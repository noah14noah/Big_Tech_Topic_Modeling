What he said was cautious and rather bland, but the imagery was potent: a young Big Brother issuing a tailored message to those who administer the laws of many lands. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>did not take questions - a Facebook executive in the chamber did, after <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>faded from the screens into the green and sunny background of his distant locale.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An actual dialogue with the controller of Facebookmight have been illuminating. For example, does Facebookanticipate, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/opinion/internet-google-china-balkanization.html\">as others speculate</url>, that the internet will split into two, or three - the US internet, the China internet and the EU internet?</p><p>Unlike generalist legislators, data protection and privacy commissioners are among the public's best equipped representatives for a meaningful public discussion with <person><nameText>Zuckerberg. </nameText></person>He is among a tiny group of decision-makers who are shaping a world in which human and artificial intelligence combine to collect and use the personal information of billions of people. In their modest specialism, the commissioners are like barometers of the weather ahead for our digital age.</p><p>The absence of a framing for the internet economy has already led to a widespread culture of disregard of the law</p><p>  Paul Nemitz    </p><p>For a sense of Facebook's possible future EU operating environment, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>should read the Royal Society's new publication about the ethical and legal challenges of governing artificial intelligence. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/opinion/internet-google-china-balkanization.html\">One contribution</url> is by a senior European commission official, Paul Nemitz, principal adviser, one of the architects of the EU's far-reaching General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May this year.</p><p>Nemitz makes clear the views are his own and not necessarily those of the European commission, but the big tech companies might reasonably see his article, entitled \"Constitutional democracy and technology in the age of artificial intelligence\", as a declaration of intent.</p><p>\"We need a new culture of technology and business development for the age of AI which we call 'rule of law, democracy and human rights by design',\" Nemitz writes. These core ideas should be baked into AI, because we are entering \"a world in which technologies like AI become all pervasive and are actually incorporating and executing the rules according to which we live in large part\".</p><p>To Nemitz, \"the absence of such framing for the internet economy has already led to a widespread culture of disregard of the law and put democracy in danger, the FacebookCambridge Analytica scandal being only the latest wake-up call\".</p><p>Nemitz identifies four bases of digital power which create and then reinforce its unhealthy concentration in too few hands: lots of money, which means influence; control of \"infrastructures of public discourse\"; collection of personal data and profiling of people; and domination of investment in AI, most of it a \"black box\" not open to public scrutiny.</p><p>The key question is which of the challenges of AI \"can be safely and with good conscience left to ethics\" and which need law. Nemitz sees much that needs law.</p><p>In an argument both biting and sophisticated, Nemitz sketches a regulatory framework for AI that will seem to some like the GDPR on steroids.</p><p>Among several large claims, Nemitz argues that \"not regulating these all pervasive and often decisive technologies by law would effectively amount to the end of democracy. Democracy cannot abdicate, and in particular not in times when it is under pressure from populists and dictatorships.\"</p><p>Overall, his case is tied to well established legal principles. For instance: AI that makes decisions that affect individuals should give intelligible reasons; when a machine engages a human in political discourse, the machine should be required by law to disclose that it is a machine; AI that applies rules must conform to the same tests that are used to decide whether laws themselves are legitimate, such as consistency with fundamental rights, due process and proportionality.</p><p>To Nemitz, these are ways AI can earn the trust needed for broad acceptance in society.</p><p>An important debate is happening. It is essential that the big tech companies engage in meaningful dialogue, and cease giving the impression that they see interactions with public policymakers mainly within a public relations framework. Some progress has been made over the past year, but more is required, and faster. We are all in this transformative era together.</p><p>Paul Chadwick is the Guardian readers' editor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-48667149</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKN-3281-F021-6499-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><timeReceived>8:58 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Indeed, many Americans were generally unaware that such threats exist, even though these threats could potentially be more destructive to the country than Sept. 11, 2001, or Pearl Harbor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, U.S. social media - indeed, worldwide social media - remained open to manipulation by malign agents of disinformation. We are still defended by only the thinnest of lines at the Pentagon and within the law enforcement and intelligence communities.</p><p>Last week, our tech titans were a largely unregulated group. If not exactly indifferent to the growing consensus that these members of \"Big Tech\" are achieving dangerous concentrations of power and wealth, then at best the companies moved at a snail's pace to convince the public of their good and fair intentions and thus cut off ham-handed and outdated regulation.</p><p>Then, on Monday, reports confirmed that the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and the House Judiciary Committee were launching almost simultaneous offensives against everything represented by the term \"FAANG\" - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. (Disclosure: I own only Amazon stock, and The Post is owned by Amazon's founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos. My views on this issue long predate either purchase.)</p><p>Neither investors nor consumers should be amused. There isn't any indication that any of the would-be regulators have the background to assess the new issues set or, crucially, even care much about the national security implications of either our collective defenses or lack of export controls on our technologies.</p><p>No notice. No public discussion. Just a bum's rush to regulate. Slow down.</p><p>I've argued for a new regulatory regime for Big Tech for years: to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House GOP leaders, to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and national security adviser John Bolton, and to many others in both houses of Congress. About the only thing Hillary Clinton and I agreed on in our long on-air conversation following the publication of her campaign memoir was the need for everyone to read a different book (\"World Without Mind,\" by Franklin Foer) on the dangers of the new age of artificial intelligence. I don't need to be convinced that there are risks as enormous as an unregulated Manhattan Project out there in the wilds of Big Tech.</p><p>But count me very skeptical that these risks are best addressed and remedied by FTC regulators and lawyers using statutory authorities only remotely connected to the massive problem, or by Justice Department litigators wielding theories of antitrust law that were previously not widely aired, much less debated. There's little danger posed by the newly announced congressional hearings - perhaps even some good. But the suddenness of the collective lurch against Big Tech served most to illuminate how little has been done before to ask what these new technologies are doing to us and how they're exposing us to Big Tech.</p><p>What is needed, believe it or not, is a select commission. Yes, really: It's the hoariest of old Beltway ruses for doing nothing, but this time it could do immense good. Attorney General William P. Barr is the right official who ought to impanel a select commission of, say, 15 or so, including the principals or general counsels of three or four of the biggest tech titans, a similar number of the country's best legal minds, senior military thinkers and a dash of academic genius and public intellectuals. Give them six months to a year to provide a comprehensive assessment of risks and regulatory approaches.</p><p>Barr knows that the government rushing in without a plan is in fact a plan for massive and potentially disastrous unintended consequences. It may indeed be that Justice's antitrust division is from where the fashioning of new rules must proceed, or the export control experts at Treasury, or perhaps a new regulatory structure recommended to and enacted by Congress. But this sudden spilling onto the floor of a boiling pot of unknown ingredients and enforcement actions is terrible policy.</p><p>Some thinking first, please. It is a problem of immeasurable consequence. Prudence, not politics, is required.</p><p>             Read more:          </p><p>             Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein: Here's what will decide whether technology becomes a force for good, or evil          </p><p>             Jim Hoagland: The tech economy is hard to explain.

Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg, the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, each sat on a web call this week to face an antitrust panel in Congress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The already less-than-ideal format, in which politicians often grandstand more than ask probing questions, was only made more strange by the COVID-induced situation of having everyone phone in to the panel. The whole thing would have felt a bit sci-fi if the stakes weren't so very real.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Because the fact that these four men, who collectively run companies worth about $5 trillion and reach around half the world's population, were hauled in front of a congressional panel at all signifies the deep worry about tech's growing power. And while this specific hearing was to focus on questions of competition and antitrust, inevitably the panel strayed into issues of speech, censorship and influence.</p><p>Yet, watching the whole affair, it was hard not to get the sense that governments are working with a set of outdated rules. For one, a group of U.S. politicians could only ever defer to the idea of fostering competition. But what the hearings may have inadvertently revealed is that what separates Big Tech from other kinds of companies is that they are platforms - historically unique entities that need their own set of rules.</p><p>Despite the strangeness, there was some real tension. Under the glare were a series of troubling patterns from the companies. Amazon's Bezos came under fire for his company's practice of being a platform for smaller third-party sellers to hawk wares but also using the data from those sales to compete with them. Similarly, Rep. Pramila Jayapal brought receipts of early emails when Facebook was considering acquiring Instagram, showing that Facebook essentially threatened the then much smaller photo-sharing app.</p><p>It was indicative of just how much Big Tech has gotten away with as we were lost in its haze over the past decade or so. But Jayapal, who represents part of Seattle, also took the time to thank Bezos for his contributions to the city and suggested that all she wanted was more Amazons, rather than one behemoth. It pointed to the bind we are in: Worried about tech companies, but also beholden to them and how essential they have become to both our lives and the economy at large.</p><p>Can you actually have more than one Amazon, though? The trouble is, large technology companies don't just offer a service or product to consumers in the way that Ford or Sony might. Rather, they offer a platform - that is, a thing on which other services and businesses are built. Facebook is not just a way to connect with friends, it is also full of neighbourhood groups, buy and sell clubs, news, videos, messaging, digital payments and more. Something similar might be said of all big tech companies. Apple has its app store, from which it takes a 30 per cent cut of sales, and is why you cannot buy a book from Amazon or Kobo from your iPad (those companies refuse to let Apple take a cut). They aren't merely companies as much as a kind of infrastructure for both themselves and other companies.</p><p>Making matters more complicated is that platform companies only really work when they have scale. What would be the point of joining Facebook or setting up a business on Amazon if there weren't hundreds of millions of people also on those sites? It's a phenomenon called network effects: The value of a platform to someone goes up the more people are on it. The trouble is obviously that such scale helps to prevent competition. If a network is only good when it has hundreds of millions of people on it, how can you set up a competing one?</p><p>That's why these companies can't be reined in using traditional rules about antitrust, or even rules for traditional media or utilities. They are new and, as such, need to be treated with new rules. Even breaking up companies wouldn't have the desired effect.</p><p>The closest analogy we have to platform companies are utility companies. Organizations that, in places like Canada, are tightly regulated in no small part because they form the backbone for so many other things.</p><p>That is how platform companies like Facebook or Google should be regulated: as if they are infrastructure, because that's what they are. But, because of network effects, we will need new rules: Limitations on what platform companies can do in regards to competition, their users' data, and the availability of that data to potential competitors and governments, too. Yes it will be awkward and it will be hard. But we can't tackle one of the biggest problems of this century if we are stuck using tools from the last.</p><p>Navneet Alang is a Toronto-based freelance contributing technology columnist for the Star.

In a chapter called \"How Aristocracy Could Issue from Industry\" he observed that industrial capitalism would create economic inequality between owners and wage-workers and divide them culturally, morally, and socially.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the rise of industrial capital, Tocqueville feared there would be no genuine relationships between these two emergent classes. \"If ever a permanent inequality of conditions and aristocracy are introduced anew into the world, one can predict they will enter through this door.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Almost 200 years later, Tocqueville's fears seem prescient. We live in a second Gilded Age - an era of extreme economic inequality and monopoly power. Wages for workers have been largely stagnant for a generation, while CEO pay has skyrocketed. A small number of firms now dominate many sectors of the economy. And the consequence for democracy is dire: <url normalizedValue=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9836.html\">study</url> after       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9836.html\">study</url> in political science shows that government is responsive to the preferences of the wealthy and their interest groups, but not to ordinary people. This creates a vicious cycle in which the wealthy and corporations can rig the political rules to benefit themselves. And the rigged system only makes them wealthier and more powerful. The danger of \"a permanent inequality of conditions and aristocracy\" is upon us.</p><p>Can democracy survive what capitalism has unleashed? It will depend on what policymakers do and especially what the people - organized on the streets and at the ballot box - force them to do.</p><p>At this critical moment, with the age of neoliberal capitalism coming to an end, I am optimistic we can choose wisely and rescue democracy. I have hope because many of the problems of capitalism are not entirely new and because the playbook for taming industrial capitalism already exists. More than a century ago, when industrial capitalism was on the rise, reformers and intellectuals outlined - and adopted - a variety of structures to keep the feral beast within a democratic enclosure.</p><p>These reformers recognized that concentrated economic power - in any form - was a threat to freedom and democracy. Concentrated economic power not only allowed for localized oppression, especially of workers in their daily lives, it also made it more likely that big corporations and wealthy people wouldn't be subject to the rule of law or democratic controls. Reformers' answer to the concentration of economic power was threefold: break up economic power, rein it in through regulation, and tax it.</p><p>It was the reformers of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era who invented America's antitrust laws - from the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 to the Clayton Act and Federal Trade Commission Acts of the early 20th century. Whether it was Republican trustbuster Teddy Roosevelt or liberal supreme court justice Louis Brandeis, courageous leaders in this era understood that when companies grow too powerful they threatened not just the economy but democratic government as well. Break-ups were a way to prevent the agglomeration of economic power in the first place, and promote an economic democracy, not just a political democracy.</p><p>In other sectors, however, monopoly seemed almost necessary. It made more sense to have a single telephone network in America, given the high costs of building the network and the importance of having everyone on it. So here, reformers of the Progressive Era championed public utilities regulation. Democratic control would be preserved through legal restrictions - regulation of rates, universal service obligations, and non-discrimination rules. Public utilities regulation was a way to ensure that the basic infrastructure of industrial capitalism remained under democratic control, rather than being able to control democracy. This basic infrastructure also ensured that economic democracy could flourish; small businesses and individuals thrive when they have access to the preconditions of modern life at fair terms and for a fair price.</p><p>Outside of utilities, regulations prohibited unsafe and unhealthy practices - food and drug laws, child labor laws, workplace safety laws. Reformers pushed for the internal regulation of corporations, calling for the expansion of cooperative ownership and the creation of \"industrial democracy,\" and the country ultimately settled on labor union collective bargaining to both empower workers and rein in managers. It was regulation that defanged the most dangerous parts of capitalism.</p><p>Reformers of this era also understood that individuals and corporations who accumulated enormous amounts of wealth gained political power too, and so could become less accountable in the economy, in the political realm, and in the courts of law. So they passed corporate taxes and income taxes. And when the Supreme Court struck down the federal income tax, Progressive-Era reformers got organized - and passed a constitutional amendment reversing the Court's decision.</p><p>In addition to guarding against the accumulation of economic power, Progressive Era reformers sought to prevent it being converted into political power. To prevent economic power from infecting politics, they passed the first federal campaign finance laws. But they also adopted structural reforms to make the political process itself more democratic. Perhaps the best example is the passage of a constitutional amendment for the direct election of senators. This fundamental change to the constitutional structure ended the era of sometimes corrupt state legislatures sending corporate bosses and their cronies to Washington.</p><p>Theodore Roosevelt once wrote that \"there can be no real political democracy without something approaching an economic democracy.\" The truth is that the two work hand in hand. Political democracy helps foster economic democracy as the people work to make the country more egalitarian. And a more economically equal society feeds into political democracy, as no one accumulates so much power that they can dominate government or their fellow citizens.</p><p>Antitrust, regulation, tax, democracy reforms - these were rules that made industrial capitalism work, and kept it from destroying democracy. Even though it's been gathering dust for decades, this Gilded Age and Progressive Era playbook is the essential starting point for reform today. We must reinvigorate antitrust laws and create a more competitive economy. This means breaking up big tech, big pharma, big banks - and restructuring and empowering the antitrust agencies so they are empowered to act with courage and vigor.</p><p>We must revive public utilities regulation and think seriously about the necessary infrastructure of modern society - from a public option for broadband internet to basic bank accounts for everyone. We need to create a more just and equitable tax system - including treating all income the same, adopting a wealth tax, and reviving estate and inheritance taxes. This will, as Thomas Jefferson once said of his own economic reforms, lay \"the axe to the root of pseudoaristocracy.\" And to accomplish these reforms - and others - we will need to start by passing new laws that prevent the corruption of our political process: campaign finance laws, anti-corruption laws, revolving door laws, lobbying laws, and pro-democracy reforms that will empower the people, not just the powerful.</p><p>None of these reforms will be easy. Some intellectuals and political figures will fight them with claims of efficiency and economic growth. Many others who personally benefit from the status quo will fight to halt, slow, or water down reforms. As Frederick Douglass once observed: \"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.\"</p><p>But even with a revival of these strategies, even with the political movement to back it up, even with courageous leaders at the helm to implement these policies, the roadmap for reforming industrial capitalism will still be insufficient to rescue democracy today. New approaches will also be needed.</p><p>A central lesson of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era reformers is not what they did to reform the system. It is that they had the courage and creativity to think for themselves and pursue bold reforms, persistently, over decades.</p><p>A new generation will have to adapt the old playbook to new challenges. Industrial capitalism's basic structure is changing. As Shoshona Zuboff has argued in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, the rise of surveillance technology and behavioral targeting risks an economic revolution that turns consumers into commodities and a political revolution that could morph democracy into digital authoritarianism. To paraphrase Tocqueville, if a permanent inequality of conditions or a nationalist oligarchy come to define the next generation, they could very well enter through these doors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-55648831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXT-V321-JCJY-G496-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1476\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

I suggest they cast their books aside for 30 minutes to study one short piece urgently: Jeff Bezos's opening statement to the US congressional hearing on Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Amazon boss's remarks were an unfashionable ode to consumer-led capitalism. Customers, he said, \"are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy.\" It is that pressure that animates businesses to improve services, add features, invent products, lower prices and speed up shipping. \"Perceptive and smart\", the customers' trust is hard won and easily lost, Bezos argued - their loyalty only guaranteed through good service, until someone else produces something better.</p><p>Conservatives used to understand this economic truth - that the best economic regulator is consumer power. After the Thatcher revolution, Tories believed that customers' revealed purchasing preferences represented what was best for them given the circumstances faced. They thought the best \"consumer protection\" policy was to facilitate more buying options at varying prices, through free trade and lightly regulated product markets.</p><p>A raft of recent activity, however, suggests that plenty of modern Tories have junked or forgotten this outlook. Not only do they appear to think politicians know better than us what we really want, but their arguments imply we simply cannot be trusted to judge any trade-offs between quality and price, despite this age of extensive, readily available information.</p><p>Behind the embrace of \"industrial policy\" and \"regional rebalancing\" lies an assumption that a consumer-led economy brings inadequate outcomes. Perhaps the clearest example of government attempts to buck consumer-led trends is the constant battle to \"revive the high street\".</p><p>A member of Boris Johnson's inner circle said after the general election: \"If Darlington high street isn't visibly better in four years' time, we'll be in trouble.\" Nowhere in that sentiment existed the possibility that consumers might just prefer the convenience of home delivery and online shopping, making trends away from high streets indicative of progress. After yet more customers flocked to online suppliers through lockdown, the policy implications of rejecting consumer sovereignty became clearer. Money was already being pumped into high streets through the Towns Fund. Now ministers are contemplating an online sales tax or delivery charge to \"level the playing field\" between online and bricks-and-mortar sellers.</p><p>Whatever ministers claim, an online business choosing to forgo expensive inner-city properties and the higher business rates they bring is not some unfair advantage. If politicians really thought the tax system was tilting the deck against the high street, they could revise business rates. The truth is, this policy to hurt online sellers is being contemplated because politicians think they know better than us what retail should look like. However much we value online delivery, they are convinced we want or need the return of bustling Fifties-style town centres.</p><p>Though it might seem pro-consumer - given it subsidises consumption - a similar sentiment underpins the recent \"Eat Out To Help Out\" <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.initiative.No\">www.initiative.No</url> doubt we will see a big spike in restaurant footfall on Mondays to Wednesday as a result. Customers are not known to look the gift horse of free money in the mouth. But at its core, the policy says that customers alone can't be trusted to make decisions about their social spending habits. In the name of preserving the March 2020 economy, the Government is now actively subsidising indoor dining during a respiratory viral pandemic. Where once Conservatives thought consumers' choices were synonymous with what was best for them, now Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, sees his role to nudge our consumption to fit the Government's pre-conceived ideas of which industries should survive.</p><p>It is on trade policy, however, where this consumer-nudging Toryism could be most consequential. Those who recognise that liberalising markets enables consumers to better show what practices, quality and products they want are under relentless assault from Tories representing protectionist interests and inherent snobbishness.</p><p>In a recent article, Conservative MP Danny Kruger claimed a free-trading agenda post-Brexit risked \"a two-tier market in the UK: lovely sustainably farmed British food for the rich, and cheap foreign muck for the masses\". Aside from the incredible parochialism of this sentiment, note the implication: free trade in food was undesirable in part because consumers might make ghastly decisions about what to buy.</p><p>Behind much opposition to free consumer choice lays this view that the proles might purchase things of qualities our betters disapprove of. Kruger masks this with arguments for why agriculture is different, in the same way his Tory communitarian friends say high streets are different, or the modern industrial strategists say manufacturing is different.</p><p>Yet strip away all the filler about things markets cannot provide or the need for better consumer information, none of which requires protectionism, and you see the simple desire to \"stop our farmers being too badly undercut by inferior cheap imports\".</p><p>Not only would Kruger ban chlorinated chicken from the US, the b\u00eate noire of upper-middle class lore, but he would use tariffs to \"drive up the prices of imports on food made with practices we don't use here\". In other words, he rejects the idea consumers are best placed to decide what to eat.</p><p>There have always been tensions within the Conservative Party about free trade and the degree to which consumers need regulatory protection from rogue sellers. But what we are seeing here is something deeper. Conservatives increasingly reject the idea of the sovereign consumer shaping economic life. Whether it be subsidies, taxes, regulations, or tariffs, more and more Tories reject our free choices in favour of them deciding for us, or nudging us in their preferred direction.</p><p>Ryan Bourne holds the R Evan Scharf chair for the public understanding of economics at the Cato Institute Economic Intelligence For unique insight into the world's economic issues, sign up to our Economic Intelligence newsletter, by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard and Jeremy Warner <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk\">www.telegraph.co.uk</url>/ ei-newsletter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Shoppers in London's Oxford Street.

Part of the 'Breakout Startups' session on Tuesday morning, Torii was featured alongside additional exciting tech ventures handpicked by leading investors. Other SaaS companies that appeared included collaboration platform Hugo [2]and voice app design platform Voiceflow[3].With Collision being one of North America's top technology conferences, the segment comes as a welcome development for the SaaS space as it affirms that investors are warming up to SaaS once again.Torii offers a management solution that makes SaaS use more visible to administrators by automatically discovering SaaS applications being used within a company's network. </p><p>The platform also allows It managers to oversee access to applications through onboarding and offboarding features.The round was led by Silicon Valley venture fund Uncork Capital and also involved Global Founders Capital and Entre Capital. The fresh capital raised is set to bolster Torii's efforts to integrate better mechanisms for workflow automation. The company also looks to allocate more funding to its US-based commercial activities.Renewed Interest in SaaSInvestments in SaaS have been bearish since 2016[4], but this outlook seems to have flipped. Just this April alone, around $200 million[5] had been invested in SaaS startups[6].We've also seen some significant acquisitions of SaaS companies in the IT space so far this year. Disaster recovery service CloudEndure [7]was acquired by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN[8])for $200 million. Apptio [9]also recently announced its acquisition of Cloudability[10], its third purchase in just two years.Torii's successful seed round only affirms the trend. The participation of a top funds like Uncork Capital, which is among the most respected VC shops in Silicon Valley, underscores that opportunities are truly present in the space.'We chose to invest in Torii because we loved the team, the product, the early traction, and the market,' said Andy McLoughlin of Uncork Capital, whose firm's portfolio includes big tech company names like SendGrid, About.me, Bitly, Fitbit, Eventbrite and Mint. 'The three founders are experienced tech innovators - they bring valuable experience working in high growth businesses, coupled with developing consumer products.'SaaS Continues to See Booming AdoptionAccording to Gartner, public cloud adoption is expected to continue its upward trajectory. By 2022, the total market for public cloud services is set to hit $331.2 billion[11] worldwide. SaaS is expected to account for over 43 percent of the market, contributing $143.7 billion in revenue.Consumers and line-of-business users are also shifting many of their daily activities to online and mobile, prompting businesses to aggressively digitize their processes. This widespread digital transformation of businesses is greatly contributing to cloud and SaaS growth. By 2020, 41 percent [12]of workloads are set to run on public cloud platforms.SaaS applications are distributed as browser-based app experiences, which has made technology once only accessible to enterprises more accessible to smaller operations and individual users.Departments can now fit software acquisition to be part of their own operating expenses. This has also shortened the time across decision, purchasing, and implementation. As such, IT decision makers are now likely to prefer SaaS solutions over conventional licensed software. Addressing Demand for Better ManagementRising SaaS adoption, however, has created new challenges for organizations to overcome. It has caused 'shadow IT' - the use of devices and applications that are undisclosed to the IT department - to grow unchecked within organizations.Shadow IT can introduce various risks for companies, top among which are cybersecurity threats. The use of poorly secured applications exposes them to possible hacks and data breaches. Should their data be stolen through these unsecure third parties, not only are they looking at the cost of data loss, but they can also face fines and penalties for non-compliance with privacy regulations.Shadow IT can also result in unnecessary spending from redundant subscriptions. Poor integration mechanisms across these applications can also result in data silos which can degrade data integrity and disrupt workflows.IT teams need to stay on top of all applications and subscriptions running within their respective organizations. These concerns only contribute to the growing demand for effective management tools specifically designed for SaaS, which represents a major opportunity for providers to offer solutions that address these issues.'Companies can no longer afford to grant third-party tools access to their databases without knowing for sure that sensitive information won't be vulnerable to interception or sold to the highest bidder,' Torii CEO Haramati said. 'As part of their security mandates, IT leaders need to make sure that all software products in use at their companies are mapped, tracked and vetted.'Investors and startups would do well recognizing that offering services that are integral and supportive of SaaS adoption appear to be a solid premise for success.

What's his plan to solve the national nightmare?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And plain truth. The FAA accused of getting too familiar with the airlines, putting them over your safety. The agency's top guy answers live on this AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome back. Thanks for joining us on this Friday the 4th of April. Kiran is off today. I'm John Roberts along with my pals Alina Cho and Ali Velshi. What do you got on your plate this hour?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALI VELSHI, CNN SENIOR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, we got a couple of things. One is commodity prices are up again, and that's going to affect the amount that all of you pay for the food that you buy. And secondly, in about an hour and a half, we're going to get the big jobs report for March. We're expecting that we're going to have lost more jobs in the United States. And for those of you who are sitting on the fence about whether we're getting into a recession or not, this might make your decision for you.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right. Looking forward to your views on that. What's new on your plate?</p><p>ALINA CHO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A surprising new study about online scams and who is scammed more, men or women? You take a guess. We'll tell you in a couple of minutes.</p><p>And the other story that's really interesting this morning, a Lincoln manuscript sells for a record price at auction. We're going to tell you more about that.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right. Looking forward to that.</p><p>Breaking news overnight to tell you about. As severe storms leave behind a trail of fire in central Arkansas, witnesses say a tornado touchdown near the capital of Little Rock. Take a look.</p><p>The cloud caught on dashcam sending sparks flying. It sparked an inferno in a mobile home community. The sparks that you see there are probably, according to a Saline County spokesperson, electrical transformers going up there as the lines touched and a short circuit occurred. A lot of homes were damaged there. Many people went running for shelter as winds tore roofs off of homes and trees out of the ground.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've seen this man's house, the roof is totally gone off his house. It's flattened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Even National Weather Service forecasters got into a bunker as the storm roared by. Our Rob Marciano is standing by with extreme weather on the move right now. Because this storm system didn't just dissipate as it went through Little Rock, it's on to more places.</p><p>Rob, where is it headed?</p><p>ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Well, we've got a number of severe thunderstorm watches that are in effect this morning stretching from Texas all the way into parts of Tennessee. Let's take you to four of them to be exact with all of them going into effect until 10:00, 11:00 Local time this morning.</p><p>We zoom into one particular shot that has me a little bit worried just north of Austin. This is a severe thunderstorm with a severe thunderstorm warning attached to it. It is heading to the east at 45 miles an hour, and folks in central Williamson County, Texas, are under the gun with this particular cell just north of Austin on Highway 35.</p><p>Everything is staying for the most part south of Dallas. But if you do live south of Dallas you're getting hit with some heavy thunderstorms. And also, south of Little Rock that's good news, but we do have flooding concerns for most of the state of Arkansas at the moment.</p><p>Nashville just got hammered with some storms. This line looking pretty rough heading toward Murphysboro (ph) and down the I-40 corridor, heading eastward at a pretty rapid pace. As mentioned, we've got a wide swath of action here, all of which is heading over an area that has seen a tremendous amount of rainfall over the last three weeks. So flash flood watches and warnings are posted as far east as western Tennessee and as far south as the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>A widely encompassing storm, and it does stretch all the way to the northeast, and you folks will be seeing some rainfall there today as well. John, back up to you.</p><p>ROBERTS: Rob, how far does the potential for tornadoes extend this morning?</p><p>MARCIANO: Well, right now, there are no tornado watches out. That doesn't mean that a tornado can't drop out of one of these severe thunderstorms. That's why we're watching that particular storm just north of Austin. But at the moment, we don't expect as much severe weather today as what we saw last night. We certainly hope that holds true.</p><p>ROBERTS: That's a good thing, but still plenty of airport disruptions, I'm sure, because there are thunderstorms moving into a lot of heavily populated areas.</p><p>Rob Marciano for us this morning. Rob, thanks. We'll check back with you soon.</p><p>For the most politics in the morning now, and the race to raise cash. The Democratic campaigns released fund-raising numbers for the month of March. Barack Obama raised more than $40 million last month, twice what Hillary Clinton took in during the same period. So far this year, Obama has raised a total of $131 million compared to Hillary Clinton's nearly $70 million.</p><p>And a sign that Hillary Clinton's superdelegate support could slip if she doesn't start putting up the numbers. Two of Clinton's supporters, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine and Congressman Jack Murtha of Pennsylvania, are both saying that she has to beat Barack Obama in the popular vote to have any chance at winning the party's nomination. And Murtha comes from that all-important prize on April 22nd, as we said, Pennsylvania.</p><p>A call for a nationwide discussion on race this morning from the parent denomination of Barack Obama's church in Chicago. Leaders with the United Church of Christ are asking their 10,000 pastors to conduct what's being called a sacred conversation next month. It follows the outrage generated by comments from Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the former pastor of Trinity Church.</p><p>The president of the United Church of Christ, Reverend John Thomas, spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REV. JOHN THOMAS, PRESIDENT, UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST: I think we saw a caricature and a stereotype not only of Reverend Wright but the black church. And as a result, the conversation on race has not been sacred but profoundly ugly and unhelpful. And that's why on this anniversary of Dr. King's famous speech before his assassination, we're calling for a sacred conversation on race that we think can achieve and move us toward his challenge to make America a better place.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: How do you see that conversation unfolding? I mean, you're calling for a conversation in churches on a given day. What do you want people to talk about? What is the conversation?</p><p>THOMAS: Part of the reason that this conversation is so difficult is that we often are unwilling to be deeply honest with one another, that we view one another simply through a lens of caricature or stereotype. So we're calling for a conversation where people in a context of trust and respect begin to be more honest with one another, to share their fears, their hopes, their anxieties, their anger. This is not going to be an easy conversation. Sacred conversations can be profoundly difficult, and sometimes they can be loud, but they're important for us, and we know that it's only a beginning on May 18th. That's the opening part of the conversation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Obama's church has received threats since Wright's comments came to light. It is the country's largest United Church of Christ congregation.</p><p>Hillary Clinton and <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>will both be in Memphis today for ceremonies honoring the 40th anniversary of the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. But last night, Hillary Clinton showed off her lighter side during an appearance on \"The Tonight Show.\"</p><p>Clinton walked out with Leno's band playing the theme song from \"Rocky\" jumping off of her comments earlier in the week where she compared herself to the fictional fighter. Clinton, then, went on to make fun of her recent comments about her 1996 trip to Bosnia as First Lady.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is so great to be here. You know, I was worried I wasn't going to make it.</p><p>JAY LENO, HOST, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO\": Oh.</p><p>CLINTON: Yes, I was pinned down by sniper fire.</p><p>LENO: Really?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Clinton and Leno also had some fun with her \"It's 3:00 a.m.\" campaign commercials. Leno said it's got to be tough handling all those middle of the night emergencies.</p><p>Seven minutes after the hour. Alina Cho here now with other stories new this morning. She can make fun of that.</p><p>CHO: Yes, she can. The lighting is great on Jay Leno, by the way. It set the mood very well. All right.</p><p>New this morning. Good morning, everybody.</p><p>A Virginia Tech-style plot police say they discovered online, and they say it led them to a 20-year-old with a stash of automatic rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Police in Homestead, Florida, say Calin Chi Wong was threatening to stage an attack similar to the one at Virginia Tech nearly a year ago that killed 32 students.</p><p>Police say Wong had more weapons than most local SWAT teams, including four AK-47s and body piercing ammunition. Wong has been charged with making written threats to kill. He was released on bond. Well, runways are back open at Kennedy International Airport in New York this morning. The landing gear of a small plane collapsed last night, and that plane skidded off the runway and into the grass. The airport closed down all but one runway last night leading to some delays, of course. One person was slightly hurt.</p><p>Explosive testimony about safety in the skies and about the agency that's supposed to ensure it. The founder of Southwest Airlines testified before a Congressional committee that Southwest made a mistake when it allowed planes to fly that should have been grounded. Lawmakers also heard from two FAA safety inspectors. One of them says he tried to raise a flag about missed safety checks, but managers at the FAA blocked him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOBBY BOUTRIS, FAA INSPECTOR: My experience, I believe, the priority of the regional office is damage control, and I see no interest in accountability or doing the right thing. At the end of the investigation, no matter what evidence shows, it's disregarded by the division management team who cherry picked the information from the investigation reports. And while looking at the big picture, they apply band aids instead of fixing the root of the problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHO: Lawmakers now plan to call the FAA in on a regular basis to see what kind of progress it's making to improve its inspection program. And stay tuned because coming up at 7:30, in less than a half hour, we're going to talk to the acting FAA administrator about just how safe the skies are.</p><p>We have a consumer alert to tell you about. A government report says Americans are being ripped off in record numbers by online scams. Records from the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center show that Internet crimes topped $240 million last year. That's actually up $40 million from two years ago.</p><p>The Feds say many of the crime cases involve pet scams, online dating fraud, and scammers trying to profit from natural disasters like that I-35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis last year. The report also found that men were more likely to be scammed than women.</p><p>Forty years ago today, civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. You're looking live there at the King Center in Atlanta and the reflecting pool, as we widen out that shot. Several events are planned today including visits by presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and <person><nameText>John McCain.</nameText></person></p><p>King was shot on a Memphis balcony back in 1968. His death tore a hole in the hearts of several civil rights leaders and Americans really. Four decades later, King's work continues. Yesterday, lawmakers honored his legacy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER: Dr. King possessed a voice of hope so powerful that it shook and shattered walls of oppression and lifted the spirits of the downtrodden and the denied.</p><p>SEN. HARRY REID (D), MAJORITY LEADER: Our responsibility is to continue his dream with courage, with hard work, so that we can, as he said, make our old world a new world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHO: And a programming note, join CNN this afternoon for all the King commemorations live from Memphis. We're also tuning in with radio show hosts around the country for what we're calling \"Conversations With Black America.\" Catch it live on CNN at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time or logon to CNN.com/live.</p><p>And finally, a letter written by Abraham Lincoln has set a record at auction. It happened at Sotheby's. President Lincoln wrote it in response to the \"Little People's Petition\" in 1864. School kids were asking the then-president to free slave children, and Lincoln actually wrote back.</p><p>He said, \"While I have not the power to grant all they ask, I trust they will remember that God has.\" The letter, by the way, sold for $3.4 million at Sotheby's to a private American collector who was bidding by phone. So interesting.</p><p>ROBERTS: Let me just come back to this guy in Homestead, this guy, Wong, who had been making threats to stage another Virginia Tech- style massacre. Had an arsenal that you described as being more than SWAT teams.</p><p>CHO: More than the local SWAT teams.</p><p>ROBERTS: And armor-piercing rounds, which are illegal in the state of Florida, and he bonded out for $7,500?</p><p>CHO: It's a big question why. It's a big question why. Of course, with Virginia Tech, there were some mental problems that were revealed. Not sure what's coming out yet about that, but we're still watching the details. It is very interesting that he was released on bond.</p><p>ROBERTS: I think this is a story we need to dig a little deeper on. Alina Cho for us this morning. Alina, thanks.</p><p>CHO: You bet.</p><p>ROBERTS: Twelve minutes after the hour. One of the hottest states in the mortgage meltdown is Arizona. It's the home base of <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>where even million dollars homes are going under. We've got a closer look at the candidate's plans to fix the housing crisis coming up.</p><p>How to help your doctor help you. Advice to get the most out of your next trip to the doctor's office. That's ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBERTS: Fifteen minutes after the hour. More signs of a troubled economy to tell you about. This time the tech industry is in the spotlight, and our Veronica De La Cruz joins us now. What companies are we talking about?</p><p>VERONICA DE LA CRUZ, CNN INTERNET CORRESPONDENT: Oh, wow. You know, some big name companies, John. Dell, Microsoft, Google all looking to cut costs by downsizing. Again, Dell CEO, they're saying the company will cut more than 8,800 jobs previously announced to stay more competitive.</p><p>Moving on to Motorola, 2,600 employees around the globe. The company has been having a rough time with their cell phone entity especially with Apple's iPhone taking such a huge chunk of the high- end market. And then, getting you to Google, 300 employees there from newly acquired DoubleClick, Inc. -- 300 employees. It may not sound like a lot, but it's actually about a quarter of that company. Google bought DoubleClick in March for $3 billion plus.</p><p>You know, also in the headlines this morning, we touched a little on it already. But scammers have been using e-mail to con trusting Americans. Victims have been falling for it time and time again. This new government report out shows money lost from Internet crime hit a new high last year, nearly $240 million. The report shows scams involving pets, check cashing schemes, and online dating all are on the rise.</p><p>The report also shows that more than 75 percent of the perpetrators were male. Men were scammed out of more money than women were, on average about $200 more. And almost half of the victims were between the ages of 30 and 49 years old.</p><p>So, John, the first time this report was released was 2001. $18 million lost that year. $240 million, 2007.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROBERTS: Any idea why men are more vulnerable to being scammed than women?</p><p>DE LA CRUZ: You know, honestly, I would say that men ...</p><p>ROBERTS: Other than the history of life between men and women causes women to be more suspicious.</p><p>DE LA CRUZ: I would say that men probably use the Internet more to shop and are probably, you know, doing more when it comes to online banking. You know, I talked to a lot of my female friends who are still scared to give out their personal information online.</p><p>ROBERTS: Yes. Guys, got to get sharp. Veronica, thanks very much.</p><p>So you've been to the doctor's office and you know that there's ... whoops. Where are we here? Where do we go?</p><p>You've been to the doctor's office. You know that there's precious little time for doctor-patient interaction. So what can you do to maximize the time that you spend with your doctor and actually help your doctor take care of you?</p><p>CNN's Elizabeth Cohen at the medical update desk for us now. Elizabeth, why should a patient help the doctor take care of the patient? I thought the doctor was supposed to do all of that?</p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Right, John, it does seem a little bit backwards. But the way that it works these days is your doctor is so rushed sometimes, it really behooves you to help your doctor because you're going to be the one who benefits in the end. Help your doctor make the most out of the time that you do have together. So we have a list on CNN.com/health. Let's take a look at two of the things that you can do to help your doctor help you.</p><p>First of all, arrive at your appointment with a list of medications, so you're not sitting there thinking, saying to the doctor, I think I take a pink pill maybe once a day, maybe twice. Can't remember the name. Don't do that. Just hand him a list of medications. It's much easier.</p><p>Also, bring in your list of your top three concerns. Now, you might be thinking well, I know why I'm there. I mean, I made the appointment. You know what, when you're in that exam room in that funny little gown that opens in all sorts of weird places, you forget things.</p><p>You get sort of flustered and you're not always going to remember every point you wanted to bring up with the doctor. Have it in writing. It's a whole lot easier.</p><p>Now, if you want to see some more of our tips about how to help your doctor help you, go to CNN.com/health. You can click on it. It's the main story on our page there, and it will give you five ways to help your doctor help you -- John.</p><p>ROBERTS: Elizabeth, you know, many times people not only have one doctor, but say that they got some condition that they're seeing multiple specialists for. What do they do to get that whole team working together?</p><p>COHEN: John, what they have to do is you have to figure early on that you are the captain of the team. You are the glue that holds that team together. Unfortunately, doctors are notorious for not talking to one another.</p><p>So when you finish with one appointment with Dr. Smith, say, Dr. Smith, can you please send me a list of your notes from this appointment so when I go to see Dr. Jones next month, I can just hand them to him. You have the paper in hand because otherwise that paper may never reach your second doctor.</p><p>ROBERTS: Elizabeth Cohen for us this morning on the medical update desk in Atlanta. Elizabeth, thanks.</p><p>COHEN: Thanks.</p><p>ROBERTS: Some good tips for us this morning.</p><p>Alina's got the results of an interesting poll about the way Americans are viewing the country and the direction.</p><p>CHO: Yes.</p><p>ROBERTS: What do you got?</p><p>CHO: Yes, thanks, John. And Americans should listen up because this is important. Eight out of every 10 Americans now think the country is headed in the wrong direction. That's according to the latest \"New York Times\"/CBS poll that's asking that question. Eighty- one percent of people say we're on the wrong track. That's the most since they started taking that poll in the early 1990s.</p><p>And that brings us to this morning's \"Quick Vote\" question. What do you think is the primary reason you think the country is on the wrong track like so many people say?</p><p>Right now, 51 percent say Iraq. A slight majority. Twenty-two percent say the economy. Twenty-one percent say political gridlock. Two percent say the state of health care. Five percent say the state of education.</p><p>Cast your vote at CNN.com/am. Of course, we'll continue to tally your votes throughout the morning.</p><p>We're also looking for your thoughts online. Didn't see a choice on that \"Quick Vote\" that you like? Think something else is driving the country off track? Well, e-mail us at CNN.com/email. We're going to read some of your e-mails, and we'll have the first tally of the votes later this hour -- John.</p><p>ROBERTS: I would imagine we'll probably going to get some pretty interesting commentary on that particular question.</p><p>Well, what goes up must come down. Phoenix was once one of the hottest housing markets in the country. Now, it's a hotbed for foreclosures. How <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>is handling the housing mess in his home state. That's coming up next on AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBERTS: Twenty-three minutes after the hour. The economy is issue number one with American voters, and the housing crisis is hitting home on the campaign trail. One of the nation's hottest spots in the mortgage meltdown is Phoenix, Arizona, the home base for Senator <person><nameText>John McCain. </nameText></person>Phoenix had the 14th highest foreclosure rate in the nation in February. During that month, 2,500 homes were foreclosed.</p><p>McCain told us here in AMERICAN MORNING that he supports the Senate bill designed to offer relief.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>JOHN MCCAIN </nameText></person>(R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The first priority is to help those people, those four to six million people, who are badly in danger of losing their homes who did nothing wrong. And this package in the Senate, I think, would have a significant beneficial effect.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Ed Lavandera is in McCain's home state of Arizona. He joins us this morning with a little bit more on what McCain might do as well, Ed, to try to fix the housing crisis. Good morning to you.</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, John. We know several years ago investors started moving into Arizona, buying up property all over the place. And as you mentioned today, the state has the fourth highest foreclosure rate in the country. The real estate bubble here has burst, so it's a good place to study how presidential candidate <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>has handled the crisis in his home state.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): It seems like the entire state of Arizona is for sale. There are more than 57,000 homes on the market in the Phoenix area. One local realtor estimates only 4,000 have sold in the last month.</p><p>Foreclosure listings are growing. Home prices are dropping. Housing experts say it will take at least a year for the market to settle.</p><p>JAY BUTLER, ARIZONA REALTY EXPERT: The issue is who do you turn to? And in some instances, you want to turn to government, but it doesn't necessarily have the solutions.</p><p>LAVANDERA (on camera): In Arizona, you take the mortgage crisis and you mix it in with a weakening economy and you find homes like this one. Two years ago, public records show this house sold for $3.7 million. Today, it's listed as a foreclosure selling for $1.2 million.</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): While the mortgage meltdown pummels Arizona, you won't find this state's senior senator advocating for sweeping help from the federal government.</p><p>MCCAIN: And it's not the duty of government to bailout and reward those who act irresponsibly.</p><p>LAVANDERA: McCain's aides say the presidential candidate prefers a judicious and targeted response. In the last year, he supported stricter guidelines for loaning money and the Mortgage Forgiveness Act, which keeps homeowners facing foreclosure from paying some taxes if they can refinance their home. One Arizona political columnist says McCain has not talked much about the mortgage crisis and that's surprising.</p><p>ROBERT ROBB, COLUMNIST, \"ARIZONA REPUBLIC\": He seems to be setting up the general election very much as a contest between those who think government ought to do a lot more, and those who think that maybe government ought to step back a minute and be pretty selective and not rush to judgment.</p><p>LAVANDERA: In the meantime, another for sale sign is planted in the desert.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAVANDERA: And, of course, the Democratic presidential candidates have been taking a lot of criticism of McCain over the last week or so, after McCain explained kind of his philosophy on how to handle this crisis. If you take a closer look at the foreclosure rates in Arizona, we get one in every 264 households that have been foreclosed on right now. That's according to Realty Track. That's up 210 percent from this time last year.</p><p>Then you look at the home states of Obama and Clinton. In Illinois, one in every 587 households. That's up 32 percent from last year. And in New York, one in almost 15 households has been foreclosed on, and that's up about 15 percent from this time last year -- John.</p><p>ROBERTS: And growing pressure on lawmakers and the presidential candidates who are all facing election this November to do something about it. Ed Lavandera for us this morning, Paradise Valley, Arizona, the place to be. Ed, thanks.</p><p>You're watching the most news in the morning. Caught on tape, a cloud of fire. A tornado sends sparks flying igniting parts of central Arkansas. We'll have a live update on the rescue and cleanup effort.</p><p>And we're also tracking more extreme weather that you're going to want to know about coming up.</p><p>The cash keeps on flowing into Barack Obama's campaign coffers as he takes aim at Hillary Clinton's lead in Pennsylvania. Our John Dickerson with some campaign analysis when AMERICAN MORNING returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBERTS: It's Friday the 4th of April. Thanks very much for being with us on this AMERICAN MORNING. John Roberts along with Ali Velshi and Alina Cho. Kiran is off today.</p><p>We got some breaking news to tell you about this morning as people in Arkansas wake up to see the destruction that a tornado left behind. At least one tornado ripped through central Arkansas near the capital of Little Rock. It sparked a fire that spread to several trailer homes and police say that it injured four people and sent residents running.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everything was tore up. Doors were torn off the buildings, people's house, their roofs were taken off. I felt the wind literally almost take me off my feet. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Powerful stuff this morning. Rob Marciano standing by with more on this extreme weather which is on the move right now. Rob, this is a pretty substantial storm system.</p><p>MARCIANO: Yes, really stretching its legs here, John. And we got a number of watch boxes out. The system is felt really, there's a number of pieces of energy flowing in the upper levels of the atmosphere that is just stretching this thing out and making it a several-day and several-state long event, all the way from New England and back to central Texas.</p><p>And we have a number of watch boxes out. These yellow watch boxes are severe thunderstorm watch boxes issued by the storms predictions center, meaning that severe thunderstorms are likely within these areas. And right now, we've got four of them. Most of them in effect until 10:00 and 11:00 local time.</p><p>All right. Let's do a couple of these and talk about what kind of action we're seeing right now. We do have a severe thunderstorm watch out or warning out for eastern parts of Williams County, Texas. This is just north of Boston. This cell has been holding together for the past couple of hours and has some heavy rains and gusty winds and significant hail and it's moving quickly to the east at 30 to 40 miles an hour.</p><p>North into Dallas, we're seeing most of the action south of Dallas-Ft. Worth metropolitan area, but no doubt DFW will have some delays today. Heavier rains stretching into Arkansas. This is where we saw the tornado last night. Right now, we're just heavy rain, but that's not good news either because for the past 2 1/2, 3 weeks heavy rain has plagued that part of the state there. They're in a flash flood warning right now in effect for the next couple of hours.</p><p>Heavy thunderstorms rolling through Nashville and then moving quickly off to the east, and off towards the northeast we're seeing some rain from New York up through Bridgeport, Connecticut, and through Boston as well as the storm continues to stretch out and affect a whole swath of the eastern part of the country.</p><p>John, back up to you.</p><p>ROBERTS: Rob Marciano keeping a close eye for us this morning. Rob, appreciate it. Thanks.</p><p>MARCIANO: You got it.</p><p>ROBERTS: Now to politics and another campaign windfall for Barack Obama. The candidate raised $40 million in March, double what Hillary Clinton took in. And Obama is spending it in Pennsylvania where he is closing the gap on Clinton with the primary just two weeks and four days from now.</p><p>Our John Dickerson, CNN political analyst and chief political correspondent for slate.com joins us from Cleveland this morning. John, what do you attribute this disparity in fund-raising on the part of Barack Obama to?</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, he's been able to grab a whole bunch of people. He's just got more actual donors, and he's been tapping them time and time again. They haven't given him the big donations. That's more typical of the Clinton donor, but Obama has people who give in small increments, so he can keep going back to them each time.</p><p>ROBERTS: So he keeps going back to them again and again and again. He's got a pad of $20 million over Hillary Clinton for the month of March. Can he effectively spend that in Pennsylvania and narrow the gap. He's made some inroads there, he's not as far behind as he was but in most polls he's still behind by double digits.</p><p>DICKERSON: That's right. He's made a little bit of inroads in Pennsylvania. He spent a lot of time registering new voters, trying to get new folks to the polls. He wants to drive up his numbers in those areas where he's strong. Money will help with some of that.</p><p>He might also be using that money in the later contest, North Carolina is a place everybody is now focusing on. So in Pennsylvania all of that money may not help from today forward, but it certainly has helped when he's raised it in getting him to where he is now.</p><p>ROBERTS: Hillary Clinton, a couple of days ago the story came out that in trying to convince Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico to support her, she allegedly said to him, Obama can't win. She was asked about that comment yesterday.</p><p>Let's listen to what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: I don't talk about private conversations. I can win. I know I can win. That's why I do this every day. And that's what my campaign is about. I'm in it to win it, and I intend to do just that. It's a no.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: So she says that's a no, which people originally took to mean that's a no, I didn't say that, but her campaign came out and clarified to say, no, the no was in relation to not talking about private conversations. But even if she did say it to Bill Richardson, Obama can't win, that guy can't win, you got to vote for that, is that unusual?</p><p>DICKERSON: Well, it is a little unusual. The reason she was doing all of that fast dancing in that clip and the reason may sound a little confusing is what she doesn't want to say in public on camera is Obama can't win because if Obama does win and she is either on the ticket or campaigning for him, that's an ad that <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>can run against Obama.</p><p>You know, Hillary Clinton said he can't win, but the fact is as you point out, the Clinton campaign has been arguing for months that Obama is essentially fundamentally flawed. He can't win among certain constituencies and he can't win in these big states. Now, they don't want to say it out loud, of course, but it is the message of the campaign.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right. John Dickerson for us this morning in Cleveland. John, thanks very much.</p><p>Thirty-five minutes after the hour. Ali Velshi here now minding your business. And we did something on this last year and you had a great breakdown on it. The price of corn going up again, and just how much of everything that we consume or use involves corn?</p><p>VELSHI: Well, you know, we talk about issue number one, and we often think it has got to do with those credit crunch and housing crisis. But fundamentally as we broke it down, Americans have told us in our polling that, in fact, it is inflation that is the number one concern. And often we associate that with gasoline, but corn plays very heavily into this whole thing.</p><p>First of all, several years ago we made some decisions about how corn is going to be used to make ethanol, which is added to our gasoline. Now, a number of people think while that was meant to reduce our dependency on crude oil, what it does is it take what is fundamentally a food source and makes it into a gasoline source. That's caused corn to go up. And yesterday, we had a record on corn hitting $6 a bushel. That was a fairly big increase in the price of corn.</p><p>Now, the other thing is because we're using all of this land to buy corn, it's causing wheat, sorghum, soybeans, all those other things to become more expensive. It's also causing animal feed to become more expensive which is increasing the price of dairy and chicken and beef and things like that. And when you put all that together, there's an index that tracks commodities. Now, this includes oil but this is the Dow Jones Commodity Index over the last year.</p><p>Take a look at the leap in prices on that. That's a combination of your oil, your corn, your wheat, all of those expenses, and that means inflation to the average American which goes full circle to the fact that issue number one to most people is, in fact, the fact that they are getting less for the same dollar that they were spending last year. And this is about the kitchen table.</p><p>So you're paying to get the corn or whatever food is being farmed, the diesel used on those farms, the diesel that used to truck it there, and the energy used to store it, and then frankly you're just paying for the basic commodity.</p><p>CHO: Well, let's not forget that high fructose corn syrup used in diet soda.</p><p>VELSHI: That's right. Everything that is sweetened these days. That was in the day when corn was cheap and plentiful.</p><p>CHO: Right.</p><p>VELSHI: So, we changed that. Now, corn is not cheap nor plentiful, and that's -- this is a major issue that the administration is going to have to deal with. We have put a lot of pressure on corn. It's a food.</p><p>ROBERTS: The only bright spot in all of this is that all of these farmers, not talking about ...</p><p>VELSHI: Corn farmers.</p><p>ROBERTS: We're not talking about farming companies but we're talking about all these farmers who were growing corn and losing money.</p><p>VELSHI: Now they're making money.</p><p>ROBERTS: Finally, making some money.</p><p>VELSHI: The problem is you're making farmers who weren't making money and other things who are growing corn and that's why we're not making the same amount of wheat and soybeans and things like that.</p><p>CHO: So, it's a wash.</p><p>VELSHI: We do need to balance it out somehow. It's an issue.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right. Ali Velshi for us this morning. Ali, thanks.</p><p>New questions about how safe we all are when we fly this morning. This after two FAA inspectors say they were pressured to keep quiet about safety problems, threatened even. Coming up, we are going to talk with the acting FAA administrator and what is being done to keep you and your family safe. And how we got into this situation in the first place?</p><p>And 40 years later, the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. lives on. A look at how life has changed in Memphis, coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBERTS: Is the cozy relationship between the airlines and the FAA putting you at risk? That's what two whistle blowers told a congressional committee. During their testimony yesterday the two said they were pressured to ignore problems at Southwest Airlines.</p><p>One of the safety inspectors getting emotional as he described the threats made against him and his family if he revealed what he knew.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUGLAS PETERS, FAA INSPECTOR: He then pointed to a picture of my family and said, again, this is what's important. I'd hate to see you jeopardize yours and her career trying to take down a couple of losers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, joining me to talk more about this is the acting FAA administrator Robert Sturgell. He is live in Washington this morning. Mr. Sturgell, good to see you. And thanks for being with us today.</p><p>The treatment of these whistle blowers, Bobby Boutris and Doug Peters, by their superiors, threatened for pressuring on the issue of safety violations. What is the flying public to think about that?</p><p>ROBERT STURGELL, ACTING FAA ADMINISTRATOR: Well, good morning, John.</p><p>Listen, I'm not going to make any excuses for what went on in that office in our Southwest region. It's obvious that some legitimate concerns were being raised for a period of time and they weren't being addressed. So, we've taken some actions. The investigation continues, and I suspect we'll take additional actions down there as well.</p><p>ROBERTS: These whistle blowers said that the FAA views airlines as customers rather than companies to be regulated. Yesterday, here on AMERICAN MORNING, we took an informal, not a scientific poll, nearly 90 percent of people thought the FAA was looking out for the airlines, not looking out for passengers who fly on the airlines. I mean, you take those things together it's a rather stinging indictment of the FAA.</p><p>STURGELL: Well, make no mistake our number one customers are the flying public and the taxpayers. We don't lose sight of that. When we find things, you know, regardless of what you label it, when we find things, we fix them.</p><p>I think what people need to understand is that the system consists of a variety of oversight mechanism, not just inspections, a regulatory role, an enforcement role, but also partnership programs and voluntary disclosure programs with the carriers that are very important part of this system. They allow people to bring safety data to us and allow us to take measures proactively. Without those kinds of systems, we're going to drive safety issues underground, and that's a result the public cannot afford.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right. How did this situation get to the point that it did in that office?</p><p>STURGELL: Well, again, as I said, I'm not going to make any excuses for that office and for what went on. We are taking action, and there will be additional actions taken.</p><p>ROBERTS: Right but do you know how it got there in the first place?</p><p>STURGELL: Well, we have the testimony. We have an investigative file, and again the investigation is ongoing.</p><p>ROBERTS: Right.</p><p>STURGELL: So I suspect there will be additional actions down there.</p><p>ROBERTS: Now, Calvin Scoville, who is the inspector general for the Department of Transportation yesterday spoke out on all of this. He agreed with the two whistle blowers that there seemed to be a cozy relationship between the FAA inspectors and supervisors locally and Southwest Airlines.</p><p>He went on to suggest yesterday that we need an independent oversight organization for the FAA, which would appear to be to a lot of people to be very troubling because it's the FAA that's supposed to be the oversight organization. So what does it say about the FAA if you need oversight of the overseers?</p><p>STURGELL: Well, we've been working very closely with the inspector general throughout this process, and I think the point I would make here is that over the last couple of weeks we've also initiated our own special emphasis audit throughout the country, and that audit has produced a compliance rate that we found of about 99 percent.</p><p>So we've got some areas that we need to continue to work on, but I think overall it shows that the system is working and it's working as designed. And, you know, I can only tell people to look at the data. Look at the accident rates. See how safe the system is, and I think that's proof of the system working. Can it be better? Yes, it can be better.</p><p>ROBERTS: On that point, let me just play a little bit more of what Bobby Boutris, one of the whistle blower inspector said yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOUTRIS: I am very concerned because the safety issues affect the lives of the flying public. And instead of being advocates for safety, some people are still trying to muddy the water by down playing the serious safety issue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: It's true, as you say, Mr. Sturgell that there were no fatal accidents in the airline industry last year, but if what Bobby Boutris says is true, is the potential out there going forward in the future for catastrophic accidents?</p><p>STURGELL: The system is not perfect, John, but safety is our number one priority, and we've got thousands and thousands of people, not just at the FAA, not just our controllers, our inspectors, our mechanics or engineers, but tens of thousands of people in this industry who are out there every day making this system safe for the flying public. ROBERTS: James Oberstar who chaired the committee yesterday up there on Capitol Hill suggested that the FAA needs a top to bottom house cleaning. Would you agree with that?</p><p>STURGELL: Well, I think everybody is passionate about this issue. My job is to stay focused on the mission, and the mission is the safety and efficiency of the system. So that's what I'm going to do.</p><p>ROBERTS: Robert Sturgell, the acting administrator of the FAA. Thanks for being with us this morning. Appreciate it.</p><p>STURGELL: Thank you.</p><p>ROBERTS: Still ahead, the whole reason that Martin Luther King went to Memphis 40 years ago. He was marching with striking sanitation workers. Well, we found one of them, and we'll hear how he thinks America has changed after Dr. King's death, next, on AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBERTS: Coming up now on ten minutes to the top of the hour. This morning we are uncovering America. A look at the faces and the stories of our changing nation. Today Dr. King's dream 40 years after his death. He went to Memphis to march with sanitation workers on strike from a job made even more difficult by the racism and prejudice that they faced every day.</p><p>CNN's Don Lemon is in Memphis for the 40th anniversary talking with sanitation workers who were on the job back then and now. Don joins us this morning. Good morning, Don.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN, ANCHOR: Yes. Hey, good morning to you. Don't go anywhere, John. I want to ask you this. Do you know this name? Echo Cole? Do you know this one?</p><p>ROBERTS: They were ...</p><p>LEMON: Robert Walker.</p><p>ROBERTS: They were the sanitation workers that sparked the whole thing.</p><p>LEMON: Absolutely and how much do you hear about them? You don't hear that much and that's why I really made these because reading up on history and knowing about this story, John, as we all do, you know those names but not many people know the names.</p><p>With a driving rainstorm, two African-American sanitation workers, they couldn't fit in the cab of the garbage truck so they had to ride in the back of the truck between the compressor and the outside. The compressor malfunctioned, and that crushed them to death. And that's really -- that was the last straw with the sanitation workers. They went on strike, and that's why Dr. King came to Memphis, Tennessee. We wanted to find out if things have changed 40 years, what these sanitation workers were fighting for? If anything has changed in those years, we spoke to a man who was there 40 years ago and his son who now works for the Sanitation Department.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAMES MANUEL: That was the worst moment I had on the job.</p><p>LEMON: James Manuel has come a long way since the 1960s when he first became a sanitation worker in segregated Memphis, Tennessee.</p><p>MANUEL: You work outside in 100 degrees. 90-something degrees.</p><p>LEMON: It's hot, smelly, the garbage is leaking on you.</p><p>MANUEL: Right. It was tough. That's all I can say.</p><p>LEMON: And it was dangerous. Back then Manuel says people didn't put their garbage out on the curb. He and his fellow workers, all black, had to retrieve it from backyards. He said the company didn't provide gloves or uniforms. How much money were you making then?</p><p>MANUEL: When I started I think I was making $1.33 an hour.</p><p>LEMON: $1.33 an hour?</p><p>MANUEL: Right.</p><p>LEMON: To pick up garbage and half of it is leaking on you.</p><p>MANUEL: Right.</p><p>LEMON: The walking buzzards as they were called had to carry the leaking 60-gallon filthy tubs on their shoulders or heads and then they had to ride in the back of the truck with the garbage to the landfill.</p><p>MANUEL: You could sit on top of the garbage to the landfill or whatever.</p><p>LEMON: Really? People did that?</p><p>MANUEL: Yes.</p><p>LEMON: Sit on top of the garbage?</p><p>MANUEL: Yes.</p><p>LEMON: That's how two sanitation workers died in February of 1968. To escape a driving rainstorm, they huddled in the back with the putrefying garbage like the workers in this picture. They were accidentally crushed by a malfunctioning trash compressor.</p><p>After that, sanitation workers went on strike and Dr. King came to Memphis. It was here he gave his last speech on the evening before an assassin's bullet took his life on the balcony of the now infamous Lorraine Motel. James Manuel had attended the rally.</p><p>MANUEL: I feel bad about that. The whole Memphis feels bad about that.</p><p>LEMON: Now 40 years later, Manuel's son, James Jr., also works for the Sanitation Department.</p><p>JAMES MANUEL, JR., SANITATION WORKER: I admire and respect him, he's my father. He took care of me when I couldn't take care of myself. He taught me right from wrong. And he does -- the goals I want to follow in his footsteps become a supervisor.</p><p>LEMON: Today the working conditions, while not perfect, are better, and this time young and old, black and white, are working together.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEMON: As we come out live now, room 306 of the Lorraine Motel, that's the balcony of course, the infamous balcony, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lost his life. And John, 40 years later, as we said in our story, the conditions aren't perfect, but they are better, but still at least now they have gloves and they have uniforms. And rode with them yesterday and they were out passing them, giving them rain suits to make sure they didn't get wet in the rain.</p><p>But also now, John, they don't have to work in the rain if they don't want to. They have that option. But still 40 years later, they don't have a pension, so they're fighting for some of the things they were fighting for even when Dr. King came to town.</p><p>ROBERTS: Fascinating story for us this morning, Don. And it's a real reminder of the level of injustice back then in the 1960s. As you said, it has gotten somewhat better in the last 40 years, but still a lot of issue with labor across this country that needs to be addressed. Don Lemon for us this morning. Look forward to your coverage throughout the day, my friend. Thanks.</p><p>LEMON: Thanks, John.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right. See you soon.</p><p>And join CNN this afternoon for all of the King commemorations live from Memphis. We are also tuning in with radio show hosts around the country for \"Conversations with black America.\" Catch it live on CNN, 1:00 p.m. Eastern or logon to cnn.com/live.</p><p>Spring is usually the best time of year to sell your house, but will the current housing crisis make this spring a cold one on the home front? Our Gerri Willis will tell us what to expect. That's coming up.</p><p>Pus, an 18-year-old boy gets bitten by a shark and lives to tell about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He shook his head, wouldn't let go for a second. I tried to pull my foot out. And finally, he just let go.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Wow. We'll tell you how he's doing after that close encounter. That's ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, here is a pretty staggering figure or statistic in an election year. Eight out of every 10 Americans think the country is heading in the wrong direction. That's according to the latest \"New York Times\"/CBS news poll asking that question. Eighty- one percent of people say the country is on the wrong track. That is the highest percentage since they started taking that poll back in the early 1990s.</p><p>And that brings us to this morning's \"Quick Vote\" question. What do you think is the primary reason the country is on the wrong track? Right now, let's take a look. Fifty-one percent say Iraq, 25 percent say the economy, 17 percent say political gridlock, two percent say the state of health care, and five percent are pointing to the state of education.</p><p>Cast your vote for us at cnn.com/am. We'll continue to tally your votes throughout the morning. We've also been asking you for your e- mails as well. Ring in on those. Let's take a look at some of what people have been writing to us this morning.</p><p>Susan from Mount Pleasant, South Carolina says \"This is the first time in my almost 60 years I have actually considered leaving this country for good. It disgusts me.</p><p>Carol from Blackburg, Virginia says \"You've got to be kidding. The primary reason that the U.S. is on the wrong track: George W. Bush.</p><p>Steve from Seward, Nebraska writes \"This is one poll where you should have added \"all of the above.\"</p><p>See, we actually thought about that this morning but we did want people to break it down into what they thought was the primary reason. We though that everybody will just vote for \"all of the above.\"</p><p>And Michael from Lexington, Kentucky writes \"Our great nation is on the wrong track not for one single reason but a combination of several. Luckily, we are at a fork in the road and we have the opportunity to speak again as a nation in November.\"</p><p>TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.voxantshop.com\">www.voxantshop.com</url></p><p>[Byline: John Roberts, Alina Cho, Rob Marciano, Ali Velshi, Anderson Cooper, Veronica De La Cruz, Elizabeth Cohen, Ed Lavandera, John Dickerson, Don Lemon] [Guest: Robert Sturgell] [High: A tornado roars through Arkansas, causing damage and destruction.

Extreme weather on the march.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hitting home, the mortgage meltdown slams John McCain's home state.  What's his plan to solve the national nightmare?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And plain truth.  The FAA accused of getting too familiar with the airlines, putting them over your safety.  The agency's top guy answers live on this AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome back.  Thanks for joining us on this Friday the 4th of April.  Kiran is off today.  I'm John Roberts along with my pals Alina Cho and Ali Velshi.  What do you got on your plate this hour?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALI VELSHI, CNN SENIOR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we got a couple of things.  One is commodity prices are up again, and that's going to affect the amount that all of you pay for the food that you buy.  And secondly, in about an hour and a half, we're going to get the big jobs report for March.  We're expecting that we're going to have lost more jobs in the United States.  And for those of you who are sitting on the fence about whether we're getting into a recession or not, this might make your decision for you.</p><p>ROBERTS:  All right.  Looking forward to your views on that. What's new on your plate?</p><p>ALINA CHO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  A surprising new study about online scams and who is scammed more, men or women?  You take a guess. We'll tell you in a couple of minutes.</p><p>And the other story that's really interesting this morning, a Lincoln manuscript sells for a record price at auction. We're going to tell you more about that.</p><p>ROBERTS:  All right.  Looking forward to that.</p><p>Breaking news overnight to tell you about.  As severe storms leave behind a trail of fire in central Arkansas, witnesses say a tornado touchdown near the capital of Little Rock.  Take a look.</p><p>The cloud caught on dashcam sending sparks flying.  It sparked an inferno in a mobile home community.  The sparks that you see there are probably, according to a Saline County spokesperson, electrical transformers going up there as the lines touched and a short circuit occurred.  A lot of homes were damaged there.        Many people went running for shelter as winds tore roofs off of homes and trees out of the ground.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I've seen this man's house, the roof is totally gone off his house.  It's flattened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Even National Weather Service forecasters got into a bunker as the storm roared by.  Our Rob Marciano is standing by with extreme weather on the move right now.  Because this storm system didn't just dissipate as it went through Little Rock, it's on to more places.  </p><p>Rob, where is it headed?</p><p>ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Well, we've got a number of severe thunderstorm watches that are in effect this morning stretching from Texas all the way into parts of Tennessee.  Let's take you to four of them to be exact with all of them going into effect until 10:00, 11:00 Local time this morning.</p><p>We zoom into one particular shot that has me a little bit worried just north of Austin.  This is a severe thunderstorm with a severe thunderstorm warning attached to it.  It is heading to the east at 45 miles an hour, and folks in central Williamson County, Texas, are under the gun with this particular cell just north of Austin on Highway 35.</p><p>Everything is staying for the most part south of Dallas.  But if you do live south of Dallas you're getting hit with some heavy thunderstorms.  And also, south of Little Rock that's good news, but we do have flooding concerns for most of the state of Arkansas at the moment.</p><p>Nashville just got hammered with some storms.  This line looking pretty rough heading toward Murphysboro (ph) and down the I-40 corridor, heading eastward at a pretty rapid pace.  As mentioned, we've got a wide swath of action here, all of which is heading over an area that has seen a tremendous amount of rainfall over the last three weeks.  So flash flood watches and warnings are posted as far east as western Tennessee and as far south as the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>A widely encompassing storm, and it does stretch all the way to the northeast, and you folks will be seeing some rainfall there today as well.  John, back up to you.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Rob, how far does the potential for tornadoes extend this morning?</p><p>MARCIANO:  Well, right now, there are no tornado watches out. That doesn't mean that a tornado can't drop out of one of these severe thunderstorms.  That's why we're watching that particular storm just north of Austin. But at the moment, we don't expect as much severe weather today as what we saw last night.  We certainly hope that holds true.</p><p>ROBERTS:  That's a good thing, but still plenty of airport disruptions, I'm sure, because there are thunderstorms moving into a lot of heavily populated areas.</p><p>Rob Marciano for us this morning.  Rob, thanks.  We'll check back with you soon.</p><p>For the most politics in the morning now, and the race to raise cash.  The Democratic campaigns released fund-raising numbers for the month of March.  Barack Obama raised more than $40 million last month, twice what Hillary Clinton took in during the same period.  So far this year, Obama has raised a total of $131 million compared to Hillary Clinton's nearly $70 million.</p><p>And a sign that Hillary Clinton's superdelegate support could slip if she doesn't start putting up the numbers.  Two of Clinton's supporters, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine and Congressman Jack Murtha of Pennsylvania, are both saying that she has to beat Barack Obama in the popular vote to have any chance at winning the party's nomination.  And Murtha comes from that all-important prize on April 22nd, as we said, Pennsylvania.</p><p>A call for a nationwide discussion on race this morning from the parent denomination of Barack Obama's church in Chicago.  Leaders with the United Church of Christ are asking their 10,000 pastors to conduct what's being called a sacred conversation next month.  It follows the outrage generated by comments from Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the former pastor of Trinity Church.  </p><p>The president of the United Church of Christ, Reverend John Thomas, spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REV. JOHN THOMAS, PRESIDENT, UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST:  I think we saw a caricature and a stereotype not only of Reverend Wright but the black church.  And as a result, the conversation on race has not been sacred but profoundly ugly and unhelpful.  And that's why on this anniversary of Dr. King's famous speech before his assassination, we're calling for a sacred conversation on race that we think can achieve and move us toward his challenge to make America a better place.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  How do you see that conversation unfolding?  I mean, you're calling for a conversation in churches on a given day.  What do you want people to talk about?  What is the conversation?</p><p>THOMAS:  Part of the reason that this conversation is so difficult is that we often are unwilling to be deeply honest with one another, that we view one another simply through a lens of caricature or stereotype.  So we're calling for a conversation where people in a context of trust and respect begin to be more honest with one another, to share their fears, their hopes, their anxieties, their anger.      This is not going to be an easy conversation.  Sacred conversations can be profoundly difficult, and sometimes they can be loud, but they're important for us, and we know that it's only a beginning on May 18th.  That's the opening part of the conversation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Obama's church has received threats since Wright's comments came to light.  It is the country's largest United Church of Christ congregation.</p><p>Hillary Clinton and John McCain will both be in Memphis today for ceremonies honoring the 40th anniversary of the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  But last night, Hillary Clinton showed off her lighter side during an appearance on \"The Tonight Show.\" </p><p>Clinton walked out with Leno's band playing the theme song from \"Rocky\" jumping off of her comments earlier in the week where she compared herself to the fictional fighter.  Clinton, then, went on to make fun of her recent comments about her 1996 trip to Bosnia as First Lady.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It is so great to be here.  You know, I was worried I wasn't going to make it.</p><p>JAY LENO, HOST, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO\":  Oh.</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes, I was pinned down by sniper fire.</p><p>LENO:  Really?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Clinton and Leno also had some fun with her \"It's 3:00 a.m.\" campaign commercials.  Leno said it's got to be tough handling all those middle of the night emergencies.</p><p>Seven minutes after the hour.  Alina Cho here now with other stories new this morning.  She can make fun of that.</p><p>CHO:  Yes, she can.  The lighting is great on Jay Leno, by the way.  It set the mood very well.  All right.</p><p>New this morning.  Good morning, everybody.</p><p>A Virginia Tech-style plot police say they discovered online, and they say it led them to a 20-year-old with a stash of automatic rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition.  Police in Homestead, Florida, say Calin Chi Wong was threatening to stage an attack similar to the one at Virginia Tech nearly a year ago that killed 32 students.</p><p>Police say Wong had more weapons than most local SWAT teams, including four AK-47s and body piercing ammunition.  Wong has been charged with making written threats to kill.  He was released on bond.      Well, runways are back open at Kennedy International Airport in New York this morning.  The landing gear of a small plane collapsed last night, and that plane skidded off the runway and into the grass. The airport closed down all but one runway last night leading to some delays, of course.  One person was slightly hurt.</p><p>Explosive testimony about safety in the skies and about the agency that's supposed to ensure it.  The founder of Southwest Airlines testified before a Congressional committee that Southwest made a mistake when it allowed planes to fly that should have been grounded.  Lawmakers also heard from two FAA safety inspectors.  One of them says he tried to raise a flag about missed safety checks, but managers at the FAA blocked him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOBBY BOUTRIS, FAA INSPECTOR:  My experience, I believe, the priority of the regional office is damage control, and I see no interest in accountability or doing the right thing.  At the end of the investigation, no matter what evidence shows, it's disregarded by the division management team who cherry picked the information from the investigation reports.  And while looking at the big picture, they apply band aids instead of fixing the root of the problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHO:  Lawmakers now plan to call the FAA in on a regular basis to see what kind of progress it's making to improve its inspection program.  And stay tuned because coming up at 7:30, in less than a half hour, we're going to talk to the acting FAA administrator about just how safe the skies are.</p><p>We have a consumer alert to tell you about.  A government report says Americans are being ripped off in record numbers by online scams. Records from the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center show that Internet crimes topped $240 million last year.  That's actually up $40 million from two years ago.</p><p>The Feds say many of the crime cases involve pet scams, online dating fraud, and scammers trying to profit from natural disasters like that I-35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis last year.  The report also found that men were more likely to be scammed than women.</p><p>Forty years ago today, civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.  You're looking live there at the King Center in Atlanta and the reflecting pool, as we widen out that shot.  Several events are planned today including visits by presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and John McCain.</p><p>King was shot on a Memphis balcony back in 1968.  His death tore a hole in the hearts of several civil rights leaders and Americans really.  Four decades later, King's work continues.  Yesterday, lawmakers honored his legacy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)      REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER:  Dr. King possessed a voice of hope so powerful that it shook and shattered walls of oppression and lifted the spirits of the downtrodden and the denied.</p><p>SEN. HARRY REID (D), MAJORITY LEADER:  Our responsibility is to continue his dream with courage, with hard work, so that we can, as he said, make our old world a new world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHO:  And a programming note, join CNN this afternoon for all the King commemorations live from Memphis.  We're also tuning in with radio show hosts around the country for what we're calling \"Conversations With Black America.\"  Catch it live on CNN at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time or logon to CNN.com/live.</p><p>And finally, a letter written by Abraham Lincoln has set a record at auction.  It happened at Sotheby's.  President Lincoln wrote it in response to the \"Little People's Petition\" in 1864.  School kids were asking the then-president to free slave children, and Lincoln actually wrote back.</p><p>He said, \"While I have not the power to grant all they ask, I trust they will remember that God has.\"  The letter, by the way, sold for $3.4 million at Sotheby's to a private American collector who was bidding by phone.  So interesting.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Let me just come back to this guy in Homestead, this guy, Wong, who had been making threats to stage another Virginia Tech- style massacre.  Had an arsenal that you described as being more than SWAT teams.</p><p>CHO:  More than the local SWAT teams.</p><p>ROBERTS:  And armor-piercing rounds, which are illegal in the state of Florida, and he bonded out for $7,500?</p><p>CHO:  It's a big question why.  It's a big question why.  Of course, with Virginia Tech, there were some mental problems that were revealed.  Not sure what's coming out yet about that, but we're still watching the details.  It is very interesting that he was released on bond.</p><p>ROBERTS:  I think this is a story we need to dig a little deeper on.  Alina Cho for us this morning.  Alina, thanks.</p><p>CHO:  You bet.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Twelve minutes after the hour.  One of the hottest states in the mortgage meltdown is Arizona.  It's the home base of John McCain where even million dollars homes are going under.  We've got a closer look at the candidate's plans to fix the housing crisis coming up.</p><p>How to help your doctor help you.  Advice to get the most out of your next trip to the doctor's office.  That's ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Fifteen minutes after the hour.  More signs of a troubled economy to tell you about.  This time the tech industry is in the spotlight, and our Veronica De La Cruz joins us now.  What companies are we talking about?</p><p>VERONICA DE LA CRUZ, CNN INTERNET CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, wow.  You know, some big name companies, John.  Dell, Microsoft, Google all looking to cut costs by downsizing.  Again, Dell CEO, they're saying the company will cut more than 8,800 jobs previously announced to stay more competitive.</p><p>Moving on to Motorola, 2,600 employees around the globe.  The company has been having a rough time with their cell phone entity especially with Apple's iPhone taking such a huge chunk of the high- end market.  And then, getting you to Google, 300 employees there from newly acquired DoubleClick, Inc. -- 300 employees.  It may not sound like a lot, but it's actually about a quarter of that company.  Google bought DoubleClick in March for $3 billion plus.</p><p>You know, also in the headlines this morning, we touched a little on it already.  But scammers have been using e-mail to con trusting Americans.  Victims have been falling for it time and time again. This new government report out shows money lost from Internet crime hit a new high last year, nearly $240 million.  The report shows scams involving pets, check cashing schemes, and online dating all are on the rise.</p><p>The report also shows that more than 75 percent of the perpetrators were male.  Men were scammed out of more money than women were, on average about $200 more.  And almost half of the victims were between the ages of 30 and 49 years old.</p><p>So, John, the first time this report was released was 2001.  $18 million lost that year.  $240 million, 2007.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Any idea why men are more vulnerable to being scammed than women?</p><p>DE LA CRUZ:  You know, honestly, I would say that men ...</p><p>ROBERTS:  Other than the history of life between men and women causes women to be more suspicious.</p><p>DE LA CRUZ:   I would say that men probably use the Internet more to shop and are probably, you know, doing more when it comes to online banking.  You know, I talked to a lot of my female friends who are still scared to give out their personal information online.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Yes.  Guys, got to get sharp.  Veronica, thanks very much.</p><p>So you've been to the doctor's office and you know that there's ... whoops.  Where are we here?  Where do we go?</p><p>You've been to the doctor's office.  You know that there's precious little time for doctor-patient interaction.  So what can you do to maximize the time that you spend with your doctor and actually help your doctor take care of you?</p><p>CNN's Elizabeth Cohen at the medical update desk for us now. Elizabeth, why should a patient help the doctor take care of the patient?  I thought the doctor was supposed to do all of that?</p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Right, John, it does seem a little bit backwards.  But the way that it works these days is your doctor is so rushed sometimes, it really behooves you to help your doctor because you're going to be the one who benefits in the end.  Help your doctor make the most out of the time that you do have together.  So we have a list on CNN.com/health.  Let's take a look at two of the things that you can do to help your doctor help you.</p><p>First of all, arrive at your appointment with a list of medications, so you're not sitting there thinking, saying to the doctor, I think I take a pink pill maybe once a day, maybe twice. Can't remember the name.  Don't do that.  Just hand him a list of medications.  It's much easier.</p><p>Also, bring in your list of your top three concerns.  Now, you might be thinking well, I know why I'm there.  I mean, I made the appointment.  You know what, when you're in that exam room in that funny little gown that opens in all sorts of weird places, you forget things.</p><p>You get sort of flustered and you're not always going to remember every point you wanted to bring up with the doctor.  Have it in writing.  It's a whole lot easier.</p><p>Now, if you want to see some more of our tips about how to help your doctor help you, go to CNN.com/health.  You can click on it. It's the main story on our page there, and it will give you five ways to help your doctor help you -- John.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Elizabeth, you know, many times people not only have one doctor, but say that they got some condition that they're seeing multiple specialists for.  What do they do to get that whole team working together?</p><p>COHEN:  John, what they have to do is you have to figure early on that you are the captain of the team.  You are the glue that holds that team together.  Unfortunately, doctors are notorious for not talking to one another.</p><p>So when you finish with one appointment with Dr. Smith, say, Dr. Smith, can you please send me a list of your notes from this appointment so when I go to see Dr. Jones next month, I can just hand them to him.  You have the paper in hand because otherwise that paper may never reach your second doctor.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Elizabeth Cohen for us this morning on the medical update desk in Atlanta.  Elizabeth, thanks.</p><p>COHEN:  Thanks.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Some good tips for us this morning.</p><p>Alina's got the results of an interesting poll about the way Americans are viewing the country and the direction.</p><p>CHO:  Yes.</p><p>ROBERTS:  What do you got?</p><p>CHO:  Yes, thanks, John.  And Americans should listen up because this is important.  Eight out of every 10 Americans now think the country is headed in the wrong direction.  That's according to the latest \"New York Times\"/CBS poll that's asking that question.  Eighty- one percent of people say we're on the wrong track.  That's the most since they started taking that poll in the early 1990s.</p><p>And that brings us to this morning's \"Quick Vote\" question.  What do you think is the primary reason you think the country is on the wrong track like so many people say?</p><p>Right now, 51 percent say Iraq.  A slight majority.  Twenty-two percent say the economy.  Twenty-one percent say political gridlock. Two percent say the state of health care.  Five percent say the state of education.</p><p>Cast your vote at CNN.com/am.  Of course, we'll continue to tally your votes throughout the morning.</p><p>We're also looking for your thoughts online.  Didn't see a choice on that \"Quick Vote\" that you like?  Think something else is driving the country off track?  Well, e-mail us at CNN.com/email.  We're going to read some of your e-mails, and we'll have the first tally of the votes later this hour -- John.</p><p>ROBERTS:  I would imagine we'll probably going to get some pretty interesting commentary on that particular question.</p><p>Well, what goes up must come down.  Phoenix was once one of the hottest housing markets in the country.  Now, it's a hotbed for foreclosures.  How John McCain is handling the housing mess in his home state.  That's coming up next on AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Twenty-three minutes after the hour.  The economy is issue number one with American voters, and the housing crisis is hitting home on the campaign trail.  One of the nation's hottest spots in the mortgage meltdown is Phoenix, Arizona, the home base for Senator John McCain.  Phoenix had the 14th highest foreclosure rate in the nation in February.  During that month, 2,500 homes were foreclosed.  </p><p>McCain told us here in AMERICAN MORNING that he supports the Senate bill designed to offer relief.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The first priority is to help those people, those four to six million people, who are badly in danger of losing their homes who did nothing wrong. And this package in the Senate, I think, would have a significant beneficial effect.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Ed Lavandera is in McCain's home state of Arizona.  He joins us this morning with a little bit more on what McCain might do as well, Ed, to try to fix the housing crisis.  Good morning to you.</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, John.  We know several years ago investors started moving into Arizona, buying up property all over the place.  And as you mentioned today, the state has the fourth highest foreclosure rate in the country.  The real estate bubble here has burst, so it's a good place to study how presidential candidate John McCain has handled the crisis in his home state.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over):  It seems like the entire state of Arizona is for sale.  There are more than 57,000 homes on the market in the Phoenix area.  One local realtor estimates only 4,000 have sold in the last month.</p><p>Foreclosure listings are growing.  Home prices are dropping. Housing experts say it will take at least a year for the market to settle.</p><p>JAY BUTLER, ARIZONA REALTY EXPERT:  The issue is who do you turn to?  And in some instances, you want to turn to government, but it doesn't necessarily have the solutions.</p><p>LAVANDERA (on camera):  In Arizona, you take the mortgage crisis and you mix it in with a weakening economy and you find homes like this one.  Two years ago, public records show this house sold for $3.7 million.  Today, it's listed as a foreclosure selling for $1.2 million.</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over):  While the mortgage meltdown pummels Arizona, you won't find this state's senior senator advocating for sweeping help from the federal government.</p><p>MCCAIN:  And it's not the duty of government to bailout and reward those who act irresponsibly.</p><p>LAVANDERA:  McCain's aides say the presidential candidate prefers a judicious and targeted response.  In the last year, he supported stricter guidelines for loaning money and the Mortgage Forgiveness Act, which keeps homeowners facing foreclosure from paying some taxes if they can refinance their home.  One Arizona political columnist says McCain has not talked much about the mortgage crisis and that's surprising.</p><p>ROBERT ROBB, COLUMNIST, \"ARIZONA REPUBLIC\":  He seems to be setting up the general election very much as a contest between those who think government ought to do a lot more, and those who think that maybe government ought to step back a minute and be pretty selective and not rush to judgment.</p><p>LAVANDERA:  In the meantime, another for sale sign is planted in the desert.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAVANDERA:  And, of course, the Democratic presidential candidates have been taking a lot of criticism of McCain over the last week or so, after McCain explained kind of his philosophy on how to handle this crisis.  If you take a closer look at the foreclosure rates in Arizona, we get one in every 264 households that have been foreclosed on right now.  That's according to Realty Track.  That's up 210 percent from this time last year.</p><p>Then you look at the home states of Obama and Clinton.  In Illinois, one in every 587 households.  That's up 32 percent from last year.  And in New York, one in almost 15 households has been foreclosed on, and that's up about 15 percent from this time last year -- John.</p><p>ROBERTS:  And growing pressure on lawmakers and the presidential candidates who are all facing election this November to do something about it.  Ed Lavandera for us this morning, Paradise Valley, Arizona, the place to be.  Ed, thanks.</p><p>You're watching the most news in the morning. Caught on tape, a cloud of fire.  A tornado sends sparks flying igniting parts of central Arkansas.  We'll have a live update on the rescue and cleanup effort.</p><p>And we're also tracking more extreme weather that you're going to want to know about coming up.</p><p>The cash keeps on flowing into Barack Obama's campaign coffers as he takes aim at Hillary Clinton's lead in Pennsylvania.  Our John Dickerson with some campaign analysis when AMERICAN MORNING returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBERTS:  It's Friday the 4th of April.  Thanks very much for being with us on this AMERICAN MORNING.  John Roberts along with Ali Velshi and Alina Cho.  Kiran is off today.  </p><p>We got some breaking news to tell you about this morning as people in Arkansas wake up to see the destruction that a tornado left behind.  At least one tornado ripped through central Arkansas near the capital of Little Rock.  It sparked a fire that spread to several trailer homes and police say that it injured four people and sent residents running.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everything was tore up.  Doors were torn off the buildings, people's house, their roofs were taken off.  I felt the wind literally almost take me off my feet.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Powerful stuff this morning.  Rob Marciano standing by with more on this extreme weather which is on the move right now. Rob, this is a pretty  substantial storm system.</p><p>MARCIANO:  Yes, really stretching its legs here, John.  And we got a number of watch boxes out.  The system is felt really, there's a number of pieces of energy flowing in the upper levels of the atmosphere that is just stretching this thing out and making it a several-day and several-state  long event, all the way from New England and back to central Texas.  </p><p>And we have a number of watch boxes out.  These yellow watch boxes are severe thunderstorm watch boxes issued by the storms predictions center, meaning that severe thunderstorms are likely within these areas.  And right now, we've got four of them.  Most of them in effect until 10:00 and 11:00 local time.</p><p>All right. Let's do a couple of these and talk about what kind of action we're seeing right now.  We do have a severe thunderstorm watch out or warning out for eastern parts of Williams County, Texas.  This is just north of Boston.  This cell has been holding together for the past couple of hours and has some heavy rains and gusty winds and significant hail and it's moving quickly to the east at 30 to 40 miles an hour.</p><p>North into Dallas, we're seeing most of the action south of Dallas-Ft. Worth metropolitan area, but no doubt DFW will have some delays today.  Heavier rains stretching into Arkansas.  This is where we saw the tornado last night.  Right now, we're just heavy rain, but that's not good news either because for the past 2 1/2, 3 weeks heavy rain has plagued that part of the state there.  They're in a flash flood warning right now in effect for the next couple of hours.</p><p>Heavy thunderstorms rolling through Nashville and then moving quickly off to the east, and off towards the northeast we're seeing some rain from New York up through Bridgeport, Connecticut, and through Boston as well as the storm  continues to stretch out and affect a whole swath of the eastern part of the country.  </p><p>John, back up to you.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Rob Marciano keeping a close eye for us this morning. Rob, appreciate it.  Thanks.</p><p>MARCIANO:  You got it.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Now to politics and another campaign windfall for Barack Obama.  The candidate raised $40 million in March, double what Hillary Clinton took in.  And Obama is spending it in Pennsylvania where he is closing the gap on Clinton with the primary just two weeks and four days from now.</p><p>Our John Dickerson, CNN political analyst and chief political correspondent for  slate.com joins us from Cleveland this morning. John, what do you attribute this disparity in fund-raising on the part of Barack Obama to?</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, he's been able to grab a whole bunch of people.  He's just got more actual donors, and he's been tapping them time and time again.  They haven't given him the big donations.  That's more typical of the Clinton donor, but Obama has people who give in small increments, so he can keep going back to them each time.</p><p>ROBERTS:  So he keeps going back to them again and again and again.  He's got a pad of $20 million over Hillary Clinton for the month of March.  Can he effectively spend that in Pennsylvania and narrow the gap.  He's made some inroads there, he's not as far behind as he was but in most polls he's still behind by double digits.</p><p>DICKERSON:  That's right.  He's made a little bit of inroads in Pennsylvania.  He spent a lot of time registering new voters, trying to get new folks to the polls.  He wants to drive up his numbers in those areas where he's strong.  Money will help with some of that.  </p><p>He might also be using that money in the later contest, North Carolina is a place everybody is now focusing on.  So in Pennsylvania all of that money may not help from today forward, but it certainly has helped when he's raised it in getting him to where he is now.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Hillary Clinton, a couple of days ago the story came out that in trying to convince Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico to support her, she allegedly said to him, Obama can't win.  She was asked about that comment yesterday.  </p><p>Let's listen to what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  I don't talk about private conversations.  I can win. I know I can win.  That's why I do this every day.  And that's what my campaign is about.  I'm in it to win it, and I intend to do just that. It's a no.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS:  So she says that's a no, which people originally took to mean that's a no, I didn't say that, but her campaign came out and clarified to say, no, the no was in relation to not talking about private conversations.  But even if she did say it to Bill Richardson, Obama can't win, that guy can't win, you got to  vote for that, is that unusual?</p><p>DICKERSON:  Well, it is a little unusual.  The reason she was doing all of that fast dancing in that clip and the reason may sound a little confusing is what she doesn't want to say in public on camera is Obama can't win because if Obama does win and she is either on the ticket or campaigning for him, that's an ad that John McCain can run against Obama.  </p><p>You know, Hillary Clinton said he can't win, but the fact is as you point out, the Clinton campaign has been arguing for months that Obama is essentially fundamentally flawed.  He can't win among certain constituencies and he can't win in these big states.  Now, they don't want to say it out loud, of course, but it is the message of the campaign.</p><p>ROBERTS:  All right.  John Dickerson for us this morning in Cleveland.  John, thanks very much.  </p><p>Thirty-five minutes after the hour.  Ali Velshi here now minding your business.  And we did something on this last year and you had a great breakdown on it.  The price of corn going up again, and just how much of everything that we consume or use involves corn?</p><p>VELSHI:  Well, you know, we talk about issue number one, and we often think it has got to do with those credit crunch and housing crisis.  But fundamentally as we broke it down, Americans have told us in our polling that, in fact, it is inflation that is the number one concern.  And often we associate that with gasoline, but corn plays very heavily into this whole thing.</p><p>First of all, several years ago we made some decisions about how corn is going to be used to make ethanol, which is added to our gasoline.  Now, a number of people think while that was meant to reduce our dependency on crude oil, what it does is it take what is fundamentally a food source and makes it into a gasoline source. That's caused corn to go up.  And yesterday, we had a record on corn hitting $6 a bushel.  That was a fairly big increase in the price of corn.</p><p>Now, the other thing is because we're using all of this land to buy corn, it's causing wheat, sorghum, soybeans, all those other things to become more  expensive.  It's also causing animal feed to become more expensive which is increasing the price of dairy and chicken and beef and things like that.  And when you put all that together, there's an index that tracks commodities.  Now, this includes oil but this is the Dow Jones Commodity Index over the last year.</p><p>Take a look at the leap in prices on that.  That's a combination of your oil, your corn, your wheat, all of those expenses, and that means inflation to the average American which goes full circle to the fact that issue number one to most people is, in fact, the fact that they are getting less for the same dollar that they  were spending last year.  And this is about the kitchen table.  </p><p>So you're paying to get the corn or whatever food is being farmed, the diesel used on those farms, the diesel that used to truck it there, and the energy used to store it, and then frankly you're just paying for the basic commodity.</p><p>CHO:  Well, let's not forget that high fructose corn syrup used in diet soda.</p><p>VELSHI:  That's right.  Everything that is sweetened these days. That was in the day when corn was cheap and plentiful.</p><p>CHO:  Right.</p><p>VELSHI:  So, we changed that.  Now, corn is not cheap nor plentiful, and that's -- this is a major issue that the administration is going to have to deal with.  We have put a lot of pressure on corn. It's a food.</p><p>ROBERTS:  The only bright spot in all of this is that all of these farmers, not talking about ...</p><p>VELSHI:  Corn farmers.</p><p>ROBERTS:  We're not talking about farming companies but we're talking about all these farmers who were growing corn and losing money.</p><p>VELSHI:  Now they're making money.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Finally, making some money.</p><p>VELSHI:  The problem is you're making farmers who weren't making money and other things who are growing corn and that's why we're not making the same amount of wheat and soybeans and things like that.</p><p>CHO:  So, it's a wash.</p><p>VELSHI:  We do need to balance it out somehow.  It's an issue.</p><p>ROBERTS:  All right.  Ali Velshi for us this morning.  Ali, thanks.</p><p>New questions about how safe we all are when we fly this morning. This after two FAA inspectors say they were pressured to keep quiet about safety problems, threatened even.  Coming up, we are going to talk with the acting FAA administrator and what is being done to keep you and your family safe.  And how we got into this situation in the first place?</p><p>And 40 years later, the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. lives on.  A look at how life has changed in Memphis, coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Is the cozy relationship between the airlines and the FAA putting you at risk? That's what two whistle blowers told a congressional committee.  During their testimony yesterday the two said they were pressured to ignore problems at Southwest Airlines.  </p><p>One of the safety inspectors getting emotional as he described the threats made against him and his family if he revealed what he knew.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUGLAS PETERS, FAA INSPECTOR:  He then pointed to a picture of my family and said, again, this is what's important.  I'd hate to see you jeopardize yours and her career trying to take down a couple of losers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Well, joining me to talk more about this is the acting FAA administrator Robert Sturgell.  He is live in Washington this morning.  Mr. Sturgell, good to see you.  And thanks for being with us today.</p><p>The treatment of these whistle blowers, Bobby Boutris and Doug Peters, by their superiors, threatened for pressuring on the issue of safety violations.  What is the flying public to think about that?</p><p>ROBERT STURGELL, ACTING FAA ADMINISTRATOR:  Well, good morning, John.  </p><p>Listen, I'm not going to make any excuses for what went on in that office in our Southwest region.  It's obvious that some legitimate concerns were being raised for a period of time and they weren't being addressed.  So, we've taken some actions.  The investigation continues, and I suspect we'll take additional actions down there as well.</p><p>ROBERTS:  These whistle blowers said that the FAA views airlines as customers rather than companies to be regulated.  Yesterday, here on AMERICAN MORNING, we took an informal, not a scientific poll, nearly 90 percent of people thought the FAA was looking out for the airlines, not looking out for passengers who fly on the airlines.  I mean, you take those things together it's a rather stinging indictment of the FAA.</p><p>STURGELL:  Well, make no mistake our number one customers are the flying public and the taxpayers.  We don't lose sight of that.  When we find things, you know, regardless of what you label it, when we find things, we fix them.  </p><p>I think what people need to understand is that the system consists of a variety of oversight mechanism, not just inspections, a regulatory role, an enforcement role, but also partnership programs and voluntary disclosure programs with the carriers that are very important part of this system.  They allow people to bring safety data to us and allow us to take measures proactively.  Without those kinds of systems, we're going to drive safety issues underground, and that's a result the public cannot afford.</p><p>ROBERTS:  All right.  How did this situation get to the point that it did in that office?</p><p>STURGELL:  Well, again, as I said, I'm  not going to make any excuses for that office and for what went on.  We are taking action, and there will be additional actions taken.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Right but do you know how it got there in the first place?</p><p>STURGELL:  Well, we have the testimony.  We have an investigative file, and again the investigation is ongoing.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Right.</p><p>STURGELL:  So I suspect there will be additional actions down there.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Now, Calvin Scoville, who is the inspector general for the Department of Transportation yesterday spoke out on all of this. He agreed with the two whistle blowers that there seemed to be a cozy relationship between the FAA inspectors and supervisors locally and Southwest Airlines.  </p><p>He went on to suggest yesterday that we need an independent oversight organization for the  FAA, which would appear to be to a lot of people to be very troubling because it's the FAA that's supposed to be the oversight organization.  So what does it say about the FAA if you need oversight of the overseers?</p><p>STURGELL:  Well, we've been working very closely with the inspector general throughout this process, and I think the point I would make here is that over the last couple of weeks we've also initiated our own special emphasis audit throughout the country, and that audit has produced a compliance rate that we found of about 99 percent.  </p><p>So we've got some areas that we need to continue to work on, but I think overall it shows that the system is working and it's working as designed.  And, you know, I can only tell people to look at the data.  Look at the accident rates.  See how safe the system is, and I think that's proof of the  system working.  Can it be better?  Yes, it can be better.</p><p>ROBERTS:  On that point, let me just play a little bit more of what Bobby Boutris, one of the whistle blower inspector said yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOUTRIS:  I am very concerned because the safety issues affect the lives of the flying public.  And instead of being advocates for safety, some people are still trying to muddy the water by down playing the serious safety issue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS:  It's true, as you say, Mr. Sturgell that there were no fatal accidents in the airline industry last year, but if what Bobby Boutris says is true, is the potential out there going forward in the future for catastrophic accidents?</p><p>STURGELL:  The system is not perfect, John, but safety is our number one priority, and we've got thousands and thousands of people, not just at the FAA, not just our controllers, our inspectors, our mechanics or engineers, but tens of thousands of people in this industry who are out there every day making this system safe for the flying public.      ROBERTS:  James Oberstar who chaired the committee yesterday up there on Capitol Hill suggested that the FAA needs a top to bottom house cleaning.  Would you agree with that?</p><p>STURGELL:  Well, I think everybody is passionate about this issue.  My job is to stay focused on the mission, and the mission is the safety and efficiency of the  system.  So that's what I'm going to do.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Robert Sturgell, the acting administrator of the FAA. Thanks for  being with us this morning.  Appreciate it.</p><p>STURGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Still ahead, the whole reason that Martin Luther King went to Memphis 40 years ago.  He was marching with striking sanitation workers.  Well, we found one of them, and we'll hear how he thinks America has changed after Dr. King's death, next, on AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Coming up now on ten minutes to the top of the hour. This morning we are uncovering America.  A look at the faces and the stories of our changing nation.  Today Dr. King's dream 40 years after his death.  He went to Memphis to march with sanitation workers on strike from a job made even more difficult by the racism and prejudice that they faced every day.</p><p>CNN's Don Lemon is in Memphis for the 40th anniversary talking with sanitation workers who were on the job back then and now.  Don joins us this morning.  Good morning, Don.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN, ANCHOR:  Yes.  Hey, good morning to you.  Don't go anywhere, John.  I want to ask you this.  Do you know this name? Echo Cole? Do you know this one?</p><p>ROBERTS:  They were ...</p><p>LEMON:  Robert Walker.</p><p>ROBERTS:  They were the sanitation workers that sparked the whole thing.</p><p>LEMON:  Absolutely and how much do you hear about them?  You don't hear that much and that's why I really made these because reading up on history and knowing about this story, John, as we all do, you know those names but not many people know the names.  </p><p>With a driving rainstorm, two African-American sanitation workers, they couldn't fit in the cab of the garbage truck so they had to ride in the back of the truck between the compressor and the outside.  The compressor malfunctioned, and that crushed them to death.  And that's really -- that was the last straw with the sanitation workers.  They went on strike, and that's why Dr. King came to Memphis, Tennessee.        We wanted to find out if things have changed 40 years, what these sanitation workers were fighting for?  If anything has changed in those years, we spoke to a man who was there 40 years ago and his son who now works for the Sanitation Department.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAMES MANUEL:  That was the worst moment I had on the job.</p><p>LEMON:  James Manuel has come a long way since the 1960s when he first became a  sanitation worker in segregated Memphis, Tennessee.</p><p>MANUEL:  You work outside in 100 degrees.  90-something degrees.</p><p>LEMON:  It's hot, smelly, the garbage is leaking on you.</p><p>MANUEL:  Right.  It was tough.  That's all I can say.</p><p>LEMON:  And it was  dangerous.  Back then Manuel says people didn't put their garbage out on the curb.  He and his fellow workers, all black, had to retrieve it from backyards.  He said the company didn't provide gloves or uniforms.  How much money were you making then?</p><p>MANUEL:  When I started I think I was making $1.33 an hour.</p><p>LEMON:  $1.33 an hour?</p><p>MANUEL:  Right.</p><p>LEMON:  To pick up garbage and half of it is leaking on you.</p><p>MANUEL:  Right.</p><p>LEMON:  The walking buzzards as they were called had to carry the leaking 60-gallon filthy tubs on their shoulders or heads and then they had to ride in the back of the truck with the garbage to the landfill.</p><p>MANUEL:  You could sit on top of the garbage to the landfill or whatever.</p><p>LEMON:  Really? People did that?</p><p>MANUEL:  Yes.</p><p>LEMON:  Sit on top of the garbage?</p><p>MANUEL:  Yes.</p><p>LEMON:  That's how two sanitation workers died in February of 1968.  To escape a driving rainstorm, they huddled in the back with the putrefying garbage like the workers in this picture.  They were accidentally crushed by a malfunctioning trash compressor.  </p><p>After that, sanitation workers went on strike and Dr. King came to Memphis.  It was here he gave his last speech on the evening before an  assassin's bullet took his life on the balcony of the now infamous Lorraine Motel.  James Manuel had attended the rally.</p><p>MANUEL:  I feel bad about that.  The whole Memphis feels bad about that.</p><p>LEMON:  Now 40 years later, Manuel's son, James Jr., also works for the Sanitation Department.</p><p>JAMES MANUEL, JR., SANITATION WORKER:  I admire and respect him, he's my father.  He took care of me when I couldn't take care of myself.  He taught me right from wrong.  And he does -- the goals I want to follow in his footsteps become a supervisor.</p><p>LEMON:  Today the working conditions, while not perfect, are better, and this time young and old, black and white, are working together.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEMON:  As we come out live now, room 306 of the Lorraine Motel, that's the balcony of course, the infamous balcony, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lost his life.  And John, 40 years later, as we said in our story, the conditions  aren't perfect, but they are better, but still at least now they have gloves and they have uniforms.  And rode with them yesterday and they were out passing them, giving them rain suits to make sure they didn't get wet in the rain.  </p><p>But also now, John, they don't have to work in the rain if they don't want to.  They have that option.  But still 40 years later, they don't have a pension, so they're fighting for some of the things they were fighting for even when Dr. King came to town.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Fascinating story for us this morning, Don.  And it's a real reminder of the level of injustice back then in the 1960s.  As you said, it has gotten somewhat better in the last 40 years, but still a lot of issue with labor across this country that needs to be addressed.  Don Lemon for us this morning.  Look forward to your coverage throughout the day, my friend.  Thanks.</p><p>LEMON:  Thanks, John.</p><p>ROBERTS:  All right.  See you soon.</p><p>And join CNN this afternoon for all of the King commemorations live from Memphis.

We'll tell you how he's doing after that close encounter.  That's ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Well, here is a pretty staggering figure or statistic in an election year.  Eight out of every 10 Americans think the country is heading in the wrong direction.  That's according to the latest \"New York Times\"/CBS news poll asking that question.  Eighty- one percent of people say the country is on the wrong track.  That is the highest percentage since they started taking that poll back in the early 1990s.</p><p>And that brings us to this morning's \"Quick Vote\" question.  What do you think is the primary reason the country is on the wrong track? Right now, let's take a look.  Fifty-one percent say Iraq, 25 percent say the economy, 17 percent say political gridlock, two percent say the state of health care, and five percent are pointing to the state of education.</p><p>Cast your vote for us at cnn.com/am.

It disgusts me.</p><p>Carol from Blackburg, Virginia says \"You've got to be kidding. The primary reason that the U.S. is on the wrong track: George W. Bush.</p><p>Steve from Seward, Nebraska writes \"This is one poll where you should have added \"all of the above.\"  </p><p>See, we actually thought about that this morning but we did want people to break it down into what they thought was the primary reason. We though that everybody will just vote for \"all of the above.\"</p><p>And Michael from Lexington, Kentucky writes \"Our great nation is on the wrong track not for one single reason but a combination of several.

What's his plan to solve the national nightmare?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And plain truth. The FAA accused of getting too familiar with the airlines, putting them over your safety. The agency's top guy answers live on this AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome back. Thanks for joining us on this Friday the 4th of April. Kiran is off today. I'm John Roberts along with my pals Alina Cho and Ali Velshi. What do you got on your plate this hour?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALI VELSHI, CNN SENIOR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, we got a couple of things. One is commodity prices are up again, and that's going to affect the amount that all of you pay for the food that you buy. And secondly, in about an hour and a half, we're going to get the big jobs report for March. We're expecting that we're going to have lost more jobs in the United States. And for those of you who are sitting on the fence about whether we're getting into a recession or not, this might make your decision for you.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right. Looking forward to your views on that. What's new on your plate?</p><p>ALINA CHO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A surprising new study about online scams and who is scammed more, men or women? You take a guess. We'll tell you in a couple of minutes.</p><p>And the other story that's really interesting this morning, a Lincoln manuscript sells for a record price at auction. We're going to tell you more about that.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right. Looking forward to that.</p><p>Breaking news overnight to tell you about. As severe storms leave behind a trail of fire in central Arkansas, witnesses say a tornado touchdown near the capital of Little Rock. Take a look.</p><p>The cloud caught on dashcam sending sparks flying. It sparked an inferno in a mobile home community. The sparks that you see there are probably, according to a Saline County spokesperson, electrical transformers going up there as the lines touched and a short circuit occurred. A lot of homes were damaged there. Many people went running for shelter as winds tore roofs off of homes and trees out of the ground.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've seen this man's house, the roof is totally gone off his house. It's flattened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Even National Weather Service forecasters got into a bunker as the storm roared by. Our Rob Marciano is standing by with extreme weather on the move right now. Because this storm system didn't just dissipate as it went through Little Rock, it's on to more places.</p><p>Rob, where is it headed?</p><p>ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Well, we've got a number of severe thunderstorm watches that are in effect this morning stretching from Texas all the way into parts of Tennessee. Let's take you to four of them to be exact with all of them going into effect until 10:00, 11:00 Local time this morning.</p><p>We zoom into one particular shot that has me a little bit worried just north of Austin. This is a severe thunderstorm with a severe thunderstorm warning attached to it. It is heading to the east at 45 miles an hour, and folks in central Williamson County, Texas, are under the gun with this particular cell just north of Austin on Highway 35.</p><p>Everything is staying for the most part south of Dallas. But if you do live south of Dallas you're getting hit with some heavy thunderstorms. And also, south of Little Rock that's good news, but we do have flooding concerns for most of the state of Arkansas at the moment.</p><p>Nashville just got hammered with some storms. This line looking pretty rough heading toward Murphysboro (ph) and down the I-40 corridor, heading eastward at a pretty rapid pace. As mentioned, we've got a wide swath of action here, all of which is heading over an area that has seen a tremendous amount of rainfall over the last three weeks. So flash flood watches and warnings are posted as far east as western Tennessee and as far south as the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>A widely encompassing storm, and it does stretch all the way to the northeast, and you folks will be seeing some rainfall there today as well. John, back up to you.</p><p>ROBERTS: Rob, how far does the potential for tornadoes extend this morning?</p><p>MARCIANO: Well, right now, there are no tornado watches out. That doesn't mean that a tornado can't drop out of one of these severe thunderstorms. That's why we're watching that particular storm just north of Austin. But at the moment, we don't expect as much severe weather today as what we saw last night. We certainly hope that holds true.</p><p>ROBERTS: That's a good thing, but still plenty of airport disruptions, I'm sure, because there are thunderstorms moving into a lot of heavily populated areas.</p><p>Rob Marciano for us this morning. Rob, thanks. We'll check back with you soon.</p><p>For the most politics in the morning now, and the race to raise cash. The Democratic campaigns released fund-raising numbers for the month of March. Barack Obama raised more than $40 million last month, twice what Hillary Clinton took in during the same period. So far this year, Obama has raised a total of $131 million compared to Hillary Clinton's nearly $70 million.</p><p>And a sign that Hillary Clinton's superdelegate support could slip if she doesn't start putting up the numbers. Two of Clinton's supporters, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine and Congressman Jack Murtha of Pennsylvania, are both saying that she has to beat Barack Obama in the popular vote to have any chance at winning the party's nomination. And Murtha comes from that all-important prize on April 22nd, as we said, Pennsylvania.</p><p>A call for a nationwide discussion on race this morning from the parent denomination of Barack Obama's church in Chicago. Leaders with the United Church of Christ are asking their 10,000 pastors to conduct what's being called a sacred conversation next month. It follows the outrage generated by comments from Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the former pastor of Trinity Church.</p><p>The president of the United Church of Christ, Reverend John Thomas, spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REV. JOHN THOMAS, PRESIDENT, UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST: I think we saw a caricature and a stereotype not only of Reverend Wright but the black church. And as a result, the conversation on race has not been sacred but profoundly ugly and unhelpful. And that's why on this anniversary of Dr. King's famous speech before his assassination, we're calling for a sacred conversation on race that we think can achieve and move us toward his challenge to make America a better place.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: How do you see that conversation unfolding? I mean, you're calling for a conversation in churches on a given day. What do you want people to talk about? What is the conversation?</p><p>THOMAS: Part of the reason that this conversation is so difficult is that we often are unwilling to be deeply honest with one another, that we view one another simply through a lens of caricature or stereotype. So we're calling for a conversation where people in a context of trust and respect begin to be more honest with one another, to share their fears, their hopes, their anxieties, their anger. This is not going to be an easy conversation. Sacred conversations can be profoundly difficult, and sometimes they can be loud, but they're important for us, and we know that it's only a beginning on May 18th. That's the opening part of the conversation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Obama's church has received threats since Wright's comments came to light. It is the country's largest United Church of Christ congregation.</p><p>Hillary Clinton and <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>will both be in Memphis today for ceremonies honoring the 40th anniversary of the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. But last night, Hillary Clinton showed off her lighter side during an appearance on \"The Tonight Show.\"</p><p>Clinton walked out with Leno's band playing the theme song from \"Rocky\" jumping off of her comments earlier in the week where she compared herself to the fictional fighter. Clinton, then, went on to make fun of her recent comments about her 1996 trip to Bosnia as First Lady.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is so great to be here. You know, I was worried I wasn't going to make it.</p><p>JAY LENO, HOST, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO\": Oh.</p><p>CLINTON: Yes, I was pinned down by sniper fire.</p><p>LENO: Really?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Clinton and Leno also had some fun with her \"It's 3:00 a.m.\" campaign commercials. Leno said it's got to be tough handling all those middle of the night emergencies.</p><p>Seven minutes after the hour. Alina Cho here now with other stories new this morning. She can make fun of that.</p><p>CHO: Yes, she can. The lighting is great on Jay Leno, by the way. It set the mood very well. All right.</p><p>New this morning. Good morning, everybody.</p><p>A Virginia Tech-style plot police say they discovered online, and they say it led them to a 20-year-old with a stash of automatic rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Police in Homestead, Florida, say Calin Chi Wong was threatening to stage an attack similar to the one at Virginia Tech nearly a year ago that killed 32 students.</p><p>Police say Wong had more weapons than most local SWAT teams, including four AK-47s and body piercing ammunition. Wong has been charged with making written threats to kill. He was released on bond. Well, runways are back open at Kennedy International Airport in New York this morning. The landing gear of a small plane collapsed last night, and that plane skidded off the runway and into the grass. The airport closed down all but one runway last night leading to some delays, of course. One person was slightly hurt.</p><p>Explosive testimony about safety in the skies and about the agency that's supposed to ensure it. The founder of Southwest Airlines testified before a Congressional committee that Southwest made a mistake when it allowed planes to fly that should have been grounded. Lawmakers also heard from two FAA safety inspectors. One of them says he tried to raise a flag about missed safety checks, but managers at the FAA blocked him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOBBY BOUTRIS, FAA INSPECTOR: My experience, I believe, the priority of the regional office is damage control, and I see no interest in accountability or doing the right thing. At the end of the investigation, no matter what evidence shows, it's disregarded by the division management team who cherry picked the information from the investigation reports. And while looking at the big picture, they apply band aids instead of fixing the root of the problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHO: Lawmakers now plan to call the FAA in on a regular basis to see what kind of progress it's making to improve its inspection program. And stay tuned because coming up at 7:30, in less than a half hour, we're going to talk to the acting FAA administrator about just how safe the skies are.</p><p>We have a consumer alert to tell you about. A government report says Americans are being ripped off in record numbers by online scams. Records from the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center show that Internet crimes topped $240 million last year. That's actually up $40 million from two years ago.</p><p>The Feds say many of the crime cases involve pet scams, online dating fraud, and scammers trying to profit from natural disasters like that I-35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis last year. The report also found that men were more likely to be scammed than women.</p><p>Forty years ago today, civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. You're looking live there at the King Center in Atlanta and the reflecting pool, as we widen out that shot. Several events are planned today including visits by presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and <person><nameText>John McCain.</nameText></person></p><p>King was shot on a Memphis balcony back in 1968. His death tore a hole in the hearts of several civil rights leaders and Americans really. Four decades later, King's work continues. Yesterday, lawmakers honored his legacy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER: Dr. King possessed a voice of hope so powerful that it shook and shattered walls of oppression and lifted the spirits of the downtrodden and the denied.</p><p>SEN. HARRY REID (D), MAJORITY LEADER: Our responsibility is to continue his dream with courage, with hard work, so that we can, as he said, make our old world a new world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHO: And a programming note, join CNN this afternoon for all the King commemorations live from Memphis. We're also tuning in with radio show hosts around the country for what we're calling \"Conversations With Black America.\" Catch it live on CNN at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time or logon to CNN.com/live.</p><p>And finally, a letter written by Abraham Lincoln has set a record at auction. It happened at Sotheby's. President Lincoln wrote it in response to the \"Little People's Petition\" in 1864. School kids were asking the then-president to free slave children, and Lincoln actually wrote back.</p><p>He said, \"While I have not the power to grant all they ask, I trust they will remember that God has.\" The letter, by the way, sold for $3.4 million at Sotheby's to a private American collector who was bidding by phone. So interesting.</p><p>ROBERTS: Let me just come back to this guy in Homestead, this guy, Wong, who had been making threats to stage another Virginia Tech- style massacre. Had an arsenal that you described as being more than SWAT teams.</p><p>CHO: More than the local SWAT teams.</p><p>ROBERTS: And armor-piercing rounds, which are illegal in the state of Florida, and he bonded out for $7,500?</p><p>CHO: It's a big question why. It's a big question why. Of course, with Virginia Tech, there were some mental problems that were revealed. Not sure what's coming out yet about that, but we're still watching the details. It is very interesting that he was released on bond.</p><p>ROBERTS: I think this is a story we need to dig a little deeper on. Alina Cho for us this morning. Alina, thanks.</p><p>CHO: You bet.</p><p>ROBERTS: Twelve minutes after the hour. One of the hottest states in the mortgage meltdown is Arizona. It's the home base of <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>where even million dollars homes are going under. We've got a closer look at the candidate's plans to fix the housing crisis coming up.</p><p>How to help your doctor help you. Advice to get the most out of your next trip to the doctor's office. That's ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p>ROBERTS: Fifteen minutes after the hour. More signs of a troubled economy to tell you about. This time the tech industry is in the spotlight, and our Veronica De La Cruz joins us now. What companies are we talking about?</p><p>VERONICA DE LA CRUZ, CNN INTERNET CORRESPONDENT: Oh, wow. You know, some big name companies, John. Dell, Microsoft, Google all looking to cut costs by downsizing. Again, Dell CEO, they're saying the company will cut more than 8,800 jobs previously announced to stay more competitive.</p><p>Moving on to Motorola, 2,600 employees around the globe. The company has been having a rough time with their cell phone entity especially with Apple's iPhone taking such a huge chunk of the high- end market. And then, getting you to Google, 300 employees there from newly acquired DoubleClick, Inc. -- 300 employees. It may not sound like a lot, but it's actually about a quarter of that company. Google bought DoubleClick in March for $3 billion plus.</p><p>You know, also in the headlines this morning, we touched a little on it already. But scammers have been using e-mail to con trusting Americans. Victims have been falling for it time and time again. This new government report out shows money lost from Internet crime hit a new high last year, nearly $240 million. The report shows scams involving pets, check cashing schemes, and online dating all are on the rise.</p><p>The report also shows that more than 75 percent of the perpetrators were male. Men were scammed out of more money than women were, on average about $200 more. And almost half of the victims were between the ages of 30 and 49 years old.</p><p>So, John, the first time this report was released was 2001. $18 million lost that year. $240 million, 2007.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROBERTS: Any idea why men are more vulnerable to being scammed than women?</p><p>DE LA CRUZ: You know, honestly, I would say that men ...</p><p>ROBERTS: Other than the history of life between men and women causes women to be more suspicious.</p><p>DE LA CRUZ: I would say that men probably use the Internet more to shop and are probably, you know, doing more when it comes to online banking. You know, I talked to a lot of my female friends who are still scared to give out their personal information online.</p><p>ROBERTS: Yes. Guys, got to get sharp. Veronica, thanks very much.</p><p>So you've been to the doctor's office and you know that there's ... whoops. Where are we here? Where do we go?</p><p>You've been to the doctor's office. You know that there's precious little time for doctor-patient interaction. So what can you do to maximize the time that you spend with your doctor and actually help your doctor take care of you?</p><p>CNN's Elizabeth Cohen at the medical update desk for us now. Elizabeth, why should a patient help the doctor take care of the patient? I thought the doctor was supposed to do all of that?</p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Right, John, it does seem a little bit backwards. But the way that it works these days is your doctor is so rushed sometimes, it really behooves you to help your doctor because you're going to be the one who benefits in the end. Help your doctor make the most out of the time that you do have together. So we have a list on CNN.com/health. Let's take a look at two of the things that you can do to help your doctor help you.</p><p>First of all, arrive at your appointment with a list of medications, so you're not sitting there thinking, saying to the doctor, I think I take a pink pill maybe once a day, maybe twice. Can't remember the name. Don't do that. Just hand him a list of medications. It's much easier.</p><p>Also, bring in your list of your top three concerns. Now, you might be thinking well, I know why I'm there. I mean, I made the appointment. You know what, when you're in that exam room in that funny little gown that opens in all sorts of weird places, you forget things.</p><p>You get sort of flustered and you're not always going to remember every point you wanted to bring up with the doctor. Have it in writing. It's a whole lot easier.</p><p>Now, if you want to see some more of our tips about how to help your doctor help you, go to CNN.com/health. You can click on it. It's the main story on our page there, and it will give you five ways to help your doctor help you -- John.</p><p>ROBERTS: Elizabeth, you know, many times people not only have one doctor, but say that they got some condition that they're seeing multiple specialists for. What do they do to get that whole team working together?</p><p>COHEN: John, what they have to do is you have to figure early on that you are the captain of the team. You are the glue that holds that team together. Unfortunately, doctors are notorious for not talking to one another.</p><p>So when you finish with one appointment with Dr. Smith, say, Dr. Smith, can you please send me a list of your notes from this appointment so when I go to see Dr. Jones next month, I can just hand them to him. You have the paper in hand because otherwise that paper may never reach your second doctor.</p><p>ROBERTS: Elizabeth Cohen for us this morning on the medical update desk in Atlanta. Elizabeth, thanks.</p><p>COHEN: Thanks.</p><p>ROBERTS: Some good tips for us this morning.</p><p>Alina's got the results of an interesting poll about the way Americans are viewing the country and the direction.</p><p>CHO: Yes.</p><p>ROBERTS: What do you got?</p><p>CHO: Yes, thanks, John. And Americans should listen up because this is important. Eight out of every 10 Americans now think the country is headed in the wrong direction. That's according to the latest \"New York Times\"/CBS poll that's asking that question. Eighty- one percent of people say we're on the wrong track. That's the most since they started taking that poll in the early 1990s.</p><p>And that brings us to this morning's \"Quick Vote\" question. What do you think is the primary reason you think the country is on the wrong track like so many people say?</p><p>Right now, 51 percent say Iraq. A slight majority. Twenty-two percent say the economy. Twenty-one percent say political gridlock. Two percent say the state of health care. Five percent say the state of education.</p><p>Cast your vote at CNN.com/am. Of course, we'll continue to tally your votes throughout the morning.</p><p>We're also looking for your thoughts online. Didn't see a choice on that \"Quick Vote\" that you like? Think something else is driving the country off track? Well, e-mail us at CNN.com/email. We're going to read some of your e-mails, and we'll have the first tally of the votes later this hour -- John.</p><p>ROBERTS: I would imagine we'll probably going to get some pretty interesting commentary on that particular question.</p><p>Well, what goes up must come down. Phoenix was once one of the hottest housing markets in the country. Now, it's a hotbed for foreclosures. How <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>is handling the housing mess in his home state. That's coming up next on AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p>ROBERTS: Twenty-three minutes after the hour. The economy is issue number one with American voters, and the housing crisis is hitting home on the campaign trail. One of the nation's hottest spots in the mortgage meltdown is Phoenix, Arizona, the home base for Senator <person><nameText>John McCain. </nameText></person>Phoenix had the 14th highest foreclosure rate in the nation in February. During that month, 2,500 homes were foreclosed.</p><p>McCain told us here in AMERICAN MORNING that he supports the Senate bill designed to offer relief.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>JOHN MCCAIN </nameText></person>(R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The first priority is to help those people, those four to six million people, who are badly in danger of losing their homes who did nothing wrong. And this package in the Senate, I think, would have a significant beneficial effect.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Ed Lavandera is in McCain's home state of Arizona. He joins us this morning with a little bit more on what McCain might do as well, Ed, to try to fix the housing crisis. Good morning to you.</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, John. We know several years ago investors started moving into Arizona, buying up property all over the place. And as you mentioned today, the state has the fourth highest foreclosure rate in the country. The real estate bubble here has burst, so it's a good place to study how presidential candidate <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>has handled the crisis in his home state.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): It seems like the entire state of Arizona is for sale. There are more than 57,000 homes on the market in the Phoenix area. One local realtor estimates only 4,000 have sold in the last month.</p><p>Foreclosure listings are growing. Home prices are dropping. Housing experts say it will take at least a year for the market to settle.</p><p>JAY BUTLER, ARIZONA REALTY EXPERT: The issue is who do you turn to? And in some instances, you want to turn to government, but it doesn't necessarily have the solutions.</p><p>LAVANDERA (on camera): In Arizona, you take the mortgage crisis and you mix it in with a weakening economy and you find homes like this one. Two years ago, public records show this house sold for $3.7 million. Today, it's listed as a foreclosure selling for $1.2 million.</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): While the mortgage meltdown pummels Arizona, you won't find this state's senior senator advocating for sweeping help from the federal government.</p><p>MCCAIN: And it's not the duty of government to bailout and reward those who act irresponsibly.</p><p>LAVANDERA: McCain's aides say the presidential candidate prefers a judicious and targeted response. In the last year, he supported stricter guidelines for loaning money and the Mortgage Forgiveness Act, which keeps homeowners facing foreclosure from paying some taxes if they can refinance their home. One Arizona political columnist says McCain has not talked much about the mortgage crisis and that's surprising.</p><p>ROBERT ROBB, COLUMNIST, \"ARIZONA REPUBLIC\": He seems to be setting up the general election very much as a contest between those who think government ought to do a lot more, and those who think that maybe government ought to step back a minute and be pretty selective and not rush to judgment.</p><p>LAVANDERA: In the meantime, another for sale sign is planted in the desert.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAVANDERA: And, of course, the Democratic presidential candidates have been taking a lot of criticism of McCain over the last week or so, after McCain explained kind of his philosophy on how to handle this crisis. If you take a closer look at the foreclosure rates in Arizona, we get one in every 264 households that have been foreclosed on right now. That's according to Realty Track. That's up 210 percent from this time last year.</p><p>Then you look at the home states of Obama and Clinton. In Illinois, one in every 587 households. That's up 32 percent from last year. And in New York, one in almost 15 households has been foreclosed on, and that's up about 15 percent from this time last year -- John.</p><p>ROBERTS: And growing pressure on lawmakers and the presidential candidates who are all facing election this November to do something about it. Ed Lavandera for us this morning, Paradise Valley, Arizona, the place to be. Ed, thanks.</p><p>You're watching the most news in the morning. Caught on tape, a cloud of fire. A tornado sends sparks flying igniting parts of central Arkansas. We'll have a live update on the rescue and cleanup effort.</p><p>And we're also tracking more extreme weather that you're going to want to know about coming up.</p><p>The cash keeps on flowing into Barack Obama's campaign coffers as he takes aim at Hillary Clinton's lead in Pennsylvania. Our John Dickerson with some campaign analysis when AMERICAN MORNING returns.</p><p>ROBERTS: It's Friday the 4th of April. Thanks very much for being with us on this AMERICAN MORNING. John Roberts along with Ali Velshi and Alina Cho. Kiran is off today.</p><p>We got some breaking news to tell you about this morning as people in Arkansas wake up to see the destruction that a tornado left behind. At least one tornado ripped through central Arkansas near the capital of Little Rock. It sparked a fire that spread to several trailer homes and police say that it injured four people and sent residents running.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everything was tore up. Doors were torn off the buildings, people's house, their roofs were taken off. I felt the wind literally almost take me off my feet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Powerful stuff this morning. Rob Marciano standing by with more on this extreme weather which is on the move right now. Rob, this is a pretty substantial storm system.</p><p>MARCIANO: Yes, really stretching its legs here, John. And we got a number of watch boxes out. The system is felt really, there's a number of pieces of energy flowing in the upper levels of the atmosphere that is just stretching this thing out and making it a several-day and several-state long event, all the way from New England and back to central Texas.</p><p>And we have a number of watch boxes out. These yellow watch boxes are severe thunderstorm watch boxes issued by the storms predictions center, meaning that severe thunderstorms are likely within these areas. And right now, we've got four of them. Most of them in effect until 10:00 and 11:00 local time.</p><p>All right. Let's do a couple of these and talk about what kind of action we're seeing right now. We do have a severe thunderstorm watch out or warning out for eastern parts of Williams County, Texas. This is just north of Boston. This cell has been holding together for the past couple of hours and has some heavy rains and gusty winds and significant hail and it's moving quickly to the east at 30 to 40 miles an hour.</p><p>North into Dallas, we're seeing most of the action south of Dallas-Ft. Worth metropolitan area, but no doubt DFW will have some delays today. Heavier rains stretching into Arkansas. This is where we saw the tornado last night. Right now, we're just heavy rain, but that's not good news either because for the past 2 1/2, 3 weeks heavy rain has plagued that part of the state there. They're in a flash flood warning right now in effect for the next couple of hours.</p><p>Heavy thunderstorms rolling through Nashville and then moving quickly off to the east, and off towards the northeast we're seeing some rain from New York up through Bridgeport, Connecticut, and through Boston as well as the storm continues to stretch out and affect a whole swath of the eastern part of the country.</p><p>John, back up to you.</p><p>ROBERTS: Rob Marciano keeping a close eye for us this morning. Rob, appreciate it. Thanks.</p><p>MARCIANO: You got it.</p><p>ROBERTS: Now to politics and another campaign windfall for Barack Obama. The candidate raised $40 million in March, double what Hillary Clinton took in. And Obama is spending it in Pennsylvania where he is closing the gap on Clinton with the primary just two weeks and four days from now.</p><p>Our John Dickerson, CNN political analyst and chief political correspondent for slate.com joins us from Cleveland this morning. John, what do you attribute this disparity in fund-raising on the part of Barack Obama to?</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, he's been able to grab a whole bunch of people. He's just got more actual donors, and he's been tapping them time and time again. They haven't given him the big donations. That's more typical of the Clinton donor, but Obama has people who give in small increments, so he can keep going back to them each time.</p><p>ROBERTS: So he keeps going back to them again and again and again. He's got a pad of $20 million over Hillary Clinton for the month of March. Can he effectively spend that in Pennsylvania and narrow the gap. He's made some inroads there, he's not as far behind as he was but in most polls he's still behind by double digits.</p><p>DICKERSON: That's right. He's made a little bit of inroads in Pennsylvania. He spent a lot of time registering new voters, trying to get new folks to the polls. He wants to drive up his numbers in those areas where he's strong. Money will help with some of that.</p><p>He might also be using that money in the later contest, North Carolina is a place everybody is now focusing on. So in Pennsylvania all of that money may not help from today forward, but it certainly has helped when he's raised it in getting him to where he is now.</p><p>ROBERTS: Hillary Clinton, a couple of days ago the story came out that in trying to convince Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico to support her, she allegedly said to him, Obama can't win. She was asked about that comment yesterday.</p><p>Let's listen to what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: I don't talk about private conversations. I can win. I know I can win. That's why I do this every day. And that's what my campaign is about. I'm in it to win it, and I intend to do just that. It's a no.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: So she says that's a no, which people originally took to mean that's a no, I didn't say that, but her campaign came out and clarified to say, no, the no was in relation to not talking about private conversations. But even if she did say it to Bill Richardson, Obama can't win, that guy can't win, you got to vote for that, is that unusual?</p><p>DICKERSON: Well, it is a little unusual. The reason she was doing all of that fast dancing in that clip and the reason may sound a little confusing is what she doesn't want to say in public on camera is Obama can't win because if Obama does win and she is either on the ticket or campaigning for him, that's an ad that <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>can run against Obama.</p><p>You know, Hillary Clinton said he can't win, but the fact is as you point out, the Clinton campaign has been arguing for months that Obama is essentially fundamentally flawed. He can't win among certain constituencies and he can't win in these big states. Now, they don't want to say it out loud, of course, but it is the message of the campaign.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right. John Dickerson for us this morning in Cleveland. John, thanks very much.</p><p>Thirty-five minutes after the hour. Ali Velshi here now minding your business. And we did something on this last year and you had a great breakdown on it. The price of corn going up again, and just how much of everything that we consume or use involves corn?</p><p>VELSHI: Well, you know, we talk about issue number one, and we often think it has got to do with those credit crunch and housing crisis. But fundamentally as we broke it down, Americans have told us in our polling that, in fact, it is inflation that is the number one concern. And often we associate that with gasoline, but corn plays very heavily into this whole thing.</p><p>First of all, several years ago we made some decisions about how corn is going to be used to make ethanol, which is added to our gasoline. Now, a number of people think while that was meant to reduce our dependency on crude oil, what it does is it take what is fundamentally a food source and makes it into a gasoline source. That's caused corn to go up. And yesterday, we had a record on corn hitting $6 a bushel. That was a fairly big increase in the price of corn.</p><p>Now, the other thing is because we're using all of this land to buy corn, it's causing wheat, sorghum, soybeans, all those other things to become more expensive. It's also causing animal feed to become more expensive which is increasing the price of dairy and chicken and beef and things like that. And when you put all that together, there's an index that tracks commodities. Now, this includes oil but this is the Dow Jones Commodity Index over the last year.</p><p>Take a look at the leap in prices on that. That's a combination of your oil, your corn, your wheat, all of those expenses, and that means inflation to the average American which goes full circle to the fact that issue number one to most people is, in fact, the fact that they are getting less for the same dollar that they were spending last year. And this is about the kitchen table.</p><p>So you're paying to get the corn or whatever food is being farmed, the diesel used on those farms, the diesel that used to truck it there, and the energy used to store it, and then frankly you're just paying for the basic commodity.</p><p>CHO: Well, let's not forget that high fructose corn syrup used in diet soda.</p><p>VELSHI: That's right. Everything that is sweetened these days. That was in the day when corn was cheap and plentiful.</p><p>CHO: Right.</p><p>VELSHI: So, we changed that. Now, corn is not cheap nor plentiful, and that's -- this is a major issue that the administration is going to have to deal with. We have put a lot of pressure on corn. It's a food.</p><p>ROBERTS: The only bright spot in all of this is that all of these farmers, not talking about ...</p><p>VELSHI: Corn farmers.</p><p>ROBERTS: We're not talking about farming companies but we're talking about all these farmers who were growing corn and losing money.</p><p>VELSHI: Now they're making money.</p><p>ROBERTS: Finally, making some money.</p><p>VELSHI: The problem is you're making farmers who weren't making money and other things who are growing corn and that's why we're not making the same amount of wheat and soybeans and things like that.</p><p>CHO: So, it's a wash.</p><p>VELSHI: We do need to balance it out somehow. It's an issue.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right. Ali Velshi for us this morning. Ali, thanks.</p><p>New questions about how safe we all are when we fly this morning. This after two FAA inspectors say they were pressured to keep quiet about safety problems, threatened even. Coming up, we are going to talk with the acting FAA administrator and what is being done to keep you and your family safe. And how we got into this situation in the first place?</p><p>And 40 years later, the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. lives on. A look at how life has changed in Memphis, coming up next.</p><p>ROBERTS: Is the cozy relationship between the airlines and the FAA putting you at risk? That's what two whistle blowers told a congressional committee. During their testimony yesterday the two said they were pressured to ignore problems at Southwest Airlines.</p><p>One of the safety inspectors getting emotional as he described the threats made against him and his family if he revealed what he knew.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUGLAS PETERS, FAA INSPECTOR: He then pointed to a picture of my family and said, again, this is what's important. I'd hate to see you jeopardize yours and her career trying to take down a couple of losers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, joining me to talk more about this is the acting FAA administrator Robert Sturgell. He is live in Washington this morning. Mr. Sturgell, good to see you. And thanks for being with us today.</p><p>The treatment of these whistle blowers, Bobby Boutris and Doug Peters, by their superiors, threatened for pressuring on the issue of safety violations. What is the flying public to think about that?</p><p>ROBERT STURGELL, ACTING FAA ADMINISTRATOR: Well, good morning, John.</p><p>Listen, I'm not going to make any excuses for what went on in that office in our Southwest region. It's obvious that some legitimate concerns were being raised for a period of time and they weren't being addressed. So, we've taken some actions. The investigation continues, and I suspect we'll take additional actions down there as well.</p><p>ROBERTS: These whistle blowers said that the FAA views airlines as customers rather than companies to be regulated. Yesterday, here on AMERICAN MORNING, we took an informal, not a scientific poll, nearly 90 percent of people thought the FAA was looking out for the airlines, not looking out for passengers who fly on the airlines. I mean, you take those things together it's a rather stinging indictment of the FAA.</p><p>STURGELL: Well, make no mistake our number one customers are the flying public and the taxpayers. We don't lose sight of that. When we find things, you know, regardless of what you label it, when we find things, we fix them.</p><p>I think what people need to understand is that the system consists of a variety of oversight mechanism, not just inspections, a regulatory role, an enforcement role, but also partnership programs and voluntary disclosure programs with the carriers that are very important part of this system. They allow people to bring safety data to us and allow us to take measures proactively. Without those kinds of systems, we're going to drive safety issues underground, and that's a result the public cannot afford.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right. How did this situation get to the point that it did in that office?</p><p>STURGELL: Well, again, as I said, I'm not going to make any excuses for that office and for what went on. We are taking action, and there will be additional actions taken.</p><p>ROBERTS: Right but do you know how it got there in the first place?</p><p>STURGELL: Well, we have the testimony. We have an investigative file, and again the investigation is ongoing.</p><p>ROBERTS: Right.</p><p>STURGELL: So I suspect there will be additional actions down there.</p><p>ROBERTS: Now, Calvin Scoville, who is the inspector general for the Department of Transportation yesterday spoke out on all of this. He agreed with the two whistle blowers that there seemed to be a cozy relationship between the FAA inspectors and supervisors locally and Southwest Airlines.</p><p>He went on to suggest yesterday that we need an independent oversight organization for the FAA, which would appear to be to a lot of people to be very troubling because it's the FAA that's supposed to be the oversight organization. So what does it say about the FAA if you need oversight of the overseers?</p><p>STURGELL: Well, we've been working very closely with the inspector general throughout this process, and I think the point I would make here is that over the last couple of weeks we've also initiated our own special emphasis audit throughout the country, and that audit has produced a compliance rate that we found of about 99 percent.</p><p>So we've got some areas that we need to continue to work on, but I think overall it shows that the system is working and it's working as designed. And, you know, I can only tell people to look at the data. Look at the accident rates. See how safe the system is, and I think that's proof of the system working. Can it be better? Yes, it can be better.</p><p>ROBERTS: On that point, let me just play a little bit more of what Bobby Boutris, one of the whistle blower inspector said yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOUTRIS: I am very concerned because the safety issues affect the lives of the flying public. And instead of being advocates for safety, some people are still trying to muddy the water by down playing the serious safety issue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: It's true, as you say, Mr. Sturgell that there were no fatal accidents in the airline industry last year, but if what Bobby Boutris says is true, is the potential out there going forward in the future for catastrophic accidents?</p><p>STURGELL: The system is not perfect, John, but safety is our number one priority, and we've got thousands and thousands of people, not just at the FAA, not just our controllers, our inspectors, our mechanics or engineers, but tens of thousands of people in this industry who are out there every day making this system safe for the flying public. ROBERTS: James Oberstar who chaired the committee yesterday up there on Capitol Hill suggested that the FAA needs a top to bottom house cleaning. Would you agree with that?</p><p>STURGELL: Well, I think everybody is passionate about this issue. My job is to stay focused on the mission, and the mission is the safety and efficiency of the system. So that's what I'm going to do.</p><p>ROBERTS: Robert Sturgell, the acting administrator of the FAA. Thanks for being with us this morning. Appreciate it.</p><p>STURGELL: Thank you.</p><p>ROBERTS: Still ahead, the whole reason that Martin Luther King went to Memphis 40 years ago. He was marching with striking sanitation workers. Well, we found one of them, and we'll hear how he thinks America has changed after Dr. King's death, next, on AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p>ROBERTS: Coming up now on ten minutes to the top of the hour. This morning we are uncovering America. A look at the faces and the stories of our changing nation. Today Dr. King's dream 40 years after his death. He went to Memphis to march with sanitation workers on strike from a job made even more difficult by the racism and prejudice that they faced every day.</p><p>CNN's Don Lemon is in Memphis for the 40th anniversary talking with sanitation workers who were on the job back then and now. Don joins us this morning. Good morning, Don.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN, ANCHOR: Yes. Hey, good morning to you. Don't go anywhere, John. I want to ask you this. Do you know this name? Echo Cole? Do you know this one?</p><p>ROBERTS: They were ...</p><p>LEMON: Robert Walker.</p><p>ROBERTS: They were the sanitation workers that sparked the whole thing.</p><p>LEMON: Absolutely and how much do you hear about them? You don't hear that much and that's why I really made these because reading up on history and knowing about this story, John, as we all do, you know those names but not many people know the names.</p><p>With a driving rainstorm, two African-American sanitation workers, they couldn't fit in the cab of the garbage truck so they had to ride in the back of the truck between the compressor and the outside. The compressor malfunctioned, and that crushed them to death. And that's really -- that was the last straw with the sanitation workers. They went on strike, and that's why Dr. King came to Memphis, Tennessee. We wanted to find out if things have changed 40 years, what these sanitation workers were fighting for? If anything has changed in those years, we spoke to a man who was there 40 years ago and his son who now works for the Sanitation Department.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAMES MANUEL: That was the worst moment I had on the job.</p><p>LEMON: James Manuel has come a long way since the 1960s when he first became a sanitation worker in segregated Memphis, Tennessee.</p><p>MANUEL: You work outside in 100 degrees. 90-something degrees.</p><p>LEMON: It's hot, smelly, the garbage is leaking on you.</p><p>MANUEL: Right. It was tough. That's all I can say.</p><p>LEMON: And it was dangerous. Back then Manuel says people didn't put their garbage out on the curb. He and his fellow workers, all black, had to retrieve it from backyards. He said the company didn't provide gloves or uniforms. How much money were you making then?</p><p>MANUEL: When I started I think I was making $1.33 an hour.</p><p>LEMON: $1.33 an hour?</p><p>MANUEL: Right.</p><p>LEMON: To pick up garbage and half of it is leaking on you.</p><p>MANUEL: Right.</p><p>LEMON: The walking buzzards as they were called had to carry the leaking 60-gallon filthy tubs on their shoulders or heads and then they had to ride in the back of the truck with the garbage to the landfill.</p><p>MANUEL: You could sit on top of the garbage to the landfill or whatever.</p><p>LEMON: Really? People did that?</p><p>MANUEL: Yes.</p><p>LEMON: Sit on top of the garbage?</p><p>MANUEL: Yes.</p><p>LEMON: That's how two sanitation workers died in February of 1968. To escape a driving rainstorm, they huddled in the back with the putrefying garbage like the workers in this picture. They were accidentally crushed by a malfunctioning trash compressor.</p><p>After that, sanitation workers went on strike and Dr. King came to Memphis. It was here he gave his last speech on the evening before an assassin's bullet took his life on the balcony of the now infamous Lorraine Motel. James Manuel had attended the rally.</p><p>MANUEL: I feel bad about that. The whole Memphis feels bad about that.</p><p>LEMON: Now 40 years later, Manuel's son, James Jr., also works for the Sanitation Department.</p><p>JAMES MANUEL, JR., SANITATION WORKER: I admire and respect him, he's my father. He took care of me when I couldn't take care of myself. He taught me right from wrong. And he does -- the goals I want to follow in his footsteps become a supervisor.</p><p>LEMON: Today the working conditions, while not perfect, are better, and this time young and old, black and white, are working together.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEMON: As we come out live now, room 306 of the Lorraine Motel, that's the balcony of course, the infamous balcony, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lost his life. And John, 40 years later, as we said in our story, the conditions aren't perfect, but they are better, but still at least now they have gloves and they have uniforms. And rode with them yesterday and they were out passing them, giving them rain suits to make sure they didn't get wet in the rain.</p><p>But also now, John, they don't have to work in the rain if they don't want to. They have that option. But still 40 years later, they don't have a pension, so they're fighting for some of the things they were fighting for even when Dr. King came to town.</p><p>ROBERTS: Fascinating story for us this morning, Don. And it's a real reminder of the level of injustice back then in the 1960s. As you said, it has gotten somewhat better in the last 40 years, but still a lot of issue with labor across this country that needs to be addressed. Don Lemon for us this morning. Look forward to your coverage throughout the day, my friend. Thanks.</p><p>LEMON: Thanks, John.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right. See you soon.</p><p>And join CNN this afternoon for all of the King commemorations live from Memphis. We are also tuning in with radio show hosts around the country for \"Conversations with black America.\" Catch it live on CNN, 1:00 p.m. Eastern or logon to cnn.com/live.</p><p>Spring is usually the best time of year to sell your house, but will the current housing crisis make this spring a cold one on the home front? Our Gerri Willis will tell us what to expect. That's coming up.</p><p>Pus, an 18-year-old boy gets bitten by a shark and lives to tell about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He shook his head, wouldn't let go for a second. I tried to pull my foot out. And finally, he just let go.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Wow. We'll tell you how he's doing after that close encounter. That's ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, here is a pretty staggering figure or statistic in an election year. Eight out of every 10 Americans think the country is heading in the wrong direction. That's according to the latest \"New York Times\"/CBS news poll asking that question. Eighty- one percent of people say the country is on the wrong track. That is the highest percentage since they started taking that poll back in the early 1990s.</p><p>And that brings us to this morning's \"Quick Vote\" question. What do you think is the primary reason the country is on the wrong track? Right now, let's take a look. Fifty-one percent say Iraq, 25 percent say the economy, 17 percent say political gridlock, two percent say the state of health care, and five percent are pointing to the state of education.</p><p>Cast your vote for us at cnn.com/am. We'll continue to tally your votes throughout the morning. We've also been asking you for your e- mails as well. Ring in on those. Let's take a look at some of what people have been writing to us this morning.</p><p>Susan from Mount Pleasant, South Carolina says \"This is the first time in my almost 60 years I have actually considered leaving this country for good. It disgusts me.</p><p>Carol from Blackburg, Virginia says \"You've got to be kidding. The primary reason that the U.S. is on the wrong track: George W. Bush.</p><p>Steve from Seward, Nebraska writes \"This is one poll where you should have added \"all of the above.\"</p><p>See, we actually thought about that this morning but we did want people to break it down into what they thought was the primary reason. We though that everybody will just vote for \"all of the above.\"</p><p>And Michael from Lexington, Kentucky writes \"Our great nation is on the wrong track not for one single reason but a combination of several. Luckily, we are at a fork in the road and we have the opportunity to speak again as a nation in November.\"</p><p>TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.voxantshop.com\">www.voxantshop.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2008040402CNV74</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4S6V-R2J0-TWD3-11H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8299\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved. </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>April 4, 2008 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Arkansas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tornadoes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Damages</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Rev.

It may be premature to say that Toronto has won, but the new Sidewalk Labs plan unveiled Thursday is a clear sign that it has held its own.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech's efforts to drive innovation at the local level - everything from autonomous vehicles and smart transit to flexible architecture and engineered outdoor microclimates, all enabled by high-speed networks, futuristic algorithms and sensors - is forcing municipalities to rethink everything from regulatory oversight to public-realm data privacy to the complex dynamics of public-private infrastructure partnerships.</p><p>Until now, the tenor of Toronto's civic experiment with Sidewalk Labs has been less partnership and more crisis negotiation. The Google sister company's initial plan, delivered last June, was accused of overreach for its 77-hectare \"Innovative Development and Economic Acceleration\" district in response to the RFP for the five-hectare Quayside site. There was also relatively little engagement with Toronto's existing tech ecosystem, environmentalists and other key groups.</p><p>In the face of enormous pushback from government, civic leaders and Torontonians, Waterfront Toronto's new chair, Stephen Diamond, hit the reset button and changed the power dynamic. Sidewalk Labs had to scale back its ambition or the tri-government agency would walk away. Today's open letter from Waterfront Toronto makes clear that Big Tech blinked. The new version of the plan, just released, addresses the major criticisms raised since June.</p><p>Here are some key changes in the new Sidewalk Labs proposal.</p><p>Real estate: Sidewalk's role on the waterfront has shrunk from provider of advanced systems across the 77-hectare IDEA district and lead developer of Quayside and Villiers West, to the original five hectares at Quayside, and it will be required to partner with local real estate developers. Only when Quayside is successful would additional public land be considered, and then through competitive procurement.</p><p>Intellectual property: The patent pledge now offers Canadian innovators a global licence to use Sidewalk Labs Canadian patents. This is a big win for local firms looking to export urban innovations globally.</p><p>Data privacy: Sidewalk has agreed no personal information collected will leave Canada and has eliminated its proposal for an urban data trust as well as the term \"urban data.\" Waterfront Toronto would now take the lead on governance, setting up data guidelines along the line of its successful green building standards.</p><p>Fairer deal: Waterfront Toronto will receive fair market value at today's valuation for the Quayside lands, which have appreciated significantly over the past two years. The revenue-sharing from intellectual property with Waterfront Toronto has also been adjusted to be based on revenue, not profit.</p><p>Canadian participation: Sidewalk has added procurement policies to prioritize Canadian businesses. Sidewalk Labs has upped its engagement with Toronto's existing innovation hubs and intends to commission a report defining Toronto's urban innovation ecosystem with recommendations for supporting growth.</p><p>Of course, this is no done deal. There are plenty of potential stumbling blocks before this proposal is approved and set in motion.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto still must do a detailed evaluation of the reworked plan and then more public consultation. Sidewalk Labs must submit development plan applications through the city's application process. On March 31, Waterfront Toronto votes on the proposal. The City of Toronto also must approve the plan, and specifics must be approved by other levels of government. Critically, citizens need to have an ongoing, central role in the decision-making process.</p><p>But today, it seems fair to say that the revised proposal outlined in the open letter is good news.</p><p>Thanks to Diamond's leadership, Toronto is learning how to take a leadership role in negotiations with Big Tech, while Sidewalk Labs has heard and responded to Torontonians' concerns. This is clearly in the city's interest. It may also hold lessons for civic leaders elsewhere as they build their own cities of the future.</p><p>Alex Ryan is the VP of Solutions Lab, MaRS Discovery District.

It may be premature to say that Toronto has won, but the new Sidewalk Labs plan unveiled Thursday is a clear sign that the city has held its own.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech's efforts to drive innovation at the local level - data-driven technological fixes that promise (or threaten) everything from autonomous vehicles and smart transit to flexible architecture and engineered outdoor microclimates, all driven by high-speed networks, futuristic algorithms and a vast array of sensors - is forcing municipal governments to rethink everything from regulatory oversight to public realm data privacy to the complex dynamics of public-private infrastructure partnerships.</p><p>Until now, the tenor of Toronto's civic experiment with Sidewalk Labs has been less like a partnership and more like a crisis negotiation. The Google sister company's initial plan, delivered last June in a 1,524-page document, was accused of overreach for its 77-hectare \"Innovative Development and Economic Acceleration\" district in response to the RFP for the five hectare Quayside site. There was also relatively little engagement with the city's existing tech ecosystem, environmentalists, and a number of other key representatives and groups in the community.</p><p>In the face of enormous pushback from government leaders, civic leaders and Torontonians, Waterfront Toronto's new chair, Stephen Diamond, hit the reset button and changed the power dynamic. Sidewalk Labs had to scale back its ambition or the tri-government agency would walk away from the proposal.</p><p>Thursday's open letter from Waterfront Toronto makes clear that Big Tech has blinked. The new version of the plan, just released, addresses the major criticisms that have been raised since June.</p><p>Here are some key changes in the new Sidewalk Labs proposal:</p><p>Real estate: Sidewalk's role on the waterfront has shrunk from provider of advanced systems across the 77 hectare IDEA district and lead developer of Quayside and Villiers West, to the original five hectares at Quayside and will be required to partner with local real estate developers. Only when Quayside has proven successful would sale of additional public land be considered and would proceed through standard competitive procurement processes.</p><p>Intellectual property: The patent pledge now offers Canadian innovators a global licence to use Sidewalk Labs Canadian patents in their innovations. This is a big win for local innovators looking to export urban innovations globally.</p><p>Data privacy: Sidewalk has agreed no personal information collected will leave Canada and has eliminated its proposal for an urban data trust as well as the term \"urban data\" because it is unhelpful to categorize data based on where it is collected. Waterfront Toronto would now take the lead on data governance. The agency is intending to set up data standards along the line of its successful green building standards.</p><p>Fairer deal: Waterfront Toronto will receive fair market value at today's valuation for the Quayside lands, which have appreciated significantly over the past two years of planning. The revenue sharing from intellectual property with Waterfront Toronto has also been adjusted to be based on revenues, rather than profits.</p><p>Canadian participation: Sidewalk has added procurement policies to prioritize Canadian businesses. Sidewalk Labs has upped its engagement with Toronto's existing innovation hubs, and is intending to commission a report defining Toronto's urban innovation ecosystem with recommendations on how to support its growth.</p><p>Of course, this is not a done deal. There remains a long road ahead, with a lot of potential stumbling blocks, before this proposal is approved and set in motion.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto still must do a detailed evaluation of the reworked plan and more public consultation based on its evaluation. Sidewalk Labs will have to submit development plan applications through the City of Toronto's application process.</p><p>On March 31, Waterfront Toronto is scheduled to vote on the proposal. The City of Toronto also must approve the plan, and specific aspects must be approved by other levels of government. Critically, citizens need to have a meaningful and ongoing role at the centre of the decision-making process.</p><p>But today, it seems fair to say the revised proposal outlined in the open letter is good news. Thanks to Steve Diamond's leadership, Toronto is learning how to take a leadership role in negotiations with Big Tech, while Sidewalk Labs has heard and responded to the concerns of Torontonians. This is clearly in Toronto's interest. It may also hold lessons for civic leaders elsewhere as they look to build the cities of the future.</p><p>Alex Ryan is the VP of Solutions Lab, MaRS Discovery District. MaRS has worked with Sidewalk Labs on a small regulatory project on safety and pricing regulations for Autonomous Vehicles, along with working for Waterfront Toronto (with supplemental funding from Sidewalk Labs) to explore the potential of a data trust for responsible data sharing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019103156179827</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD4-5P61-JDH1-C0C8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"847\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

The Google sister company's initial plan, delivered last June in a 1,524-page document, was accused of overreach for its 77-hectare \"Innovative Development and Economic Acceleration\" district in response to the RFP for the five hectare Quayside site.

The new version of the plan, just released, addresses the major criticisms that have been raised since June.</p><p>Here are some key changes in the new Sidewalk Labs proposal:</p><p>Real estate: Sidewalk's role on the waterfront has shrunk from provider of advanced systems across the 77 hectare IDEA district and lead developer of Quayside and Villiers West, to the original five hectares at Quayside and will be required to partner with local real estate developers. Only when Quayside has proven successful would sale of additional public land be considered and would proceed through standard competitive procurement processes.</p><p>Intellectual property: The patent pledge now offers Canadian innovators a global licence to use Sidewalk Labs Canadian patents in their innovations. This is a big win for local innovators looking to export urban innovations globally.</p><p>Data privacy: Sidewalk has agreed no personal information collected will leave Canada and has eliminated its proposal for an urban data trust as well as the term \"urban data\" because it is unhelpful to categorize data based on where it is collected. Waterfront Toronto would now take the lead on data governance. The agency is intending to set up data standards along the line of its successful green building standards.</p><p>Fairer deal: Waterfront Toronto will receive fair market value at today's valuation for the Quayside lands, which have appreciated significantly over the past two years of planning. The revenue sharing from intellectual property with Waterfront Toronto has also been adjusted to be based on revenues, rather than profits.</p><p>Canadian participation: Sidewalk has added procurement policies to prioritize Canadian businesses. Sidewalk Labs has upped its engagement with Toronto's existing innovation hubs, and is intending to commission a report defining Toronto's urban innovation ecosystem with recommendations on how to support its growth.</p><p>Of course, this is not a done deal. There remains a long road ahead, with a lot of potential stumbling blocks, before this proposal is approved and set in motion.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto still must do a detailed evaluation of the reworked plan and more public consultation based on its evaluation. Sidewalk Labs will have to submit development plan applications through the City of Toronto's application process.</p><p>On March 31, Waterfront Toronto is scheduled to vote on the proposal. The City of Toronto also must approve the plan, and specific aspects must be approved by other levels of government. Critically, citizens need to have a meaningful and ongoing role at the centre of the decision-making process.</p><p>But today, it seems fair to say the revised proposal outlined in the open letter is good news. Thanks to Steve Diamond's leadership, Toronto is learning how to take a leadership role in negotiations with Big Tech, while Sidewalk Labs has heard and responded to the concerns of Torontonians.

A small excerpt from the article is below.   Given these big tech companies have strong capital positions and likely access to low-cost capital (in addition to access to proprietary customer data generated through other services, such as social media) to tailor their offerings to individual customers\u2019 preferences), the FSB notes such companies could very quickly achieve scale in financial services.  However, while big tech companies could represent a source of increased competition, their participation in financial services may not necessarily result in a more competitive market over the longer term if big tech companies were to operate with lower margins (due to cross-subsidization). In particular, the FSB notes that a greater market share of big tech may be associated with unchanged or higher concentration, along with a change in composition away from traditional players.

To maintain our connected culture during the current crisis, individuals, enterprises and big tech firms must cut down on their bandwidth usage - and the best way to do so is to reduce the use of video.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reduce\u00a0video bandwidth</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why?</p><p>The truth is that video accounted for over two-thirds of global consumer internet traffic in 2017 and has continued to grow ever since.</p><p>[ Related: An Apple-centric guide to effective (and productive) remote working  ]</p><p>In its most recent State of the Internet report, Cisco observes that an internet-enabled HD TV used to watch shows for a few hours daily generates more traffic than a whole household. In part this is because we are streaming video in 4K.</p><p>In other words, even as the internet strains to handle the demands of tens of millions of workers worldwide fortunate enough to be able to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also struggling to handle the sheer quantity of video we are all consuming.</p><p>Video is by far the biggest consumer of bandwidth, and if we're going to optimize how we make use of it, we're going to need to reduce our consumption of it.</p><p>We all need to keep working, so it makes complete sense to reduce the quantity of video-related traffic we generate - or at least take steps to mitigate it.</p><p>So, what can consumers do immediately?</p><p>Every enterprise worker is also a consumer, so these recommendations apply to everyone, whether you're a Morgan Stanley executive suddenly wondering why the brave nurses, doctors and utility staff are paid so much less than you as they face the risks of the coronavirus while you shelter in your home or if you are a proud parent cuddling your children and hoping for the best.</p><p>If two-thirds of internet traffic is video-related, it makes sense to mitigate video consumption first. And you can - with just a little inconvenience.</p><p>How to reduce streaming bandwidth consumption</p><p>If you use a streaming TV system (a smart TV, Apple TV, or such-like), you should reduce the resolution of the video you download.</p><p>While doing so will reduce your picture quality, it will also reduce the amount of data your TV set requires. If everyone who uses a streaming video system cuts quality, this should make a significant difference in terms of available bandwidth during the current crisis.</p><p>Here's what to do with an Apple TV:</p><p>Screensavers: Open Settings &gt; General &gt; Screensaver &gt; Aerial and change the Download New Videos setting to Never. This will reduce the amount of bandwidth you consume by around 600MB per instance. You may also want to prevent your photos from being downloaded to Apple TV.</p><p>TV resolution: Changing the Apple TV resolution in Audio and Video settings doesn't really change the bandwidth used. In order to reduce that bandwidth, you must open the settings for each relevant streaming app (in my case that's Amazon Prime, Netflix and TV+). \u00a0</p><p>For the TV app, set Wi-Fi playback quality to 'Good' on all the devices you use to consume video content. You'll find it impossible to adjust settings for Prime and Netflix, and this is why the EU is asking streaming video service providers to get with the program and reduce the quality of the shows they provide, in order to ensure that the internet doesn't break. Netflix, Amazon, YouTube and other providers must heed this call.</p><p>Put your social media apps on a bandwidth diet</p><p>All the social media apps (particularly Facebook) are bad citizens when it comes to auto-streaming video. Not only is this usually annoying, but it also consumes valuable bandwidth.</p><p>To reduce video bandwidth consumption on Twitter: Tap the three-dot symbol to find Twitter's settings and privacy tools. Select Data usage and enable data saver. Once you've done so, videos won't autoplay, and images will be loaded in lower quality. You will need to repeat these steps on each device you use to access the service.</p><p>To reduce video bandwidth consumption on Facebook: Facebook's settings are, as ever, stupidly complicated, which I resent. Tap the three-line icon to access your menu, scroll down to Settings (ignoring the garish blue of the app), tap this and scroll down, down, down until you find Videos and photos. Tap this and ensure Auto-play is set to never, reduce motion is off and that you aren't uploading content in HD.</p><p>I'd be interested to hear from other social media companies as to how to reduce their video bandwidth consumption. I'll add short instructions to this story.</p><p>What can enterprises do now?</p><p>Now that you have more people than ever before working from home, enterprises have a social responsibility to take stock of the quantity of bandwidth they use.</p><p>For example, following its national lock-down, Italy is experiencing a threefold increase in the use of videoconferencing and has seen a 75% increase in residential data traffic, reports the Financial Times.</p><p>Mobile networks have already shown signs of strain, though broadband seems to be holding up. However, in Spain the industry is warning consumers to ration their use and try to use land lines for voice calls.</p><p>These statistics strongly suggest there is a need to take responsibility for bandwidth consumption today as more nations across our planet are now also heading into lock-down. What enterprise, or any other form of culture, we have left after this crisis in part depends upon this.</p><p>I understand each enterprise setup is different, so providing relevant advice for everyone is beyond the scope of this piece, but some basic strategies to reduce video bandwidth consumption follow:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Don't force employees to keep an active video chat session going all through working hours. You employed your people and if you can't trust them to continue working for you even while they are at home, that reflects more on you than on them.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Examine the videoconferencing tools you use.

Tetiana Yurchenko/Shutterstock.com[1]  Courtesy ofAram Sinnreich[2], American University School of Communication[3] and Barbara Romzek[4], American University School of Public Affairs[5] As Congress and the public wrestle with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal[6], many people are now realizing the risks data collection poses to civic institutions, public discourse and individual privacy. The U.K.-based political consulting firm didn't just collect personal data from the 270,000 people[7] who used researcher Aleksandr Kogan's online personality quiz[8] - nor was the damage limited to 87 million of their friends[9]. Facebook recently revealed that nearly all[10] of its 2.2 billion users[11] have had data scraped by 'malicious[12]' people or companies. The firm itself has joined[13] calls for better privacy regulations[14]. For years, watchdogs have been warning[15] about sharing information[16] with data-collecting companies[17], firms engaged in the relatively new line of business called some academics have called 'surveillance capitalism[18].' Most casual internet users are only now realizing how easy - and common - it is for unaccountable and unknown organizations to assemble detailed digital profiles of them. </p><p>They do this by combining the discrete bits of information[19] consumers have given up to e-tailers, health sites, quiz apps and countless other digital services. As scholars of public accountability[20] and digital media systems[21], we know that the business of social media is based on extracting user data and offering it for sale[22]. There's no simple way for them to protect data as many users might expect. Like the social pollution[23] of fake news, bullying and spam that Facebook's platform spreads, the company's privacy crisis also stems from a power imbalance: Facebook knows nearly everything about its users, who know little to nothing about it. It's not enough for people to delete their Facebook accounts[24]. Nor is it likely that anyone will successfully replace it with a nonprofit alternative[25] centering on privacy, transparency and accountability[26]. Furthermore, this problem is not specific just to Facebook[27]. Other companies, including Google and Amazon, also gather and exploit extensive personal data[28], and are locked in a digital arms race[29] that we believe threatens to destroy privacy altogether. Government regulation can help Governments need to be better guardians of public welfare - including privacy. Many companies using various aspects of technology in new ways have so far avoided regulation[30] by stoking fears that rules might stifle innovation[31]. Facebook and others have often claimed that they're better at regulating themselves[32] in an ever-changing environment than a slow-moving legislative process could be. But these companies have clearly failed to regulate themselves. As Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg admitted, 'We did not think enough about the abuse[33]' potential of their data collection practices. So government regulation is both reasonable and necessary, to reduce the risks that social pollution and data abuse pose to political stability[34] and personal privacy. Considering new rules Congress is already discussing how to fight the social pollution of misleading advertising with hidden agendas. The Honest Ads Act[35] would require both buyers and sellers of online political ads to disclose more information[36]. Facebook's response to the Cambridge Analytica crisis has included switching from opposing this act to supporting it[37], and even announcing it's improving transparency[38] before being required to by law. This is a good start, but it does nothing to protect people's privacy. New rules must govern privacy policies, which today bamboozle consumers into signing away their rights. Most online sites, apps and services have extremely long documents with obscure legal language that most users never read and can't digest[39]. People simply click 'agree' and move on. A new rule could require standard notices, along the lines of financial services disclosures[40], communicating a company's privacy protections in a short and straightforward manner. Another rule could also let users opt out of certain uses or analyses of their data. Seeking broader protection Even better than single-issue bills focused on political ads or privacy policies would be sweeping, proactive data protections[41] for online consumers. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation[42], which goes into effect on May 25, is a reasonable effort at achieving these ends. One particularly interesting feature of the GDPR is the 'right to be forgotten[43],' which among other things allows individuals to ask companies to remove information about them from online databases. And the potential penalties for a firm violating the law are significant - up to 20 million euros[44] or 4 percent of the company's global annual revenue. However, even a broad law would not address the most fundamental problem. The internet at present is based on a single business model: surveillance capitalism[45]. Online businesses need new ways to make money, without aggregating, exploiting or selling individuals' data. Changing the business model To encourage companies to serve democratic principles and focus on improving people's lives, we believe the chief business model of the internet needs to shift to building trust and verifying information[46]. While it won't be an immediate change, social media companies pride themselves on their adaptability[47] and should be able to take on this challenge. The alternative, of course, could be far more severe. In the 1980s, when federal regulators decided that AT...as using its power in the telephone market to hurt competition and consumers, they forced the massive conglomerate to break up[48]. A similar but less dramatic change happened in the early 2000s when cellphone companies were forced to let people keep their phone numbers[49] even if they switched carriers. Data, and particularly individuals' personal data, are the precious metals of the internet age. Protecting individual data while expanding access to the internet and its many social benefits is a fundamental challenge for free societies. Creating, using and protecting data properly will be crucial to preserving and improving human rights[50] and civil liberties in this still young century. To meet this challenge will require both vigilance and vision, from businesses and their customers, as well as governments and their citizens[51].

The U.K.-based political consulting firm didn't just collect personal data fromthe 270,000 people[2]who usedresearcher Aleksandr Kogan's online personality quiz[3]- nor was the damage limited to87 million of their friends[4]. Facebook recently revealed thatnearly all[5]of its2.2 billion users[6]have had data scraped by 'malicious[7]' people or companies.The firm itself has joined[8]calls for better privacy regulations[9]. For years,watchdogs have been warning[10]aboutsharing information[11]withdata-collecting companies[12], firms engaged in the relatively new line of business called some academics have called 'surveillance capitalism[13].' Most casual internet users are only now realizing how easy - and common - it is for unaccountable and unknown organizations to assemble detailed digital profiles of them. They do this bycombining the discrete bits of information[14]consumers have given up to e-tailers, health sites, quiz apps and countless other digital services. As scholars ofpublic accountability[15]anddigital media systems[16], we know that the business of social media is based onextracting user data and offering it for sale[17]. There's no simple way for them to protect data as many users might expect. </p><p>Like thesocial pollution[18]of fake news, bullying and spam that Facebook's platform spreads, the company's privacy crisis also stems from a power imbalance: Facebook knows nearly everything about its users, who know little to nothing about it. It's not enough for people todelete their Facebook accounts[19]. Nor is it likely that anyone will successfullyreplace it with a nonprofit alternative[20]centering onprivacy, transparency and accountability[21]. Furthermore, this problem is not specificjust to Facebook[22]. Other companies, including Google and Amazon, alsogather and exploit extensive personal data[23], and are locked in adigital arms race[24]that we believe threatens to destroy privacy altogether. Government Regulation Can Help Governments need to be better guardians of public welfare - including privacy. Many companies using various aspects of technology in new ways have so faravoided regulation[25]by stoking fears thatrules might stifle innovation[26]. Facebook and others have oftenclaimed that they're better at regulating themselves[27]in an ever-changing environment than a slow-moving legislative process could be. But these companies have clearly failed to regulate themselves. As Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg admitted, 'We did not think enough about the abuse[28]' potential of their data collection practices. So government regulation is both reasonable and necessary, to reduce the risks that social pollution and data abuse pose topolitical stability[29]and personal privacy. A woman is photographed managing her facebook account in Berlin on May 22, 2018. Photo: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images Considering New Rules Congress is already discussing how to fight the social pollution of misleading advertising with hidden agendas. TheHonest Ads Act[30]would require both buyers and sellers of online political ads todisclose more information[31]. Facebook's response to the Cambridge Analytica crisis has includedswitching from opposing this act to supporting it[32], and even announcing it'simproving transparency[33]before being required to by law. This is a good start, but it does nothing to protect people's privacy. New rules must govern privacy policies, which today bamboozle consumers into signing away their rights. Most online sites, apps and services have extremely long documents with obscure legal language thatmost users never read and can't digest[34]. People simply click 'agree' and move on. A new rule could require standard notices, along the lines offinancial services disclosures[35], communicating a company's privacy protections in a short and straightforward manner. Another rule could also let users opt out of certain uses or analyses of their data. Seeking Broader Protection Even better than single-issue bills focused on political ads or privacy policies would besweeping, proactive data protections[36]for online consumers. The European Union'sGeneral Data Protection Regulation[37], which goes into effect on May 25, is a reasonable effort at achieving these ends. One particularly interesting feature of the GDPR is the 'right to be forgotten[38],' which among other things allows individuals to ask companies to remove information about them from online databases. And the potential penalties for a firm violating the law are significant -up to 20 million euros[39]or 4 percent of the company's global annual revenue. However, even a broad law would not address the most fundamental problem. The internet at present is based on a single business model:surveillance capitalism[40]. Online businesses need new ways to make money, without aggregating, exploiting or selling individuals' data. Changing The Business Model To encourage companies to serve democratic principles and focus on improving people's lives, we believe the chief business model of the internet needs to shift tobuilding trust and verifying information[41]. While it won't be an immediate change, social media companiespride themselves on their adaptability[42]and should be able to take on this challenge. The alternative, of course, could be far more severe. In the 1980s, when federal regulators decided that AT...as using its power in the telephone market to hurt competition and consumers, they forcedthe massive conglomerate to break up[43]. A similar but less dramatic change happened in the early 2000s when cellphone companies were forced tolet people keep their phone numbers[44]even if they switched carriers. Data, and particularly individuals' personal data, are the precious metals of the internet age. Protecting individual data while expanding access to the internet and its many social benefits is a fundamental challenge for free societies. Creating, using and protecting data properly will be crucial to preserving andimproving human rights[45]and civil liberties in this still young century. To meet this challenge will require both vigilance and vision,from businesses and their customers, as well as governments and their citizens[46].

What happens to the cookie and what comes next? Companies will need practical advice on how to advertise in the new web environment.After privacy regulators in Europe, Canada and elsewhere clearly stated plans to enforce collection of consumer information only with express permission of the consumer data subject, the third-party cookie's days were clearly numbered. HTTP cookies - some session cookies, some persistent cookies - involve usually-secret placement of code on a consumer's web browser which could remember items in a shopping cart, record browsing activity and save data entered into website fields. </p><p>These cookies are likely to survive.Third-party tracking cookies tend to compile long-term records of a consumer's browsing history and provide that data to whoever could read it. Some websites could set over 800 cookies on a passing browser. The New York Times reported[1] that it found that people reading a controversial article may be tracked by nearly 50 companies, including those that sell that tracking information to scores more companies. The Times author stated, 'as advertisers pushed for ways to better target ads, ad tech companies created vast networks to harvest user data and broker ads on billions of web pages, providing a one-stop shop for advertisers to reach web users.'The GDPR mandated privacy by design for web browsing, requiring technology companies to develop software that protects privacy by default, and automatically opts the user out of these huge ad networks unless the use chooses to accept the intrusions. The CCPA applies to persistent identifiers, including cookies, and provides consumers rights to learn about the information collected and to request that data be erased. Allowing consumers to opt-out of the cookie networks is bad enough for the current ad industry, but the EU's requirement of an automatic opt-out by default signals the death of that business model.And Big Tech is responding. Safari (2017) and Firefox (2019) are already blocking cookies effectively. The world's most popular browser, Chrome by Google, is rolling out similar third-party cookie blocking technology. According to the blog[2] for Elevated Internet Marketing, 'Once Google kills third-party cookies on Chrome, it will still allow tracking to continue without passing personal information onto advertisers. This will give Google more power, but also increase privacy online.' Google has announced its goal of making third-party cookies obsolete by 2022.The Google announcement quickly affected the online advertising industry. Shares of Critereo crashed to a 52 week low and other companies with cookie-based advertising infrastructure dropped[3] in a similar manner.What follows the third-party cookie in the online advertising space?Google's advertising is not simply disappearing. Clicks and purchases will be stored in the browser and not broadcast to third parties, giving browser companies like Google more control over the data. Prioritizing privacy means significantly less measurement and targeting from an indiscriminate mass of ad networks. Whoever has access to first party data will continue to thrive. Loyal audiences will command a premium.Cookies are a device-based tool. The software rests on a device, tying that device to browsing history. The future may involve much more marketing directed at a specific person whatever device that person uses to surf the web. Facebook assigns a unique identifier to each person, and this can be used to track people across the platforms they use to access the web - smartphone, laptop, iPad, television - and benefit from a fuller picture of a consumer. Brands have always used first party data to appeal to customers, but tools are developing to allow deeper relationships.Closed corporate systems like Facebook with huge herds to milk for data will certainly benefit. But the death of third-party cookies may spur a movement toward a universal personal ID that can used by any marketer. MarTech Advisor[4] writes, 'The race has already started so vendors only have two years remaining to develop their universal ID solution, win enough partners to become relevant in scale and a feasible industry alternative (in fact selective Customer Intelligence platforms have started establishing such IDs.) Publishers will have an incentive to work with a couple of universal ID suppliers to not make themselves too dependent on any one provider.'AI allows brands to extract marketable intelligence from customer telephone conversations, just as it allows Amazon to draw useful information from a customer's on-site browsing habits. New uses of machine learning will be applied to first person consumer data to understand their needs and desires in a way that supports traditional marketing tools.What was old is new again. Keyword targeting was an early search marketing tool and is likely to regain its relevance. This system uses your currently expressed interests to market to you, rather than your overall behavioral profile, like the third-party cookie regime. According to Marketing Land[5], 'With contextual targeting, the ads you see are based on the content you are looking at instead of your overall behavior profile. So when you are looking at your knitting blog, you see ads for knitting needles, and when you're reading up on how to improve the click-through rate on your email newsletters, you see ads for relevant email automation platforms.'Movements in the marketing tech industry show that privacy laws like the GDPR have succeeded in creating a desired effect - structural changes that promote consumer privacy and grant consumers greater choice. The cookie may crumble, but advertisers will still eat.[View source[6].] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/opinion/data-privacy-tracking.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/opinion/data-privacy-tracking.html</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.elevated.com/buh-bye-cookie-google-kicks-off-2-year-plan-to-kill-cookies-in-chrome-whats-next\">https://www.elevated.com/buh-bye-cookie-google-kicks-off-2-year-plan-to-kill-cookies-in-chrome-whats-next</url>/ [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/14/criteo-stock-crashes-after-google-announces-chrome-cookie-change.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/14/criteo-stock-crashes-after-google-announces-chrome-cookie-change.html</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/ads/its-finally-over-for-the-3rd-party-cookie-what-now/\">https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/ads/its-finally-over-for-the-3rd-party-cookie-what-now/</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://marketingland.com/the-third-party-browser-tracking-cookie-is-dead-whats-next-263804\">https://marketingland.com/the-third-party-browser-tracking-cookie-is-dead-whats-next-263804</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://heydatadata.com/2020/06/30/toss-out-the-milk-the-cookie-party-is-over/\">https://heydatadata.com/2020/06/30/toss-out-the-milk-the-cookie-party-is-over/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411159364205530225876100200</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6088-9T11-JCMN-Y4WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1146\"/><timeReceived>10:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Claypoole[1] Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP[2] HeyDataData[3] For 25 years - since the introduction of Internet Explorer 2 - our browsers supported third-party cookie technology that formed the basis of internet advertising.The cookie party is ending.Tech lawyers and business executives need to learn about what will be following the cookie era, as online advertising pivots to survive omnibus consumer privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA that make old-fashioned adware impossible to use and therefore obsolete. What happens to the cookie and what comes next? Companies will need practical advice on how to advertise in the new web environment.After privacy regulators in Europe, Canada and elsewhere clearly stated plans to enforce collection of consumer information only with express permission of the consumer data subject, the third-party cookie's days were clearly numbered. HTTP cookies - some session cookies, some persistent cookies - involve usually-secret placement of code on a consumer's web browser which could remember items in a shopping cart, record browsing activity and save data entered into website fields. </p><p>These cookies are likely to survive.Third-party tracking cookies tend to compile long-term records of a consumer's browsing history and provide that data to whoever could read it. Some websites could set over 800 cookies on a passing browser. The New York Timesreported[4]that it found that people reading a controversial article may be tracked by nearly 50 companies, including those that sell that tracking information to scores more companies. The Times author stated, 'as advertisers pushed for ways to better target ads, ad tech companies created vast networks to harvest user data and broker ads on billions of web pages, providing a one-stop shop for advertisers to reach web users.'The GDPR mandated privacy by design for web browsing, requiring technology companies to develop software that protects privacy by default, and automatically opts the user out of these huge ad networks unless the use chooses to accept the intrusions. The CCPA applies to persistent identifiers, including cookies, and provides consumers rights to learn about the information collected and to request that data be erased. Allowing consumers to opt-out of the cookie networks is bad enough for the current ad industry, but the EU's requirement of an automatic opt-out by default signals the death of that business model.And Big Tech is responding. Safari (2017) and Firefox (2019) are already blocking cookies effectively. The world's most popular browser, Chrome by Google, is rolling out similar third-party cookie blocking technology. According to theblog[5]for Elevated Internet Marketing, 'Once Google kills third-party cookies on Chrome, it will still allow tracking to continue without passing personal information onto advertisers. This will give Google more power, but also increase privacy online.' Google has announced its goal of making third-party cookies obsolete by 2022.The Google announcement quickly affected the online advertising industry. Shares of Critereo crashed to a 52 week low and other companies with cookie-based advertising infrastructuredropped[6]in a similar manner.What follows the third-party cookie in the online advertising space?Google's advertising is not simply disappearing. Clicks and purchases will be stored in the browser and not broadcast to third parties, giving browser companies like Google more control over the data. Prioritizing privacy means significantly less measurement and targeting from an indiscriminate mass of ad networks. Whoever has access to first party data will continue to thrive. Loyal audiences will command a premium.Cookies are a device-based tool. The software rests on a device, tying that device to browsing history. The future may involve much more marketing directed at a specific person whatever device that person uses to surf the web. Facebook assigns a unique identifier to each person, and this can be used to track people across the platforms they use to access the web - smartphone, laptop, iPad, television - and benefit from a fuller picture of a consumer. Brands have always used first party data to appeal to customers, but tools are developing to allow deeper relationships.Closed corporate systems like Facebook with huge herds to milk for data will certainly benefit. But the death of third-party cookies may spur a movement toward a universal personal ID that can used by any marketer.MarTech Advisor[7]writes, 'The race has already started so vendors only have two years remaining to develop their universal ID solution, win enough partners to become relevant in scale and a feasible industry alternative (in fact selective Customer Intelligence platforms have started establishing such IDs.) Publishers will have an incentive to work with a couple of universal ID suppliers to not make themselves too dependent on any one provider.'AI allows brands to extract marketable intelligence from customer telephone conversations, just as it allows Amazon to draw useful information from a customer's on-site browsing habits. New uses of machine learning will be applied to first person consumer data to understand their needs and desires in a way that supports traditional marketing tools.What was old is new again. Keyword targeting was an early search marketing tool and is likely to regain its relevance. This system uses your currently expressed interests to market to you, rather than your overall behavioral profile, like the third-party cookie regime. According toMarketing Land[8], 'With contextual targeting, the ads you see are based on the content you are looking at instead of your overall behavior profile. So when you are looking at your knitting blog, you see ads for knitting needles, and when you're reading up on how to improve the click-through rate on your email newsletters, you see ads for relevant email automation platforms.'Movements in the marketing tech industry show that privacy laws like the GDPR have succeeded in creating a desired effect - structural changes that promote consumer privacy and grant consumers greater choice. The cookie may crumble, but advertisers will still eat.Copyright  2020 Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP All Rights Reserved.

It happened again in the late 1940s, when nuclear war seemed imminent. And it is happening now, as big technology companies work on artificial intelligence that threatens to create a world where human beings are eternal losers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying about how history doesn\u2019t repeat itself but it rhymes, and we\u2019re definitely in a rhyming mode,\u201d said Edward T. O\u2019Donnell, a historian at College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. \u201cOur worries about our technological future are sending us back to solutions in our industrial past.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For decades, antitrust regulation has been overwhelmingly focused on the welfare of the consumer. No cost to the consumer, no problem. That opened the door for Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon \u2014 which offered digital services that were cheap or free \u2014 to become immensely profitable and powerful.</p><p>Now a backlash is mounting as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html\">renegade scholars try to reverse years of established doctrine</url> that they say does not appropriately take the clout of those companies into account. Economic absolutism is making way for other considerations as antitrust thinking goes back to its roots.</p><p>\u201cPeople might enjoy using the tech platforms but they are also asking, What kind of society do we want?\u201d said Hal Singer, a senior fellow at George Washington University\u2019s Institute of Public Policy. \u201cWe\u2019re at one of those antitrust moments.\u201d</p><p>The change in antitrust thinking has recently gathered momentum. This month, American regulators indicated <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcecilia-kang&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;pgtype=collection\">they were looking at Big Tech</url>, inspiring a rush of \u201cabout time\u201d remarks from politicians across the spectrum. Since then,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/technology/big-tech-antitrust-scrutiny.html\">President Trump</url>, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler have all endorsed in their own ways a heightened scrutiny of the tech behemoths.</p><p>Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department official in charge of antitrust, recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-remarks-antitrust-new-frontiers\">gave a speech in Israel</url> in which he upped the stakes by rejecting the consumer welfare standard as the sole determinant of harm. He went so far as to assert that \u201cdiminished quality\u201d can harm competition, which could send regulators into some novel areas.</p><p>Mr. Delrahim concluded by saying the antitrust division \u201cis working hard to stay true\u201d to the original vision of John Sherman, the Ohio senator whose name is on the 1890 antitrust act that was the first legislation against monopolies.</p><p>The Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in the Senate by a 51-to-1 vote, while the House endorsed it unanimously. It was two pages long, did not bother defining the word \u201cmonopoly\u201d and was used in its first decade mostly to go after labor. Some historians think the conservative Congress that passed it was merely being cynical, offering a sop to reformers.</p><p>The fear of the future, however, was real as the economy transformed itself. In 1890, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1949/compendia/hist_stats_1789-1945/hist_stats_1789-1945-chD.pdf\">the percentage of the population in agriculture</url> was at 43 percent, down from 72 percent in 1820. The steel companies, meatpackers and railroads hired and then hired some more. The number of millionaires rose from a few hundred before the Civil War to about 4,000 in 1890, historians estimate. .</p><p>\u201cThe rising fear of the day was that honest, hardworking people are being screwed and the system is rigged,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Donnell, author of \u201cHenry George and the Crisis of Inequality: Progress and Poverty in the Gilded Age.\u201d People grew to depend on big companies like Standard Oil, just as their descendants today cannot sign off from Facebook and Google. But they did not necessarily like them.</p><p>\u201cNearly every household had a five-gallon red can of Standard Oil\u2019s kerosene,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cBut the founder, John D. Rockefeller, was often seen as rapacious octopus.\u201d</p><p>In 1900, the Democratic Party platform included the belief that \u201cprivate monopolies are indefensible and intolerable,\u201d declaring: \u201cUnless their insatiate greed is checked, all wealth will be aggregated in a few hands and the Republic destroyed.\u201d</p><p>Groundbreaking reforms followed, including the breakup of Standard Oil. In 1913, in a largely forgotten episode, National Cash Register Co. became the first tech company to be successfully prosecuted for violating the Sherman Act. Nearly 30 executives at the company, which controlled 95 percent of the cash register market, were convicted and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/economics/pdf/marvel/ncr.pdf\">sentenced to brief prison terms.</url> While they appealed and never served a day, the company\u2019s power was broken.</p><p>Antitrust moves ebbed and flowed through the 20th century. In the late 1940s, said Daniel Crane, an antitrust historian at the University of Michigan, \u201cthere was quite a bit of alarm about the growing tide of industrial concentration following the war, and fear that undue levels of concentration could bring fascism or communism to power.\u201d</p><p>By the mid-1950s, Americans had reconciled themselves to working for large corporations but antitrust remained a potent force.</p><p>\u201cAnybody who knows anything about the conduct of American business knows that the managers of the large corporations do their business with one eye constantly cast over their shoulders at the antitrust division,\u201d the historian Richard Hofstadter wrote in 1964.</p><p>One of the most controversial cases of that era is now enjoying a resurgence: Brown Shoe Co. Inc. v United States.</p><p>The case began in 1956 when Brown Shoe, a manufacturer and retailer, merged with G.R. Kinney Co., which also made and sold shoes to customers. The government sued, saying the merger would increase concentration in the manufacturing and selling of shoes, eliminate a major competitor and deprive other shoe companies of a fair opportunity to compete. The government won the case in the district court and then, in 1962, at the Supreme Court.</p><p>The case could give Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple nightmares. The reason: The way that regulators defined unhealthy concentration in a market. At the time, Brown Shoe and Kinney together owned only 7.2 percent of the country\u2019s retail shoe stores, and shoe stores were by no means the only place to buy shoes. The closest the merged company got to a monopoly was in six cities, where it sold over 40 percent of children\u2019s shoes.</p><p>Google, by contrast, has <url normalizedValue=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\">92 percent of the worldwide search market today,</url> while Facebook has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/social-media-stats\">70 percent of the social media market</url> and Amazon about 38 percent of the e-commerce market in the United States, according to research firms. (Antitrust arguments against Apple are less about market share and more about how it treats competitors in its App Store.)</p><p>Brown Shoe\u2019s argument that the shoe industry was \u201cdynamically competitive\u201d did not sway minds. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote that \u201cthe protection of viable, small, locally owned businesses\u201d was a priority, even if \u201coccasional higher costs and prices\u201d might be the result.</p><p>Brown Shoe is a \u201cfoundational antitrust decision even though it embodies values that have fundamentally shifted,\u201d C. Paul Rogers III, a professor at SMU School of Law, wrote last year in the SMU Law Review.</p><p>In an interview, he said, \u201cThe court was very concerned about trends toward concentration and growth by acquisition. It ignored efficiency arguments, saying efficiency gains could actually be a negative because they can squeeze out the small guys.\u201d He added that he thought the case was wrongly decided on its facts, \u201cbut if that populist approach comes back, it would be scary to these very efficient high-tech behemoths.\u201d</p><p>Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook declined to comment on Brown Shoe.</p><p>If the populists gain more momentum, they have a ways to go to unseat the antitrust establishment, which still hews to the consumer welfare standard developed by Robert Bork, the influential legal scholar and judge, and scholars at the University of Chicago beginning in the 1970s.</p><p>Some experts, like Mr. Singer of George Washington University, are waiting to see how sincere regulators are in their newfound zeal \u2014 and where exactly they plan to go. Mr. Delrahim of the Justice Department mentioned in his speech some unusual applications of antitrust, including \u201cprivacy protections\u201d and \u201cfree speech on platforms.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Singer said that last was a nod to President Trump, who has said he and some of his supporters have been unfairly treated on social media. As for privacy, \u201cI am very skeptical that more competition is going to make the platforms less exploitative of user data,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir whole reason for existing is to exploit user data.\u201d</p><p>At least for the moment, however, the reformers are ascendant and the economists defensive.</p><p>\u201cThe American people designed antimonopoly law so anyone can understand the rules,\u201d said Barry Lynn, the executive director of Open Markets, a Washington think-tank that has advocated antitrust reform. \u201cEnforcers followed guidelines that limited industrial firms to 25 percent of any market. To enforce the law, in other words, all you had to do was be able to count to four. We don\u2019t need economists to help us count to four.\u201d</p><p>Even if the reformers decisively win, the arguments will doubtless continue. The truest thing ever said about antitrust was by Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in the late 1990s.</p><p>\u201cMerger enforcement in the United States,\u201d he said, \u201chas often been erratic and always controversial.\u201d</p><p>Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @DavidStreitfeld. </p><p>PHOTO: John Sherman, an Ohio senator, spurred the 1890 antitrust act that was the first legislation against monopolies.

It happened again in the late 1940s, when nuclear war seemed imminent. And it is happening now, as big technology companies work on artificial intelligence that threatens to create a world where human beings are eternal losers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's an old saying about how history doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes, and we're definitely in a rhyming mode,\" said Edward T. O'Donnell, a historian at College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. \"Our worries about our technological future are sending us back to solutions in our industrial past.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For decades, antitrust regulation has been overwhelmingly focused on the welfare of the consumer. No cost to the consumer, no problem. That opened the door for Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon - which offered digital services that were cheap or free - to become immensely profitable and powerful.</p><p>Now a backlash is mounting as renegade scholars  try to reverse years of established doctrine that they say does not appropriately take the clout of those companies into account. Economic absolutism is making way for other considerations as antitrust thinking goes back to its roots.</p><p>\"People might enjoy using the tech platforms but they are also asking, What kind of society do we want?\" said Hal Singer, a senior fellow at George Washington University's Institute of Public Policy. \"We're at one of those antitrust moments.\"</p><p>The change in antitrust thinking has recently gathered momentum. This month, American regulators indicated they were looking at Big Tech, inspiring a rush of \"about time\" remarks from politicians across the spectrum. Since then, President Trump, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler have all endorsed in their own ways a heightened scrutiny of the tech behemoths.</p><p>Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department official in charge of antitrust, recently gave a speech in Israel  in which he upped the stakes by rejecting the consumer welfare standard as the sole determinant of harm. He went so far as to assert that \"diminished quality\" can harm competition, which could send regulators into some novel areas.</p><p>Mr. Delrahim concluded by saying the antitrust division \"is working hard to stay true\" to the original vision of John Sherman, the Ohio senator whose name is on the 1890 antitrust act that was the first legislation against monopolies.</p><p>The Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in the Senate by a 51-to-1 vote, while the House endorsed it unanimously. It was two pages long, did not bother defining the word \"monopoly\" and was used in its first decade mostly to go after labor. Some historians think the conservative Congress that passed it was merely being cynical, offering a sop to reformers.</p><p>The fear of the future, however, was real as the economy transformed itself. In 1890, the percentage of the population in agriculture was at 43 percent, down from 72 percent in 1820. The steel companies, meatpackers and railroads hired and then hired some more. The number of millionaires rose from a few hundred before the Civil War to about 4,000 in 1890, historians estimate. .</p><p>\"The rising fear of the day was that honest, hardworking people are being screwed and the system is rigged,\" said Mr. O'Donnell, author of \"Henry George and the Crisis of Inequality: Progress and Poverty in the Gilded Age.\" People grew to depend on big companies like Standard Oil, just as their descendants today cannot sign off from Facebook and Google. But they did not necessarily like them.</p><p>\"Nearly every household had a five-gallon red can of Standard Oil's kerosene,\" Mr. O'Donnell said. \"But the founder, John D. Rockefeller, was often seen as rapacious octopus.\"</p><p>In 1900, the Democratic Party platform included the belief that \"private monopolies are indefensible and intolerable,\" declaring: \"Unless their insatiate greed is checked, all wealth will be aggregated in a few hands and the Republic destroyed.\"</p><p>Groundbreaking reforms followed, including the breakup of Standard Oil. In 1913, in a largely forgotten episode, National Cash Register Co. became the first tech company to be successfully prosecuted for violating the Sherman Act. Nearly 30 executives at the company, which controlled 95 percent of the cash register market, were convicted and sentenced to brief prison terms. While they appealed and never served a day, the company's power was broken.</p><p>Antitrust moves ebbed and flowed through the 20th century. In the late 1940s, said Daniel Crane, an antitrust historian at the University of Michigan, \"there was quite a bit of alarm about the growing tide of industrial concentration following the war, and fear that undue levels of concentration could bring fascism or communism to power.\"</p><p>By the mid-1950s, Americans had reconciled themselves to working for large corporations but antitrust remained a potent force.</p><p>\"Anybody who knows anything about the conduct of American business knows that the managers of the large corporations do their business with one eye constantly cast over their shoulders at the antitrust division,\" the historian Richard Hofstadter wrote in 1964.</p><p>One of the most controversial cases of that era is now enjoying a resurgence: Brown Shoe Co. Inc. v United States.</p><p>The case began in 1956 when Brown Shoe, a manufacturer and retailer, merged with G.R. Kinney Co., which also made and sold shoes to customers. The government sued, saying the merger would increase concentration in the manufacturing and selling of shoes, eliminate a major competitor and deprive other shoe companies of a fair opportunity to compete. The government won the case in the district court and then, in 1962, at the Supreme Court.</p><p>The case could give Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple nightmares. The reason: The way that regulators defined unhealthy concentration in a market. At the time, Brown Shoe and Kinney together owned only 7.2 percent of the country's retail shoe stores, and shoe stores were by no means the only place to buy shoes. The closest the merged company got to a monopoly was in six cities, where it sold over 40 percent of children's shoes.</p><p>Google, by contrast, has 92 percent of the worldwide search market today, while Facebook has 70 percent of the social media market and Amazon about 38 percent of the e-commerce market in the United States, according to research firms. (Antitrust arguments against Apple are less about market share and more about how it treats competitors in its App Store.)</p><p>Brown Shoe's argument that the shoe industry was \"dynamically competitive\" did not sway minds. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote that \"the protection of viable, small, locally owned businesses\" was a priority, even if \"occasional higher costs and prices\" might be the result.</p><p>Brown Shoe is a \"foundational antitrust decision even though it embodies values that have fundamentally shifted,\" C. Paul Rogers III, a professor at SMU School of Law, wrote last year in the SMU Law Review.</p><p>In an interview, he said, \"The court was very concerned about trends toward concentration and growth by acquisition. It ignored efficiency arguments, saying efficiency gains could actually be a negative because they can squeeze out the small guys.\" He added that he thought the case was wrongly decided on its facts, \"but if that populist approach comes back, it would be scary to these very efficient high-tech behemoths.\"</p><p>Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook declined to comment on Brown Shoe.</p><p>If the populists gain more momentum, they have a ways to go to unseat the antitrust establishment, which still hews to the consumer welfare standard developed by Robert Bork, the influential legal scholar and judge, and scholars at the University of Chicago beginning in the 1970s.</p><p>Some experts, like Mr. Singer of George Washington University, are waiting to see how sincere regulators are in their newfound zeal - and where exactly they plan to go. Mr. Delrahim of the Justice Department mentioned in his speech some unusual applications of antitrust, including \"privacy protections\" and \"free speech on platforms.\"</p><p>Mr. Singer said that last was a nod to President Trump, who has said he and some of his supporters have been unfairly treated on social media. As for privacy, \"I am very skeptical that more competition is going to make the platforms less exploitative of user data,\" he said. \"Their whole reason for existing is to exploit user data.\"</p><p>At least for the moment, however, the reformers are ascendant and the economists defensive.</p><p>\"The American people designed antimonopoly law so anyone can understand the rules,\" said Barry Lynn, the executive director of Open Markets, a Washington think-tank that has advocated antitrust reform. \"Enforcers followed guidelines that limited industrial firms to 25 percent of any market. To enforce the law, in other words, all you had to do was be able to count to four. We don't need economists to help us count to four.\"</p><p>Even if the reformers decisively win, the arguments will doubtless continue. The truest thing ever said about antitrust was by Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in the late 1990s.</p><p>\"Merger enforcement in the United States,\" he said, \"has often been erratic and always controversial.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @DavidStreitfeld. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006557330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDC-Y1B1-DYR7-C1SW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1599\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Ladislas Paszkiewicz, in charge of Investor Relations.</p><p>After the presentation we had from Helle Kristoffersen yesterday on the Total Energy outlook, we will focus today on strategy. Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 and all the members of the executive committee are here, and we'll address your questions during this afternoon. Patrick will first present the strategy, and there will be a session of Q&amp;A after that. Then will come the time of focused presentations with 2 main presentation, 1 on renewable with Philippe Sauquet; one on the mobility revolution with both Bernard Pinatel who will focus on biofuels and Alexis Vovk who will focus on electric mobility. A Q&amp;A session will also take place after the presentation.</p><p>So this is the program for today. But before we start, I'd like to hand over to Arnaud Breuillac who will present you the safety moment for today.</p><p>ARNAUD BREUILLAC, PRESIDENT OF EXPLORATION &amp; PRODUCTION, TOTAL SE: Thank you, Ladislas. Today, we've chosen to share with you a sad safety moment with the tragic death of 1 of our contractor staff, a 37-year old rig floor man. The fatal accident occurred on August 23 at 11 a.m. on our drilling operations in the U.S. GoM.</p><p>The incident analysis is still ongoing, but let me present you with our current understanding of what happened. The drillship, Pacific Khamsin, was pulling the riser colon out of the water in preparation for a rig move to escape the Storm Laura. This is a routine operation that was executed with no time pressure as the rig disconnection had been decided well in advance. The injured person was removing large bolts from the riser colon using heavy-duty pneumatic wrench. The weight of this tool is 150 kilograms, and it was attached to a wrench cable with a 0 gravity compensator.</p><p>The tool became jammed and the injured person was working over the tool during the attempts to free it by pulling on the wrench and also by manipulating it manually as you can see on the small schematic. As the tool suddenly became free, the tension in the wrench cable was released and projected the tool upward, hitting the injured person and projecting him from the riser table to the rig floor. Unfortunately, medical efforts at site failed to save his life.</p><p>This strategic accident hands a 2-year fatality-free period for the E&amp;P activities and is a shock to our company. An Incident Analysis Committee is working jointly with the drilling contractor, [Pacific Khamsin], to determine the root causes of this accident. And preliminary assessments and recommendations have already been shared with local authorities and within Total. Our next steps are to complete the root-cause analysis and to continue to share learnings and mitigation measures so that every possible information is used to prevent similar occurrence.</p><p>Safety is a core value of Total, and we strongly believe that it is a cornerstone of operational efficiency. Our track record demonstrates our relentless drive for improvement and this is illustrated by the frequency rate of recordable injury, which is on a good trend that compares well with our peers. But of course, no complacency as we are more than aware that with safety every day is a new day.</p><p>In terms of health, we have limited the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with a fast and proactive response. We've mobilized very early a crisis management set at group level to support safe continuation of operations around the globe in all parts of our businesses. We've been able to source and supply more than 100 million masks to 130 affiliates and to enforce strict health protocols to maintain our site and premises COVID-free.</p><p>As a result, there has been no impact on our production or our ability to supply vital products and energy to our customers. We've also supported our communities with contribution adapted to local situations.</p><p>More broadly, safety defined as HSE, including environmental safety, will be well covered in today's presentation as we believe that long-term success is built on sustainability and acceptability. Thank you.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9, CHAIRMAN, CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, TOTAL SE: So good afternoon in London and Paris. Good morning in New York, and good evening in Singapore. Welcome this afternoon to the traditional September Total strategy and outlook session.</p><p>First, I hope that you are all safe and sound and coping all right with current COVID situations. Thank you to Arnaud to have made this safety moment and way to pay tribute to this young man in the U.S. And Arnaud has also to take the traditional standard slide on our safety commitments and results.</p><p>To be honest with you, considering the number of short-term challenges and a very high degree of uncertainty that we are facing in these extraordinary times, we ask ourselves whether we should maintain or not this strategic presentation as it will be difficult to answer to any question on the very near future but because our action plans to tackle the present challenges are well into force. Because we demonstrated our higher resilience since the beginning of this crisis, thanks to the work done in past years of migrating the portfolio, lowering the breakeven, deleveraging the company to strengthen our resilience. Because energy is a matter of medium and long term in the same way that we have announced our climate ambition to get to Net Zero in May at the worst time of the COVID lock down, we have finally decided to maintain this strategy presentation. And this is probably the most important one I will do since 2015.</p><p>Because today, we will elaborate more precisely looking to the next decade how we are willing to reach our ambition to get to Net Zero by 2050. How we want to transform Total to meet the dual challenge as summarized yesterday by Helle, more energy and less carbon.</p><p>Today, you will hear our Total Oil, I would say, will become Total EnergieS, with a big s, a broad energy company, which will be the first oil and gas major to take to this commitment that it will reduce by 2030 the Scope 3 emissions of its customers in absolute value compared to 2015.</p><p>Oil customers, their demand. Those are keywords shaping our strategy. Our strategy derives from demand evolution, markets evolution and not from supply availability as it could have been in the past.</p><p>Yesterday, rightly in introduction, Helle told you that the Total 2020 Energy are to focus on energy demand, not energy supply. This was intentional. Because changing the world energy mix to meet the climate challenge within priority required to change the demand patterns together with our customers, together with society.</p><p>Today, we will use concrete examples of successful projects to demonstrate proof-of-concept by building a multi-energy company as possible. Today, we will explain why becoming a broad energy company is consistent with our long-term strategy to invest for profitable growth with our capital disciplined approach, targeting increased cash flows and returns.</p><p>Today, we will show you our oil and gas businesses will found the transition even at $40 per barrel for profitable growth in renewables and electricity while supporting the dividend at the same time. Because time is right to accelerate growth into low carbon, surge in demand for green energy and climate action is triggering wave of supportive government policies and attracting new financial partners and is creating opportunities to grow in new areas and unconsolidated markets.</p><p>Strategically, we recognize sustainability is a key to long-term success. The shift in demand-driven low carbon sales mix underpins Scope 3 neutrality. And diversifying activities by growing renewables power generation increase resilience and mitigate oil price volatility.</p><p>Accelerating energy transition and transforming to broad energy company is a matter of leveraging expertise and competitive advantages to selectively capture opportunities and build long-term positions that will enable us to achieve our ambition of moving forward with society and stakeholders to grow the company sustainably and profitably and get to Net Zero by 2050 or sooner.</p><p>The next decade, 2020, 2030 will be a transformative decade for Total. Further high-grading the portfolio, favoring gas overall, accelerating expansion of low-carbon electricity and decarbonizing the sales mix, all within the framework of strict capital discipline.</p><p>The energy transition is an inevitable evolution. Cleaner energies will continue to displace traditional energies at an accelerating rate. The real risk is not participating in the transition and being left behind. We have the knowledge, the technology, the financial strength needed to thrive in fast-growing areas like renewables, biofuels and carbon capture. We have studied these for years and developed in-house expertise. We have visibility, and we are confident on the returns we can expect in the next 5 years from this strategy. So now we go to work, we will execute and deliver.</p><p>In 10 years, we grow the company largely by developing opportunities we have on hand today and we reduce emissions. We took the walk and we walked the talk.</p><p>Let's go for now 1 hour presentation. It will be a little long. And to describe you the thematic of the dual challenge, we will tackle it, increasing energy while decreasing carbon. This presentation is a little different from previous ones. You will have at the beginning, the menu for the next 10 -- first 10 slides.</p><p>So I will announce you the menu with simple slides, maybe some of them will surprise you. And then after I will enter into the menu for each dishes with some details. And at the end, for the desert, I will come back to you to summarize and speak about returns to shareholders.</p><p>So let's go in the journey that we have prepared. I will speak alone today. It's mainly due to this virtual, I would say, exercise. It was more complex to us. But honestly, this is the result of hard work of all the teams, that is why all my colleagues are here together with me. It's -- I'm the voice -- the speak -- spoke person for the whole teams and the whole executive committee to describe this strategy.</p><p>So of course, and I'll be short, because you are -- you heard Helle yesterday during 1 hour. All that -- all these strategy, again, is linked to the evolution of the demand we anticipate. We have seen scenarios. I think there are 2 big trends. Growing population in emerging countries, aiming at higher living standards, so growing energy demand, which we have to face. And the other part of the challenge is absolute necessity to get the planet to carbon neutrality by 2050, if we can, and the latest by 2070 with all the countries being on board.</p><p>So that's the 2 challenges. And in front of that, this has some implications like it was presented to you by Helle on the energy mix and on the various sources of energy.</p><p>For all, it's clear that the acceleration of innovation to substitute all use is there and that all demand will plateau 2030 plus and then decline. It will have so an impact on long-term prices, and as you know, Total is considering $50 per barrel.</p><p>On natural gas, the scenarios, which have been presented to you, we -- clearly, the natural gas is key in the energy transition, available, affordable, complement to renewables with a specific segment of the natural gas, which has the fastest growth, which is the LNG. And natural gas also will have to be decarbonized with greener, with biogas and hydrogen.</p><p>The other segment of the energy mix, which will grow quicker is electricity. Clearly, if we want to go to Net Zero policies, electricity will be at the core of the mix going -- coming from 20% of the worldwide energy mix to at least 40% in the Net Zero in the 1.5-degree scenario. And of course, this will have to be decarbonized electricity. And so renewables will be the segment, which will have the highest growth. And last but not least, as it was explained to you, to get to carbon neutrality, carbon things are required. So these are the trends, which we take into account.</p><p>At the same time, Total as a responsible company, and our aim is to become responsible energy major, has expressed its clear ambition in climate ambitions in May this year, getting to Net Zero. And we clearly share not only a corporate level, but each employee of the company shared the ambition to contribute to get to Net Zero by 2050 together with society for our world business.</p><p>And we have established 3 clear objectives and commitments to -- on this road map to get to Net Zero. The first one is, of course, Net Zero on all operations, the emissions of Scope 1 and 2. As you all know, when you speak about 40 billion tons that yesterday Helle was mentioning as a world emission, this is some of Scope 1 of all corporation and individuals in the planet. Scope 1 are additive. If each company is taking care of the Scope 1, then the planet would be at Net Zero.</p><p>But we are also on the top of it, because it's a requirement from the society. We have not to work only on our emission, but to work with our customers in order to help them to go and to change their demand patterns because if we want to move the planet, we need not only to act on the supply, but we need also, as I said, to act on the demand.</p><p>And there, we took 2 commitments regarding, I would say, the emission of our customers. The first one is for Europe. Europe is very important for Total because 60% of our sales and our customers are located in Europe. And so we took the commitment because Europe itself at a political level has decided and has set itself the same target to be carbon-neutral by 2050. There is no reason and no way, in fact, to escape to work together with Europe and to be, ourselves, carbon-neutral in Europe by 2050 or sooner.</p><p>And on the worldwide basis, on the question of this Scope 3 emissions of our customer, we set a target in terms of carbon intensity, which is to diminish our portfolio of sales, the carbon intensity of the portfolio of sales, by 60% or more by 2050. So in May, we said that.</p><p>And of course, today, we will explain you how we translate that ambition, taking into account the evolution of energy markets into our strategy. The strategy is summarized on this chart. In simple words, there is no figures for once in Total. And I think the message there is that, clearly, we want to transform Total into a broad energy company. And this is what we will explain you what it means today more precisely.</p><p>It means that we are willing to proposed to investors a sort of new concept in energy, a company of energy encompassing natural gas, electricity, oil and carbon sinks. Again, somewhere, we summarized that in sort of a motto: Total becoming Total EnergieS, with a big s, with, of course, the ultimate objective. But sustainability is key to create long-term value for shareholders.</p><p>So what does it mean by segment of energy, which is a different approach of the traditional one, but again, we want to cope with the demand. On natural gas, we are a clear leader, #2 in the world. And this is one LNG. It's one of the fastest-growing segment. So we'll continue to play on that advantage and to maintain and even develop that position, integrating along the value chain while at the same time, we'll develop positions in biogas and clean hydrogen in order to decarbonize the natural gas. We'll also promote natural gas for power and mobility.</p><p>Electricity is okay. Of course, again, the second fastest segment of the energy is, on which we want to develop and to accelerate our investments, primarily electricity being produced from renewables. But there again, same strategy to integrate along the electricity value chain, production, storage and trading and supply. All will remain a core activity because the demand for all is still there despite we go to the plateau.</p><p>But there, because of this long -- the trends that we expressed, we will focus our investments on low-cost oil, which will be resilient to the volatility of the oil price. And as well, we'll invest in biofuels, which will be a substitute to all for liquid use of energy. And at the same time, of course, we have to adapt our refining capacity and sell to the demand in Europe where we are a big refiner.</p><p>And last but not least, carbon sinks. Because we want to be ourselves carbon-neutral, we'll have to take our share of investing in carbon sinks either nature-based or carbon capture use and storage.</p><p>So that's, in fact, the menu that I propose, and just to complement the menu now, we come with 2 figures. So we have a growing -- we have -- we want to increase energy. We have some ambition to continue to grow the company, let's be clear. And that means as we are an energy supplier, to grow our energy production. But our growth for the next decade will come from the 2 segments, which offer the fastest-growing -- the fastest growth, which are LNG, as I said, and electricity.</p><p>So as you can see on this chart, by the way, because we know you better understand million barrels of equivalent per day than terawatt per hour, we translated on the left side. The scale is in million barrel of oil equivalent per day, but it's a little complex, to be honest, to transform some terawatt hour in million barrels of equivalent per day. I'm not sure, by the way, that our stakeholder would be happy if we continue like that.</p><p>So on the right scale, we put another unit, which will have -- maybe to better understand, which is the petajoule per day. I think our Australian friends love this -- they love this unit. So maybe we'll have to take that on board. But more seriously, what we show you that is that this company has the ambition to grow from around 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day today to 4 million by 2030. And the growth will come from half from gas, in fact, from LNG, let me be clear, and the other half will be from electrons and green electrons.</p><p>The 120 terawatt, which appear there are equivalent to 500,000 barrel equivalent per day. The oil will remain in our portfolio but will be stable. Maybe it could decline by horizon as 2030, but the decline will be replaced by biofuels, by productions of another liquid, because again, we'll need some customers. We'll need a liquid form of energy in the future.</p><p>So that's for the growth. And at the same time, we want to reduce emissions. And today, we are taking new commitments on the Scope 3 emissions of our customers, I should say, of the energy products used by our customers. Because, in fact, it's not really true. It's not the Scope 3 emissions. The Scope 3 emissions of our customer are our Scope 1 in fact. But let's say it like that. In absolute value, that's the most important word. Until now, and we are the first major oil and gas company to take a commitment in absolute value on the decrease of the Scope 3 emission of our customers.</p><p>Why do we take that? Because first, and I come back to the commitment we took on being carbon-neutral in Europe by 2050. I read the comments about the fact that we are concentrating only on Europe. But again, you will see the positive impact it has as a world company. Europe again represents 60% of our emissions in 2015. It was the same, by the way, in 2019. The absolute figure did not diminish between '15 and '19, 410 million Scope 3 emissions are reported by Total.</p><p>But in Europe, there is clearly an acceleration of the evolution of the demand. And so we commit to reduce our Scope 3 -- the Scope 3 emissions of our European customers by 30% by 2030, which would be a first step to go to 100% by 2050. So this will come back on that.</p><p>And these results, I mean this commitment in Europe, of course, contributes to the fact that we can take a second commitment today, which is that on a worldwide basis, our Scope 3 emission in 2030 will be lower than the one in 2015. And again, we are the first to take that commitment. Stakeholders ask us a question after we make our commitments in May. And tell us, \"But okay, 2050 is assigned. But what do you do in 2030?\" You have the answer today.</p><p>So you will ask me, but what do you do? You grow on one side your production. You reduce your emissions. What is the magic tool that you have find? In fact, again, it's just about demand. And what is driving the -- most of the emissions are not the one we emit when we produce . When we produce, Total emits 50 million tons of CO2. But the products we sell and our customers, which are using these products, they emit 400 million tons. So the focus will also be there. And in fact, we are able to reduce our emissions on the Scope 3 parts -- to reduce the Scope 3 emissions because we will adapt our sales pattern to the demand patterns.</p><p>What does that mean? That means that in 2019, we sold 55% of oil products, 40% of natural gas and 5% of electrons. By 2030, by adapting again our system and our sales to the demand, we will reduce the sales of our oil products by almost 30%, which will be, again, on the -- as the liquids -- and liquids be replaced by 5% of biofuel. So the liquid sales will represent together 35%. Natural gas sales will increase to 50% linked to our growth in LNG. And the electrons, in particular, this green electrons, will represent 15% of our sales.</p><p>So that's with the 3 slides who have the framework of the strategy of the company and why we say we are somewhere transforming Total.</p><p>Of course, to do that, we'll need to align investments to become that broad energy company we aspire to be. That means that along the years, the next 10 years, the next decade, progressively, because it's a matter to have access to more and more projects, we will increase the capital we spent in renewable electricity. We'll maintain the capital we spent in LNG, more or less 15% to 20% of our CapEx. And oil and gas will continue to reserve -- to receive the major part of it because -- and that's fundamental to this transformation. We need to continue to deliver cash flows coming from oil and gas in order to be able to finance the growth that we want to deliver in renewables and electricity.</p><p>And so you have said some indication about this increasing capital spend in renewables and electricity. It was $1.5 billion the last 5 years, 10%. It will be more than EUR 2 billion and more than 15% of our capital investments for the next 5 years. And it will progressively grow to more than EUR 3 billion and more than 20% on the next 5 years.</p><p>Of -- this strategy aims, of course, not only to grow. It's not a matter of volume. It's a matter of value for all of you. We know very well the message. And so at the same time, we will be able to, of course, increase cash flows and deliver a double digit profitability, more than 10% of return on equity at $50 per barrel.</p><p>I will come back on this slide at the end of my presentation, but just have a look. What do you see? You see that if you take -- we took by chance the last 12 months at an average of $51 per barrel so as we propose to look in 2025 to an environment at $50 with a sensitivity of $60, you can see that renewable electricity in 5 years become very clear. Very clear with EUR 1.5 billion. You can see that there is an increase of around 30% of the LNG cash flows. I will come back on that. And you can also see, but of course, oil and gas and LNG are offering us upside. Its price is higher than the $50 base -- case base. And that's, again, the enzyme. In fact, to be clear, the oil and gas is the enzyme of transformation because they will give us a blood to be able to accelerate investing in renewables and electricity.</p><p>Again, you will tell me, and I affirm the question, why Total? What is -- why you do think you can become this broad energy company? We took the question seriously, and we put there the 8 elements, I would say, which we consider our competitive advantage and which we can build to grow in renewable and electricity. And not to remain only an oil and gas company. You should read them from bottom to the top. They go 2 by 2. That is well-organized, you know engineers in Total.</p><p>So the first one, of course, I just mentioned it, we have the oil and gas cash flow. We have the financial capacities. The second one, which is important, we are thinking on the worldwide basis. We have a worldwide footprint. Where we think about the strategy of renewables and electricity, I will come back on it. We can think of the world, looking for the best opportunities. And from this perspective, we are offering something different than many utilities, which, in fact, are more national, Continental or Atlantic.</p><p>The second element of competitive advantages are linked to technical -- the technical capacities and competencies of the company. Project management and offshore expertise is clear. And when we look to offshore wind, project management, we speak about 3, 4 projects, in which we invested in Scotland for $4 billion of CapEx. And when we want to be pioneer in floating of shore wind, obviously, we have there some in-house expertise that we can use and leverage to be pioneer of this technology.</p><p>The first elements are linked, in fact, to our strong position in gas. And in fact, we don't discover power today. Our teams under the leadership of Philippe and our trading teams have for long look to gas to power some power projects, by the way, gas-fired power plant. So the integration gas to power is well-known. And we know we have the expertise of all these markets, oil, gas and electricity for our trading teams, which we know we have put all together in Geneva since last year to have a better -- to leverage better all the knowledge we have of all these markets.</p><p>And last but not least, when we go to downstream to the customers within the DNA of Total, there is a customer proximity through all the activity we get in Marketing &amp; Services. And we have another asset, which is our global brand, our global reach.</p><p>Just small information, but we recently acquired a portfolio of customers for gas and power customers in Spain. We made some polls among the population to try to get -- to do to ask a question, which brand should we use. And 45% of the Spanish who answered to the poll knew Total, having a good image of Total, despite the fact that we leave, unfortunately, Spain 10 years ago, when we sold all our shares in CEPSA.</p><p>So this brand as an asset and the global reach it represents, and we should build on it. So these are, I will say, why we are confident. And not only to speak about the advantage, but to put them into action, in particular, on the technical competencies. Today, we have launched a project. It's still at a project, so it's not yet, of course, in, I would say, in action, which we call the One Tech Project. The idea is to concentrate all the group's technical expertise, which are spread today between E&amp;P, Refining and Chemical, Marketing &amp; Services and Gas, Renewables &amp; Power in one large technical center. This will represent the central organization, more than 3,300 engineers.</p><p>Why do we do that? Not at all to make synergies. No. We will add contrary. We want to leverage the existing expertise, which are high because Total -- the success of Total today are largely due to our technical competencies of our engineers and technicians around the world, but we want to really leverage that in order to give to our renewable and electricity business that will grow now at a large scale the, I would say, manufacturing and technical background that it requires if we want seriously to build this broad energy company, and this is our purpose.</p><p>If we want to foster innovation, we need to have -- to be able to allocate these competencies to these new businesses. And I will tell you, it's not only the company we want, it's our employees. Our employees today, really, they are all like in the society. They want to contribute to the climate challenge. They are in an energy company where you have the competencies, and I've seen when we propose them to tackle their emissions, they raise 500 IDs, different projects. So they are willing to contribute. Of course, they hear what is happening around us. This is a pressure on Total as an oil and gas company. But I don't want to be in the (inaudible) apart. They want to be together with -- in this transformation. And I think what we offer them will be unique opportunity to contribute directly to the transformation of the company.</p><p>So it's why I'm using transformation today for the first time in my speech. It's not only a matter of strategy, financial, capital allocation. It's a whole company that we want to embark in that projects globally, and in particular, again, our technical people, which are at the core of what is an industrial company like Total.</p><p>So you have the menu, I could stop my presentation there, but we have more slides in order to give you some details. And it's quite a little long, but I hope you will like the dishes one by one.</p><p>So the first one, and I will -- the first part, I will go through the gas, through the electrons and the liquids. So today, the presentation is an upstream downstream. It's a little different. We do it through segments of demand.</p><p>So gas is first. Of course, they are -- it's clear. And LNG, again, you understood, is at the core of our ambition. Why? Because this market experienced a growth of more than 10% per year in the last 5 years. The first semester, despite the pandemic, it was plus 7%. And I heard yesterday that in August, the Chinese demand has grown by 12% in August. So this is a market which, clearly -- because, in fact, in the energy transition, there is a strong case for gas replacing coal.</p><p>And when I heard this last week, President Xi from China announcing carbon neutrality by 2060, I'm sure it's one of the good news for promoting LNG. Of course, renewable will be there as well and hydrogen and EVs in China, but gas will be -- clearly, have a share -- a lion's share in that mix.</p><p>And so we are very well-positioned. On the top of it, there is not only the demand, but on the supply side, it's true that we face since last year a form of oversupply, which has been accentuated by the pandemic somewhere. But because of the pandemic, there is a lot of projects which are delayed in terms of sanctions.</p><p>This year, no new projects. Last year, all the commentators were afraid to see too many projects by 2025. The reality is that when you delay by 1 year and maybe 2, because I'm not very optimistic about next year and the oil price considering the inventories, if we did it by 2 years, there is no way to accelerate LNG projects. It takes 4 to 5 years to build.</p><p>And so that means that there will be a tightened supply by '24, '25, as you can see in this chart, maybe even in '23 even at only 5% growth. And that will benefit from Total -- to Total. Why? Because we sanctioned projects last year. And so we are in a very good position to benefit from this evolution of the market in LNG.</p><p>I will not be long on this one. You know that slide. We have established we are the #2 worldwide player in an integrated value chain. We are producing in 11 different plants. We have regas terminals. We have long-term customers. So world system is a matter of size integration to capture value.</p><p>For the next 5 years, we will increase our LNG sales to 50 million tonne per year from 35 million. So still an increase. And why? Because primarily, all production will grow by 10 million tonnes from '20; more or less to '30s, 18 million to 20 million. So that's a program.</p><p>And again, I will not be long. I will answer the questions that you have. But we have 3 flagship LNG projects, Arctic 2, Nigeria Train 7, Mozambique LNG. They all progressed well despite the pandemic, 38% progress for Arctic, Mozambique LNG engineering is progressing very well. It's project financing and in place and all the early works are done to welcome the construction.</p><p>Just a note, if you add the 3 figures which are at the bottom of this slide, it represents $1.5 billion of cash, which will be generated at the project level in group share. So you will understand why, after that, I will speak to you about growing cash flow from LNG.</p><p>And it's not only because we give you today a view not only to '25, but to 2030. What is an important message? In fact, with all the work which has been done in the last years, we have already in our portfolio enough resources to feed the future growth beyond '25 until 2030 by an additional 10 million tonnes. In fact, we have generated many options in, of course, the Russia giant Arctic resource with our partner, NovaTek, which is targeting 70 million tonnes of LNG by 2030.</p><p>In Mozambique, we're beyond the first phase. There is more to come, much more resources, which could be developed in synergies with other operators. We have in the U.S. projects which are expansions of existing plants, which are generally quite profitable like an expansion of Cameron and other new project we want to develop in Baja, California. And Papua LNG has been delayed because of the pandemic, but it's there and will be developed I'm convinced because of its geographic position. So it's another option, and there could be more to come.</p><p>So that means that Total will not spend a lot in M&amp;A to acquire LNG resources in the come -- in the next 10 years. We have what we need in our hand.</p><p>Again, I mentioned these figures already. We approached this -- all the integration that the LNG marketing and trading teams are taking -- are creating value from scale and arbitrage.</p><p>The strategy of Total -- let's just 1 minute on the right-hand side of this chart. As you can see, there is more and more integration. In fact, we want to dedicate -- when we take some market risk, when we market LNG by ourselves, we took it on our balance sheet. We want to do it in an integrated way. We think that being a pure merchant player is clearly is exposing to volatility of the markets, like it is the case today, where you are -- you have some commitments to offtake some LNG, but there is no real market to absorb it or at a very low price. And it's much better to come back to the integrated approach, which is that we will market the energy we produce.</p><p>Of course, as you know, in the past, we have taken some offtake commitments from the U.S. LNG. But in the meantime, we are developing positions. And so you can see that this white part at the top of the column is diminishing, and that will be the trend clearly to exit from a pure merchant risk, but to take the risk if we have on the -- also the profits coming from the production and the infrastructure, I would say, the LNG plant.</p><p>I would say that we have a good -- and again, you've seen this chart, this slide last year, but it's useful to us to express what it means, integration. It means that when we are developing a customer portfolio in Europe, either through gas-fired power plant or through customers, B2C and B2B customers, we are having a short, I would say, of LNG. It represent 11 million tonnes of short.</p><p>And these 11 million tonnes, we have the infrastructure to fill back. It's owned by us, the regas capacities. We have 20 so we can manage them, and we have also the portfolio in Europe will represent around 20%, 25% of our sales. And Europe is key because it's a very liquid market. It's very accessible. And so -- and you've seen that it's a sort of market with last results. We observed it last year when the price of LNG are low. Everybody is coming to Europe. It's better to be able to control your infrastructure. And by the way, we are quite happy to see our regas capacity building full and making money in this type. So it was, again, the advantage of integration.</p><p>So that's in terms of cash flows that you can expect from our integrated LNG business. We put there the 2019 figure at EUR 64 billion. So you can compare to what we'll be able to deliver in 2025. Again, the production will increase by 40% LNG production from 500 something to 800 on this period with the projects which have been all launched.</p><p>And you can observe that, in fact, we'll be able to deliver same cash flow at $40 per barrel, but last year at $64. You have 70% more or less of the LNG portfolio, which is linked to the oil price. It's why you have clearly an upside. And at $60, it represents between $1.5 billion to $2 billion extra cash flows. You had the same assumptions of NBP and GKM to be able to compare and to have the sensitivity to the Brent price.</p><p>So I've been long on gas, but I cannot stop there on gas without speaking about methane. Because, again, if you want to be consistent, we have to be consistent with the climate ambition. And the methane, when we speak about gas is, in fact, lowering our Scope 1 and 2.</p><p>And there, there are 2 information. The first one is on the right. In fact, when we look to our operated gas assets, I can say today but that we are almost near 0 emissions because methane intensity of our operating gas asset is lower than 0.1%. I don't know if we can measure it lower than it. But it means that, honestly, we are at the top of the class. We have nothing to -- we continue to drive it. And it's surely not to get him coming back higher, but we are very -- we are there in a strong position.</p><p>The methane emission of Total as a rule are coming more, in fact, from the oil business and from gas business. Globally speaking, if we take oil and gas, by the way, the average intensity is around 0.2%, and we'll look to drive down because as you see on the left, we have a program, and we are investing to continuously reduce our methane emissions. We've done 45% of reductions in the last 10 years. And we'll continue to drive down, in particular, by stopping flaring, by limiting the flaring or eliminating some coal vents on some mature oil fields. So there is a program, methane emissions, and really there, I think we are participants to many initiatives, and to be transparent on that. It's very important when we want to be a leader of natural gas.</p><p>The other way to, of course, to be consistent with our climate ambition is not only to invest in natural gas, but also in biomethanes and clean hydrogen, because these are the ways to decarbonize natural gas.</p><p>On these 2 business, it's quite new to Total. 2020 is an important year because we have established 2 business units, recruiting people outside of the company to bring expertise, 1 for biogas and the other 1 for clean hydrogen. I mean for hydrogen, but in fact, for clean. Clean means that we are color blind in Total. Even if I will tell you, that green hydrogen when you are investing a lot in renewables is, of course, quite attractive.</p><p>On biomethane, at this stage, we set the first target. Probably we will increase it in the coming years when we'll have a better understanding of all businesses. But we set a target, about 10% of the gas we supply to our CCGTs in Europe should come -- should be bioethane. It's a way to decarbonize our Scope 1 emissions in fact. And so this would represent around 5 terawatt hour per year.</p><p>On the green hydrogen side, of course, there are many interests in the company for hydrogen. It's, of course, for the marketing, it's a way to decarbonize, I would say, the road transportation, the trucks, buses, trains, private fleets. So we are looking to that business, where we are today, some small positions. I will come back.</p><p>But we are also looking to produce with hydrogen, and we will have a sort of porch showcase in</p><p>La M\u00e9de biorefinery, where we want to establish an industrial project with 100-megawatt solar plants, feeding a 30-megawatt electrolyzer. But now we are working on it, and we'll come back on it when we'll have clear IDs.</p><p>But it's clearly, in fact, in the next 5 years, our plan is to have 1 green hydrogen projects in our hands to better understand it. But the rear one with intermittencies, the storage issues and with real customers, and a blue 1, which means decarbonizing by capturing the CO2 from SMR and ascending the CO2 in depleted fields. This one, we are looking in the Netherlands. So that's for gas.</p><p>Now my second dish is electrons. This is a new one. You did not hear -- so you will hear a lot of electrons much more than you will ever hear within Total. But you have seen the news coming months after month since the beginning of the year. We have been quite active, and this is because -- by the way, all these activity of our teams, and in fact, it's just that we receive the fruits of what we grow for the last 2, 3, 4 years, in 2020.</p><p>And because of that, we have a better visibility, better understanding. I would say we have figures. We have models, which we can add and tell you today what we can deliver, not only in terms of capacity, production, but also in terms of results and cash flow like for the other business. And I think as soon as we told you we will spend more in that business, of course, we need to be clear about the value creation.</p><p>So we can do it today. We'll do it. And you notice what I already said. Our development in the electricity will be along the full value chain from production to trading through trading and storage, to customers. This is why we developed customers as well.</p><p>You have here some figures, and I will make one comment. You see that by 2025, we expect to have 9 million customers in France -- today, in France, Belgium and Spain, we have around 6 million customers. So we want to grow between today and -- in these businesses. I will produce, if you add the production, the net production coming from our gas-fired power plant and from renewables, around 50 terawatt net. The difference between being supplied in France by some power coming from the nuclear system at which we are eligible when you are a new competitor in the system in France.</p><p>But I will add another comment. And just to educate you the way we'll speak about electricity. You will hear us speaking about growth capacity and about net production. Why this choice? It's not to grow the figures like I read in the newspaper, not at all. It's just growth capacity. It's a way to -- it's a good metrics for understanding the development phase and the financial -- the CapEx that we need to finance if we want to build these plants, because we are ready to build and develop the plants at a 100% basis in Total. So that means a lot when you look to the development phase.</p><p>Having said that, growth capacity is not at all an either capacity, either growth or net. By the way, it's not the right metrics to speak about profit and loss, to speak about revenues, to think about cash flows. Why? Because like in E&amp;P, when I am announcing that we sanction Mero, we expect Mero 3. We speak about the project of 180,000 barrels per day, I think. It's 100% growth capacity. And then we have our own production. It will be 30,000 barrel per day net.</p><p>So there, again, we make the difference, and we speak about net production, which is the basis of all the P&amp;L, cash flows and revenues and which is another phase of the project. One, it has been invested and derisked. It is true and in our business model, and I will come back on the business model. We intend to sell 50% of what we have invested to cash in part of the value immediately, to de-risk also the project, and then we'll have in our net production 50% of what we have developed. So we will continue to speak about growth capacity and net production.</p><p>Last word. In electricity, capacity doesn't mean a lot of things. In E&amp;P, in my example, when we speak about 180,000, there is a good chance, but E&amp;P will produce 95%, I would say, of the capacity.</p><p>In electricity, when you speak about capacity, it's been staffing, because your solar plant will be around 20%. Your wind -- wind onshore at 30%, your wind offshore at 50%, and your gas-fired power plant, you don't know. It could be to 20% to 60%, depending on the weather or the other -- because it's not a base load. So that means, again, I'm advocating that this growth capacity is the right metrics in order to better evaluate the investment phase and net production for the P&amp;L.</p><p>So yes, I've been long, but I want to clarify that today.</p><p>So the business project I just mentioned, and I have often the question that all that is not profitable. I mean, it's not profitable. It's profitable. It maybe not delivering the same upside when we invest in the oil business because, of course, as I've seen in the previous slides, when you are in the oil business, you have the upside when the price is going up. You have also the downside when the price is going down, which is your business model is less stable, but it delivers profitability at the end.</p><p>And this is why we say we have a capital-light model. And the way we envisage our development in that business I reiterate to you is a typical project IRR will be around 5%. But we'll get first -- there is a lot of attractiveness from the financial world.</p><p>And why is there a lot of attractiveness from the financial world to finance these projects? Because this is the other part of the slide. These projects are offering predictable cash flows with long-term upside. And the predictability of the cash flow because of the PPA either granted by state or corporate PPAs are attractive enough to financial institutions to be able to bring money. And so we can leverage easily without being ourselves, I would say, a green company. But it's easy for Total to leverage all corporate balance sheets to finance this project with the same competitiveness, even better sometimes than our competitors.</p><p>So we put typically 70-30, but yesterday, we approved the project in Japan. It was 85-15.</p><p>That's why at the end, we can say that it's -- in terms of equity, we have to inject. In capital-light, it's quite -- we can leverage it. It's -- I would say -- and this is consistent with the CapEx we have announced. And then we will farm down 50%.</p><p>Why do we consider that farm-down is important? It's not only a matter of accounting is more fundamental to that. You are signing PPAs with third party, state or corporations for 10, 15 years. You never know what quite can happen. I'm afraid some state, even European state, could sometimes envisage to revisit their contracts. So farming down is a way to cash in immediately part of future revenues while derisking 50% of the project. I think, honestly, this is the same type of business models that we applied in our oil and gas business. We are never 100%. We share the risks because of the magnitude of it. But when you look to offshore wind projects, frankly, to be 100%, it would be quite brave. So there is risk at the end. The target permanently to us is to have more than 10% return.</p><p>Projects in Japan, we looked yesterday was far above 10%, more in the 20% plus, to be honest. But it's true that I can confirm to you that all the projects which have been announced by Total since the beginning of the year have reached that threshold of -- at minimum 10% and some of them are above, thanks to that mechanics.</p><p>So the other advantage is why we see some value to invest in renewables, is that it's strengthening our group business model, because it's balancing the cash flow risk profile by giving predictable cash flows. And it has some long-term upside. Because beyond this first period of PPA, there are some upsides.</p><p>Solar panels are there for 30, it's not for 15. And even if you have to change something, most of the investment has been done, including access to the land. And in the wind farm, you can change the turbines for higher -- for more powerful turbines and get more energy from your same location. So there is a life beyond the PPA.</p><p>And this is a value -- of course, we are entering into merchant markets with volatility, and the renewables will increase renewal volatility in this electricity market, that's clear, but it's offering to our successors in 15 years new cash flows with investments being largely done. The second upside will be to be able to produce green hydrogen from these renewable plants because you can have easy access to marginal 0 cost electricity and then store your energy. So it's a way to enhance the production capacity from your renewable investment.</p><p>And last but not least, trading, aggregation. The more you have decentralized source of energy, there is clearly added value to be able to aggregate all that and to deliver it to the grid. And that's a competence on which we are building in the company, and we will develop on that value.</p><p>So I was long there, but I think it's important to explain you why we consider that these investments in renewables and power is not only a matter of being responsible in terms of climate, it's also fundamentally to create value for the long-term for our shareholders.</p><p>So I did not mention it just for fun. I think you read it on the first slide that the capacity we are targeting by 2025 is no more 25 gigawatts, but 35 gigawatt. I know that people were asking them. Why do -- where is it coming from, the 25 gigawatt for 2025? The reality is that the activity of our teams has been great since, I would say, last 2 years. And today, when we look to what we have in our portfolio, we have already this 24, 25 gigawatt, 24 rather than 25, but let's say, we have them. We have 5 gigawatts, maybe 6, by the way, in operations. We have 4 or 5 gigawatts in construction, and we have built a pipeline, 5 gigawatts being announced in solar in Spain, in France and in other countries.</p><p>So the question to ask ourselves, okay, we are there. We know that in the renewable business for this type of solar and offshore wind -- onshore wind, sorry, not offshore, onshore wind. The time -- the duration of the project is 2 years, 2.5 years. So we can still increase our ambition by 2025, but we will continue to work in '21.</p><p>And this project, '21 to mid '22 will feed renewable capacity by 2025, which is why we have raised the bar on 35 gigawatts to 45 gigawatts, building again on the 2020 dynamic where I would say that we have not only able to capture opportunities but at a low entry cost, and that's a tribute to the teams.</p><p>So I speak about production, because at the end, as I will show you figures of P&amp;L, what is important is production, so 50 terawatt hours by 2025 of productions, 40% from gas-fired power plant, 60% from renewables. And 2040, clearly, priority will be given to the growth in renewables more than gas-fired power plants, because in Europe, we see a limitation to that. And the target is to reach the equivalent of 500,000 barrel per day, so 120 terawatt hour per year.</p><p>At this level, clearly, we will be among the top leaders in renewables. But the ambition of Total, we are among the top 5 in oil and gas, is to reach the same level in renewables. And that means that we'll have to have the enzyme to continue to feed our future growth by adding 10 gigawatts per year of new projects, of course, capacity.</p><p>This is an important slide, just to show you that what we are building today is quite a unique renewable portfolio because we look -- we'll have at the end for various vehicles a full worldwide footprint, representing again this 35 gigawatts. And you see that, of course, Europe will have a share lion -- lion's share, sorry. But we'll have the -- also quite strong, quite big in India, around 6 gigawatt. And China and the U.S. are also areas where we intend to develop. And South America, by the way, this -- when you look to this map, it's not exactly the same map that we have in oil and gas. So this business is rebalancing somewhere the group geopolitic profile. But again, I said to you, we have 1 competitive advantage, it's to think on a worldwide basis and to look to various opportunities. This is what you can see.</p><p>Strangely, Africa is not well-represented. It will be our next challenge. But I think it's because today, our renewable teams are going where it's more easy to have access to capacities. But I think with the One Tech story, I'm convinced that all the people who know very well Africa and the company will be able to accelerate that development in that continent.</p><p>I will not be long there because Philippe will come back in a zoom on offshore wind. Just to tell you, I mentioned it, that, yes, we have decided to be pioneer in floating offshore wind. We have no late. On fixed bottom offshore, we are late compared to some competitors, even if we acquired some interest in very large projects. But we think that there is a huge potential for offshore wind, but this technology will still benefit from strong policy support in coming years, and we want really to be at the forefront of this technology.</p><p>So these are the figures that I promised to you, not only figures, a little more than that. You have even (inaudible) the ones we want to try to measure what is behind. And so the important figures that will deliver this net production of 50 terawatt per hour by 20 terawatt hour per year.</p><p>In 2025, we'll deliver a result of $1 billion, cash flow of more than $1.5 billion and capital employed of $15 billion. People will make the math, we say it's a ROCE of 7%. But the clear part of that, in employed capital -- producing capital employed because we are in a growing mode. So we'll continue to feed capital, which are not all producing during this period of building this business.</p><p>So let's come to the third dish, which is a liquid, not to drink, to be sure, the water is fine. But there, the motto is value over volume. Clearly, again, remember what Helle explained you about the trends in the market.</p><p>And a word about the market having said that. And you have seen that all the presentation is done at $50 and $60 per barrel. And that when we announced recently our price deck for making our impairment test, we said we give a price deck, which in the coming years will -- is low, 35% today, but will grow gradually.</p><p>Why? Because I'm not -- I will not speak about OPEC, demand, et cetera. Today, I'm speaking about investments. We are -- I mean oil companies have lower investment. $300 billion will be invested in 2020 in upstream. I suspect that 2021 will not be much higher because everybody will be cautious about it. Only 250,000 barrel per day have been sanctioned, almost nothing. One of the project by way is in the Total portfolio with Mero 2 and maybe a second one with Uganda will be there. So we continue to work.</p><p>And on the top of it, not only lack of investment, but also shallow dynamic we observed in the U.S. in the last 3 years, which, of course, has somewhere overcome the lack -- the deficit of investments. There is less enthusiasm. Clearly, the financial investors, not only this year, but with last year, are asking themselves questions. So we think that the dynamic there, even for U.S. friends, are always surprising. It's much more uncertain than it was last year. And the lessons drawn by the fact that U.S. [shale] oil has been among the production which we are curtailed, among the first to be curtailed voluntary, I think, a strong signal. So our vision is that there will be reduced supply, not enough investments to compensate the natural decline, which is supportive for oil price medium-term rebound. I cannot tell you now, but by 2025, we we'll be very surprised if we don't see $50, even $60 per barrel.</p><p>But remember, by the way, but today, we are sad that we were at 72% in 2018. And also in this world and in the -- we are all well-paid to know that volatility means really something in the downside and the upside in the oil market.</p><p>So for Total, as I said, value over volume. It's a matter of fundamentally adapting our value chain in the oil business to the demand, and in particular, in Europe. We said we are integrated between production liquids because we have oil in condensate in that figure, of course, which are liquids, refining capacity and all product sales.</p><p>What you can see in 2019, because we have, in the last 10 years, begin to diminish -- to adapt our refining capacity to the demand in Europe, whereas a disconnect between ourselves and our refining capacity. But it's not only a matter of integration, and we will continue to drive down this refining capacity. By the way, we have done the work in the last 3 months for 2025 because we have announced the divestment of the Lindsey refinery and the transformation of the Grandpuis platform and the 0 oil platform with a unit of biofuels to produce more biofuels.</p><p>So that's a trend, I think. And on the demand on the sales, we'll increase biofuels and we will have again to adapt ourselves to the demand, in particular, in Europe where we are a very large retailer. So that's the business trends.</p><p>On the production side, let's say that we have built our position. And we are the leader in terms of low-cost producer among the majors. It's $5 per barrel, and we confirm that we'll maintain that label. I'm sure Arnaud and his team will do better, but $5 is already quite low. And so that's something which is embedded on strategy for 5 years to look for low -- oil low-cost oil. And this has helped a lot, of course, to diminish the group cash breakeven with the [alpha] as well of our downstream businesses in refining and marketing and everybody. But we are a low-cost oil producer, and we intend, of course, to build on that advantage.</p><p>Why are in such situation? I would just insist today a few minutes on the fact that we have a strong asset in our portfolio. It's our strong presence in the Middle East and North Africa. Because when you say my strategy is to focus on low-cost oil, where do you find it? To be honest, you find it in Middle East and North Africa.</p><p>And recently, we have continue to build that portfolio, accessing to the Abu Dhabi concession, accessing to Al Shaheen, accessing to Berkine Basin in Nigeria. So consistently, we have built this portfolio, which represented 40% of group resource. So when we say that strategy, it means that we have that already also. We are -- it's a history in Total. This represents 650,000 barrel per day of production, oil and gas, but the oil 450,000, which is 1/3 of the oil production of Total. And look, the average cost of production is $3.50 per barrel.</p><p>So this oil will be produced for long, for sure. And the profitability is good. Okay. I know that people say that in the Middle East, fiscal terms are tough. It's clear. But the $35 per barrel, this year, we are quite happy to have these productions, which giving us -- because there is less sensitivity, ROCE of 10% or $35 per barrel. I'm not sure there are many oil and gas assets which can deliver such a profitability this year.</p><p>And so this is a position, which we intend to continue to build. And if we have opportunities to grow in that region, Total will look carefully, and it's a priority.</p><p>Another region, which is -- just to fight the idea that deepwater is permanently high-cost business. When you look to the giant fields we are developing in Brazil, this can be qualified, because they are giant of low-cost opportunities. And we have built a material position in the last 5 years there, with the Mero development, which will produce almost 700,000 barrels per day with the Iara development, which has the potential to increase with operator Lapa.</p><p>We have in our hand, it seems, according to my explorers, a unique high-profile exploration license that we intend to drill soon. And Brazil, by the way, is not only a matter of low-cost oil offshore. It's onshore, a growing market for Marketing &amp; Services division for biofuel. So the attractiveness of Brazil for Total is -- it's an important country, large population, large markets, on which we intend to continue to grow.</p><p>By the way, it's also a land of opportunity for renewables and power and for LNG. So Brazil is one of this country, which is -- will be the focus of the strategy for the next 10 years.</p><p>I was speaking about exploration. People are asking us where do we go. You go with exploration and your climate ambition? How do you make all that consistent? I think it's clear that exploration will have also a challenge of transformation. Not to stop exploring, now please understand me, but to explore things, objects, prospects, which are in line with what we expressed, which is low-cost oil in terms of development, not in terms of drilling.</p><p>And that's something on which I know that Kevin McLachlan is working hard with his teams. Of course, today, our portfolio is not clearly with this trend. It was built. It's long to build a portfolio trend, but I can tell you that the new licenses that we will acquire, the executive committee will be very clear about the fact that we want to dedicate up to $1 billion. We kept the budget, but with $1 billion, you can find all on these targets, which fit with our strategy.</p><p>And I would -- I'm happy to say that today, we have a clear positive dynamic in exploration, and I pay tribute to the team, so explorers, in particular, with the Block 58 in Suriname where we entered last year, the 3 first wells have been 3 successes. They will have -- a fourth one is coming, and there is more to come in 2021. We have a number of prospects. We will have to appraise all that. It's [lighter] for the time being with gas.</p><p>But honestly, the challenge we have in -- given to us as we become operator very soon of Suriname is to do as we have done in Angola. In Angola, we discovered in 20 -- 1996, it was into production in 20 -- 2002 (inaudible) And it's possible that this is a Total block. Block 58 could be a golden book as Angola. And so the challenge will be to put into production Suriname by 2025, even if it's a short and quick development.</p><p>So that's somewhere in which we work and which will fill the future growth. Again, if it's giant, it will fit with the strategy.</p><p>Just to finalize on all because, again, it's a core activity for Total. Don't misunderstand my message today. We have a portfolio of projects, which have been sanctioned in '19, which we'll have sanctioned today this year, and which will come tomorrow, Brazil, Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria, Angola, and one of them being Uganda.</p><p>As you noticed, we have been quite active to act countercyclically. We made a deal with Tullow, which was this year better than the one we stopped last year. So we were right to stop and to relaunch. We have benefited from, I would say, a good hearing from the Uganda and Tanzania authorities, maybe because also the condition -- economic conditions are lower. So we are working on this one. The tenders are expecting this month. And we hope we'll be able to -- our target is to sanction the project before year-end.</p><p>All these projects, of course, when we sanctioned them, we review systematically the CO2 production and the way to -- if the teams are really -- designed the project to minimize the emissions. And because part of the climate ambition is to ensure that our investment in all projects are consistent with our climate ambition. And in particular, we look carefully to the carbon intensity of the project, but also of the returns. You can see that the portfolio of projects we have, all the projects have a return of more than 15% at $50. And the average technical cost, OpEx plus amortization, is around $16. So again, in line with the strategy.</p><p>Just when we speak about production or we must speak about Scope 1 and 2, because it's like on gas, I spoke about methane. We need to diminish our emissions. We set a target last -- beginning of last year, of the beginning of 2019, yes, of lowering our emissions down under 40 million tonnes despite the fact that there is an increase of activity, I would say, by 2025.</p><p>We are working on not only on that, and I confirm that we'll reach this 2025 figures. And we will maybe revise it, but we need to work.</p><p>What we have done this year is to mobilize all the teams. And recently, we took the opportunity of the 5-year business plan to ask them to come with projects to reduce. They proposed too many initiatives. I would say, 500 emission-reduction initiatives. Some of them were at $1 per tonne of CO2, some were at $200 or $300 per tonne. There was a whole spectrum, but we took everything. We didn't took everything, to be honest. That's not true. We put in our 5-year business plan all the initiatives that were under $40 per tonne, because it's a metrics we have selected.</p><p>The others are not forgotten. We will have to work for them to continue to relentlessly lower our CO2 emissions. But what I think is that I was very pleased, to be honest, with the results, is that we have asked, again, all our engineer and technicians to engage themselves. They have many ideas. We can cross-fertilize because some ideas which came around from one subsidiary could be used in another one. So there is a good -- great potential to lower the Scope 1 and 2 emission. And I'm confident we'll reach the Net Zero by 2050 or sooner even.</p><p>The other activity we have is around carbon sinks where our teams -- we have established 2 teams, 1 working on natural-based solution, the other ones on carbon capture and storage. You've noticed that we entered the Northern Light project. We'll not spend time today, but in February, I promise you that we'll come back on this Scope 1 and 2 emissions, the way to reduce them, the way to offset them by carbon sinks. And our colleagues will have the opportunity to make you some presentation, but we took the choice today not to be too long because of this virtual exercise.</p><p>And last but not least, it's like in gas, we speak about methane emission and when we speak about biogas, hydrogen. On all, we speak about Scope 1 and 2 of the reduce emission. And we speak about the biofuels because it's a way to decarbonize oil. And Bernard will make you an extensive Zoom on our ambition in renewable diesel. I will not be long there.</p><p>Just to tell you that first, we had a very -- a first good experience in La M\u00e9de. It's profitable, $350 per ton on -- in the La M\u00e9de of cash flow from operations. And so it's a profitable business, first. Second, that the refiners have one advantage that can easily convert refineries, existing plants into biorefineries, so it lowered the CapEx. So we have there clearly a role to play, and Bernard will explain to you that the ambition is to be among the top renewable diesel producer, reaching a minimum 2 million tonnes by 2025, if not 3 million and 5 million by 2030.</p><p>So it's finished for the part of the menu, which we are increasing energy in gas, electrons and liquids.</p><p>Now I'm going on reducing part, which is reducing emissions, and in fact, more importantly, adapting the energy sales to the market evolution, which is what I will focus now with a few slides in order to give you more details.</p><p>So first, that means that fundamentally, it's not at least -- when we said that we are willing to be carbon-neutral together with society, people say, \"Oh, it's a way not to do it.\" No, it's not at all the case. What we intend to do is to actively shape the demand by working with our customers, by pushing them to shift their sales to gas, their sales to gas and electricity or biofuels in power generation, in mobility and heating.</p><p>In power generation, we took the decision not to sell any more fuel oil to power generators from 2025. It's a way -- of course, we don't want to lose the customer, so we'll have to work with them, to adapt the system and to convince them that they can produce electricity with better tools. And in economic ways, we can develop storage solutions.</p><p>There is evolution of mobility on which I will come back and heating as well. There is where some business to be done with our customers. So it's a real engagement of the companies and the people, the teams in face of customers. Because, by the way, all customers themselves, most of them have the same ambition to go to carbon neutrality. So we meet together. We are in the same boat, I would say, to work in the same direction, bringing our expertise in, I would say, energy sources and their own expertise of their businesses.</p><p>So this is a few things. I will focus on, I would say, mobility and evolution of mobility going from oil and gasoline and diesel to other ways to run cars, planes, boats, biofuels. It's not only a matter of producing. And Alexis will come back on it.</p><p>We want also to grow our sales of biofuels in Europe, of course, where we are already the largest biofuel retailer, but also in the rest of the world. I mentioned Brazil. And biofuel should represent 10% to 15% of our fuel sales by 2030.</p><p>Gases for mobility is another axis of development. LNG for bunker fuel, we have been active. We are not only active. We have contracts. Now we have some bunkering barge in the North Sea, which had been launched last -- this month, I think. We have also natural gas for transportation. We have a position in the U.S. for clean energy, where we are a shareholder, but also we developed positions, in particular in Europe.</p><p>In Europe, we think by LGV and NGV, natural gas vehicles should be mixed to biomethane. We think that's a market that will evolve quickly to bio NGV rather than just NGV. But we also, when we think to develop in our position in India, where we are developing with Adani in the city gas, there is where -- there is a good opportunity to develop, and there is a policy by the government, a policy to develop CNG. In fact, in India, we intend -- the network we intend to build will be around an CNG stations.</p><p>And hydrogen, last but not least, few positions, in particular, in Germany. We are part of the H2 mobility ventures. There, we need to accelerate, and it's part of this new economy of hydrogen, but Europe wants to establish. Total will be one of the player of this hydrogen economy.</p><p>And last shot, but I will not be long because there, again, you will have a Zoom on electric mobility by Alexis and Philippe. The idea is fundamentally to take advantage of this emergence of this new business, huge growth by 2 ways, either to produce to manufacture batteries together with PSI. We had expertise of staff. And on the other way is to establish ourself as a leader on EV charging segments. You have probably noticed that we have some successes by -- in large European cities, Amsterdam, Brussels, London, now where we have acquired half of the existing charging points in the city of London.</p><p>Again, I'll let Alexis delve in that chart later.</p><p>So all these evolutions on the demand will translate into the ambition of Scope 1 and 2 and 3. This is the one announced in May about lowering our carbon intensity of the energy products. I would just like to remind a comment on it, just to be clear again, and it's because a small chart on the right you all know that it's better to repeat.</p><p>When you -- when Total sells jet fuel to an airline company, the airline company is using the jet fuel to make a flight on 1,000 kilometer journey. It will emit 22 tons of CO2. This 22 tons of CO2 are Scope 1 of the airline company. They are also reported in the Scope 3 of Total and the Scope 3 also of the plane manufacturer, in the Scope 3 of the engine manufacturer.</p><p>And so I know that for many people, oil and gas companies are so responsible for all Scope 3 emissions in the world. It's not the reality. And one more importantly is that the chart for business symbol. But if we want to tackle the aviation, energy demand and challenge, it will have to be done together. We have to make coalitions. And each company, which is on this chart, will have to bring his expertise to find solutions, and of course, the leaders will be -- each of them or each of us -- each of these companies in those segments.</p><p>So today, on the top of the May commitment, we have added what I have announced at the beginning of the presentation, the fact that the evolution of the sales pattern I just described by adapting or refining all product fuels. More natural gas, more electricity will be translated into commitments, 1 for Europe, minus 30% by 2030 on our way to Net Zero by 2050 and worldwide 2030 lower than 2050.</p><p>So I have finished all the dishes. Now I go to the desert, which is the last part, to speak about, okay, this is our strategy, broad energy company. We have some insights. Let's see what it gives at the end of the day in terms of results.</p><p>With 2 words, which are, for me, and for the Board -- it was a conclusion of our last Board, by the way, by one of the Board members. He said -- at the end, finally, it's a matter of resilience and a matter of growth and to be able to combine both resilience and growth in developing Total and convincing investors.</p><p>So of course, you know the fundamentals, the resilience is based on these 4 pillars. HSE delivery, cost and cash that we repeat, it's well into action in the company. The cash breakeven is under $25 per barrel in 2020. We intend to remain at that level. So that's the basics when you are in a commodity business.</p><p>We have to keep the discipline, it's clear, in particular, on capital investments. This strategy, with the strategy we have announced, we spent a lot of time to review, of course, our 5-year business plans to know what can we make. On one side, we need to give the space and enough capital expenditures to grow this renewable and electricity business. On the other side, as I said, we want to grow the LNG business and to maintain our core activity, which will give the future cash flows.</p><p>We came to the conclusion that we can do it with '22, '25. I will explain you why I make an exception on '21 at $13 billion, $16 billion, depending on the oil price, $50, $60. There is some flexibility, I think, one of the lessons of last year.</p><p>This year, it's dangerous to give a very precise figures. We have to be flexible and to keep some flexibility in the way we monitor our CapEx like Arnaud and his teams are doing on the short-cycle projects. We need to keep that in mind and not overcommit ourselves.</p><p>We have introduced a floor of $2 billion, as I said, for renewables and electricity. So we said, we will spend the $2 billion per year minimum from 2021. In fact, it's exactly the amount we'll spend in 2020. I'm not sure, for maybe a little more. We'll see, but we are in that range.</p><p>And so with $13, $16, we can develop the program I have presented to you. 2021 is a different approach. We don't want to launch a budget at $14 billion and then asking our teams in March to diminish it. I know it's quite a burden for all our teams, what we have done this year to resize all the budgets around the world.</p><p>So we prefer to start, I would say, at a level which is cautious, I'm clear. It's coming from the top. Let's spend EUR 12 billion. It's mainly organic cash flows, because we also know that in these times, selling assets -- it's not a very good time to sell assets. We don't want to lose value. So we'll start and build our budget on around EUR 12 billion.</p><p>We'll see after the end of this exercise. We'll come back to you in February. But of course, if there was a quicker recovery, we'll be able to activate some of the short-cycle projects which are in the end Arnaud and his teams, which we put for the time being on the back burner.</p><p>When we think about CapEx and OpEx, cost reduction, but clear that this year, we have accelerated, I would say, our saving programs. We announced in February EUR 300 million. In April, we told you -- April, $1 billion, we increased it. But I can confirm to you that we are on the track to deliver the $1 billion of savings in 2020.</p><p>So mobilization is very strong in the company. And we have decided to raise the bar there also and to raise it by another EUR 1 billion for -- by 2023. Of course, it's more and more complex because the company is, I would say, well-managed.</p><p>To be honest with you, if you would ask me if I can lay off 5,000 people, I don't know where I would find them. There is no way in Total. It's, by the way, I'm still convinced that the best way to mobilize -- and if our teams today are delivering the $1 billion, in fact, we told them, okay, we don't frighten them by speaking about lay off. It's a review concentrate on delivering from your assets and delivering the cost savings. And the company will be there. It's a matter of mutual support, but let's mobilize ourselves. And we have the way to weather the storm. I think this is a strong message in the company. And again, yes, there might be room to streamline headquarters, 10% maybe somewhere but not more.</p><p>And today, priority is more, again, to continue to optimize operationally in digital. We have launched, last year, and we presented to you back in February, some digital initiatives. We didn't cut anything there. We continue full speed to deliver this $1.5 billion value, which was proposed by -- promised by the teams. We have taken some immediate decision to freeze oil treatment, which is a way to save some cash. Of course, it cannot be long term. But again, my message there is that we will deliver the $1 billion and the extra $1 billion by 2023.</p><p>So coming to the end of the presentation, just to wrap up what we said about the production, which is [feeding], again, the Upstream production is key because it's, I would say, most of the cash flow is coming from this production. So on the 2019, 2025, we propose you a figure, which is a little wrong. And on average, it will grow by 2% per year. In fact, like we told you last year, there is a sort of plateau between 2019 and 2022, and the start of the ramp-up will go from 2023. In fact, '23, '24, '25.</p><p>So this 2% per year, which make more or less 10% to 12%, it should be spread more about 3 years than on the 5 or 6 years, which is there. But it's just to give you -- of course, it's lower than last year, to be clear. Because last year, we were thinking to acquire Algeria and Ghana assets from Anadarko. We took the decision not to do it because it was part of the, I would say, savings we had to do. So we have lowering our ambition by 2025. But we have also, as we described, a portfolio of opportunities, which will allow us to grow our cash flows.</p><p>The quota impact has to be noticed as well. This is why I'm prudent on the coming years. This year probably, we'll end up by around 2.9 million barrel of oil per day because that is good news. The OPEC countries and non-OPEC countries are really implementing the quota. So it's good because it's supporting the price.</p><p>Of course, the growth will mainly come from products from LNG, as I told you already, and the growth is also helped by the fact that we have quite a low decline in our portfolio because of long -- about 50% of production in long plateau, which results in growing cash flows, which is the blood of the company. So this chart, you can see that last year, by the way, we told you we'll have $1 billion per year of extra cash flow. This year, we're somewhere about $5 billion because there, again, it's difficult to speak of per year because next year, we propose you at $40, so it's not linear.</p><p>But when we took the last 12 months, the average is $51. And the year 2025 of $50, and we compare the cash flow generated, the growth will be $5 billion at $50. This is the amount of cash -- additional cash flows. But it will be different, it's not the same $5 billion than last year because we have less production on the Upstream part, as I just said, but we have more electrons, and the electrons and the electricity business will deliver $1.5 billion. So in fact, it's not that we are back to the $5 billion, but not in the same way. We demonstrate, by the way, but decided to drive the strategy to accelerate the strategy to become a broad energy company is delivering same type of results in terms of additional cash flows.</p><p>You can see the sensitivity. Another comment on this chart, $40 per barrel. Why did we mention it there? That should give you an indication to -- on which basis we say that the Board confirmed that we support the dividend at $40 per barrel. And you can see that, by the way, if we are able to weather the storm at $40 per barrel, we will also benefit in the future years of the growth we are expecting from our businesses.</p><p>This leads to this chart that you know very well. The cash flow allocation for Total did not change in order of priority. The first priority is capital investments. We have adapted it to, I would say, the strategy. It's -- we just said $13 billion, $16 billion, '22, '25, more than $2 billion of renewables and power. The second priority is supporting the dividend of $40 per barrel. And I confirm you that after having done the 5-year business plan, the Board spent some time to look to various scenarios, confirmed the support.</p><p>And then, of course, in this, I would say, difficult times, it's not easy to speak on the medium and long term. It would be premature to speak about growth. But the next priority will be on the balance sheet. And we also have always said, today, our gearing is growing up, of course. It was under 20%. We'd be probably around 23% by the end of the year, I think, which is acceptable.</p><p>But if we have additional cash flows, we will dedicate them after capital investments to deleveraging the company and going back under 20%. This will be the next priority. And if we have more, we'll have time to discuss, we'll be flexible, share buyback, dividend increase, but let me be clear, priority is today supporting the dividend, investing in the company according to the strategy, supporting the dividend at $40 and gearing under 20%.</p><p>It's not -- I know that for shareholders today, it's not only a matter of dividends and returns, cash returns. It's also a matter of ESG, and the -- a lot of you investors attach importance to this ESG commitment. A corporation like Total has to be a responsible company in all its dimensions and to bring to society, not only benefits and profits, but more than that. I would first notice that Total has been, this week, announced -- designated by the UN Global Compact as a lead company.</p><p>In fact, we are a lead company for the last 3 years, which is a good recognition of the efforts we do in that field. Of course, my whole presentation isn't -- was about climate change environment. So the E of the ESG, I would say, I covered it extensively during 1 hour, Net Zero. We are publishing today our new climate report, the annual climate report. At the same time, we have published yesterday our new and updated biodiversity policy because this is the other big challenge for the planet. And so I would say we are covering as much as we can the E of the ESG part.</p><p>So social is as much as important. I mentioned to you that we will go through this crisis with no big layoff. Solidarity, mature support is the real value of the company. And I think it's a demonstration of our social engagement. Safety was explained to you, presented to you by Arnaud. And I would say a word about diversity. Gender equality in Total is a reality in terms of salary and pay, for sure. In terms of responsibility, we can progress. We have progress, but we can progress more for international managers for women as well. So that's a focus of -- on the -- of the group on which we have set some objectives as a management.</p><p>And the G, the governance. I would first, I remind you that last year, maybe it was -- it's not an (inaudible) the fact that the Board has submitted the general assembly of shareholder. It was voted, new bylaws which gives new duty to the Board. It's in return. It was well done already to oversee social and environmental stakes. It's part of -- on each project. So we take care to -- and the Board is very interested to understand the condition in which all this social and environmental stakes are taken into account in the project we submit for approval.</p><p>In terms of governance, I am Chairman and CEO like traditionally in the French companies, but we have a lead independent director, which is quite engaged. It was Patricia Barbizet, now it's Marie-Christine Roquette. And she's directly engaged with shareholders and she will have some roadshows herself, independently as the Chairman and CEO, and she will report to the Board and she's very lively.</p><p>And last, but not least about governance, my compensation is linked, not only to climate, also to ESG indicators. So I think this ESG approach is well embedded in the model and the governance of the company.</p><p>So about the last slide, coming to the end. Again, summarizing, I would say, the compelling investment case, that is Total. What we offer to you today is on one side, to transform Total into a broad energy company, which will really taking onboard the commitments on the carbon -- getting to carbon neutrality with a strong commitment on Scope 3 absolute targets. We will grow, but at the same time, we will have -- we'll be able to tackle the dual challenge. Growing on one side, profitably, of course, while decreasing emissions, more energy and less carbon.</p><p>And you have noticed that we still come from LNG and renewables. And of course, at the same time, we are offering that strategy to this concept of a broad energy company, profitable board energy company, and we offer to investors a high-yield dividend, I can say. And we intend to support it as much as we can. And so this, I think, and the Board is convinced, but what we call Total energies with a big S is a real compelling investment case, which should support stock creating.</p><p>Thank you for your attention, and I propose that we'll go to the Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the first question comes from the line of Jon Rigby from UBS.</p><p>JONATHON RIGBY, MD, HEAD OF OIL RESEARCH AND LEAD ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: So a couple of questions. The first is on the -- getting some sort of assurance around the investment that's now going into the renewable space. I can see the strategic rationale. It's clear. And you do talk about it being lower risk.</p><p>But I think there's clear examples in the past. You are one of them with SunPower, for instance, where it's clear that the company entering a new area of operation doesn't fully understand all the risks that they are dealing with, and that's not an accusation to yourself. I think others have found the same issues.</p><p>And so what I wanted to ask was -- is to what degree and what assurance can you give us that you are comfortable that the risks you're taking, you have been able to sort of incorporate into your planning? And I'm sort of very struck by what looks like increasing sort of conventional wisdom that 5% or 6% return on assets can be grossed up to a 10%-plus return on equity in an increasingly competitive environment. So I just wonder if you could just talk about that in the round.</p><p>The second is, if you're correct, however, I'm struck by the capital structure you described at the end. So driving gearing back down below 20%, reiterating the dividend. Does the capital structure in the way that you do with capital going forward change as the business mix changes through the 2020s?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Jon, I think that first, on renewables, again, Philippe will come back extensively. And I think that we are engaged in this business not from today. We made some mistakes. The first investment in SunPower was not the best idea, but since 2016, we have built teams. We have invested in Total Eren in a minority position to learn, to better understand, to evaluate, to see because Total Eren is driven by experts in renewables. So the CEO was the previous CEO of EDF Energy, new energies, which one of the success leader of the bill. So we have made that investment.</p><p>We have made some direct investments and recruited people. And I can tell you that at the executive committee of Total, which is meeting every 2 weeks, and where we approve all investments above EUR 20 million, I think in that [fair]. We have, I think, every week now, a renewable project. So we learn and so it's accelerating and advancing, but of course, we are asking more and more comfortable.</p><p>And if today, I am able, for the first time, in front of you, to tell you, yes, we embark in this board, it's a new strategy, and we are able -- I use the word transform, and we will push -- we have ambitions that we put into -- in terms of net production of the equivalent of 500,000 barrels per day in 205 years, [barrels] and byproduct, is because as the CEO and with the executive committee, we have the feeling we have. But we analyze the risk of those projects.</p><p>It doesn't mean that -- by the way, it's true that we have to anticipate, what does it mean a world, an electricity market in Spain, for example, where you will have so many solar plants, intermittents, going to the grid, and all producing when the sun is at the top and less when -- I mean, there is -- in the night, there will be, of course, an intraday volatility, which could be huge, which, by the way, means that it's why the word storage appears in the presentation, and we have, remember, acquired staff with the idea that it will be helpful to develop energy storage capacities in the coming -- in the future to develop the renewable business.</p><p>But it's clear that the electricity world, not only for Total, for everybody, will offer new patterns, which could -- with new risk. It's why, by the way, we need to be very strong as well, developing our trading teams to be able to interconnect the market and to deliver the value out and to manage that risk.</p><p>So my -- if today, we are able to shape that strategy and to show you some figures and to give you some objective, 5 years is not far from there, or it's tomorrow. It's because we consider that we have a good understanding. I would not have done that presentation even 1 year ago. But we have, again, accelerated, and our teams are delivering to us more and more projects. So that's the first question.</p><p>And honestly, on the return target, I don't lie to you, Jon. I can tell you, the model works. Of course, let's be clear, it works because there is, today, very low interest rates in the market. That's clear. But I will tell you is interest rates are coming up again. If the project will not be developed at 5%, then we need more, not only for Total, but for the competitors. So that's clear. But today, you are in a specific situation where you can leverage this very low interest rates. And at the end, all the equity we engage and the 10 gigawatts projects we have announced this year, have a return of 10. It's a minimum because in India, it was 13, Japan 20, I mentioned. So you have more. So it's -- there is no miracle. It's just the situation of having access, I would say, to capital with a very -- I mean, to finance with very low interest rates.</p><p>I don't know if I -- this capital surcharge has changed as business change.</p><p>JONATHON RIGBY: sort of the balance sheet and sort of pay out.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: The question, honestly, I'm not sure if I captured it. Sorry?</p><p>JONATHON RIGBY: Is the -- it was -- the sort of follow-up was that the capital structure that the idea of where you want gearing to go, where you see the dividend is sort of couch still in very much in sort of oil and gas major terms.</p><p>Meaning is that going to still be the case? Or would you look at different capital structure models as you go forward because the business model changes?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Yes, but no. I think to be clear, Jon, I think we cannot shift from 1 day to the other. I'm convinced that we are, today, our challenge is to convince the investors that the model we propose, which is to create this multi-energy company, this broad energy company, having some -- on one side, oil and gas and electricity and renewable is viable and that we can develop. We need time to do that again.</p><p>And to the time, I think what we think is the best position for this transformation for us as an oil and gas major, but we still are, and we intend to remain. We don't enter into a decrease of our oil and gas business. Even if we stabilize in 2013, the oil production could be a little lower. This is not what we offer.</p><p>We need -- I think we are offering to investors 2 things: on one side, a dividend high-yield because it's a way to tell us give us time to do that, and we will continue, and trust us and give us the time. And at the same time, let us, allow us to reinvest part of the cash flows in growing this renewable and power business. So it's premature today to say what you propose to change the payout, et cetera. I think this is -- and again, we do it because we consider, but we can do it in the financial balance of the group, of the company.</p><p>And this was the whole exercise we have done since in the last 6 months. We understand at which pace should we invest in order to grow at the -- according to our ambitions. And so with the structure of capital and spending, we said, we can, at the same time, offer this, I would say, maybe unique model, but we want to offer to the market and to investors a high dividend. And at the same time, giving us the time and the money to change the pattern of the company.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from the line of Martijn Rats from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>MARTIJN RATS, MD AND HEAD OF OIL RESEARCH, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: I had 2, if I may. The first one is about expressing your total energy production in that figure of petajoule per day, which I really appreciate, and I think is hugely interesting. We, ourselves, have done some analysis on expressing the financials of a broad range of energy companies per unit of energy, per joule. And one of the things that struck me in this analysis is that if you look at companies that are more in the renewable space or the utility space that their capital employed or their CapEx budgets per unit of energy, per joule, are hugely higher.</p><p>They're about sort of 4, 5x higher than oil and gas, which is already a capital-intensive industry. So now sort of going through these numbers, I tend to delve, frankly, since the capital intensity is so much higher, maybe we should just expect that over time, the total energy output of companies like Total and your peers, that they will actually just shrink, i.e., there's only so much CapEx that goes around. Just if you move into a more capital-intensive area, maybe just keeping up total energy output might just be simply too challenging.</p><p>But today, you're presenting a sort of kind of sort of contrary sort of view to this in the sense that, not only are you talking about total energy production going up, but then seemingly also moving into these very capital-intensive areas. Now we often have discussions about what are the returns that lie on the other side of all these investments. But the transition itself is also quite interesting in the sense that it sort of suggests sort of quite a large CapEx hump, a period of very rapidly rising capital intensity.</p><p>And I recognize that this is quite a long-winded way for asking, in principle, a relatively simple question. But are you sure that $13 billion to $16 billion in capital expenditure is really enough to make this -- the changes to the business mix that you propose, rising total energy output in more capital-intensive areas. Is this $13 billion to $16 billion really enough for that in the long run?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Again, for the next 5 years, the way we have done it, I can tell you, it's a clear approach where we looked to what is the amount of equity we need to inject in all our renewable projects in order to grow. So we have made it. And we know because we have, again, between -- we have various models between the Indian projects, the Spanish projects, French ones. So today, we have various models. So we are able to have a mix and to have a good evaluation of what will be required.</p><p>And as I said, to grow at this pace that we propose to reach the 35 gigawatts by 2025, we need $2 billion plus, I would say. We put that as a floor. And we look also to the rest of the company to look to what can be arbitrated or not without impairing, of course, the cash flow of the company. And that's -- the results that we gave you are a clear, I would say, bottom-up approach of the organic CapEx that we need. Then there are assumptions about acquisition and divestments, which are giving you the capital -- the global capital investments.</p><p>But yes, I'm confident with this figure. And again, it's clear that -- and that's the advantage of being a -- not a utility, but maybe an oil and gas company is that we have the average of the oil price. And so is the price going up again? It will go up [again]. We'll have extra cash that we can allocate in order to monitor this Capex, why we give you a range. But yes, Martijn, I'm confident that we can stick within the $13 billion, $16 billion range.</p><p>It's also true that doing that, we have made some arbitration in some segments in line with the old strategy, I would say. So we revised the old assets that we have, not only in Upstream and in Downstream as well to say, \"Okay, what do we want to do in this segment? How much do we allocate of capital?\" And because the demand will change, so why should we invest in many retail networks if we think very well demand will lower?</p><p>So that's question mark. So there are some arbitration behind it in line with the strategy, but no, I'm confident on it. I think on the first point, again, I -- the many -- I tried to spend a lot of time myself, I can tell you together, to read the reports of all our competitors and the utilities competitors, their financials, to better understand their metrics and to be -- because we wanted to make a presentation where we could find the metrics, which could be consistent.</p><p>To be honest, where -- the notion of CapEx is not maybe not exactly the same, but us there, I have the impression, if they take the full CapEx, I would say, the gross CapEx, we take the net CapEx. When we give you a CapEx figure, this is the equity part we take into our CapEx figure. Of course, the off-balance sheet is not in the CapEx figure. Of course, that means that the off-balance sheet, I'll be clear, of Total will grow. But from this perspective, our -- we have a robust balance sheet, I would say.</p><p>And at a certain point of time, it will not go indefinitely because you will recircle your leverage because once your projects have been delivered, you can after 6, 7, 8 years, you are recirculating the same amount of balance sheet commitment. So I would say that's the way we look at it. So I'm -- but I'm pleased that you support the petajoule-per-day approach. I hope that all your peers, which are participating in the call, will do the same.</p><p>Yes. To be honest, I have difficulties here, too, to transfer all that. Okay. Next question.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Lydia Rainforth from Barclays.</p><p>LYDIA ROSE EMMA RAINFORTH, DIRECTOR &amp; EQUITY ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: And then I will get used to petajoules as well. Two questions, if I could. The first one, on the tech center that you're establishing, can you just walk me through, how is that different to the digitalization factory that we were talking about back in February? Does this build on that? Or are they 2 completely separate areas?</p><p>And then the second one is -- and it's linked a little bit back to Jon's question earlier, there is a lot of change within Total. You are accelerating that change. How do you prepare the organization to perhaps move more quickly than it has in the past?</p><p>So for example, you talked about Africa and wanted to build up the renewables capacity there. How do you do that quickly enough now? And effectively, does that decision-making process need to change from what it has been historically?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Okay. The first one, no, it's different, Lydia. Maybe I have not been clear. The Digital Factory is purely dedicated to digital. Of course, it's working for all the divisions and the Upstream, refining and chemical, marketing and service. It's established. It's a new tool, 200 engineers going to 300. We don't want to disturb them. It's brand new. So we'll let them work. They might be, later in the future, we'll see, but we don't want to disturb that. They have to deliver.</p><p>We have some, I would say, a road map of many business cases, which are, by the way, given to them by the assets, not by the technical centers and technical divisions. So of course, you can think we can merge everything. This one we tend to protect because we want -- we have a clear objective for delivering value by '23, '25, and we want to build it to raise it. Maybe later, we'll see if we need to bring them.</p><p>The technical center, we want to take, the 1-take concept is really to take all the divisions which are supportive of operations and projects in E&amp;P, in refining and chemicals, in marketing, they are more -- not so many. And in gas renewables and power, they are quite minimum, but there are quite a lot. There are some hidden competencies somewhere in the direct subsidiaries. And to bring all together in order to be able, again, to use existing the competencies to build this industrial bases for our gas, renewables and power.</p><p>And also for, I would say, training, helping them to -- in terms of evolution of competencies, so that's a different approach. But again, the idea is to have a core center and I would say to use the existing competence to build our renewables board and power business.</p><p>To Philippe, you take the second one? Renewables in Africa. What do we need to do? I will tell you what we need to do is to change the regulators of electricity in Africa. But...</p><p>PHILIPPE SAUQUET, PRESIDENT OF GAS, RENEWABLES &amp; POWER, TOTAL SE: Yes. Clearly, it was stated, there is a real potential of developing renewable in Africa because mainly with solar, we can compensate for the lack of development of the grid, and there is a lot of sun. Having said that, with our costly project, yes, they are capital-intensive. And so we need to have a stable scheme in order to invest on a profitable and safe basis.</p><p>And therefore, yes, the negotiation are taking place with the various governments in this continent. And there are some small projects that are now being developed. We have some plans already in South Africa. There are some under development in other countries. But yes, this still takes time because, yes, we want to develop this business on a profitable basis.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: But your question is good, Lydia, just to add something. I think until now, we have developed a renewable business, I would say, as separate teams. Many teams and trying to answer, as I answered to Jon, to better understand the business, to Africa, for example, has been it's Total Eren, which is in charge of Africa, which has its own objective. And it's clear that in Africa, honestly, I was joking, but we face, in fact, where we were trying to make gas to power plants I remember in Nigeria, I think Arnaud has worked hard on this type of project like myself.</p><p>We face the fact that, unfortunately, financing a power business in Africa is quite challenging. And in fact, we could hope that with renewables, which are smaller projects, it could face, which could solve the issues, but it takes some time because people are not prepared, in fact. So that's a challenge. But I think also that is signal because today is a very important day. As I said, we have announced to attempt the concept of 1-take. And I think a lot of my employees, I think, around the world are listening to what we say. And I'm convinced that there is a signal there that these renewables and power are absolutely part of the business model of Total.</p><p>And so when we'll go tomorrow, I've been in Angola. So I can say because there, our MD is already taking care of our solar projects. But when we go in all these countries, it will be obvious for management locally but they have the right even if they are in charge of E&amp;P to look to renewable projects, and we're a driving force, and then maybe we'll go quicker. So I think some [of which] phase would be enthusiastic. You know what we've done in Qatar as well has been on the same source of philosophy. So my view is that the signal is launched today that, yes, we are embarking in this strategy on a worldwide basis. And I'm sure more and more ideas will come and people will embark into because they are all willing to contribute to this climate change challenge.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Oswald Clint from Sanford C. Bernstein.</p><p>OSWALD C. CLINT, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO., LLC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to ask a first question on integration across the electricity value chain as well. But more specifically, on the final side of the customer side. Now I want to get your thoughts whether you think you need to have more big customer and partnerships to really maximize the value in this chain. You -- I mean you talk about retail customers in Europe, but I wanted to see if -- do you think that's enough?</p><p>Or you should be focusing as well on some of these big global corporates, like, for example, some of these tech companies and just offering them global power contracts that utilities can't. I mean, I know you have 60% of your customers in Europe, and that's your base, but there's a lot of competitors that are also trying to sell them clean power. That's the first question.</p><p>And secondly, it's good to see the current conviction around the gas and the LNG. But I wanted to zoom in on India. I mean, a lot of LNG import growth in LNG expected in India. You have a position there with Adani, but a little bit tricky for us to see just how profitable that value chain, LNG value chain is in India. The Indians' clearly very good at getting low LNG prices. So I wonder if you could perhaps share a little bit of color around that LNG supply chain as it relates to India, please.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: We'll leave Philippe answering to the India question. On the first one, I'll be clear, with Philippe as well, we are working with the same big companies. These big tech companies are very good to make competition. And so today, they want to sell the cloud to Total. And so they access the cloud to my colleagues and selling sections of the cloud. They all want to. They are ready to take 50 megawatts of solar plants, which is not enough.</p><p>Now but we have this type of discussion, obviously. You have noticed probably that we have done something last week. Philippe will come back on it. This -- in his presentation, something quite original. We have assigned to ourself, it's ourself the largest corporate PPA between solar plants in Spain and all our European plants in the company. That means that we have designed a model where -- and the intent is to offer it to big corporations that we have done it for ourselves.</p><p>So we know if we can manage the risks of such a contract. And so the idea today, of course, is that you'll to need to do it with Total, but we have done it for us and to go, and we have some discussions, to be clear, corporate levels at high corporate levels, sometimes CEOs are involved themselves in other. Because all -- there's a lot of companies, not only the tech ones, who are willing to green their electricity. Everybody is committing today to carbon neutrality.</p><p>And so this is a business, which will lead to what we call corporate PPAs, which will probably the next wave of 1. So on these ones, yes, we are willing to develop partnerships. At the end partnership, they are big words, but at the end, it's what do you sell to me and what do you buy to me? Let's very be clear. I'm like for ownership, but it's more immaterial because none of them wants to be really, I think, in the end, on only 1 supplier. The -- none of them, even if they like to establish monopoly, they don't want to be in the end of an employee in front of them.</p><p>So that's -- but again, that's clear. It's part of the -- and that, by the way, it's back to something on which -- but I don't know, maybe Philippe will come back on it. It's all what we call the Solar Distributed Generation business, which is not big solar farms, but I think Philippe will come back on it in his presentation. So I will leave him to.</p><p>India LNG value chain?</p><p>PHILIPPE SAUQUET: India, clearly, we see high growth in even 2020, we see a very high growth in India, which is becoming one of the largest LNG markets. So development is already a reality in India. You have to be aware that we have been in India since now 15 years when we were partnering with Shell in Hazira and so we know exactly the behavior of the Indian customers.</p><p>We have never been selling under the market price, I can tell you in India. What is clear is that when the prices are low, we are selling more LNG when the prices are high. But across the years, we've managed to fill -- to fill a 0 and to make profit during the years. And with the partnership that we have, we've had any with the fact that now, yes, we will be players inside India, and we see room for optimization and for profitable growth. We are confident that, yes, we can combine growth and profitability in India.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Adolff from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p><p>THOMAS YOICHI ADOLFF, HEAD OF EUROPEAN OIL &amp; GAS EQUITY RESEARCH AND DIRECTOR, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions from me as well. Just going back to your beautiful charts on renewable generation and how you're showing your target IRRs of more than 10%. I believe this time last year, you presented it as at least 15%, including farm outs. Looks like a bit of a downgrade here. Or are we talking about a wider range across the different geographies you've entered since?</p><p>And the second question is relating to your credit rating. And correct me if I'm wrong, single A is probably the minimum acceptable to operate your business effectively. And if my numbers are correct, your credit metrics were consistent with the single-A rating in 2019, around 44% funds from operations to adjusted net debt. But you are below the 30% threshold in 2020 and probably less than 25% at least on my numbers using Brent at $40 and assuming cash flow after interest of $15 billion, $16 billion.</p><p>So if we assume you pay your dividend 100% cash and no script and that $8 billion of CapEx is $13 billion, oil stays at $40 and refining margins don't recover as you assume. How do you drive it back to 30% in the next few years if asset sales are also difficult?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: I will leave to Jean-Pierre. He can answer the second question. Jean-Pierre?</p><p>JEAN-PIERRE SBRAIRE, CFO, TOTAL SE: Yes. So credit rating. So as you know, Moody's and S&amp;P dramatically changed their price deck. It was in March or April after the drop in oil prices. So at this time, we are able to maintain our rating. The change was their [perspective]. So we were before stable. Now we are -- we have a negative outlook.</p><p>I just see -- I think it was mid-September that S&amp;P maintained its outlook for 2021 and 2022 at $50 per barrel for price deck. And $40, by the way, for 2020. So at this level, I do not see any reason given the resilience that Patrick mentioned to you to be downgraded. So having the discipline regarding our gearing, having these targets maintained again, along 20%, I think will protect our credit rating. And I think that it will be well received by the agencies.</p><p>THOMAS YOICHI ADOLFF: But if we stay at $40...</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Okay. And if at that time, that means you are right, it was September 2019 when last year, I was looking to the presentation because I had always in mind my 10%. So that means that we'll come back to the question of Jon. We have learned in the year, and we realized that if we wanted to be successful, to get some projects, we have to accept to -- the target to have 10%, but at 10%, we are successful. I can tell you. This is what I mentioned during my speech.</p><p>But at 10%, we have been able to get the projects and to put them in our portfolio. So that means that this is the right metrics that we need to consider if we want to develop the business. But the ambition last year maybe it was because we had more Japanese projects in our heads than some Spanish projects, I would say, other areas. But -- so the metrics that I gave you today, I can tell you, but at this level, we are competitive.</p><p>In fact, let me be clear, it's always the case. If you go to be competitive in a stupor Middle East tender, where you have everybody is coming, I can tell you, at 10%, you are not winning. By the way, and what have you, we lost, but we win in Qatar. So that's different. But the idea is like always in the business, is to try to have direct negotiation. And what we've done in Spain, having access to 3 pipelines of 1 plus 1 plus 3 gigawatts, direct negotiations, and that means that you have to have the smart teams on the ground. You don't operate that from Paris. That means that, in fact, that's -- I would say, what could limit our -- the ambition is that what I observe is that in renewable electricity, you all know that it's a national approach that you need to have, national regulators.</p><p>And to identify the good opportunities, you don't do that with bankers in Paris, which always come to you with the big M&amp;As. But if you want to be smart, you have to have teams. So we have a good team. I can pay tribute to them in Spain. That's clear. And I think the more -- if we want to continue to grow, we'll have to put the teams in the various countries where we will think there is a development to be done. Clearly, we will establish something in the U.S. coming because there is, of course, big companies, but you have plenty of opportunities in the U.S. as well. So that's something.</p><p>And last comment for you Thomas, is that that's true, that the returns are lower than -- for oil and gas, yes, but the risks are not the same as well. You know when you sign a PPA, which we are not going to use, so usually 15 years, in oil and gas, I have nobody which is giving me a predictable revenue. So that's chicken and egg, but again -- so I don't -- I will not come back to you with lowering my 10% next year.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Irene Himona from Societe General.</p><p>IRENE HIMONA, EQUITY ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE CROSS ASSET RESEARCH: Patrick, I'm looking at priorities 2 and 4 of the cash allocation, dividend and buyback. You used to communicate in terms of the proportion of cash flow that was right in the previous strategy to return to investors. Today, you told us the dividend is supported at $40 gearing to come down.</p><p>During this transformation period, and given your view that lack of investment may very well push prices towards $50 or $60, but of course, you need to continue to invest in low carbon. So in this new -- in this transformation period, what is the right proportion of cash flow that assuming you delever the balance sheet would be correct to return to investors?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: I'm not sure I even expressed in this presentation a percentage of returns of cash flows. Having said that, honestly. This was a difficult part is where I made an introductory comment of coming to you today. You can understand that in these times where we are today, already Total and the Board of Total is quite bold by confirming, repeating that we support the dividend of $40. When at the same time, all our competitors in Eastern Europe have just given up on their dividend. So I think it's already a strong signal to investors that we are ready to maintain a high-yield dividend. Even if, as I said, the Board is expecting some stock rerating thanks to that policy.</p><p>Going beyond, and at the same time, we do it, but it's true, but we are using the balance sheet as we are increasing the gearing. And so that means that the Board is, because as seen in the figures, the resilience of the company is ready to support. But at the same time, is thinking that the priority will be, and nobody knows how long it will be, I would say, to come back to a normal environment and getting out of this pandemia and this world crisis. So going beyond what we said, you need quite a short term and long-term view. I think what we told you today is already a strong message.</p><p>The other strong message we gave you is that we will increase at 5 -- by $5 billion of cash flows in the same $50 environment between 20 -- this year and 2025. So obviously, the matter will be to allocate this capital again, first, and you can make the math. At $50, we need to -- we need additional cash flow to deleverage the company, and we'll be under 20% by 2025, more or less. That means that at $60, the question will be sensible.</p><p>This is why we put on the same chart, but we can be flexible at higher prices. But that's not so easy to commit on the long-term of such metrics. I prefer -- I know that some of the peers have done it. But they have first cut their dividend. So for the time being, we are concentrated on maintaining the dividend. And I think it's the best message we can deliver to our shareholders.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Michele Della Vigna from Goldman Sachs.</p><p>MICHELE DELLA VIGNA, CO-HEAD OF EUROPEAN EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; MD, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Thank you, Patrick, for the clear vision on decarbonization growth and improved profitability. I have 2 questions, if I may. The first one is, if I can come back to cash return to shareholders. Clearly, Total stands out for having maintained the dividend through the crisis. But when I look forward at the numbers, the dividend yield effectively is costing you right now about 9%, and the cost of debt post tax is less than 2%.</p><p>Now I perfectly understand the importance of a strong balance sheet. But given this complete difference between the cost of capital, effectively that your investors are charging you versus the cost of debt, wouldn't it make more sense perhaps to focus on buybacks rather than financial degearing at this juncture?</p><p>And then a second question, perhaps a little bit niche. But when I think about your refining and chemical business, you are moving away from mega project, mega plants of refining and petrochemicals towards smaller ones focused on biofuels and biochemicals, which are more local. And where the economics really are driven by the local logistics of collecting and delivering waste in an effective way. I was wondering, do you think you have the right capabilities in-house for it? And do you think you need to change the way that business is run for this future reality with a bigger share of biofuels and biochemicals?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Okay. I take your point, buyback rather than gearing. I think, again, what we experienced to manage an oil and gas company with volatility, I think, honestly, we are sure, but I'm convinced that we'll see higher cycles. But after the higher cycles, with lower cycles. And so if we want to have a steady return policy to our shareholders, it's much better to -- I would say, to have the capacity to weather the storms like we are trying to do it today, like we are doing it today, by the way.</p><p>It's a matter of trust. I understand the math that you mentioned and the Board has discussion about it, to be honest, and that's true, but today, it will be nonsense to go for looking for equity from our shareholders. And I prefer Jean-Pierre to go on the bond markets and maybe even the green bond markets that you need to tackle. This is the next challenge. But with all what we have announced, I think it will not be so complex to convince bankers to issue green bond market today with the total or sustainable bond markets will -- next step for us. But that's true, but it's -- but again, my message to you is that with all what we have announced, what the Board is expecting is a rerating of the stock, and so the yield should diminish.</p><p>That's a good answer. And then buybacks might be an option. And the big debate is a debate, and it's why it's returned like that, will be, if you have additional cash buyback, it's probably better than increasing largely the dividend that was envisaged in the future.</p><p>The second one, I would say, no. I mean, let me be clear, don't make a mistake. First, it's not because we have focused the presentation today on biofuels, but Bernard has abandoned the large Amiral project with Saudi Aramco in Saudi Arabia, which is progressing very well. We have all the allocation from the ministry. So it's not eminent. But having said that, it's true, but Michele, you understand, but Total will not build a new refinery elsewhere in the world. I mean, it's clear. It's out of earth.</p><p>So we still have some petrochemical projects in Saudi Arabia. In Korea, the Korean platform, that's the core of it. And then the biorefinery. So a question for Bernard is, do you need more new -- different competencies to -- for biorefining? I would say that on bioplastics, in Italy, my -- our polymer business, people are very accustomed to the size of plants. We have done our first plant in Thailand. But Bernard, about competence and capabilities on these niche markets, what do you think?</p><p>BERNARD PINATEL, PRESIDENT OF REFINING &amp; CHEMICALS, TOTAL SE: One of the answer is the fact that we are going to slightly change the organization by creating a biofuels business unit with dedicated resources. That will be a team, which will be focused entirely on biorefinery and growing the business in Europe and outside of Europe, which, of course, requires certainly a different set of skills when conducting larger petrochemical projects. So we can lead the 2 strategies, I would say, both growing large platforms in petchems, and at the same time, yes, growing high value-added niches like biorefineries.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: No. But Michele is giving you a good idea, which is to go and recruit some people in one of the good competitor in biofuels.</p><p>MICHELE DELLA VIGNA: You are welcome.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: To strengthen your new business unit. Okay. But again, I think, Michele, the size of the projects that we have in these biofuels and bioproducts are on the size of the polymer plant. So I mean, we have in the company, our chemical guys, our petrochems, our Belgians part of the company is able to build this type of small plants, not the French one. We love -- they love the large projects.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Herrmann from Exane.</p><p>LUCAS OLIVER HERRMANN, HEAD OF OIL AND GAS RESEARCH, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions if I might, Patrick, regarding the renewables business. Yes, maybe one of them is a little unfair at this stage. But the first was just on PPAs. Can you give us an idea as to all the projects you're developing, what proportion of the output typically is PPA covered?</p><p>And the second is when you talk about 120-terawatt hours of electricity or electrons into the future, can you give us any idea as to how you'd expect that the end markets for those electrons to split? So how much do you think will go to EV? How much go -- might go to hydrogen? How much retail? How much corporate?</p><p>I'm sure you looked at the different value chains and opportunities. But just to -- for us to get some sense of, yes, what are the markets that are going to be according value to the different streams?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: So the first question is easy. The second one is for Philippe. I love the questions of Lucas. Now the first one is clear because according to what I just described to you, the instruction given to our teams is we want to cover with a 100% PPA. Having said that, it's clear that we have done one first exception with our entrants into the Seagreen offshore wind projects in Scotland, where, by the way, it was a long discussion, I can tell you with SSE.</p><p>They wanted to sell us 40% PPA, 60% project. And we said, no. We want at least 70% and 30%, knowing that we agreed together. But the last tranche of production could be we will submit it to the next round for CFD in the U.K. So that's clear that this -- we had yesterday, again, a new -- another discussion with our teams, which jumped into a 70-30 business model and we told them at the executive committee level, \"Don't go too straight because, again, what we like in renewables is not only the volume, but it's the predictability of the revenue.\"</p><p>So this is what we'll explain tomorrow to our investors. So if you begin to go to quickly in merchant, it's -- I think it will be -- it might be okay. I -- so I think our objective is, honestly, is to maximize the level of PPAs. We can accept some, time-to-times, maybe 30%, but not more, as we had done it once, that sort of metrics.</p><p>The second question, I'll leave it to Philippe because I know he knows everything about the math.</p><p>PHILIPPE SAUQUET: Lucas, on this question, I'm not sure if I have the right answer. But what you should bear in mind is that even if, of course, we spend a lot of time developing new markets such as EV and green hydrogen for the time being, which will remain a very limited part of the worldwide market or for electricity worldwide production.</p><p>So if I had to give you a guesstimate, I would say that it will be some, let's say, 2%, 3% for hydrogen and maybe a bit more for EV. But clearly, the most -- the bulk of our production will, still in 2030, will go to, I would say, the overall power market.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: So it's -- yes, I fully support the answer despite it's a complex one. It's probably a 45% retail, 45% corporates and then EV and hydrogen. Honestly, EVs, Alexis will speak about it. But when we look at the end to what does it represent to a 15,000 or 20,000 charging points in cities? It does not consume a lot, to be honest. So if you want to make money, it's not only through electrons. You have to source the service part of it, but Alexis will come back on that.</p><p>LUCAS OLIVER HERRMANN: Just coming back on the PPA question. Can I just follow-up on the PPA? You mentioned earlier, you spent a lot of time looking at your utility brethren and what they -- how they report, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>They also have a tendency to give a fair indication of what the PPA levels and terms are. Might we expect that you will give better indication to the future of what the PPA terms are, so we have a better idea of what revenues are?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: We might consider give you all the data sheets of Total, but we are -- or maybe not, we'll see. I will take the point, Lucas, and I will ask my colleagues to make a benchmark on the utility company's disclosure. And we'll look at it.</p><p>What I propose Ladislas is that we take a last question or 2 before we'll stop to go to the Zoom because we have another session of Q&amp;A, and I'm afraid, otherwise, we will extend until midnight. So I propose to stop at 4:30 like it was planned. So maybe let's take 2 questions before to stop, and then we'll move on to on the Zoom by Philippe, and then we have another session of Q&amp;A.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Bertrand Hodee from Kepler Cheuvreux.</p><p>BERTRAND HODEE, HEAD OF OIL AND GAS SECTOR RESEARCH, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. In fact, the question I had was exactly the same as Lucas in terms of PPA and American exposure. But maybe I'll try to find another one, which is in fact, when I look at your 2025 guidance for a low-carbon contribution, should I understand that, in fact, there is no implicit electricity price or American price built into that assumption and as you are, in a way, fully secured by the PPA? Is that a correct statement?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Exactly that. It's exactly that because, by the way, the Seagreen project, which is the only merchant for 30% will not produce in 2025. So it's exactly that. You're right. You have find the solution. Next question, but Bertrand, don't worry, we'll take all the questions from everybody. It's just a matter of time. Next question?</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Kuplent from Bank of America. This will be our last question for now.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER KUPLENT, HEAD OF EUROPEAN ENERGY EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Could I squeeze in 2 questions, please. The first one, hopefully quick, Patrick, you were referring to countercyclical M&amp;A. And I wondered in that $13 billion to $16 billion, how big a role net acquisitions play. You already mentioned that the $12 billion or below $12 billion next year is largely organic. But just wondered whether you could break down your view of organic spend versus inorganic.</p><p>And my second question is a bit more philosophical, which is if you look at the renewable space, you've obviously got your own listed subsidiary in some power. You witness that free cash flow yields are pretty meaningless in terms of valuation metrics and the EBITDA multiples or price-to-cash-flow multiples trade at a multiple higher compared to where the Total group listing gets you today.</p><p>So I wonder how you think around communicating better with different metrics that speak to the renewables growth, which, according to your own presentation today, will remain free-cash-flow negative for the foreseeable future. So I wonder how you're thinking around that project -- problem and whether indeed you think allowing the equity markets to have a clearer view in the way that you have an independent listing for SunPower is the way forward.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: So I think on the first question, if I remember the balance between acquisition divestment is around $1 billion, I think, maximum. So that means that there is much of the CapEx we are organic, and there is plus and minus, which is $1 billion extra. Of course, it's linked to the possibility to divest, but this is the metrics we have put in this business plan. And if we want to acquire more, we'll have to divest more. It's clear. I would say, so that's the first point.</p><p>On the second one, but we try to communicate on it, maybe not enough. I know that maybe it's not good to show that it's cash flow negative, but all of these renewable companies are cash flow negative, by the way, it doesn't matter. So the question is, of course, to, I think, clearly, what we try, what we have begun to do today, and we'll have to do more, of course is if we want to embed in the valuation of Total the valuation of the size of this renewable company, which compare, when we speak about 35 gigawatts compared to a lot of these independent renewables company, which are much smaller, have huge valuation, we need to give clarity on what we are doing. That's clear to attract these multiples also on this part of Total. So that's a challenge.</p><p>Should -- so yes, we intend, I will say, to go to give step-by-step clarity on what we do, and I think it was the first step. And you have a slide where we have figures. But should we go to IPO? All that is very premature. It's not at all what we -- I explained to you. I just explained to you during one now that what we intend to do is to build a broad energy company and again, being able to have in the same company, on one side, the oil and gas business. On the other side, the renewables and power business.</p><p>And we want to convince that this model because at least again, we are the renewables and power business is benefiting from the cash flows coming from the oil and gas business. So we have a good engine to make that transition. We want to really take time to convince the market that this is the right model. If we don't succeed, we'll see. But by the way, as you said, when we are building such a portfolio of renewable business, it will not be difficult if we think it's the best options to introduce -- to go in another way. But it's not what we intend to do for the next 5 years.</p><p>So that is last for the viewers. And again, to all the ones who have questions, don't worry, we'll take all the questions, but after the 3, next Zoom.</p><p>LADISLAS PASZKIEWICZ: All right. So thank you for this first set of questions. And now we are entering the second part of the afternoon with the focus presentations. And so we'll start with Philippe with a presentation on renewables.</p><p>PHILIPPE SAUQUET: Okay. So good afternoon to all. So my challenge is to convince you that we are not -- we are ambitious, but we are not dreamers. But let's start by the dream and by reminding you of the market and the growth that we see on this global solar and wind market. This year, we have seen, even with the COVID, a 15% growth. And this growth is clearly geared to continue with the greening of the planet and the carbon-neutrality mission that have been announced.</p><p>The lion's share of this growth will be for solar. We see solar as being the cheapest technology in many countries around the world. But doing that, of course, we are over technology of interest. And wind offshore, in particular, for which we feel that we have a unique competitive advantages, should represent in 2030 around 200 gigawatt. So 5% of the overall market.</p><p>What also is important to be noticed is the fact that around 80% of the growth is concentrated in 4 different areas: China for sure, which will represent more or less 40% of the growth; Europe being #2 with, of course, the Green deal gearing up via the market to high growth; and then in India and U.S. at approximately same level, 10% of all the growth. So no surprise if we are focusing our development; not forgetting, of course, other continents, South Africa, where we are also unique advantage still to be developed. But clearly, those 4 areas are the one in which we will have a greatest share of our business.</p><p>One reminder about also our history in those businesses. Yes, it was reminded that we invested in [San Patent 11] but was not maybe the greatest investment that we made. But we learned from this investment, and we started our renewed -- our new ambition and mission to become the responsible energy major. And we created Gas, Renewable &amp; Power branch in 2016.</p><p>We are very clear that we are more or less starting with a blank sheet. And so we needed to have, first, competencies, talents, assets. And there was no hesitation for us, but we needed to make some strategic acquisition. And this is what we made, and you all remember this acquisition of Saft, of Direct Energie, of Quadrant, just to mention the most important.</p><p>But what we see today and what you see on this chart in '20 is that the growth and the number of deals is clearly accelerating. And it is accelerating just because, as Patrick mentioned, we have now teams that are competent and competent enough to fuel our growth with ideas, with what I would call, semi-organic growth. And this is giving us a lot of opportunities that are -- that we can exceed on a very low cost of entry. And what is also very clear that most of this deal in terms of number now is focused around renewables. And among the 12 deals of 2020, 10 are around renewables.</p><p>And where do we stand today after those 4 years? We could say, and I'm saying it, I think that our renewable business is starting, just starting, but it's starting to reach a critical size when we compare to the leaders. And what I mean the leaders, clearly, the utilities because our -- all competitors are far from being at this level today.</p><p>So we are starting now to have significant asset, significant yield. We are positioned on all our growth markets, because we are a large company, we have a large ambition, and we can afford to be on several of these markets. So the solar farm, which bring size and low cost of producing electricity. What we call a solar distributed generation, and we'll come back on that because it is not, of course, most well-known part of our business, but it delivers high growth and higher profit because of higher barrier of entry.</p><p>We're not sure, of course, which is a needed complement because there are countries where there are a lot of wind but not so much sun. And wind offshore, which is, of course, the area where we are willing to grow on the basis of our core competencies, but as utilities clearly do not have for all of them at least.</p><p>And batteries, we made the acquisition of Saft, one of the world leader of this technology. And we are among the few participants of this service segment. And 2020 -- end of 2020, we will have already 7 gigawatt of asset in operation. So it start to be meaningful. Of course, it is small at the scale of Total. But in the world of renewable, I can tell you, that it is very significant already.</p><p>And the dynamic that we have now is not only limited, of course, to those asset in operation because we have also project under construction. And I will show in a minute some of the most significant. We have also identified late-stage development project and that we are confident that can be developed among the next year and, clearly, before 2025. And this is why Patrick was mentioning that our former objective of last year of 25 gigawatt in 2025, even if it was easy to memorize, is clearly something that is -- it is too easy for the team to achieve. And so we had to set a new target, and this is why we decided to have this 35 gigawatt. So it means that we have more or less 10 gigawatt to identify. And we -- based on what is our track record today, we have a little hesitation that we can do it, limiting ourselves, of course, to only profitable opportunities.</p><p>So some example of where we are. The first country, of course, today is our own country, France, and where we acquired Quadrant, and Quadrant was and is still now one of the main renewable developer in France. It was crazy in 2013. So there's already in this company with more than 300 professional. We have already 7 years of experience that we can capitalize in order to fuel our growth. This professional are competent as well in wind and in solar. You can see on this map of France the different dots for wind and different dot of solar. And you see that, yes, we are today balanced between wind and solar, which is understandable for a country such as France. We have 1 gigawatt of operation right now, and we have already secured the pipeline to have 4 gigawatt by 2025.</p><p>One example of what I call semi-organic growth was the acquisition this year of Global Wind and Power -- Global Wind Power. It's an onshore wind developer. But I can tell you that without the competencies of Guanghui, Total Guanghui, now as it is named, we would have had a lot of difficulty to make this acquisition profitable because we need all the team in order to expedite the development of the project that we have been acquiring.</p><p>And what we can say today is that if Total in France is clearly the largest energy company, we are already now among the 3 big players integrated in electricity and in France. And this, of course, is giving a lot of stability and a lot of confidence going forward on our ability to remain profitable and to continue growing.</p><p>After France and Belgium, Spain is to become our third market where we are again one of the leading integrated electricity company. So we will be 1 of the 4 once the deal with EDP will be closed, so hopefully very soon. And on this market, it is also a market where we can grow solar generation, because it's a market where there are a lot of sun, more than 2,000 hours of -- generating hours for solar project in Spain, where we have only 1,000, so 50% less in France or in Germany. So it's really a market, which is very favorable for low-cost solar.</p><p>And on this market, as we mentioned, we have managed to secure a 5-gigawatt pipeline of solar project, which is noticeable. It represent more or less the third of the total mission for 2025 of the country. And we have managed to secure those 5 gigawatt through, I would say, a low-risk acquisition agreement. We have made agreement with 3 developers and we -- it is a scheme when -- where the developers are pursuing themselves, the development of the project. And we are buying the project with payment condition on them reaching precise milestones that you can see on the chart. So it's a very efficient way and very secure way for us to develop this pipeline of projects.</p><p>And as I was saying, Spain is a country where we can produce low-cost solar electricity. And Patrick, as I reminded you about our strong objective to reduce our carbon footprint in Scope 1 and Scope 2. So we took advantage of the pipeline of solar farm that we are in the process of developing in Spain in order to walk the talk and mobilizing both farm to produce enough green electricity to supply 100% of the 6 terawatt-hour electricity needs of all our industrial site in Europe. And so we do that on the basis of our own solar asset.</p><p>We are doing that also thanks to our trading ability to balance the risk between the country's electricity price spreads because, of course, we deliver this electricity to our German colleagues on the basis of the German price of electricity. Of course, we have to balance the production of the solar farm and the consumption of our site, which is more or less 24 hours a day when, of course, a lot of them are only producing a day. But we have the ability -- trading ability of doing so. And we have signed what we call corporate in our PPA, which is the largest corporate PPA that we have identified today worldwide. So when we say Total is walking the talk, yes, it is a reality.</p><p>One example, of course, of high interest of what we are doing on large project, large solar project, such as the one that we have won in Qatar, one of the interests of that was, of course, that it is a large project. But it was also a test of the competencies and the competitiveness of our team. Because, yes, it was -- we got that through a tender. And through this tender, we manage without compromising, I can tell you, on our profitability objective. We managed to win the tender with the record levelized cost of electricity at $14.5 per megawatt hours. The category, we are very happy with us. And we were solely because, yes, we got the project on a profitable basis. And it was a test for us to make sure that, yes, we are able to have the best design. We are able to have the most competitive supply chain with attractive prices for the panel but, of course, we are buying in China because we are the most competitive producer in the world. And therefore, it was a good test, and it will start in '21. And as we said, of course, our ambition, especially in the country where the group has been present for nearly 100 years, what we are willing, of course, to develop is on a negotiated basis, other project that should deliver higher return.</p><p>Another country of interest, we have mentioned it, India. So yes, we are targeting India as being one of the main market of today and tomorrow for renewable. Yes. You see on the chart, we have quite an impressive objective of 175 gigawatt of renewable by 2022. India is clearly key for our LNG gas strategy with high potential for them to reduce CO2 by coal-to-gas switching, and this was the main reason to partner with one of the largest private Indian company, Adani. But going forward, we realized that Adani was very active in renewable. We have created Adani Green, which is a listed company, very successful. They were recently ranked by consultants as the world leader in solar development. So they are very attractive and very dynamic company. And so we managed to sign with them the agreement to create a 50-50 joint venture on the basis of more than 2 gigawatt of solar farm with a very nice rate of return, considering that these projects are completely derisked because we are already in operation and benefiting for 100% of their production of a 25-year PPA.</p><p>Total RM. So another example of what we did in order to attract the competencies that we didn't have internally at the time when we started in 2016, we identified that there was a very competent team, which created Eren in 2012. So [Paris Boratto] give his day. But knowing that, yes, Paris was and has been active in [Weblinc] in 2000 when he created a company, which later on become Total -- sorry, EDF Energies Nouvelles, which was the listed company before EDF decided to buy 100% in 2011. And then Paris decided to recreate a new company, and it partnered with us in 2017. We have 30% of Total Eren today. They are developing in areas where it is complementary to what our own Total team are doing. And their mission, and they are in the right track to achieve this ambition is to have 5 gigawatt by 2022, the year where Total has the option to acquire 100% of the share if we decide to do so.</p><p>Solar DG. So Solar DG, yes, it's different market. It's peculiar to set up with no distributed generation for wind, of course. But having the possibility at acceptable cost to develop a solar policing asset on the roof of different industrial companies is something that is attracting a lot of interest today in many areas of the world where it bring already lower cost of electricity rather than buying electricity from the grid. And you see that the growth is there, 15% per year.</p><p>It is a market that has been taught to us by SunPower because, yes, we learned from the mistake of SunPower, but we learned also of the success of SunPower. And SunPower is one of the leader, if not the leader, of this business in the U.S. So we understand what is needed in order to make money in those business. And yes, we have started, as it was mentioned, to propose to multinational companies that are willing as Total to reduce their global carbon footprint to have kind of solarization project. We have one inside Total, and some companies are considering it. And we are amongst the few companies that can offer them this possibility.</p><p>And it is also a sector where we have managed to attract the interest of Envision, a Chinese company. I don't know if you know this company, but it's a rather well-known technical company, which are involved in digital and in the renewable. We are on the verge of becoming one of the leader of manufacturing of wind turbine. They have also a footprint in battery. So very dynamic company. And we have a joint venture with them, 50-50, in China, which is developing today at accelerated space. Even if we have to be reasonable in terms of gigawatt, this will never be as important as a solar farm or the wind project that we are developing.</p><p>One word of SunPower because, yes, there was recent news for SunPower. Yes, it was mentioned that SunPower was maybe not the best investment that Total has made, but we learned from our mistake. We identified very quickly -- at least 2016 when we were counting our strength, we identified that SunPower had a high-performance product, maybe the highest performance worldwide. But clearly, we are not the lowest cost and mainly for a question of scale. And the scale in manufacturing businesses, such as solar sales and solar panel, is coming from large market, such as China and a very well -- a good know-how of low-cost manufacturing such as the Chinese are able to develop.</p><p>So we identified that the future of SunPower and on the manufacturing side decided to go through a partnership with Chinese company. And this is what was achieved and was announced recently this month. Spin-off of Maxeon Solar Technology, which is a manufacturing arm with a partnership with TZS, which was one of the partners well known to SunPower and one of the leading wafer manufacturing for solar wafers.</p><p>So TZS has taken 29% shareholding, injecting $300 million inside Maxeon. And new SunPower, the remaining SunPower, will focus only on distributed generation and storage markets, having the freedom to source best panels, the cheapest panel if it is of its interest. And of course, we think that it is a good promise for future successes for both companies. And we saw that the stock market has recognized that we realized a significant value creation through the spin-off.</p><p>Wind offshore. So wind offshore, as you might have seen us, we were a bit shy on this technology that we knew. But we are considering for years that it was too costly technology. And you have to remember that no later than 2018, there were still some PPAs that we are negotiated with a public authority on the basis of prices much higher than EUR 100 per megawatt hour. And then through the contract that we had with the contractors that are the same but the one that we use in oil and gas, we started to understand that there was a cost reduction -- a significant reduction, which was happening.</p><p>And we decided to partner first with Ofsted, the world leader. And we did partner with them in order to bid on the tender, [Darier] in France, that we lost, but we learned a lot from having our teams discussing and working shoulder to shoulder with Ofsted. When you want to learn, you better partner with the best one in the industry. That's what we did. Yes, we lost the tender because we are unwilling to compromise on the profitability. But we realized that we were able to make a profitable bid for us at less than EUR 50 per megawatt hour. So we are definitely convinced that, yes, this technology has a future. And we looked since then at different opportunities.</p><p>And the first one that we can announce as real first big step is the Seagreen project, where we have acquired majority stake, 51%. We have a nice partner, SSE, which is also one of the leading developer of wind offshore project in the North Sea. And this project is already under construction. This is a project where we have the exception, only 70% is covered by PPA. But we have some ideas, and there will be some auction next year that could allow us to secure a bit more and allow us to derisk even more of the project. But on this basis, we are already satisfied with the economics as we see them. And there is opportunity to develop 400 megawatt beyond that could be also at a nice level of profitability.</p><p>But as Patrick mentioned, the new frontier in wind offshore is in floating offshore because the fixed bed project are limited, more or less, to a 60-meter water depth. And in the North Sea, yes, there is a lot of area to develop those project. But outside of the North Sea, most of the time, we are very limited in term of surface. If we can only use project that need less than 60-meter water depth.</p><p>So the floating is the new concept that is being developed. It can unlock fantastic development for the technology. Of course, today, it's more expensive than the fixed bed and -- but there are a strong willingness of many countries to offer PPA in order to meet the profitability requirement that we have and allows to secure the development of first project on the profitable basis. And we have already 2 significant projects. There will be another one that we'll announce later in October. But we have already 400 megawatt of project in the U.K., and we have announced also partnerships with Macrae with a portfolio of -- to be a lot of projects in South Korea.</p><p>Of course, the challenge being to reduce the cost we intend everyday to leverage the competencies that we have inside developed in oil and gas, because this will be more or less the same technologies. And we need, of course, to work in order to industrialize the best technology and to lower the cost, and we have started already. We have a team that is working on this subject with a budget of $20 million per year of budget.</p><p>And last slide that Patrick already showed you. So this is the result of our ambition, the 35 gigawatt that we ambition to have in operation because we have, of course, a pipeline to go beyond but 35 gigawatt in operation in 2025. Double-digit return, for sure. Very low risk, nearly 100%, as we mentioned, secured by PPA with first -- for first-line companies or with public authorities. And with this ambition, I think, yes, we will be among the 5 global leaders of this industry.</p><p>Stop there. Ladislas, please.</p><p>LADISLAS PASZKIEWICZ: All right. Well, thank you very much, Philippe. So if you have questions for Philippe, keep them for now. There will be the Q&amp;A session at the end.</p><p>But now we have the last Zoom focused on the mobility revolution. It will be made of 2 parts, but to introduce this Zoom, I hand over to Helle.</p><p>HELLE KRISTOFFERSEN, PRESIDENT OF STRATEGY &amp; INNOVATION, TOTAL SE: Thank you, Ladislas, and good afternoon, everyone. Just as a way of a quick introduction on the revolution that is taking place in the mobility sector, I have one chart from our energy outlook that we presented yesterday.</p><p>And so here it is. What you can see here is the actual fuel mix of the worldwide transport sector expressed in million barrels equivalent per day in 2018 to the left; and then moving over to the right, the evolution in 2030 and 2050 in our 2 scenarios: Momentum and Rupture.</p><p>The colors on the bar chart to the further right, so Rupture, in 2050 tells the whole story. It shows how the fuel mix diversifies and how effectively we cannot achieve net 0 for the transport sector without this massive change in the use of fuels.</p><p>To the far right, therefore, you have the different fuels. You see that there is still some are left, and that would be especially in emerging markets. But there is a strong penetration of biofuels and e-fuels or sustainable liquid fuels. Synthetic fuels is another name. Penetration also of natural gas, hydrogen and, of course, electrification, especially of passenger cars, but not only.</p><p>In the shorter term, which is the data you didn't have yesterday, so between now and 2030, the takeaway is that electrification, biofuels and gases will be the best way to decarbonize transport. And this is effectively what you're going to hear about.</p><p>Now from first, Bernard, I believe, and then lit. Thank you.</p><p>BERNARD PINATEL: Thank you, Helle. Good afternoon. So let's now turn to biofuels. What I intend to do in the next 20 minutes with Alexi together is to share with you our ambition on the biofuels market from the producer as well as from the marketer standpoint.</p><p>So let's first turn to the market, the world biofuel market. You see it on this chart. What is, of course, obvious is that's a growing market. 2 million barrels a day today, 4% of global transportation fuels market. But we expect this part to double by 2030. And of course, as I explained, depending on the scenario, this part could even further double by 2050.</p><p>So why is it growing? It's pretty obvious. It's because biofuels reduce CO2 emissions by more than 50% compared to their fossil counterparts. And the states have, of course, understood that this is a readily available solution to decarbonize transportation. So states put in place CO2 reduction targets supported by tax incentives. Practically, it means that given percentage of biofuels has to be incorporated into fossil fuels. And of course, these targets are meant to increase over time.</p><p>And when you look at the 10 years ahead of us, in most of the countries, you see this target increasing. And on top of it, you even see more states coming and joining, I would say, the trend by putting in place such mechanism, the latest one being, for example, Canada, which intend to reduce their carbon intensity by 12% by 2030; or states in the U.S. like Oregon, New York or Washington. So in a nutshell, an attractive market from a growth standpoint.</p><p>So how do we intend to catch this growth? What is our strategy? Our strategy has been designed along 2 pillars. From a producer standpoint, which is the perspective of Refining &amp; Chemical, our strategy is going to grow in renewable diesel, the most attractive part of the biofuels market. I will come back on this one. And as a marketer, of course, which is the perspective of Marketing &amp; Services, the strategy is to grow the share of biofuels distributed through our retail network.</p><p>And I leave the floor now to Alexis. Alexis will elaborate on this one.</p><p>AHMED BEN SALEM, OIL AND GAS ANALYST, ODDO BHF CORPORATE &amp; MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Thank you, Bernard. Indeed, our ambition in biofuels is to grow our sales very significantly, as you can see. We are looking at growth, both in Europe and in the rest of the world.</p><p>In Europe, we are currently the largest biofuel retailer. Indeed, the great deal that was just announced will translate higher incorporation mandates. And also HBO will come into the equation, especially with the trucking segment. HBO has a great interest for the whole company who want to decrease their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions without having to change their trucks. So the combination of both will allow us to continue developing our biofuel mix in this continent.</p><p>But we go beyond that. As an example, we are actively promoting e85. That means 85% of ethanol in gasoline in our retail network in France. We doubled the number of stations offering e85 between 2018 and 2019, and we continue expanding our network as the demand is clearly there.</p><p>Beyond Europe, we have identified a few markets where we want to grow. One of this is Brazil, which is the large -- the second largest biofuel market in the world, with 1/3 of the sales there biofuels already. In 2019, we acquired a network of 300 station. This was the first step as our target is to have more than 1,000 station in Brazil by 2025.</p><p>We are also anticipating developments in the aviation business, but Bernard will elaborate on that in a few moments. So you see biofuel will represent between 10% and 15% of our sales in 2030. This is what it takes to meet the 2 key objectives of the group of reducing the carbon intensity of our sales and decreasing the absolute Scope 3 emissions by 2030.</p><p>Over to you, Bernard.</p><p>BERNARD PINATEL: Thank you, Alexis. Now let's turn to renewable diesel. I just said that this is what we want to focus on as a producer in Refining &amp; Chemical, and let's try to see why. When you look at the biofuels market, typically, you have to split this market into 3 segments, which each have very different characteristic.</p><p>The very first one at the bottom is a pretty well-known segment, the biogasoline. It's the largest one. There you incorporate bioethanol made out of sugar. The second segment is the biodiesel segment, where you incorporate biocomponent made out of vegetable oil, typically hapseed oil, corn, soybean. This biocomponent are called ester fame, but they have a drawback. They contain oxygen, and that limits, from a technical standpoint, their incorporation rate into the engine. There is what you call a blending cap or blending wall above a certain volume, typically 7%. You incur you risk to damage the engine. So of course, you understand that, that puts a cap on the growth potential.</p><p>These 2 first segments have many points in common. They have low-entry barriers. They are not very capital-intensive. The technology is pretty well known. As a consequence, they are largely oversupplied. And as a consequence, margins are poor. So this is, of course, not the kind of market you like to compete in when you are a producer.</p><p>The third segment at the top is the renewable diesel segment. It's also a biocomponent for the diesel market. It's also produced from vegetable oil, but this time, with a different technology called hydrogenation. And the beauty of this process is that you can rid of the oxygen into your biocomponent. And all of a sudden, you understand that there is no incorporation limit anymore. This is what we call a drop-in solution. And in theory, you can even replace/substitute 100% of your fossil fuels by this renewable diesel.</p><p>This is a high-quality grade, but entry barrier are higher than for the 2 other segments. It's more capital-intensive. It's growing from that standpoint. It's an attractive market, a high-margin market and typically the kind of market you want to play in.</p><p>The last comment, as Alexis mentioned, renewable diesel can be used for airlines. That's not the case of the 2 other segments. And as you know, air transportation today faces a huge challenge in terms of CO2 emission reduction, which means that there is an additional growth potential for renewable diesel. And this is what I would like to show you now in more detail.</p><p>So air transport. The equation is very simple. You see there, this industry emitted last year around 1 billion ton of CO2. Airlines have made the commitment to reduce their CO2 emissions by 50% by 2050. But at the same time, they know that the passenger traffic will double during this period of time. So it looks like a tricky equation to solve.</p><p>So how do we address this challenge? First, of course, airlines try to reduce the weight of their airplanes by putting more lightweight material. They also try to optimize their flight plans to reduce the fuel consumption. But the first lever, the main lever is, of course, around the fuel itself. Today, liquid fuels are hard to substitute for long-haul flights. We know it. And thanks to this premium quality, spring grade, the renewable diesel is the only available solution offered today to airlines to reduce their CO2 emissions.</p><p>So you understand this is a brand-new market, and the states have understood, of course, it. And you see now countries like Norway, France, The Netherlands, Sweden, tomorrow, Europe and probably the U.S., putting in place incorporation targets, exactly as they did for the road transportation. So we have in front of us a brand-new nascent market, which will also fuel the growth of biofuels and notably renewable diesel.</p><p>So we have looked at the demand side. It's pretty attractive. Let's now have a look at the supply side. You have here the balance between supply and demand for renewable diesel. What is clear on the chart is that there is a clear need for additional capacities to meet the demand. And today, the market is short of capacities, and we think it will stay that way for the years to come.</p><p>Why is that? It's very simple. When you think about where the new capacities might come from, of course, you think about retrofitting existing refineries, exactly what we did with La Mede or what we're about to do with group fleet close to Paris. But the typical lead time is 3 to 4 years between the moment where you make the announcement and the moment where you have your first production. On top of it, we don't see many new greenfield projects.</p><p>Last comment, there are also not so many projects in Europe. And it's hard to some extent because we consider that Europe is at the forefront in terms of energy transition and carbon neutrality. So there is an opportunity, clearly, for European refiners and, of course, for Total. So in a nutshell, if I had to summarize, the market will stay tight. And of course, that will support margins for the years to come.</p><p>So what is our strategy in this field to catch this potential, this opportunity? So we have designed a strategy build along 3 pillars. I'm going to detail each of them. The first one, of course, is to convert existing assets. That's particularly true for Europe, where we need to adapt our refining system. We have done it with La Mede. You know it. It has been our first step. We are not doing it with Grandpuits. I will come back to it in more details in a few minutes. So that's the first pillar we execute.</p><p>The second one, of course, is to increase the share of coal processing in our existing refinering system. So we take the existing assets with some marginal CapEx, mainly some logistic CapEx, to segregate vegetable oils from crude. We produce renewable diesel. It's done at a marginal cost because typically, OpEx are very low. And you see there that we have plans to grow this part by 300,000 tons in Europe in the next 2 to 3 years. And we're also looking at opportunities in the U.S.</p><p>And the last pillar, of course, is to develop new units, additional production units on existing platforms where we can leverage existing synergies, typically, logistics synergies; or if you have an excess of hydrogen, typically, you can also leverage this excess hydrogen to produce renewable diesel. And that's typically the project we're evaluating today in Korea. It's 0.5 million ton of capacity project on our platform in Dasan.</p><p>So what you see clearly is that by leveraging our existing refinery setup, we are able to benefit from very low CapEx in the range of $500 to $750 per ton as you see. And this has to be compared with greenfield projects, which range more in the area of $1,000-plus per ton. So it's very attractive from the CapEx intensity standpoint.</p><p>And also, and I will come back on this because it's also critical, we design our investments in a way to be able to process all type of feedstock as flexibility is key in this market. So as Patrick explained, we are targeting more than 2 million tons of renewable diesel by 2025 and moving this volume -- doubling against this volume and coming close to 5 million tons by 2030 with a cash flow generation in the current environment of $350 per ton.</p><p>So I was mentioning feedstocks, which is a critical point, and I would like to tell you why. On this chart, you have the market split of the main feedstocks used for renewable diesel. On the left-hand side, the largest pool, very well known, it's all -- these are all types of vegetable oils. It's a resource, which is largely available and which will remain largely available for the future even after the pan ban.</p><p>In the middle, you have a growing category called waste and residues, so typically animal fat or used cooking oil. This is a -- there is a great demand for this category with some tax incentives because this category contribute to the secular economy, and it's supported by the government and the states. The challenge there, of course, is to increase the collection rate to meet the demand -- the increasing demand, 25 million tons today, which is already significant, and we expect this category to grow in the decade to come.</p><p>The last category on the right-hand side called advanced. It's the next generation, but not really available today. We see it more playing a role by 2030. So as you see, there are plenty of different feedstocks to play with. And of course, it depends on the price because the prices are pretty volatile, depending on the -- once again on the feedstocks. You have to play with the legislation. As I just said, for example, palm oil is banned in France. Animal fat is banned in Germany. So depending on the legislation, you have a different mix to play with.</p><p>And of course, you have to play with the tax mechanism. I was mentioning waste and residues, which in some cases benefit from tax incentives. So you understand why it's so critical to be able to play with all the state, all the panel, all these feedstocks. And that's why it's so critical to be able to -- it's so critical to design your units to be able to process all type of feedstock. And this is exactly what we have done. You see it in La Mede and two more in Grandpuits.</p><p>In La Mede, so far, we have been able to process successfully 8 different types of feedstocks. We have designed our units to be able to pretreat these feedstocks, to also be able to segregate between the different types of oil and feedstocks or finished goods. And of course, we leverage the expertise of trading to be able, once again, to get access to the best sources of certified feedstocks.</p><p>Particularly, what have we done and what do we intend to do? The very first move we made, you know it was with La Mede. It started up last year, mid of 2019. This has been our first move. We have applied there our business model, which is, once again, to retrofit existing assets to benefit from low CapEx. And you see here that La Mede -- the CapEx intensity of La Mede was around 600 ton -- $600 per ton, sorry to be compared once again with the metrics of the greenfield project, which is more in the region of 1,000 tons plus per ton. It has been designed, I've already said it, to be able to process all type of feedstocks.</p><p>And today, we are in the ramp-up phase. 300,000 tons of production, this is what we expect to do by 2020 -- by the end of the year, delivering a positive cash flow from operations above $350 per ton. So I would say first step, a successful one. And of course, we are now leveraging this experience to move to our next project, which is Grandpuits, close to Paris. That will be our very first 0 crude or 0 oil platform entirely dedicated to bio-based fuels and polymers as well as to plastic recycling. This represent an investment of more than $500 million of CapEx. A good internal rate of return, you see there, more than 15%. And we have there, if I just described briefly, the different projects, the biorefinery, which will process 400,000 tons of feedstocks, 70% being waste and residue, with half of it being secured. This unit will be completely -- largely dedicated to the production of biojet. Sustainable airline fuels, that will be the main outlet of this biorefinery and with some renewable diesel, of course, starting up in 2024.</p><p>We have also a brand-new bioplastic units, producing PLA. PLA is a biopolymer made out of sugar. We have, as you know, a very successful partnership with Corbion. We invested 2 years ago in a plant in Thailand, 100,000 tons. This plant has been ramping up very well, and we have taken the decision to double the capacity of this joint venture and to locate this new unit in Grandpuits with again a start-up phase by 2024.</p><p>The third project is a plastic recycling unit. It's a chemical recycling unit. It's a first in France. It's going to be a joint venture as well with a company called Plastic Energy, and we are targeting a start-up in 2023.</p><p>And we have, last but not least, a solar farm, 15 megawatt of capacity, which will contribute, as Philippe explained, to the generation of green electricity for the European asset of the group.</p><p>So as a conclusion, you will remember that our strategy is built along 2 pillars: a leading producer, a leading marketer. Producer, we want to grow our production in renewable diesel, becoming a leader in this field. And in the field of biofuels, as Alexis explained, we want to grow our share of biofuels within our liquid fuels by 2030 to a level which will represent 10% to 15% of our sales and that will -- and, of course, which will also contribute to reducing the carbon intensity of our sales.</p><p>Thank you. I give the floor to Alexis now.</p><p>ALEXIS VOVK, PRESIDENT OF MARKETING &amp; SERVICES, TOTAL SE: Thank you, Bernard. For the next 20 minutes, together with Philippe, I will present our third and last focus on how Total is embracing the electric mobility revolution.</p><p>I will start by stating the obvious: mobility is about to change drastically. It has already started, albeit slowly, but the change will be major in the coming decades due to the exponential penetration of the electric vehicle.</p><p>In the Total Energy outlook that was presented to you yesterday, in the Momentum one, the share of electric vehicles will reach close to 60% of the fleet by 2050. In the Rupture scenario, the increase is even faster as the percentage will be close to 75% of the world fleet in 2015.</p><p>In Western Europe, and we are presenting here on the right the 5 markets where Total has a strong footprint, the number of vehicles on the road will be more or less stable at around 100 million vehicles. But the switch to electric mobility will be faster than the worldwide average. You can see that the share of electric vehicles will still be modest in 5 years in 2025 at less than 5% but will grow significantly to reach almost 20% in 2030 and close to 95% by 2050, thanks to the impact given by the Green deal.</p><p>This acceleration is no science fiction and is being fueled by 3 main drivers. First and foremost, regulations. Regulations are the main market driver, and they take place at various levels in economic zones, in countries and in cities. There are many examples beyond the long-term political objectives of carbon neutrality announced by Europe and China recently.</p><p>This -- there are -- there is, for example, the emission target of 95 grams of CO2 per kilometer that has been set on vehicles sold in the Europe since this year. There is the banning of the internal combustion engine by many countries in the next 1 or 2 decades. There is the introduction of 0 ultra low-emission zone in city centers as London and Amsterdam have already done.</p><p>Car manufacturers have reacted to these regulations and have started to invest massively in EV. They have clearly chosen electricity as the next technology, and this is the second major market driver.</p><p>Finally, performance of battery -- of batteries is rapidly increasing, while costs are decreasing. This is the third market driver as it allow us to foresee, one, cheaper cars; the cost of the battery currently represents still 40% of the cost of the car; and two, extended autonomy. These are the 2 pain points preventing customers from switching massively to EV right now.</p><p>The mobility world is changing. As Total, we have integrated that in our strategy. In mobility and EV charging, and I will come back to that in a few moments, our strategy will be to address the most mature and attractive markets in terms of size and to leverage our position. We are quite excited as we really do believe this represent a fantastic business opportunities for Total.</p><p>I just mentioned how batteries are a key driver to this market and a key element of the value chain. And Philippe will now explain how total is addressing this marketing opportunity by developing key position in battery manufacturing.</p><p>Over to you, Philippe.</p><p>PHILIPPE SAUQUET: Thank you, Alexis. So first slide, you have to remember that when we invested in Saft, the strategy was, in fact, to develop what we call Energy Stationary Services. So battery need to compensate for renewable production interment, peak shifting or frequency regulation. But to be profitable, and we learned once again from our mistake and SunPower experience, we were willing to get low-cost manufacturing basis. And of course, this was implying to go to China and also to take interest in mobility because the lithium-ion battery needed for ESS are more or less the same chemical family as the one for mobility.</p><p>And so after having discussed with different partners in China, we decided to partner with Tianneng headquartered near Shanghai. They are the #1 worldwide of the lead battery for vehicle. This business is not part of the venture, but they were eager to develop lithium ion. And so we have already built a Giga factory, a large factory, but which was not completely filled. And we decided to partner with them. We created the joint venture, 60-40, in 2019.</p><p>Saft is contributing clearly mainly to its lithium-ion chemistry and know-how, and Tianneng is contributing with, first, its Giga factory, an existing one. And it's also contributing with its sales channels in China because on this basis, we can develop, produce cheaply products for our ESS business outside of China. And we can also develop business for mobility in China where we are leveraging also their sales network.</p><p>And today, we are already the leader in China with close to 30% market share of the e-bike segment, which is one of the highest growth segment in e-mobility. And when I say e-bike, it's not only bicycles, it's also the motorcycles. So this is our investment in China.</p><p>And second slide. Thank you. We are not limiting our mission to China. We had also an opportunity when Europe decided really to adopt a very clear policy to promote, to impose development electric cars. We had the opportunity to discuss the possibility of building manufacturing capability for battery for electric vehicles in Europe. The risk for Europe was, of course, to import batteries from China one day and in the future to import the vehicles.</p><p>And so we had a discussion with the authorities with a very strong partner, PSA, one of the leading manufacturers in Europe, maybe the most profitable now, and we decided to partner with PSA 50-50 today to develop this automotive sales company. We created the company early August. The objective around the treaty is to get up to 1 -- equivalent of 1 million EV, so that means more or less 10% of the European market. We'll go step by step. Clearly, the first step is an R&amp;D step, which has already started since August. And the -- for Total reinvestment is limited to EUR 500 million equity injection, knowing that we have significant subsidies that will -- but have already been granted by France and Germany on this project. Alexis?</p><p>ALEXIS VOVK: Thank you, Philippe. I'm going to share with you now how we are addressing the EV charging market. EV will completely reshuffle the distribution of energy to motorists. Today, customers come to our service station to refuel, and they usually do so while on the move. With EV, it is a different ballgame. The car will charge when it is not in use, when it is parked, which is most of the time. So it will bring multiple charging opportunities compared to today.</p><p>In Europe, market research foresees that approximately 40% of charging will occur at home, 40% at the workplace, 15% in the public domain and about 5% at service stations. This means that we have to reinvent the way we interact with our customers. We have to switch to a multichannel distribution model. We want to wait for customers to come to our sites anymore, and we need to provide them with charging services wherever they choose.</p><p>To address this new paradigm, we will focus on our strength, and 2 of those are our experience in offering services and our ability to manage infrastructure. This is why our primary focus will be on the B2B and the B2G segments. We will leverage our relationship with our professional B2B customers, in particular for charging at work and while they are on the move at our service stations. And in a moment, I will show you a few examples of our ability to install and operate charging points in the public domain. The public domain is what we call B2G. We will obviously reach B2Cs through public points and service station, but B2C and home charging is not our foremost priority unless in instances where Total can also be the electricity provider as increased consumption there may make it worthwhile.</p><p>There are various business models and position along the value chain. Because we are focusing on B2B and B2G and retail, the first dealing -- the first customers we're dealing with are cities and companies. The vast majority will want a single point of contact throughout the chain, providing the installation of the hardware, the operation and the maintenance and obviously the charging services with energy sales and associated services. Our business model to seize this new business opportunity is to be what we call a charge point operator, capturing the bulk of the value chain. We sell the energy and the charging services, and we develop direct customer relationships. But for convenience, our customers will want to have the capacity to access a larger number of charge point beyond the ones operated by Total. So our Total mobility solutions will also allow charging at third-party charge points. And in this way, we can retain the relationship with our customers end-to-end. Lastly, in certain markets, Total can integrate upstream by providing the electricity as well as the operation of the charging point, allowing us to capture more of the value.</p><p>Our strategy is first to address a market where we are strong and where the infrastructure needs to grow rapidly. That is Western Europe. In our main European markets, the number of charge point will grow significantly by 2025. We estimate that 3 million charging points will be installed in Europe in the next 5 years, but 40% of them or 1.2 million will be installed by corporate customers and by cities we want to equip the public domain. In this context, our strategy is to prioritize urban markets, first, by taking position through public concession in large cities, then by installing fast chargers in over 200 major urban hubs targeting high mileage urban professional. And obviously, the perfect complement is then to connect those urban areas. This will be done by installing superfast chargers of 300 of our service station along the main road corridors over Europe.</p><p>In line with the objective of reducing emissions, cities are rapidly installing EV charging infrastructure. Total intends to partner with major cities through concessions to foster e-mobilities. We already have 2 iconic examples. First, earlier this year, we were awarded the concession of the Metropole Region of Amsterdam. We already operate 5,000 charge points there and could go up to 20,000 by 2024. And since Amsterdam is a dense urban area with limited individual parking, we foresee a high usage rate, which explain why such business can bring a favorable equity return above 15%.</p><p>Second, we are not relying only on organic growth. M&amp;A is part of our growth plan. London is a dynamic market in terms of EV adoption as it has set the ambition to become a zero carbon city in 2050. And I'm very happy to announce that in line with our strategy, last week, we signed the acquisition of Bluepoint London, leader of EV charging in London with around 50% market share and long-term contract with 23 borrowers. There are already 1,600 operated charge points, and we are planning up to 4,000 by 2025.</p><p>Amsterdam and London are great examples. Altogether, today, we have already 12,000 charge points in operation in various cities in Europe. And with the coming growth that I have just outlined, we are well on track to reach our target of 50,000 operated charge points in the B2G segment by 2025.</p><p>In urban areas, we also have to cater for the fast charging needs of certain professionals who are doing high mileage on a daily basis, in particular taxis, ride-hailing cars but also last mile delivery vehicles. This professional will need dedicated high-speed EV charging stations. This gives a great opportunity for creating -- for the creation of charging hubs offering multiple charging points. You can see a picture on the left of our first one that is already up and running. Charging hubs are now being deployed in urban nodes to cover major cities in Western Europe, and we target to have more than 200 sites in the next 5 years.</p><p>For long distance traveling on the right, the issue of autonomy will remain the point of attention for some time. The solution here lies with high-power charging or what we call Superchargers up to 350 kilowatt. They have the capacity to deliver 100 kilometers of autonomy in 6 minutes. Here, Total has a very valuable asset with our existing retail network of more than 6,500 stations across Europe to choose from for providing this service. Our goal is to deploy 300 high-power charging sites along highways by 2022. This means one every 150 kilometers on main road corridors. By developing this network, we will offer our EV customers the possibility to travel with the customer experience, close to the one that we are experiencing today. And obviously, as a side comment and taking into account the average amount of time necessary to recharge, our customers will establish -- will enjoy our well-established convenience services also.</p><p>So whether on highways or on urban charging hubs, our target is to install 1,500 fast and superfast chargers in 500 locations by 2025. This represents a commitment of around $200 million and a projected IRR of 10%.</p><p>The last segment I would like to present is the B2B segment. We have a fantastic asset with our existing 1 million client base and the full potential to accompany them in their transition to cleaner mobility. In Europe, we have 3 million Total fleet cardholders, already mobility clients of Total, who will be interested for sure in our EV charging offer. This is a solid base to leverage, keeping in mind that B2B fleet conversion to EV is supported by legal constraints by the net 0 ambition of our client themselves and by the fact that certain zone will not be accessible with conventional fuels. So we anticipate the B2B segment will move fast, and the potential in Europe is over 1 million charge points for B2B by 2025. This move is already happening. And on the slide, we can see a few examples of our success.</p><p>Enedis, who is the major grid operator in France, is a very good reference. They have actually one of the largest EV fleets, and we have installed 1,250 charging points, over 155 of their sites for their fleet. Our B2B customers may want to use the charging services that we operate on their premises, not only for their fleet, but also for their clients, their employees, their visitors. This is what we call the host segment. It is what we have done for [Peugeot], where we have installed 175 charge points at 14 sites in 6 countries. It is the same principle for a shopping center who would want to provide charging services at their parking spaces.</p><p>Last, an example of how we leverage the long-term relationship with our customers is what we have done, thanks to our lubricant business. Within the last year, we have worked with more than 500 OEM dealers and garages across Europe to equip them with over 2,500 charge points. So all in all, putting all this together, our target to operate 100 charge points in the B2B segment by 2025 is quite realistic.</p><p>The next 5 years will be key to position Total well. This position is important because after this, taking into account the market development dynamics that I highlighted at the beginning, the pace will accelerate drastically. Building on our strength and our competitive advantage, we will reach a 10% market share in the B2G and B2B segment in Western Europe. Total is committing the necessary resources to make this plan happen, and we'll allocate $300 million of CapEx and $300 million of assets under leasing over the next 5 years. And we are not starting from 0. We already have a head start with the 18,000 charge points that we already operate and a significant number in our portfolio. This positions us very well to reach our target of operating 150,000 charge points by 2025, which will deliver 500 gigawatt hour. This business will bring an additional $50 million of cash flow from operations to Marketing &amp; Services by 2025 and around $100 million by 2030, thanks to a forecasted increase in usage rate. We will, therefore, be a major e-mobility player in Europe.</p><p>I've spoken about Europe because that is where Total and EV growth are strong. However, EV charging is advancing a space in China. Total has a presence in this country with strong position in 3 regions. And as you can see with this picture of our first charging hub in Wuhan in Hubei in partnership with Didi, we are also on the move there. So clearly, more to come from Total on EV charge, for sure.</p><p>Thank you for your attention, and I think we can move to the Q&amp;A.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Thank you, Alexis, for this presentation about the e-mobility and to Bernard for the biofuels and Philippe on renewables. So I think we are back for a session of 45 minutes until 6:30 p.m. So there were some question left for the first session. So of course, we should give priority to you and then if you can take more questions. So the floor is yours.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your first question comes from the line of Christyan Malek from JPMorgan.</p><p>CHRISTYAN FAWZI MALEK, MD AND HEAD OF THE EMEA OIL &amp; GAS EQUITY RESEARCH, JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Patrick and team, thank you for -- thank you for the mission as I appreciate the delicate balance to sustain oil as your core business and then building PNG at the same time. I didn't submit question the last time. If I may, I have 3.</p><p>My first question relates the flex you have with capital allocation in oil versus electrons in what could be an upward trend for prices. How tempted would you be to invest in more short-cycle projects in a higher oil price environment at the cost of delaying your sort of elevated power target 25 or 35 gigawatts? And I know it's a tough trade-off, but how would you prioritize that in capital frame?</p><p>And then linked to that question, forgive me for being a bit more optimistic about the macro environment in the medium term, but in a year of excess free cash flow and where debt has deleveraged fast at 20%, I just want to be clear, would you consider increasing your dividend payout? And how should we think about buyback versus dividend priority?</p><p>Thirdly and final question is I think it's very bold to provide explicit CFFO targets for renewables business in 2025. And thank you for more granularity than we'd expected. A lot of debate we've had around growth in renewables by all companies where this will ever be valued appropriately by the equity market. Would you consider doing what the utilities company didn't carve out for IPO, the effective utility part of your business as a separate entity? I guess that would be a great desert to finish off this great new menu.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: The only question I didn't catch because -- sorry, a question for -- I catch perfectly the last 2 questions, but the first one because the sound here was not very good. I'm not sure to have understood.</p><p>Christyan, your question was arbitration between CapEx to electrons and oil and gas, if I understand. The first question, can you...</p><p>CHRISTYAN FAWZI MALEK: Yes, exactly. The tension, yes. So essentially, how you think about allocating more CapEx towards short cycle in a high oil price environment and does that come at the cost of delaying your new power targets? What's the trade-off in a cycle environment and the capital frame?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: I think the question is -- the answer for me is clear. The short-cycle CapEx, we allocate them depending on the payback on the oil price. So if we are honestly at $50 or $60 back, we are back at $50, $60 and we can have -- we have more cash so we could decide to accelerate this short cycle, it will not be done on the detrimental part of the low carbon electricity because again, in all the scenarios we have, we have decided that we'll put the $2 billion we need for the next few years and then we'll increase it progressively. So I don't see -- I see that as an additional opportunity to deliver more cash from oil and gas and maybe feeding then more our low carbon electricity business with more opportunities if we can capture some. So I don't see -- with the CapEx allocation we propose, there is no antagonization.</p><p>But yes, we -- it's not -- I mean let's be clear, oil is still at the core of a company like, yes, and energy. So don't make a mistake. We want to add a third part and to build it in -- with a clear strategy, but it's not a matter of arbitrating to more electrons against oil. And again, short-term CapEx can be activated. If we see a rebound, which is perfectly possible in the oil price, then it's a matter of mobilizing the rig.</p><p>You have noticed that this year, we have decided to remobilize the rig in Angola because, in fact, we saw it was a possibility to quickly get some more -- there were somewhere with quite high returns, which could be done immediately. There is a debate for another rig in Angola, we'll see if that's true, but we have to monitor that according also to the environment that we face today.</p><p>The second one, I think we -- I will tell you we know that our investors prefer dividends and buybacks generally when I ask the question, and our Board is clearly more in favor of dividend by buybacks. Having said that, we also have the remark of [Mikele] previously in the -- during the discussion, which is that when you -- and it's a matter for me of level of the shares. It's why I don't want to belittle it. It's clear that the Board is waiting to see the stock rerating. And if we remain at 9% of returns, there will be a question mark that it would be strange for us to increase the dividend and not to allocate additional cash flow to buybacks, which should be the priority. So I think for me, there is -- the answer is we prefer dividend, and our investors prefer dividend when we ask the question, but it's linked to the rerating of the shares. There is 3 angle there: the share price, the dividend and the buybacks. And again, if we remain at a very high yield of 8%, 9%, there is a certain logic to allocate that, to allocate additional cash flow in priority to buybacks.</p><p>So let's wait and see if -- when we propose the strategy to -- which is more aggressive and to give clarity to this broad energy company, we convince investors. And then the day we'll have these cash flows, we will have to make that arbitration. So I gave you the type of -- I gave you some insights of the discussions around the Board, but I have no problem to be transparent on that.</p><p>The last question, I think, Christyan, it's -- again, I answered, I think, to one of your colleagues just before. It's a matter of size. Clearly, our objective today is that we are convinced that we can find investors to put money and to believe and to support this global energy company because, again, and I come back on it, we have -- it's -- we have some financial strength and some financial potential capacities to invest in these renewables and electricity business, but many of our competitors in the utility do not have, in fact. In fact, I see the reactions. The more we are expressing the targets and we are acquiring assets and we move forward, the more we are a little afraid by looking to see these big oil and gas companies, the cash flows entering into that market.</p><p>So then it's a matter, again, linked to shares. Can we convince investors? Can we rerate the Total shares including and they will accept this business model or not? If not, but we need time to do that. We need, I'd say, as I answer, 5 years. If not, in the meantime, we will have built, I would say, a sort of beautiful renewable portfolio, and the alternative could be to -- it's alternative. But it's not a priority today. The priority is to establish it because I think for the long term and if we want really -- if we are all serious about bringing climate change solutions, our companies having the source of cash flows from oil and gas and redirecting it is the best way to accelerate solutions for the climate change challenge.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi.</p><p>ALASTAIR RODERICK SYME, RESEARCH ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC. EXCHANGE RESEARCH: Two questions. Can you do everything you think you need to do in refining through adoption? I was struck in Helle's presentation yesterday that suggested under the European green deal that oil demand might be as little as 1 million to 2 million barrels a day by 2050.</p><p>And then secondly, I wonder if you could just touch on the cost estimations you think for floating wind versus fixed base. What's the level of difference? And what are you building in, in terms of cost reductions into your project economics in Korea and the U.K.?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Yes, Philippe will take the second question. On the first one, just to tell you, I mean, first, we speak about 2050, we are still in 2020. And that means that's why I think, and Total clearly has a clear strategy of progressively adaptating our refining system in Europe. We have begun, I think, 10 years ago. We closed -- we shut down the Dunkirk refinery when we went to La Mede to convert it. Now we do it with [Rampni]. I think it's a question of facing the reality and doing progressively, trying to benefit from these biofuels market, which is supported by European government policies. And frankly, it's better to be among the first to do it rather than doing among the last.</p><p>And when you look to the remaining refineries, which are in the portfolio of Bernard today, I think I would have been very happy to have the 6 remaining refineries in Antwerp, [Loina], Zeeland, Normandy and Donges and the Feyzin, which we don't -- are left in Europe. We are not -- I would have preferred to a bad portfolio when I was the Head of Refining in chemicals other than the one with many refineries and some unprofitable.</p><p>So it's a question again of adapting progressively, but there is no doubt, but we will have to do it. Having said that, when you have a very profitable one like the Antwerp or Loina or Normandy, there is no reason why not to maintain this activity. Bernard, you want to complement on that?</p><p>BERNARD PINATEL: No, no, it's clear what you said.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Okay. Philippe?</p><p>PHILIPPE SAUQUET: Yes. Today, the cost of floating, of course, is just only based on the pilot that we are, in fact, designing right now. But at the time when we speak, the cost in CapEx, let's say, per bed is around 6%. So it's double the price or the cost of the fixed bed, knowing that, of course, what we anticipate is that there will be higher, stronger wind for the floating because more or less, the farther you are from the cost, be more regular and the strong the wind are, so you just should have more production. And of course, it's just a new technology in its infancy, we should be able, first, to have a higher size for the wind turbine, even beyond what we see today.</p><p>Currently, for instance, wind is based on 10 megawatts. We can imagine for floating, that will go maybe twice as much. But of course, all this technology has to be developed. In 5 years, we went in fixed bed from EUR 150 per megawatt hour to EUR 50. So we have the same kind of challenge to face today in the floating.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Well, I think, again, it's a matter of supply chain, on mobilizing the people. This emerging technology is interest for us. A country like Korea is offering a beautiful platform because you have a lot of yards there; a lot of, by the way, suppliers, which are working for the E&amp;P, which knows a lot about floating platforms; and a motivated government. They have a clear policy. And so I'm convinced that these type of countries will help to emerge. It's a matter of -- at the beginning to give the right incentive to accept to pay, I would say, $200 per megawatt hour. So this will emerge. And then there will be an acceleration of this technology. So I think it's the same process than the others, but there is a big potential.</p><p>And frankly, on this one, the oil and gas company are perfectly positioned to be the forefront. It's why, by the way, Macquarie, which was -- which had this already these rights to make wind measurements in Korea has selected Total rather than a utility because they saw a clear interest to partner with us on this project. So yes, it's still costly, it's clear, but it's a matter now of engaging in industrial projects and not just pilots. Okay. Next question.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC.</p><p>BIRAJ BORKHATARIA, DIRECTOR, CO-HEAD OF EUROPEAN ENERGY RESEARCH TEAM &amp; LEAD ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: I've got a couple of questions again on low carbon, but I just want to get a sense of the level of competition in that business. So could you -- over the last couple of years, could you say what proportion of solar and wind tenders that you entered that you didn't win? I just wanted to get some comfort around that.</p><p>And then the second question is on your low carbon cash flow target, the $1.5 billion in 2025. What is that number in 2020? I vaguely remember you're putting out a target of $1 billion in 2020 a few years ago, but I don't know if that's apples-to-apples. So a clarification on that would be helpful.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: No, it's not the same at all. It was, by the way, by the -- mainly, when we say that it was mainly based on SunPower and expectations, which clearly have been disappointing. So today, it's not -- the figure we gave you today is a sum of many assets, so it's much more reliable but depending on 1 or 2 performance. So we were maybe too optimistic by that time. So I think in the slide, which I show you, you have the figure, maybe not. I will look to give it to you. So today, we are more in the field of $200 million, to be clear. So it's emerging because all that is just being built.</p><p>Then the first question, how many tenders did you not win? I think we lost mainly in the Middle East in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, I think. So big 2 -- big tenders, 2 tenders on which we are competing. And frankly, these ones are -- they were very aggressive. And in the wind offshore on Dunkirk. But again, I think these tenders is like in E&amp;P. You don't make money generally when you -- once you win a tender, you make money because you have a better idea and you find direct negotiation. And I think one of the interest of the -- there are many, many players around the world, small players, which are, in fact, developing some pipelines and which we have -- do not have the financial capacity to build. And this is what we have done in Spain as a business model which was defined to you by Philippe. They have the local knowledge. They have the capacity to have access to connections and land, but they have no financial capacity. So when we find them, we come and they see immediately the advantage of partnering or selling their pipeline. So it's a sort of, I would say, it's not for me M&amp;A, but it's more an inorganic business development.</p><p>We have today with this type of approach and where we leverage our financial capacities and capacity to find PPAs, corporate PPAs, which will be offered to them, so to accelerate that development. But it's not very expensive. And by the way, the way we remunerate them is according to derisking the projects step after step. Okay. And to be honest as well, if a tender is not -- it too aggressive, we are not there just to make megawatts. It's -- we don't -- it's not a question of gigawatts per gigawatts. It's a question of at the end to be, again, I have my metrics, which we approve projects if we reach 10% of equity IRR [after farm] down or not, we don't approve. And so that's clear that in one of the tender, we -- teams came back to us, and we said, no, it's too low. So that's life. It's a question and a discussion on the Dunkirk offshore wind round in France, where we're hosted, and both of us were perfectly in agreement. But it was -- and I can tell you when my friend of offshore told me is too low, I set stop immediately. Okay.</p><p>one of the difference in this tender just to -- it's not really the cost, the Capex, et cetera, it's the assumption that you will take on the tail, which means you have to take -- if you take an assumption to be reasonable, you take the present price, you take EUR 40 per megawatt, and after 15 or 20 years, you have one apple seed. So if you believe that the power price will go up to EUR 70 or EUR 80 per megawatt, of course, you change your bid. So this type of games or game for me, it's a casino. I prefer not to put the money after time in this type of game. I prefer to -- frankly, so this is exactly the type of game that some players are playing today, which is just to take a very aggressive assumptions on the long term. And that maybe because we are -- we do not know enough this segment because on the contrary, we believe that the more you will have renewables in the system, the more it could imply some lowering the cost of electricity and energy. We are not ready to play that. Okay. Next question.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Henry Tarr from Berenberg.</p><p>HENRY MICHAEL TARR, ANALYST, JOH. BERENBERG, GOSSLER &amp; CO. KG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two, please. One on the renewable diesel business. So I think you have a target of 70% per share of waste and residues in terms of feedstock. And you say you've acquired, I think, or secured half of that now. What type of feedstock have you secured so far? Would you see the need to vertically integrate into the feedstock market? So I guess we've seen a lot of companies announcing new renewable diesel capacity, but it seems as though the pool of sort of waste and residues is limited.</p><p>And then my second question would be around how you view the economics of EV charging versus your conventional sort of liquids marketing business and what the ultimate market size might be, you think, across electric mobility versus that current sort of liquid fuels business. So you're talking about $100 million of cash flow from operations, additional from the electric business over the next 10 years. But ultimately, the current liquids business is likely to come under pressure as EVs come through. So any thoughts around that would be great.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: On the first question, I would just preempt it a little because there are some commercial discussions. And as you just said, there are quite a lot of competition for the feedstock, and so we have decided in conjunction with one of our big partner and supplier not to reveal anything about it. First, because, yes, [himself] today some contracts and that coming to us by 2024 could have some impact in. So I can't tell you, but it's clearly something very important, like I think Bernard told you. But I would say 40% of the 70% are warranted, but we cannot reveal anything about it, respecting our commercial agreements. But it was, for me, a fundamental, as Bernard explained to you. It was fundamental before to take the decision to invest. Bernard, do you have something else to do? Or maybe on the other part, on the other 40% to cover? Where are you?</p><p>BERNARD PINATEL: Yes. I mean the rest will be, of course, covered by vegetable oil, mainly rapeseed oil coming from local area. So it's not so much an issue. Now just -- Henry was making a comment that he thinks that the resources will be limited. What we showed basically is that there is 25 million tonnes today, and just half of it today is dedicated to biofuels. So after, it's a matter of press point, of course, but there is still some room to further increase with the pool. And on top of it, as we see, thanks to the collection rate increasing, we see this pool increasing as well over time. So I mean securing now is key, but they will more to come, I think, in the next 10 years as well.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: EV, so Alexis, this one.</p><p>ALEXIS VOVK: Thank you, Henry, for your question. I think there is no doubt that today, the EV profitability metrics are not as dynamic as the conventional business. I mean if you look at the average return of Marketing &amp; Services, it's over 20%. It's normal because it's a mature business, whereas EV is starting. So we are a bit as we are explaining in the renewable business. We target above 10%. I think it's important for us to start this process, to take position, as I said in my speech. The next 5 years are key because the rate -- the pace will accelerate after. So it's important that we take position, which are profitable, above 10%, and the returns will come after.</p><p>After that, in term of strategy, it's obvious that we are -- I mean my presentation was on purpose focused on Europe because this is where it's happening. But Total is an international company, present in various continents, and I think our portfolio management of activities with the different maturity of fuel versus EV allows us to keep on -- to stay quite profitable and deliver cash flow from operation growing for the next 10 years.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.</p><p>PAUL CHENG, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions, please. First, Patrick, based on your current business plan, when you believe you will reach the economy of scale, where the low carbon power business will be cash flow breakeven and when you would be cash flow positive? And what is that economy of scale? And a similar question is on the e-mobility on the e-mobility investment. When that do you think you will reach the cash flow breakeven?</p><p>And also, whether that you would consider and when in the quarterly, [we saw] you will break out the low carbon power generation business as an individual segment and provide the full financial impact of that we on the Wall Street will be able to do a better job in understanding and evaluating that.</p><p>The second question is on the post 2025. Your game plan seems to suggest you expect an acceleration in the energy transition. So from that standpoint, how should we look at your percent of your CapEx shift, whether that you're still talking about 85% in the legacy business and 15% in the low carbon power business or that, that is going to shift quite significantly.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Going to be your carbon electricity same for your -- I'm trying to catch the last question because...</p><p>PAUL CHENG: Last question is that as -- in your business plan you seem to suggest post 2025, we will see an acceleration in the energy transition. So how that is going to impact on your capital allocation? Are we still going to see 15% in the low carbon power business and 85% in the legacy oil and gas business? Or that percentage, that ratio will change dramatically?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Not dramatically, but what we mentioned in the presentation is that we think that we'll go up to 20% and a little more, we say more than 20%, but let's say 20% by the second half of the decade. So it's 15% for the coming 5 years and then 20%. So it's not dramatic. As long as we can maintain this, I would say, light capital model that pays again on the idea of low interest rate, this is the -- so there is no dramatic change in that picture because, again, this is a point and because it's related also to your first question, which is that all that, of course, we want to deliver one days on net cash flow positive. And in fact, if we more we invest, of course, the more we generate cash flow. So I think the net cash flow positive will appear the second part of the decade. I don't have a precise model to tell you, but the second part of the decade. Okay.</p><p>PAUL CHENG: And whether the company will consider to change the reportings and break down the low carbon business into an individual segment and provide perhaps that's a full P&amp;L so that we can do a better job in understanding and evaluating it.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: I think we will give you, like we have began more and more information about it, but the structure has already changed. We have provided you quarterly results since the first quarter more and more clarity on it. We don't -- in terms to be clear, the organization we have with gas, renewables and power has some value because it's in the integration in gas and power, and so I don't intend to change the organization of the company. And we like the reporting to be in line with, I would say, our own organization in terms of accountability, internal accountability.</p><p>And again, I think today, it's premature because it mostly material, and there is a question of materiality of all that. But between today and 2025, for sure, there will be some change in the reporting way. But what I can ensure is that we will -- you will be able to have some metrics, which will allow you to better see the growth of it and I would say the development of this business in terms of capacity, in terms of productions, in terms of -- and so we will organize the reporting. So because of our intent, obviously, is to be attractive to the market. So we'll give the figures, which will allow you to be -- to compare what we do within Total with companies which are in that business in the renewables and power business.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kenney from Santander.</p><p>JASON S. KENNEY, HEAD OF EUROPEAN OIL AND GAS EQUITY RESEARCH, GRUPO SANTANDER, RESEARCH DIVISION: Actually, just a point of clarification, if I may. On the Total Eren option, I think you can take 100% stake from 2023 versus 29% stake to date. Do all of your renewable power targets include 100% stake by 2025 or a 29% stake in -- either way, what contribution or what is needed to take that 100% stake in 2023?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: We have 2 scenarios. And at the end, it's neither one nor the other question, so you will see. So it's neither 100% nor 29%, [override this]. But again, this will have to be evaluated. I don't want to preempt this question because the world is changing very quickly, to be clear. And we have also the option to IPO Total Eren, which might be an option as well. And so we'll -- we are considering, I would say. In our figures, it's not 100%. The way we have taken all that is we did not take 100% of all the projects in the pipeline. Okay.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of [Mino Marcado] from [Macro].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: When I look at the last 10 years, Total outperform the 2 closest peers, BP and Shell by more than 50% of total shareholder returns despite the price, the share price being like 20% below. Of course, most of this return was achieved through a growing dividend. My question to you is that, I mean always going to be the next 10 years, what can change in the next 10 years that you'll not continue to outperform your peers?</p><p>And my second question is, last, I'm wrong when you had the biggest portion of renewables, the utility companies that's actually an independent -- [floating] independent companies, we're able to grow much faster than the ones that when these come to mind. Of course, EDF Energies Nouvelles that you mentioned in your presentation, but also the Iberdrolas, the Enels, the renewables versus the German that haven't done it and so in terms of that growth. I mean do you think that by having a listed entity, you actually can grow much faster in terms of your renewal ambition?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: No. I don't think there is a link between being a listed company and being as a rate of growth. It's a matter of capital allocation. I don't understand it. As soon as we have a clear management delegated to a business, and by the way, and certainly the management has a business unit, but having expressed the strategy today, that means that part of our time as well and part of mine and part of our time is dedicated now to grow this business, and we dedicate time. So it's a matter, I think, of focus to grow and our strategy. And we have the facility there to -- we have this renewable company within Total, we have no problem to finance their projects. And we know that to access the money, which is not the case of many listed companies. So I think I don't see the -- why it should be not the same. Again, now the strategy is expressed, up to us to give -- to be sure that we have the people dedicated, but it's the way we run the business. So I'm -- the second question, it's clear to me. It will not be an excuse.</p><p>The first one is what continue to outperform, I don't know. My objective is clearly to outperform both of them. That's clear. But -- and then I would like also the stock to rerate accordingly, to be clear. No, but again, I mean, and I think, by the way, we have a differentiation factor today, which is our dividend, the yield we offer to investors. So we'll see if it's reflected in the share price.</p><p>So -- but I mean, we are -- the 3 major -- European major oil and gas companies are more or less, in fact, the same strategy. I consider that -- and this is -- I hope that we have take away from this presentation. But we are in an advanced stage compared to others, but we have already some assets that we can give you some figures that we are well engaged in it. But clear that we diverge with some of them. We consider that maintaining our oil and gas business is a condition of the transformation because it will provide to us the cash flow that we need. And that I mean -- and it's also compatible, like we show to you, with our climate ambition. And in particular, again, we are today the first to announce that we can lower our scope-free emissions by 2030.</p><p>So I think we will keep, I would say, the fundamentals of the way we run the business with a certain discipline, looking to a breakeven, and at the same time, having the ambition to establish this at a large-scale, this business. And the way we, by the way, we set the ambition is we have also looked carefully to all the names you have mentioned in the electricity competitors to see which way, which type they want to develop the business. There is one difference is that with these big utilities, we don't have any hydro in our portfolio, which obviously adds some interest in terms of storing in the storage of electricity. That's the difference because when both -- all of them are speaking about renewable capacities, we, of course, take on board the hydro capacity that's been inherited from the past. And that this ones, we do not have this part of -- is part of the missing piece of the puzzle in our portfolio.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from Palissy Advisors.</p><p>ANISH KAPADIA, DIRECTOR &amp; HEAD OF ENERGY, PALISSY ADVISORS LIMITED: A couple of questions. First of all, the fall in the -- in crude oil that you see in terms of sales from Total, what does this mean for the retail marketing business, which I think previously was supposed to be a growth area now that you'll be selling less fuel? And also, any impacts on your chemicals growth plan? So if you can give any updates in terms of your cash flow targets for those businesses?</p><p>And then secondly, there's clearly a lot of value in the Total brand in Europe and globally. And in a more connected world, there should be value in customers from their data, from cross selling. We see a number of companies that are increasingly valued on the basis of the number of customers they have. So I was just wondering, have you thought about the value embedded in that existing customer base that you have and how further to leverage that in terms of cross-selling and use of that data?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Alexis is a fan of that evaluation. So I will leave you in the second slide -- the second part, and by the way, I think also the first one. I would say, let's be clear, they are all the marketing businesses do not have the same profitability. When Alexis mentioned that he has mature assets, about 20%, all the sales are not equivalent in terms of ton -- on margins per ton. And so I think it's -- there are always -- and by the way, the objective, let's be clear, is to do what we have proposed by being selective about the sales, not only in terms of CO2 impact, but also in terms of margins impact. And we see ways to, in fact, refocus part of the marketing business on the most profitable businesses and maybe given up the less profitable ones. You want to -- you can complement obvious, and you can answer the second question, Alexis.</p><p>ALEXIS VOVK: No, no, I completely concur with what you said. I think the -- we have now to look at our businesses, obviously, based on the CO2 emission that it generates for our customers. And we have, obviously, to have a review our portfolio according to that. I think what was said earlier in the presentation is also that we are -- it's not only Total transitioning, it's also our customers. So obviously, in this marketing business, what we have to do is to transition with our customers. So the example of, for example, bunkering is clear. We want to move our customers to LNG, and we will do that to make sure that they buy less carbon energy from us. Obviously, if at a certain date, they have not transitioned, then we will have to make decisions on that business. So I think it's a very, I would say, easy mindset. We have to help our customers to transition, and we then have to make arbitrage based on the CO2 versus the margin it generates.</p><p>As for the second question, I can't read properly the question.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: The question is just you have plenty of data with your 10 million customers per day in your retail session. Why don't you sell it and make plenty of money with it? But my question is who will buy it, in fact, for you.</p><p>ALEXIS VOVK: I think the -- as a joke, I think we have heard question of putting an IPO on our Eren business. If you were a digital company and selling our data, maybe we will be the same like apple. Yes, there is value in our customer data. I think it's all about using it internally to develop the services I was mentioning, whether extending the existing services of buying new ones. And I think what is key in marketing is that our systems are not proprietary anymore. I think we have to open up to larger ecosystems. And yes, there is data when you share those data with other actors of your ecosystem and create like this. Selling them is something that we're looking at, but I don't have any specific comment to make on that.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Okay. Great. But in fact, fundamentally, the idea is to develop more services to customers, and thanks to data. I mean -- and we are -- you are developing a platform, I think, a digital platform to do the platform. You have a project.</p><p>ALEXIS VOVK: Clearly, I think specifically for -- through e-mobility. I mean electric mobility is digital native. I mentioned to you in my presentation that the -- along the value chain, our objective is to keep the relationships end to end with the customer. So it's very important that we are able to keep the customer in our ecosystem all the time. And this platform that is already up and running, that gives us access to 100,000 charging points already in Europe. Can connect with other ecosystems. And definitely, this is where the value of electric mobility and transition is coming from. I think it's a bit too early to give proper figures on the potential value of the services, but it is clearly the way we go forward.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Lydia Rainforth from Barclays.</p><p>LYDIA ROSE EMMA RAINFORTH: In terms of the renewables business, you've obviously got Total Eren, Total Solar Quadran, SunPower. It does seem quite a complicated structure. Why do you need all those different businesses? And within that, does it -- is it just geographical reach? Or is it within the effect -- how do you get the economies of scale for the construction companies and things like that? I'm just trying to want to work out practically how you make sure that those businesses aren't competing with each other in tenders?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: No, they don't compete. It's not possible. It's complementary. It's organized. It's part of the history. I think one day, probably we'll have to put that together, but it's quite clear. After that, doing E&amp;P, I have plenty of subsidiaries, one by country, and it's worked well. So it's not -- they don't compete, that's clear. So it's -- the geography has been split. And there are different entities. Some are on the distributed generation. Some are more on the large solar farms. So they don't compete, and it's well taken into account.</p><p>So I think it's not -- it seems complex to you. It's not so complex from an internal point of view. I mean -- and again, the only part is that, as you said, Total Eren, we still are minority partner. So that -- but again, we develop them in the same way. So it would be easy to reorganize if we would want to create a Total renewable company on the top. It would be easy. And then you will not see all these names, which is why in my presentation, you didn't see a single of these names. And because for me, all that is a portfolio of renewable, like we have a portfolio of E&amp;P licenses, and I don't mention all the names of all the subsidiaries. It's just because it's still a little and infant. They're like -- that is entrepreneurial spirit, which we need to keep. I mean it's also because I know that Philippe like to keep these subsidiaries because each of them is building its business, and that's good because we are in a very development mode. So there is there also a management advantage to keep sometimes some small entity, having their own business.</p><p>But as I said in my -- so One Tech concept, it will be the right time now to think big. And if we want to think big, we'll need to organize that. We vote keep -- we vote -- I mean I see them a lot of reporting to please you to get plenty of reporting but to keep the entrepreneurial spirit we have in the team. Okay.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Adolff from Credit Suisse.</p><p>THOMAS YOICHI ADOLFF: And I do apologize for the [Torin] question. If we look at Europe long-term 2050, and obviously, refineries will be converted into biofuel plants and you can probably generate more money, but how do you offset the loss of earnings from the petrol station as [IDT] transportation is electrified because charge points are far less profitable.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: Because you have plenty of, I think -- I mean the idea there is first in '20 -- by 2030 or 2050?</p><p>ALEXIS VOVK: '50.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: '50, by 2050, our renewable and power business will be so large, but it will largely be larger than our marketing business. The ambition is not to stop there. So I mean first question.</p><p>And second, I think you have an asset in the marketing business, maybe we share all these networks of shops, and that's a question mark for us. When do we really, I would say, consider that not only as a complementary business to selling fuels but as a business as itself. And that's something that clearly, we have there some assets which could be valuized. And not only to sell them as we always said, but we can also develop a convenience store business. Total is maybe not the best company. We could take some partners to do that. But in fact, these assets could be developed. And it's true in Europe, it's also true in Africa, where we have probably one of the best network over in Africa.</p><p>So I think I'm not so afraid by the fact that we can lose market in sales or liquids. That's why we need to embark in all these multi-energy business, including in Marketing &amp; Services. And Alexis will soon establish, by the way, a business unit dedicated to all these new energies, not being as an annex of the liquid fuels, but as an independent business unit in order to have its own strategy to grow the business. Do you want to...</p><p>ALEXIS VOVK: No, I just want to concur. I mean in the strategy that we presented earlier this year, we -- especially on Europe, we show that we have an objective of generating 40% of our cash flows in Europe from nonfuel revenues. So this is clearly coming from the shop and from all the associated services linked to the mobility, whether it is carwashes, tolls, especially for trucks, whether it is car parks and so on. So I think this is a complementary business. And whether you are charging on EV, you will still be mobile and you will still need to have the convenience of shopping in a nearby shop. So I think this is something that we are looking very clearly.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: But just -- Thomas, just figure, if you look to -- if you take the figures, which was given to you by Alexis out of the $2 billion of cash flow per year coming from Marketing &amp; Services, fuel sales represent 1.3, 1.4, 2/3. So it's not -- it's interesting because it's stable, it's predictable. I mean there's less volatility. So it's like we like this business. But at the scale of the company and 2050, it's not such a change.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will now be taking our last question from the line of Irene Himona from Societe Generale.</p><p>IRENE HIMONA: I had a question on renewables, if I may. Clearly, you explained the competitive advantages that you enjoy versus local utilities, your global reach, your trading capabilities. So if we take this [week] specific deal in Spain, you said that this 5 gigawatt portfolio in Spain, thanks to your electricity trading capabilities, enables you to actually supply and cover all of your European sites with green electricity. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about what -- or how does the trading platform of Total need to adapt and change its model? Because clearly, you cannot move or they cannot move the electrons. It's not the same as physically moving a barrel of oil. So what sort of new innovations or how does the model adapt and change? And does that create perhaps some different type of risks for that operation?</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: It's an excellent question. By the way, it's not a 5 gigawatt, it's 3 gigawatt out of the 5 that we need for our own operations. But the same question, your question is valid. It was a long discussion. And in fact, at the end, it was a combination of internally on one side, the renewable people. We are very happy to have a corporate PPA. So refining people and chemical people are quite happy to have a green electricity at a good price. And in the middle, we have the pressure of the trading. So Philippe, you can elaborate on the management of these risks. And by the way, one of the idea also is to probably promote the interconnection within Spain and France politically. But can you take the questions?</p><p>PHILIPPE SAUQUET: Yes. Well, first, what you have to memorize is that we have started yesterday to develop power trading, and we have been active in power trading and trading power across Europe since now more than 15 to 20 years. And I was reading recently the ambition in power trading in terms of megawatt hour traded and where we're locating, we largely do, and we were giving the ambition for 2025. We are already at this level today.</p><p>So we know that business. Yes, it's a very different business from -- compared to all trading. We need to balance our operation half an hour by half an hour. We have a lot of conviction, especially in countries like Spain, where various limit interconnection between the Continental Europe, and we take that into account. We can, of course, use some physical assets and the CCGTs that we have can allow us to hedge our position on one side. We are developing also batteries on the other, but most of the flexibility will come from our ability to trade on the market and to resell or buy the power that we need to sell in Spain when we have too much and buy the power in the countries where we will not have enough in order to supply our entities. But it is something that we know how to do, but true that the extent of the contract is massive and is forcing us to develop a specialized team in order to address that.</p><p>PATRICK POUYANN\u00e9: But I like this. It was the last question and I like the question because, in fact, for this question, I think you touch the real value that a large oil and gas company like an integrated company can bring to this business of renewables and power because it's exactly when we speak about the integration there. And part of the answer will be sure that when we take on both such contracts, we immediately think, okay, then that means that we need to have more storage assets with type of assets in order to build the business. And that's the beginning, I think, of a new creation of value.</p><p>So I think it's -- first of all, I would like to thank all of you for your participation. Sorry, it has been a little long for us in 13 minutes. I thank you because there are many questions along these 2 hours of Q&amp;A. I'm sure you have more, and we will have the following weeks to come back to you and to answer to more of your questions.</p><p>I think you'll leave with a -- this is, as I said, for us, an important day because we have put together and because, again, the strategy to transform Total into this broad energy company. I think it's a very interesting challenge, but we are also convinced with the Board of Directors that this is the right direction, as I said, to accelerate and to answer and to convince now investors that this model is basically one of the right model in order to grow and to -- in these fields. We've, again, having -- maintaining our core business, what we need and to generate the cash flows and then to accelerate progressively the ambition ongoing on renewables and power to generate new cash flows. And there is very virtuous circle. And the last year that we spent, again, I think getting the fruits of all what we have prepared during the years before make us confident that we can develop this model, and I hope we will convince more and more investors and That total will be able to convince black and greens for the benefit of our shareholders.

Getting to the \u201cright regulation\u201d will require us to think very differently. The challenge goes far beyond Facebook and other social media: The use and abuse of data is going to be the defining feature of just about every company on the planet as we enter the age of machine learning and autonomous systems. </p><p>So far, Europe has taken a much more aggressive regulatory approach than anything the U.S. was contemplating before or since <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>\u2019s testimony. The European Parliament\u2019s Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is now in force, which extends data privacy rights to all European citizens regardless of whether their data is processed by companies within the EU or beyond. But I\u2019m not holding my breath that the GDPR will get us very far on the massive regulatory challenge we face. It is just more of the same when it comes to regulation in the modern economy: a lot of ambiguous costly to interpret words and procedures on paper that are outmatched by rapidly evolving digital global technologies. Crucially, the GDPR still relies heavily on the outmoded technology of user choice and consent, the main result of which has seen almost everyone in Europe (and beyond) inundated with emails asking them to reconfirm permission to keep their data. But this is an illusion of choice, just as it is when we are ostensibly given the option to decide whether to agree to terms set by large corporations in standardized take-it-or-leave-it click-to-agree documents. There\u2019s also the problem of actually tracking whether companies are complying. It is likely that the regulation of online activity requires yet more technology, such as blockchain and AI-powered monitoring systems, to track data usage and implement smart contract terms. As the EU has already discovered with the right to be forgotten, however, governments lack the technological resources needed to enforce these rights. Search engines are required to serve as their own judge and jury in the first instance; Google at last count was doing 500 a day. The fundamental challenge we face, here and throughout the modern economy, is not \u201cwhat should the rules for Facebook be?\u201d but rather, \u201chow can we can innovate new ways to regulate effectively in the global digital age?\u201d The answer is that we need to find ways to harness the same ingenuity and drive that built Facebook to build the regulatory systems of the digital age. One way to do this is with what I call \u201csuper-regulation,\u201d which involves developing a market for licensed private regulators that serve two masters: achieving regulatory targets set by governments but also facing the market incentive to compete for business by innovating more cost-effective ways to do that. Imagine, for example, if instead of drafting a detailed 261-page law like the EU did, a government instead settled on the principles of data protection, based on core values, such as privacy and user control. Private entities, profit and nonprofit, could apply to a government oversight agency for a license to provide data regulatory services to companies like Facebook, showing that their regulatory approach is effective in achieving these legislative principles. These private regulators might use technology, big-data analysis and machine learning to do that. They might also figure out how to communicate simple options to people, in the same way that the developers of our smartphone figured that out. They might develop effective schemes to audit and test whether their systems are working \u2014 on pain of losing their license to regulate. There could be many such regulators among which both consumers and Facebook could choose; some could even specialize in offering packages of data management attributes that would appeal to certain demographics \u2014 from the people who want to be invisible online, to those who want their every move documented on social media. The key here is competition: for-profit and nonprofit private regulators compete to attract money and brains to solve the problem of how to regulate complex systems like data creation and processing. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>thinks there\u2019s some kind of \u201cright regulation\u201d possible for the digital world. I believe him; I just don\u2019t think governments alone can invent it. Ideally, some next-generation college kid would be staying up late trying to invent it in his or her dorm room. The challenge we face is not how to get governments to write better laws; it\u2019s how to get them to create the right conditions for the continued innovation necessary for new and effective regulatory systems. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN852268420180530</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SFD-P841-DXCW-D3W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 30, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Getting to \"right regulation\" will require us to think very differently.<br/> The challenge goes far beyond Facebook and other social media: the use and abuse of data is going to be the defining feature of just about every company on the planet as we enter the age of machine learning and autonomous systems.<br/> So far, Europe has taken a much more aggressive regulatory approach than anything the US was contemplating before or since Zuckerberg's testimony.<br/> The European Parliament's Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is now in force, which extends data privacy rights to all European citizens regardless of whether their data is processed by companies within the EU or beyond.<br/> But I'm not holding my breath that the GDPR will get us very far on the massive regulatory challenge we face. It is just more of the same when it comes to regulation in the modern economy: a lot of ambiguous costly-to-interpret words and procedures on paper that are outmatched by rapidly evolving digital global technologies.<br/> Crucially, the GDPR still relies heavily on the outmoded technology of user choice and consent, the main result of which has seen almost everyone in Europe (and beyond) inundated with emails asking them to reconfirm permission to keep their data. But this is an illusion of choice, just as it is when we are ostensibly given the option to decide whether to agree to terms set by large corporations in standardized take-it-or-leave-it click-to-agree documents.<br/> There's also the problem of actually tracking whether companies are complying. It is likely that the regulation of online activity requires yet more technology, such as blockchain and AI-powered monitoring systems, to track data usage and implement smart contract terms.<br/> As the EU has already discovered with the right to be forgotten, however, governments lack the technological resources needed to enforce these rights. Search engines are required to serve as their own judge and jury in the first instance; Google at last count was doing 500 a day.<br/> The fundamental challenge we face, here and throughout the modern economy, is not: \"what should the rules for Facebook be?\" but rather, \"how can we can innovate new ways to regulate effectively in the global digital age?\"<br/> The answer is that we need to find ways to harness the same ingenuity and drive that built Facebook to build the regulatory systems of the digital age. One way to do this is with what I call \"super-regulation\" which involves developing a market for licensed private regulators that serve two masters: achieving regulatory targets set by governments but also facing the market incentive to compete for business by innovating more cost-effective ways to do that.<br/> Imagine, for example, if instead of drafting a detailed 261-page law like the EU did, a government instead settled on the principles of data protection, based on core values, such as privacy and user control.<br/> Private entities, profit and non-profit, could apply to a government oversight agency for a license to provide data regulatory services to companies like Facebook, showing that their regulatory approach is effective in achieving these legislative principles.<br/> These private regulators might use technology, big-data analysis, and machine learning to do that. They might also figure out how to communicate simple options to people, in the same way that the developers of our smartphone figured that out. They might develop effective schemes to audit and test whether their systems are working-on pain of losing their license to regulate.<br/> There could be many such regulators among which both consumers and Facebook could choose: some could even specialize in offering packages of data management attributes that would appeal to certain demographics - from the people who want to be invisible online, to those who want their every move documented on social media.<br/> The key here is competition: for-profit and non-profit private regulators compete to attract money and brains the problem of how to regulate complex systems like data creation and processing.<br/> Zuckerberg thinks there's some kind of \"right\" regulation possible for the digital world. I believe him; I just don't think governments alone can invent it. Ideally, some next generation college kid would be staying up late trying to invent it in his or her dorm room.<br/> The challenge we face is not how to get governments to write better laws; it's how to get them to create the right conditions for the continued innovation necessary for new and effective regulatory systems.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10523484</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SFV-C3V1-DYDW-7014-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 29, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0009K8Y</classCode><className>CENTURY COS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Sam Granger follows software businesses through the lens of a value investor.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sam Granger could own almost any stock in the world, but it's little-known ASX software plays Objective Corp and RPMGlobal that sit side-by-side with Apple and Facebook in his unique, 13-stock best ideas strategy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Totus High Conviction Fund recorded a 40 per cent return in 2019, after fees. Granger has never shorted a single company since the fund started in 2014, although he could if he wanted to.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Granger is a reader, and it's legendary value manager Warren Buffett's letters that he says are the most instructive thing he's ever read. \"I learnt more doing that than going to university. Before I read those letters, someone would ask you 'what's a good business?' What is a good business?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"He just says, a good business is one that earns a lot of cash relative to the amount of capital invested in the business.\"</p><p>To Buffett, that could be Apple, or in another time, See's Candy. But to Granger, that's where Objective comes in: a $559 million market cap, \"undiscovered\" homegrown technology business that is a provider to governments and regulated industries for planning, process and governance.</p><p>Spews cash</p><p>\"There is very specific legislation around how they control data and compliance around how they store information. And it's very niche, basically a duopoly between two companies and Objective's one of those companies,\" the fund manager says.</p><p>\"Tony Walls is the founder and he's building this annuity stream, this recurring revenue. Through that process you might not see growth in the overall business but the mix is changing. I guess it's a time arbitrage opportunity where if I'm happy to take a two-year view - and I was - then I can get in there before you start to see the evidence of that change and you're starting to see that now.\"</p><p>Objective \"spews cash\" and the share count has reduced by 35 per cent since listing, which the fund manager says is unusual for such a business. It is also somewhat illiquid. \"There's a good book called The Outsiders: [Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success] and Tony strikes me as an outsider.\"</p><p>Granger loves software businesses, but he follows them through the lens of a value investor, not a growth junkie. \"I've stayed away from the ones that burn a lot of money,\" he says, relying on free cashflow multiples as a preferred valuation measure.</p><p>\"Software businesses are awesome businesses because you have this high fixed cost producing the software, and then you can sell it multiple times at very high gross margins, and then the really good ones have really sticky customer bases.\" Switching can also be prohibitive for many organisations.</p><p>RPM is another such business, a $199 million specialist software provider to geologists, engineers and miners.</p><p>\"The subscription revenue has started to take-off, which is the high quality part of the revenue mix. The old way of selling software was you'd sell a one-off perpetual license fee. Let's say that was $100 and then you'd get $20 a year in maintenance revenue. The maintenance was the recurring part.</p><p>\"The new model is, in the first year you get $30 of subscription revenue, no license fee, so the first year you take a $70 hit, but then the recurring revenue base is continuous: you get $30 a year instead of $20 a year. That's a high quality revenue business but the first year you take a hit. So Objective has done that process, RPM Global is going through that process as well.\"</p><p>Hit rate</p><p>Granger's fund is co-managed by Totus founder Ben McGarry, and Granger is in turn a co-manager of McGarry's much larger long-short Totus Alpha Fund. The High Conviction strategy has an average return of 18.7 per cent a year since inception.</p><p>\"Shorting's hard, Ben does a great job of it. I'm young right? So I want to be long equities for the next 30 years, and if you can ride the volatility, I'll do well. Shorting makes sense, you want to protect capital because you don't have that long time horizon.\"</p><p>Granger likens his strategy to the highly selective personal accounts some fund managers run on the side, based on its willingness to stay small and go down rabbit holes in search of ideas.</p><p>\"The market might trade on 20 times earnings, if I can buy [a stock] on the same multiple as the market, and I know it's a way better business than the market in terms of secular growth and return on capital, that's simple right? That's how we think about it.\"</p><p>McGarry made a bold call last year <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/asx-to-fall-global-bonds-sell-off-20190910-p52pph\">when he predicted Tesla was a zero</url> at a Livewire event in Sydney. Tesla has recovered, to $US510.50 a share, as of Friday. At the time it was his most profitable short ever, declaring Tesla \"a world leader in products that are not quite ready yet\".</p><p>\"I think he's right about that. But I haven't done nearly as much work on it as him. The problem with these things is when you talk about stocks publicly, you get tied to these ideas,\" Granger says. \"I read Ashlee Vance's Elon Musk book and I like Elon Musk in the sense I think what he's doing is really good and I kind of hope it works out, but based on the weight of evidence, I don't think it will.\"</p><p>Granger cites Magellan's billionaire chairman Hamish Douglass, the managers behind VGI Partners, and Samuel Terry's Fred Woollard as the kind of investors he respects, for different reasons. (He also has two brothers in funds management, but reserves judgement except to say: \"my brothers joke that in my US stocks I'm following Hamish Douglass around\").</p><p>\"If someone you respect likes something, that's a good place to start, that's a good filter. Then insider buying is a good filter as well, we look at that every day.\"</p><p>He found a profitable opportunity getting under-priced exposure to the listed VGI management company through VGI's separate listed investment company raising, where participants were entitled to rights in the manager at no cost as a means of investor alignment. The listed investment company stock could be sold upon the LIC's debut, which would leave an investor with shares in the manager that happened to be undervalued.</p><p>\"You see those things once a year if you're watching closely,\" he says.</p><p>The biggest challenge is the patience a good idea requires to play out: \"If you presented [Objective Corp's growth] to most people, they would agree with you, but buy it in 12 months' time. The good ideas are pretty obvious, it's just being patient and waiting for them and then doing the right work to make sure that your hit rate's high.\"</p><p>War on big tech</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/warren-s-troubling-aversion-to-big-corporations-20191024-p533rb\">Elizabeth Warren is threatening to break-up big tech</url> if she wins the US presidential race this year, and Bernie Sanders appears to sympathise with that view. However, the fund manager is not particularly worried about a break-up scenario, because those companies are probably worth more than the sum of their parts. Nonetheless, he would not favour restrictions on their ability to use data.</p><p>\"Some of their behaviour is quite predatory, but I just think the argument in the media generally is quite simplistic,\" Granger says. \"You've probably got friends who have built small businesses on Facebook.

Granger has not shorted a single company since the fund started in 2014, although he could if he wanted to.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Granger, an avid reader, says that legendary value manager Warren Buffett's letters are the most instructive thing he's ever read. \"I learnt more doing that than going to university. Before I read those letters, someone would ask you, 'what's a good business?' What is a good business?</p><p>\"He just says a good business is one that earns a lot of cash relative to the amount of capital invested in the business.\"</p><p>To Buffett, that could be Apple, or in another time, See's Candies. But to Granger, that's where Objective comes in: a $559 million market cap, \"undiscovered\" home-grown technology business that is a provider to governments and regulated industries for planning, process and governance.</p><p>\"There is very specific legislation around how they control data and compliance around how they store information. And it's very niche, basically a duopoly between two companies and Objective's one of those companies,\" the fund manager says.</p><p>\"Tony Walls is the founder and he's building this annuity stream, this recurring revenue. Through that process you might not see growth in the overall business but the mix is changing.</p><p>\"I guess it's a time arbitrage opportunity where if I'm happy to take a two-year view - and I was - then I can get in there before you start to see the evidence of that change and you're starting to see that now.\"</p><p>Objective \"spews cash\" and the share count has reduced by 35 per cent since listing, which the fund manager says is unusual for such a business. It is also somewhat illiquid. \"There's a good book called The Outsiders: [Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success] and Tony strikes me as an outsider.\"</p><p>Granger loves software businesses, but he follows them through the lens of a value investor, not a growth junkie. \"I've stayed away from the ones that burn a lot of money,\" he says, relying on free cash-flow multiples as a preferred valuation measure.</p><p>\"Software businesses are awesome businesses because you have this high fixed cost producing the software, and then you can sell it multiple times at very high gross margins, and then the really good ones have really sticky customer bases.\" Switching can also be prohibitive for many organisations.</p><p>RPM, a $199 million specialist software provider to geologists, engineers and miners, is another such business.</p><p>\"The subscription revenue has started to take off, which is the high quality part of the revenue mix. The old way of selling software was you'd sell a one-off perpetual license fee. Let's say that was $100 and then you'd get $20 a year in maintenance revenue. The maintenance was the recurring part.</p><p>\"The new model is, in the first year you get $30 of subscription revenue, no license fee, so the first year you take a $70 hit, but then the recurring revenue base is continuous: you get $30 a year instead of $20 a year. That's a high quality revenue business but the first year you take a hit. So Objective has done that process, RPM Global is going through that process as well.\"</p><p>Granger's fund is co-managed by Totus founder Ben McGarry, and Granger is in turn a co-manager of McGarry's much larger long-short Totus Alpha Fund. The High Conviction strategy has an average return of 18.7 per cent a year since inception.</p><p>\"Shorting's hard, Ben does a great job of it. I'm young right? So I want to be long equities for the next 30 years, and if you can ride the volatility, I'll do well. Shorting makes sense, you want to protect capital because you don't have that long time horizon.\"</p><p>Granger likens his fund's strategy to the highly selective personal accounts some fund managers run on the side, based on its willingness to stay small and go down rabbit holes in search of ideas.</p><p>\"The market might trade on 20 times earnings, if I can buy [a stock] on the same multiple as the market, and I know it's a way better business than the market in terms of secular growth and return on capital, that's simple right? That's how we think about it.\"</p><p>McGarry made a bold call last year when he predicted Tesla was a zero at a Livewire event in Sydney, declaring it \"a world leader in products that are not quite ready yet\". At the time it was his most profitable short ever. Tesla has since recovered to $US510.50 ($742) a share as of Friday.</p><p>\"I think he's right about [Tesla],\" Granger says. \"But I haven't done nearly as much work on it as him.</p><p>\"The problem with these things is when you talk about stocks publicly, you get tied to these ideas. I read Ashlee Vance's Elon Musk book and I like Elon Musk in the sense I think what he's doing is really good and I kind of hope it works out, but based on the weight of evidence, I don't think it will.\"</p><p>Granger cites Magellan's billionaire chairman Hamish Douglass, the managers behind VGI Partners, and Samuel Terry's Fred Woollard as the kind of investors he respects, for different reasons. (He also has two brothers in funds management, but reserves judgment except to say: \"My brothers joke that in my US stocks I'm following Hamish Douglass around.\")</p><p>\"If someone you respect likes something, that's a good place to start, that's a good filter. Then insider buying is a good filter as well, we look at that every day.\"</p><p>He found a profitable opportunity getting underpriced exposure to the listed VGI management company through VGI's separate listed investment company raising, in which participants were entitled to rights in the manager at no cost as a means of investor alignment.</p><p>The listed investment company stock could be sold upon the LIC's debut, which would leave an investor with shares in the manager that happened to be undervalued.</p><p>\"You see those things once a year if you're watching closely,\" he says.</p><p>The biggest challenge is the patience a good idea requires to play out. \"If you presented [Objective Corp's growth] to most people, they would agree with you, but buy it in 12 months' time. The good ideas are pretty obvious, it's just being patient and waiting for them and then doing the right work to make sure that your hit rate's high.\"</p><p>Elizabeth Warren is threatening to break up big tech if she wins the US presidential race this year, and Bernie Sanders appears to sympathise with that view. However, the fund manager is not particularly worried about a break-up scenario, because those companies are probably worth more than the sum of their parts. Nonetheless, he would not favour restrictions on their ability to use data.</p><p>\"Some of their behaviour is quite predatory, but I just think the argument in the media generally is quite simplistic,\" Granger says. \"You've probably got friends who have built small businesses on Facebook. It's the biggest enabler of small businesses.</p><p>\"What are you going to do, are you going to limit how effectively these small businesses can advertise to save some other old media companies? It doesn't make sense.\" Most people trust Facebook and want to see relevant ads, he thinks.</p><p>He has only a tiny position in Amazon because he can't get comfortable with the valuation, at $US1864 a share. \"It's obvious that he's under-earning but how much is he under-earning, and when does it show up, is hard,\" he says, with Jeff Bezos in mind.</p><p>As part of his research on the cloud and artificial intelligence, he just finished Brad Stone's The Everything Store about Amazon's origins. \"That was really interesting.\" Bezos will probably give away his fortune, but on his own terms, Granger speculates, despite the enormous investment required for the space project Blue Origin.</p><p>\"We're about track records and history being the best guide to the future, so I spend 90 per cent of my research time looking at what's happened in history, reading annual reports, modelling historical financials to understand drivers.\"</p><p>He's unlikely to try forecasting earnings five years out, because it's not an exercise even company management can do successfully for most businesses.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc78wuigyqqsyjne5z185</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1T-RDJ1-F0J6-J2J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The process was marked by success all but one designate tapped by European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen. V\u011bra Jourov, the Czec Commissioner-designate for Values and Transparency kicked-off the second round of public hearings. </p><p>Freedom of expression, protection of journalists, application of the rule of law and greater transparency of European institutions were at the top of Jourov's five-year to-do list. To respond to the challenges of the digitalisation era, Jourov is called to form a concrete European democracy action plan that will address the threats of external intervention in European elections, orientate citizens in the digital era and regulate fake news. It is through 'More agreements, less vetoes', that Josep Borrell wants to respond to foreign affairs and security policy challenges. Borrell's performance during his hearing 'For a Stronger Europe in the World' demonstrated Europe's contemporary needs; the Union needs to find its place in the international arena and to dare to use its language of power. The Spanish designate presented what the Commission President-elect, Ursula von der leyen had requested: an ambitious vision of a more strategic and coherent Union, that will have the capacity to act autonomously in the name of defending its civilisation. The following day of public hearings found Valdis Dombrovskis defending himself for 'An Economy that Works for People' portfolio. 'Changes need to be socially fair in order to succeed' highlighted the Latvian Commissioner-designate. MEPs' bombed Dombrovskis with questions over EU's banking sector, anti-money laundering rules, crypto currencies, the Sustainable Development Goals, the targets for the EU green transition and the effective implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights for a fair and accessible labour market. The experienced Dombrovskis stressed that the EU must be able to leverage its economic and political weight and act independently. Margrethe Vestager will lead Europe's digital industrial strategy. The Danish Commissioner for Competition and an Executive Vice President-designate for 'A Europe Fit for the Digital Age' will now have to deal with tasks ranging from anti-trust enforcement to data protection. Vestager pledged that she will safeguard Europe's decision-making autonomy and digital sovereignty in the era of digital transformation and is ready to reign over Big Tech. Europe also saw its new climate chief Frans Timmermans get the European Parliament green light. The Dutch-designate for European Green Deal and Climate Action committed to making Europe the first carbon-neutral continent in 2050. Preservation of resources, protection of biodiversity and Europe's leading role in meeting citizens' expectations over environmental and climate challenges shaped Timmermans' five-year plan. Janusz Wojciechowski, the Polish-designate for agriculture was heard for a second time and managed to get through, despite the remaining doubts. Wojciechowski spoke the MEPs' language or to put it better, his language, instead of English and presented an accurate action plan on US tariffs and industrialised farming. On the contrary, the French designate for the internal market portfolio, Sylvie Goulard was rejected by the European Parliament after her second hearing. MEPs questioned her capacity to deal with the wide portfolio of defence and industry and also her financial integrity related to her involvement to the US Berggruen Institute think-tank in 2013-2016.Goulard marked the third out of 26 nominees tapped by Ursula von der Leyen that was rejected, giving a headache both to the Commission President-elect and French President Emmanuel Macron. The European Parliament now faces time constraints with hearing the new designates of Hungary and Romania, and of course the new French designate. Whether a matter of exercising power or playing political parties' game, the Parliament is making it difficult for Ursula von der Leyen to take up her mandate on 1 November. However this may be of little consequence in the long-term, as the only Commission to ever start on time since hearings were introduced in 2004 was the Jean-Claude Juncker commission. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NWEU1342961570820769644251761300039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWEU-134296</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X80-6PV1-F03R-N4J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><timeReceived>7:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>New Europe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 11, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Sylvie Goulard</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Janusz Wojciechowski</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ephearings</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vra Jourov</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Valdis Dombrovskis</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Frans Timmermans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ursula von der Leyen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Josep Borrell</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>European Commission</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>European Parliament</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey were in Washington today and getting grilled by lawmakers on election tampering, privacy issues and bias, among other topics. The market's real fear, though, is the threat of increased regulation for some of the biggest engines of this strong economy.  But it wasn't just social media names taking it on the chin. Technology in general was being sold, leading to a 1.19% plunge in the NASDAQ to 7995.2. There's not much this index can do when all of the FANGs pull back at once. The last time the NASDAQ slipped by more than 1% was during the Turkey mess back in mid-August.  Tech also has a big stake in the S...but that index managed to slide by only 0.28% to 2888.6. The Dow bounced around more than its counterparts and actually finished with a gain of 0.09% to 25,975.  While these testimonies were the big news today, the market is still keeping a close eye on trade. The U.S. and Canada got back to negotiations today after failing to work out a deal last week. President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are taking hard lines on the issue with both pretty much saying that no agreement is better than a bad agreement.  And of course, there's still $200 billion worth of new tariffs that could be imposed on Chinese goods this week.  Today's Portfolio Highlights:  Stocks Under $10: The market was not happy with early results for a gene-editing trial from Sangamo BioSciences (SGMO). As a result, shares got shellacked on Wednesday and dropped more than 23%. SGMO was one of the best performers in the portfolio and Brian Bolan wanted to hold onto the name until it reached about $25. But biotech can be extremely volatile, and the editor doesn't want to risk any more of this impressive profit. He sold SGMO today and banked an approximately 55% return.  Home Run Investor: When you're heavily invested in tech, a day like this has you looking for a little diversification. Brian Bolan doesn't think today's tech selloff is a big deal, but it's just a good reminder that balance is key. Therefore, he picked up an industrial play on Wednesday by adding Harsco (HSC), which is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) services and engineered products company. In addition to some good style scores, the editor really appreciates that HSC has beaten earnings estimates for 13 quarters in a row! Read the complete commentary for more on this new addition.  Counterstrike: \"Finally, we saw some selling in the big tech names, that brought FANG bulls to their knees.  \"Stocks like GOOGL and NFLX were very weak, giving back their recent gains. Amazon and Apple showed their first signs of weakness in over a week. With that recent semiconductor winners AMD and NVDA both saw reversals in the morning.  \"While selling was aggressive in the morning, we saw the typical rebound in the afternoon. We keep seeing China selling off, which is causing selling in Asia and trickling to Europe. When the market opens here, the futures are already down, causing traders to buy the dip. So far the S...ontinues to hold up well.\" -- Jeremy Mullin  All the Best, Jim GiaquintoRecommendations from Zacks' Private Portfolios:  Believe it or not, this article is not available on the Zacks.com website.

For this is now a political as much as a technological battle. \"Duty of Care\" is a phrase which today features as often on front pages as in the business pages. It has been the subject of a long campaign at The Telegraph. Yet now that it is a matter of policy, cited 53 times in the White Paper's 98 pages, there are questions within the industry about whether that policy has been fully considered, or is merely reflex reaction to growing public outrage.</p><p>\"People see tech as a political football to be kicked around,\" one disgruntled insider said yesterday after digesting the White Paper. Not that its tone came as much of a surprise to him. He'd been briefed beforehand by Whitehall sources. \"I was told: 'The Home Secretary plans to thrash you.'\" The potential sanctions are indeed draconian. Far from bland, mealymouthed proposals, here is red meat - from making senior executives personally responsible, to blocking their services altogether. If Britain ever stopped Facebook reaching these shores, the legal basis would lie in this White Paper. Not that Mr Javid and Mr Wright intend their formula for Britain alone. As they make clear, they want their proposals to become the basis of \"new, global approaches for online safety\".</p><p>That certainly does not lack ambition. Moreover, as well as targeting tech bosses and blocking their sites, they propose to ease the way for aggressive class-action suits, calling them \"super-complaints\" with tech companies paying for the privilege. \"The regulator will be funded by industry,\" it notes. What is \"the industry\"? Answer: \"Companies that allow users to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online\". That is great swathes of the internet, from giant to start-up.</p><p>The breadth and depth of such regulatory power is, understandably, creating powerful digital shock waves. \"We are really concerned about the scope of this,\" says Dom Hallas, executive director of the Coalition for a Digital Economy. \"It really is very broad, it covers virtually everything.\"</p><p>He is referring not just to scale of companies affected, but the content they host. Acts of terror, such as the Christchurch mosque shootings last month, were broadcast on Facebook using its Live video service, and the footage initially spread faster than it, and other sites such as YouTube, could remove it.</p><p>Not all dangerous material is so easy to identify for suppression. Yet the White Paper does not shy from clamping down on content that it deems merely \"unacceptable\".</p><p>\"Other online behaviours or content, even if they may not be illegal in all circumstances, can also cause serious harm,\" it notes. Unacceptable but not illegal? \"They want [tech companies] to ban material the Government dare not ban itself,\" says Jim Killock, president of the online advocacy Open Rights Group. \"If this material is harmful, why isn't the Government banning it?\" To some, like Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs, this is the beginning of the age of censorship. \"These draconian regulations will do more harm than good, ushering in new levels of censorship and killing innovation along the way,\" he said.</p><p>And such fears of overreach are also being leapt on by big tech companies. \"We need proposals that are targeted and practical to implement \u2026 we also need to protect freedom of speech and the services consumers love,\" said a spokesman for the Internet Association, which represents 40 tech companies including Google and Facebook.</p><p>Why then, do such complaints ring a little hollow? Possibly it is because, while they may disagree on some of the terms, broadly the world's largest technology companies have recently supported calls for greater regulation. They want states to help them set the rules, recognising that, frankly, networks of billions of users require a level of mature governance that organisations months and years old cannot muster.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, last month called for a \"more active role for governments and regulators\", while Amazon, Google, Twitter's Jack Dorsey and others have all begun to nod along with the sentiment that policing the content on their sites is better left to governments. Yesterday, Mr Javid and Mr Wright obliged. \"Privately run platforms have become akin to public spaces,\" the White Paper suggested. \"Some of these companies now acknowledge their responsibility to be guided by norms and rules developed by democratic societies.\"</p><p>Such harmony may seem odd. But there is good reason for the world's biggest tech companies to celebrate yesterday's announcement. It is not the fact of state intervention Mr Zuckerberg et al favour, it is the manner of it.</p><p>Because any successful companies \"that allow users to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online\" quickly generate vast amounts of data. Huge quantities of data to check - some of which, like text, may be reasonably simple to check, some of which, like photos and videos, may present far greater problems.</p><p>The only possible solution is technology - automated vetting through sophisticated artificial intelligence. And guess which companies have the best AI? Facebook and Google have not sat still in the face of threatened regulation. They have already worked on developing the most advanced software that can immediately detect and remove \"hashed\" - essentially digitally watermarked - illegal content such as child pornography or terrorist videos.</p><p>\"We haven't waited for regulation, we've created new technology, hired experts and specialists and ensured our policies are fit for the evolving challenges we face online,\" Claire Lilley, Google's public policy manager, said yesterday.</p><p>Such dominance is legal as well as algorithmic. \"Most companies in the market, certainly small British companies, will not be able to compete with Facebook,\" says Mr Hallas. \"The Government is accidentally entrenching the dominance of the largest internet companies that have the most lawyers.\"</p><p>Such unintended consequences would hit smaller companies, and consumers - indeed, almost everyone but the large tech companies many people currently view as the chief villains of the piece.</p><p>\"In its drive to make the internet 'safe', the Government seems not to recognise its proposals don't regulate social media companies, they regulate social media users,\" Mr Killock said.</p><p>And it is not just the White Paper.</p><p>The Cairncross review into journalism in the digital age and ongoing plans for a Digital Services Tax are helping to contribute to a sense that it is open season for other hosts of digital content.</p><p>Who will survive? As though he were poor and powerless, Mark Zuckerberg has reached out a trembling hand and asked for help. \"Every day, we make decisions about what speech is harmful, what constitutes political advertising and how to prevent sophisticated cyber attacks,\" he said last month. \"But if we were starting from scratch, we wouldn't ask companies to make these judgments alone.\"</p><p>For all its laudable intent, the Online Harms white paper has now given him precisely what he wants. It dilutes his company's responsibility while setting out rules, fees and fines that it is in an unrivalled position to meet. Rivals, however, may be less content. The regulator's dilemma is far from resolved.</p><p>As though he were poor and powerless, Mark Zuckerberg has reached out a trembling hand for help</p><p>'We haven't waited for regulation. We have ensured our policies are fit for the evolving challenges we face'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg leaves the Merrion Hotel in Dublin last week after meeting politicians to discuss regulation of social media and harmful contentPRESS ASSOCIATION</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-148142550</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-NTK1-JCBW-N1MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1364\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ben Christopher is sitting in for Dan Morain, who is on assignment today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There is a protocol of death and an administration of death in the state of California, and it consumes the court's time, it consumes the criminal justice system, it exhausts the soul and the pocketbook. I would ultimately like to shut down that system of death.\"\u2014Gov. Gavin Newsom in a conference call this week with reporters from ethnic news outlets, musing on a possible plan to ban new death sentences in local criminal cases, according to The Los Angeles Times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Newsom vs. the death penalty</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Gov. Gavin Newsom could order prosecutors not to seek capital punishment.</p><p> Doubling down on the moratorium he recently issued on executions, Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters this week he's also considering a ban on death sentences in local criminal cases, yet another sign that California is swinging away from the state's once-reflexive toughness on crime.</p><p> * Making good on his musings, shared on a conference call with ethnic media on Tuesday and more widely reported by The Los Angeles Times on Thursday, could conceivably put Newsom at odds with Attorney General Xavier Becerra.</p><p> The attorney general must enforce state laws, capital punishment among them, and last year, Becerra sought the death penalty for a mass murder in Seal Beach, The Times noted:</p><p> \"While it is not entirely clear how Newsom would implement such an order, he either could have Becerra direct local district attorneys not to seek the death penalty or order Becerra to not defend appeals. Both approaches would probably face legal challenges.\"</p><p> ------------</p><p> Advertisement</p><p> ------------</p><p> The crime wave that wasn't</p><p> The 1990s \"super-predator\" panic didn't pan out as Californians feared.</p><p> Juvenile crime rates have plummeted, leaving California with thousands of empty juvenile detention beds\u2014and the attendant fixed costs, The San Francisco Chronicle reports.</p><p> So much for those \"super-predator\" youths California policymakers predicted in the tough-on-crime 1990s. Over the past three decades, the arrest rate among youths has dropped 84 percent, compared to only 9 percent for middle-aged adults, The Chronicle finds, citing statewide data:</p><p> * Homicides dropped 83 percent between 1995 to 2017.</p><p> * Violent felony arrests declined 68 percent between 1994 and 2017.</p><p> * In 39 of 43 California counties with juvenile halls, facilities were less than 50 percent full last year.</p><p> The decline happened across the country \"almost regardless of what local, state or national policies were adopted,\" said Mike Males of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice. (For a deeper analysis, see Males' commentary for CALmatters here.)</p><p> Now counties are on the hook for nearly 9,000 empty juvenile detention beds, and per capita detention costs are so high that some counties are spending the equivalent of an Ivy League degree plus two years of law school for every teen they're holding. After the report posted Thursday, three San Francisco supervisors pledged to close the juvenile hall there.</p><p> Los Angeles Democratic Sen. Holly Mitchell: \"I think we need to figure out what to do with that excess property and figure out what a new environment looks like.\"</p><p> Mark Varela, chief probation officer in Ventura County: \"It's really the opposite of what we thought it would be. We're all kind of scratching our heads over what we're going to do with all the extra space.\"</p><p> ------------</p><p> Advertisement</p><p> ------------</p><p> Offshore oil fight</p><p> Another Trump threat on California offshore drilling.</p><p> The Trump administration is trying to \"streamline\" a federal regulation that would limit California's ability to stop new offshore drilling, The Los Angeles Times reports:</p><p> \"The administration appears to be considering limits to the scope of states' review powers and a shorter period of time to process an appeal. The full extent of its plans is unclear.\"</p><p> The skirmish is the latest between California and the Trump administration over fossil fuel exploration in the Pacific.</p><p> * 2017: The Trump administration begins reviewing locations in the Pacific for new lease sales. Six sales are proposed off the California coast.</p><p> * 2018: The Legislature passes a bill, with bipartisan support, \"strongly and unequivocally\" opposing the leasing plan.</p><p> Earlier this week, 17 U.S. Senate Democrats including California's Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Sen. Kamala Harris wrote an open letter to the acting Secretary of the Interior, David Bernhardt, asking him to explain his position on offshore drilling.</p><p> * President Trump has nominated Bernhardt to formally replace the last Interior secretary, Ryan Zinke. Californians know Bernhardt as a lobbyist for oil and agribusiness. His confirmation hearing is scheduled for next Thursday.</p><p> Saber rattling the First Amendment</p><p> President Trump signs an executive order on campus free speech.</p><p> President Donald Trump\u2014surrounded by conservative college students including a few from UC Berkeley\u2014signed an executive order yesterday to \"ensure\" that universities that receive public funding \"promote free inquiry, including through compliance with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, and policies.\"</p><p> Trump: \"Federal agencies will use their authority under various grant-making programs to ensure that public universities protect\u2014cherish\u2014protect the First Amendment and the First Amendment rights of their students or risk losing billions and billions of dollars.\"</p><p> Policy consequences are unclear. The order doesn't specify how agencies should \"ensure\" promotion of free speech\u2014or what that would even look like. Funding cuts would no doubt be challenged in court. Californians responded:</p><p> *  Janet Napolitano, UC President: \"We do not need the federal government to mandate what already exists: our longstanding, unequivocal support for freedom of expression.\"</p><p> *  Harmeet Dhillon, RNC National Committeewoman from California who has sued UC Berkeley: \"It is outrageous for public universities to with one hand choke free speech, and with the other, take federal dollars\u2026this is long overdue.\"</p><p> Speaking of free speech: A Republican legislator has introduced a resolution calling for the removal of a tenured UC Davis English professor who, in the past, has cheered the death of law enforcement officers.</p><p> From HR 22: \"Incitements to violence are not protected speech under the First Amendment and the First Amendment does not entitle a person to teach impressionable students at a taxpayer-supported university.\"</p><p> Equal pay for equal play</p><p> Is a level playing field worth the loss of female-only sporting events?</p><p> Women surfers scored big  in California last year when an obscure government commission decided it would only lease a public beach to the Mavericks surf competition if men and women were awarded equal cash prizes.</p><p> * They seemed headed for another win this year when a bill was introduced to require equal prize money for men and women at any sporting event on state-owned land.</p><p> But now the push to go further has opened a broader debate over how to advance equality for women in male-dominated sports\u2014and whether men should be included in all-female competitions. The debate extends far beyond the Capitol and, for that matter, surfing:</p><p> * Sabrina Brennan, co-founder of the Committee for Equity in Women's surfing, argues that single-sex athletic events perpetuate inequality. She wants the bill to require that all sporting events on state land include categories for both men and women.</p><p> * Assemblywoman Tasha Boerner Horvath wants to preserve female-only sporting events meant to empower girls and women in sports dominated by men.</p><p> Explore the debate with CALmatters' Laurel Rosenhall.</p><p> Thurmond talks charters</p><p> State schools chief Tony Thurmond, right, with CALmatters' Ricardo Cano.</p><p> Anyone counting on Tony Thurmond, the state's top public school administrator, to soften his stance on California charter schools after the November election is in for a disappointment.</p><p> * Thurmond appeared Thursday evening at the Commonwealth Club Thursday with CALmatters' education reporter, Ricardo Cano. When Cano mentioned charters, public schools that are privately managed, the superintendent of public instruction jokingly pretended to flee\u2014feigning an aversion to the emotional topic. But after the laughter died down, Thurmond's preference was clear.</p><p> Thurmond: \"The purpose of charter schools was to lend itself to some innovation\u2026[but] I do not believe that education is an environment for competition.\"</p><p> \"There is a role\" for charters, Thurmond said, but he repeated a campaign pledge to push for a controversial policy that would let districts consider their financial impact on traditional schools in determining whether to approve a charter. Charter advocates fear the criteria would make it easier to say no to new charter schools.</p><p> * Thurmond's fiercely fought 2018 victory over former charter school CEO Marshall Tuck was portrayed during the campaign as a referendum on charters\u2014a characterization that both candidates rejected.</p><p> * But of the $30 million in outside money spent on behalf of Tuck (or against Thurmond) most came from pro-charter groups, while Thurmond drew much of his support from public school teachers unions who oppose charters.</p><p> CALmatters will have more coverage on last night's conversation later today.</p><p> Take a Number: 1.4 million</p><p> Those federal tax cuts haven't helped California's rental crisis, a new report says.</p><p>California is short 1.4 million rental units, even with last year's massive package of housing bills, the California Housing Partnership reports.</p><p> * The non-profit measured the number of renters making less than the average income in their area and compared it to the number of rental units available that would allow them to spend less than 30 percent of their income on rent.</p><p> Federal policy shares the blame for that 1.4 million difference: One of the state's biggest affordable housing programs is the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, which allows investors to reduce their tax bill in exchange for backing construction of affordable units.</p><p> * Big federal tax cuts for corporations and the very rich have diminished the appetite for tax-reducing investments.</p><p> Among Gov.

This after gains on  Wall Street last week, the Dow Industrials and the S&amp;P500 posting gains for  five weeks in a row.  </p><p>In Europe checking on England, France, and Germany, at the moment we have  gains across the board as well.

The only reason we booked you  is to show the goat video from Boise, there you go.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC:  Everybody's going crazy about the  goat video, rapid goats in Boise, Idaho.  It's the best publicity we've had  in ages. </p><p>But it's a wonderful city, Wall Street Journal called Boise, Idaho--I know  people are saying, \"What is he talking about?\"  They call Wall Street --  the called Boise, Idaho the fastest growing city in America and it's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's -- and it's because you have like 80 children and --</p><p>BAKER:  And we -- who's counting?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just -- I'm just joking.  But we -- we're going to cover the  world for you this morning in the next three hours with Mike, Mitch, and  Lee.  Great to see all of you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So on to our top story this hour, trade tensions escalating,  Chinese state media bashing President Trump's trade tactic saying policies  of extortion and intimidation won't work.  The commander-in-chief with a  different view of the situation voicing support for his negotiating style  saying tariffs are working.  </p><p>Tweeting just yesterday this, \"Tariffs are working big time.  Every country  on earth wants to take wealth out of the United States always to our  detriment.  I say as they come, tax them, if they don't want to be taxed,  let them make or build the product in the U.S.  In either event, it means  jobs and great wealth.\"</p><p>\"Because of tariffs, we will be able to start paying down large amounts of  the $21 trillion in debt accumulated, much by the Obama Administration  while at the same time reducing taxes for our people.  At minimum, we will  make much better trade deals for our country.\"</p><p>Here now is Mark Avallone, President and Founder of Potomac Wealth  Advisors.  Mark, are you with us?</p><p>MARK AVALLONE, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS:  Yes.  Good  morning, good to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  What do you -- what do you make of this?  So far,  I don't -- I don't think it's a stretch to say that the market has largely  shrugged off what has been going on with the trade fight that started in  the spring.</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well it has shrugged it off, our market's up year-to-date across  the board and China's is down.  It's down 18 percent the beginning of the  year and it's in bear market going back to 2017.  </p><p>So the Trump strategy is to use our economic strength now while we have it  to enact much needed and frankly, much deserved parity.  He wants a fair  playing field with China.  The only problem with the trade policy is he  dragged in the Canadians and the E.U. which then you have us against the  world.</p><p>If we focus on China, keep it more of a microcosm then the stock market  appears to say, \"Hey, we can manage this.  Our economy is strong enough and  we'll push higher from here.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch, how much runway is the market or investors going to give  the Trump Administration because right now we've seen with the job's report  on Friday we created on average 215,000 jobs every month, that's faster  than the pace that we were at last -- last year, the first seven months of  the year which is really incredible for an economy that's been in expansion  mode since -- for nine years.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The interesting thing would be in -- I think the reason why the  market shrugged it off and to your point on runway is because corporate  earnings have been so robust.  </p><p>But what we're starting to see is the cost of the supply chain understand  the market perspective on this, the cost in the supply chain to go up.  And  if they cannot pass those cost to the customer, meaning customers won't pay  an increase price then we're going to see impact corporate profits.</p><p>The flip side is, if they can, we're going to see inflation.  So, I think  we're close to maybe in the next quarter getting to the point where the  market's going to have a hard time turning off --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well is that a lose lose because somebody bears that cost,  either it's corporations or if it's the consumer.  If it's the consumer, is  it more -- if the companies can passed those cost on the consumer, is it  more, I guess, the impact won't be as severe to the market.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It will -- it certainly won't be.  In fact, it will help grow  revenue because they're charging more for the products.  It may not  necessarily help margin, but it will certainly help the top line.</p><p>But the challenge is going to be how much can you pay for (INAUDIBLE)  before the market pushes back or there's another alternative that starts to  erode sales.  But Mark, I'm curious your perspective on that.</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well if it does as you say raise the price of the end good and  raising revenues for the corporation, then it is a tax on the consumer.   Ultimately it is going to be a drag.</p><p>But I think the play here is that are the consumer wages are so strong, the  individuals are flushed with cash, we can pay up for this without it  slowing down our economy too much.  China's limping along.  </p><p>So one a one-on-one basis, we can power through this.  If that wasn't the  outlook, we would have seen the stock market pull back by now.  The market  looks forward and yet it's been up for the year.  So I think all the news  is out and Wall Street is saying the global growth story that we heard, the  I.M. -- from the IMF this year for the G20, from we continue it here from  the Fed, the global growth story is strong enough that even if price is  raised, it's not going to slow down the U.S. economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch already mentioned this, there's a story in the Wall Street  Journal today, an article commenting on the strong earnings season.   Profits surging at big U.S. firm, strong economy, and tax cuts, fuel gains,  and embolden companies to raise prices.</p><p>This is a recent report by the UFDA showed nearly three million have come - - individuals have come all for food stamps since President Trump took  office.  Mark -- Mike Baker, you can see the world in terms of the business  that you do. </p><p>And Mark briefly mentioned this, that we do have the upper hand because  China is so weak right now, because the stock market is greater, their  economy is growing a great deal slower, and they are wash in debt.  So the  timing of this that people act like President Trump might be rash, but  there's some wiliness and some intelligence in why we pick right now to  take this fight on.</p><p>BAKER:  I think that's true.  I'm heading to Beijing tomorrow morning for a  week or so, very curious to kind of get the on the ground response from  just the, you know, local folks in business about how they perceive this  from their side.</p><p>I will say it's not in anybody's interest globally for -- to have an  unstable Chinese economy, it just -- it just not.  And so --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think they blank though?  That's been the question that  we raise last week, do you think China blanks on this?</p><p>BAKER:  I think ultimately they do because they're extremely pragmatic and  they understand what a chaotic problem they could have if the economy  continues to head south.  </p><p>And with -- a question from Mar is, you mentioned mark the idea that we  dragged in Canada and the E.U. into this overall trade issues, trade war,  do you think that that was more of a negotiating ploy with the president in  terms of overall objective for China or do you think in a sense, you know,  there's not really a grand strategy here?</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well it's tough to say with the president.  Maybe he's trying to  show the Chinese he's serious about this and hopefully, quietly behind the  scenes reaching an agreement.  </p><p>We saw that Mexico, we might update the NAFTA Agreement and start being on  a friendly playing field again.  That's really the hope.  You really don't  want to take on the entire world.  It's either take on China, and focus on  these legitimate inequities, technology transfer and others and let's have  our allies with us as we try to take on China.</p><p>Remember, China's also unfair to the E.U., let's make the E.U. our ally  against the number one trade offender and that is China.</p><p>CARTER:  This is Lee Carter, I -- one of the things that I've been  fascinated to watch is that most Americans really have been willing to give  the president a long runway here and that's been really surprising because  the most part people don't want to take short-term pain in order for the  long-term gain.</p><p>And China's known to have a long gain, really long gain.  We've got  election cycle after election cycle after election cycle and investor seem  to be giving in the past two.  But I'm just wondering how long do you think  Americans are going to give this runway before they're going to say, \"Wait,  this is too much?\"</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well, it's interesting that -- that's a great point because a  lot of the Trump voters are the ones that are negatively impacted by this  tariff skirmish.  You have farmers in the Midwest that voted for Trump that  are taking a lot of this.</p><p>And some of the manufacturing with the aluminum and steel tariffs could  have gone against a lot of his base.  But ironically, they are sticking  with him and we haven't seen the weakness just yet.  China on the other  hand doesn't have an election in November nor will they have an election.</p><p>So their government can continue to be autocratic and weighed out.  So if  Trump's playing the long game, he doesn't really have the upper hand in  that.  I think trying -- we keep saying is, is China going to blink?   That's the last thing we should say.  China's never going to publicly  blink.  </p><p>We want to work diplomatically behind the scenes and hope to get a  favorable outcome without letting the world thing we beat China or they  blink because they're not going to blink publicly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Would you add the stocks here Mark, U.S. stocks particularly  with the -- again, over the weekend I think that Jamie Dimon the head of  J.P. Morgan said that he -- that the -- this country should brace itself  for five percent interest rates.</p><p>He said that he thinks that the tenure yield should be at four percent  right now and we should brace for five, this is we're staring down $1  trillion annual budget deficits and the Treasury is going to be selling a  whole wash of debt in the coming weeks.</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well when I hear those Jamie Dimon comments I said perhaps.  But  we're in a global economy.  With the tenure boomed and the tenure in Japan  being, what, less than one half a percent close to zero in Japan.</p><p>So we cannot unilaterally raise our rates that rapidly, it's a global  economy.  There's a subtle currency we're going on where none of these  other entities want to raise their currencies, they're not going to  (INAUDIBLE) up interest rates.  A five percent tenure is not going to  happen.</p><p>We're lucky if we get to four percent in this country the way we have the  foreign pressure in the currency and in the interest rate markets.  I think  if you invest, you have to look domestically.  Our economy is too strong.  </p><p>I think small caps which earn about 75 percent of their revenue here  domestically versus the S&amp;P500 which get about half of their revenues  overseas, I think it's a safer place in case this trade skirmish continues.</p><p>And, again, since I don't see interest rates going anywhere near four  percent in the next 12 months, I think the U.S. economy manages any rate  hike and we continue to chug along.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mark, thank you so much, Mark Avallone.  And Mitch Roschelle,  when you're talking about the debt, the one thing that's on your mind is  the amount of supply coming in Treasury.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And also, look who buys them, central bankers are the biggest  buyers of our debt and it worries that we're sort of fighting with them on  other issues.  What if China decides to use how they behave the next  Treasury auction as a -- as a weapon. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  $769 billion in Treasury up for auction over what period of  time?  I'm reading an e-mail Mitch since --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  (INAUDIBLE) your head.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, when is it coming on?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I think it's over the next year.  I think that according to the  Journal but we can double check that.  But that's a big chunk of treasuries  that are up for sale and we could see rates go up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I -- when people always point to Japan and a slow interest  rates I'm like, \"Yes.\"  But Japan's kind of been in a recession for the  last 30 years on and off.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Since the 80s.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like we don't -- yes, since the late 80s.  We kind of hope that  we're not Japan.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Don't use -- don't use Japan as the benchmark please.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.

It looks like I'm going to see  Winnie the Pooh.  Winnie the Pooh by the way in a real fight would kick Tom  Cruise's ass.  I don't know if I could say that but I just did.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You just said that.</p><p>BAKER:  I just did.  Sorry.  There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, why would -- I would put my money on Eeyore versus Tom  Cruise.</p><p>BAKER:  Well, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Eeyore is my spirit animal.</p><p>CARTER:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BAKER:  Here we go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Slow and grumpy morning, noon, and night grumpy.

Gerri Willis, you can't make it up.</p><p>WILLIS:  Here we go again, you got that right Dagen.  Wells Fargo admitting  to a glitch that led to hundreds of home for closures.  </p><p>Now the bank says that a calculation error led to as many as 400 struggling  home owners needlessly losing their homes to foreclosure, the culprit, a  modification tool online that wrongly factored lawyer's fees into a formula  that calculated government mortgages system in the wake of a housing crash.</p><p>As many as 650 applicants were incorrectly denied modifications.  Now the  details of this in a regulatory filing by the bank, the company setting  aside $8 million in the second quarter to fix the problem which were works  out to about $20,000 per home owner.  But this isn't the first problem for  Wells snapped by a long shot.</p><p>Check out this timeline of troubles for the bank and I should say here, we  don't have everything in this timeline because you don't have time for  everything in this timeline.  A fake account scandal revealed in September  of 2016, the SEC investigation of that account scandal in which bank  employees open accounts customers didn't need and didn't want in return for  bonuses.</p><p>But it wasn't just the consumer banking business an issue.  In July 2017,  allegations said the bank had properly sold auto insurance.  That same year  the bank was also accused of selling dangerous investments to brokerage  clients.  </p><p>The bank has been fined $1 billion for the -- from the CFPB for mortgage  abuses but the list of troubles goes on in nearly every line of businesses  seems to me including F.X., no matter where work -- look, whether the bank  was dealing with consumers or was dealing with their -- with their  institutional clients, big problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lee, how did they handle it in terms of messaging because this  just stinks to high heaven?</p><p>CARTER:  You know, I think that for the most part they've done a pretty  good job considering the magnitude of the problems that they've had.  Now,  the question I always have when you -- when you -- no matter how or who you  message, the more scandals that happen, trust the road.</p><p>Like you've got to get it all out at some point.  I think this is going to  be -- this of all of the problems I think is going to hurt.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I think these and other stories are going to be rallying  cry perhaps in the midterms around the deregulatory push that the  administration has and this is the reason why you have regulations in the  eyes of people who are in favor in regulations.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well I mean -- look, they have tried to set the record straight  here and move beyond it.  And what's interesting to me Dagen, I know you  watch this story very closely is that people haven't run away.</p><p>You know, the consumer is not gone from Wells Fargo.  I mean, that's' where  you would expect the pedal to really hit the metal as people see these  headlines, that consumers would take their accounts elsewhere.  We've some  of that but not a ton of that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's inertia, that's part of it.  But if -- in terms of big  banks, they're just not that many in the country.  But will you see people  turning to these smaller community banks because they are everywhere.   You're raising your hands.</p><p>BAKER:  I'll put my -- I'll put my hand up because I'm one of those people  that moved.  We were --</p><p>CARTER:  Really?</p><p>BAKER:  -- with Wells Fargo for a long time and we went through that  process.  I can tell you what I think one of the reasons why people don't  do it is because it's painful.  But you -- you -- there's a lot of work  involved and you're busy doing everything else in your day, right?</p><p>So all of a sudden you got to move your finances to a new institution.  So  -- but we did because after a while we just got fed up.</p><p>WILLIS:  Well -- and you know look, this is going to go on, people are  going to continue to watch this.  The fees are still piling up.  I  mentioned the $1 billion from the CFPB, but they've got lots of other fines  as well.  And you better bet after this news they're going to have mre.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I was thinking lawsuits.  That --</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- you kick people out of their homes unfairly, the trial  lawyers are running up.  </p><p>WILLIS:  They make people sign those agreements though to arbitrate.  So  that's one way they've stayed out of trouble in courthouses across the  country.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  Good point.  Good point.  Did you move your business  accounts too from Wells Fargo?</p><p>BAKER:  No.  No.  The long-time personal finances, but I have businesses  elsewhere, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But not at Wells Fargo?</p><p>BAKER:  That's a national security issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gerri, great -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gerri Willis.

It took me a  couple of days to figure out what the X's meant.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, it just makes a statement.</p><p>TARLOV:  Oh, it definitely does.  And picked them Socialists with the  wilting flowers, it's interesting when you see these trends happen like  that.  I think it's a very serious issue that we certainly should be  talking about.  I think there's a difference between what went on with Alex  Jones and what went on with Candace Owens.  </p><p>Here, they certainly made a mistake, and obviously, their algorithms picked  up what Candace was doing and she was making a point that I think does need  to be made about Sarah Jones' tweets, which apparently go back to 2012,  even it wasn't just the latest rash.  </p><p>As for Alex Jones, I don't know if you saw last week, that he's actually  suing parents whose child died in Sandy Hook for a hundred thousand dollars  to cover -- help him cover legal fees.  That family was forced to move six  or seven times, because of the fact that Alex Jones was not only spreading  lies at them.</p><p>You know, he said that they were actor -- child actors there, but releasing  information as to where they lived so they haven't been safe and they've  been moving with their daughter who's the same age, she was a twin with  their son that died.  So, there's a little bit of a difference there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I think that very often when you see companies shutting down  a podcast like with Apple and what Facebook did, Matt, it's -- they are  covering their you-know-whats because of legal liability.  </p><p>In some instances, that's my go-to thought, but I will say in terms of the  treatment of Conservatives, broadly speaking, looking at the Candace Owens  situation, it actually fuels the Trump base because they do feel like  they're being silenced and it actually makes them more -- I was talking to  Lee Carter and Lee's going to get into this as the show moves on.  </p><p>But, you look at -- she was testing these rallies and people are more  devoted to Trump than ever before.  What say you, Matt?</p><p>MATT BRAYNARD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LOOK AHEAD AMERICA:  Yes, I think the  real question here is, like, who's going to be next, because at least in  Alex Jones' case, the language that they used was that, you know, it was  hate speech.  And that's a very broad term and it's not really clear on any  given day what that means to these tech companies.</p><p>It's important to remember that the personnel is policy and stacked from  the bottom to the top of the corporate leadership.  Department heads of all  these tech companies, they are hard-core leftists.  </p><p>And if this is just the first example of them censoring somebody or going  after somebody, it just makes me wonder who is next, whose unfavorable  opinions will be targeted next for de-platforming by Apple or anyone of  these larger -- other large social media companies and will people who  opposed go immigration or question the latest on gender politics or pro- lifers.  </p><p>I mean, at what point does it cross that \"hate speech\" line, especially  relying on far left-organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center  to  define exactly what hate speech is, which includes this network here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Matt, what I'm saying is that, actually, that the outrage  at the social media sites is actually -- it's somehow in an upside down  world.  It works to the candidates' benefit.  It works to President Trump's  benefit.  </p><p>The laziness of many people on television media because it's just -- it's  easier to accuse President Trump of having lost his mind or being deranged  or being mentally ill, than to actually do policy work and understand, say,  his trade policy.</p><p>What I'm saying is the outrage generated by these social media platforms in  trying to censor Conservatives.  It actually whips up the base.</p><p>BRAYNARD:  I can see that there is definitely some pushback.  And when you  -- when these stories come out, it certainly does make people much more  skeptical of these large hegemonies of technology.  But it does concern us,  though, that they are essentially removing platform.  </p><p>The platform in many cases of funding and in the cases of Google, for  removing advertising options for right-wing Conservative voices, patriotic  voices, along with -- </p><p>You know, just deleting podcast, whole cell, not particular ones, but the  entire podcast series of Alex Jones.  And not to defend him but it does --  it is a troubling sign, as if there's no appeal in Facebook or Twitter  takes away your account or blocks you.  There's no remedy, you're just  stuck with it and because you have just a --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  With the podcast, you can deliver your own podcast and you can  still download -- like there are myriad podcast apps that you can use to  listen to a podcast.  It doesn't -- it might -- being on Apple's platform,  it does generate listeners.  </p><p>But I just want to make that point that if you can put it up on website and  people can listen to and watch what you put out there, because quite  frankly, the first amendment.</p><p>But I want to switch gears to Senator Elizabeth Warren, fuelling rumors,  Jessica Tarlov, over a 2020 run, this is over the weekend, here is what she  had to say, she's not afraid to be the underdog.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  It won't be easy.  We are going  to have to fight uphill.  But me, I'm going up that hill and I hope you are  too.  And I hope that when you do, you'll reach your hand out and bring  someone else along for the climb.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jessica, that was the Netroots conference, down in New Orleans,  I know you were glued to the internet watching those -- watching those --</p><p>TARLOV:  I didn't go out all weekend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a lot of slogan there, but what about policy?</p><p>TARLOV:  Well, she certainly has a set of policies and they're very aligned  with Bernie Sanders' policies and the Dems Socialist line, you can listen  to Cynthia Nixon, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance.  You can hear  what Elizabeth Warren is all about, and frankly, she has been incredibly  vocal for a long time now.  </p><p>And you do know what she stands for.  The Democrats feel, that I think the  most I've seen is a list of about 35, it is wide.  Apparently, Joe Biden is  the leader right now, in most of the polling, that seems -- I really do  love Joe Biden, but it feels like we need a fresher face, someone that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let me just be blunt, how excited are the Democrats about  running an old-white guy?</p><p>TARLOV:  I -- not great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He would appeal to some of the same base that President Trump  does, mid-Western grit --</p><p>TARLOV:  And Obama's base as well.  He is utterly beloved in the party, and  actually, a lot of Republicans are a fan of him, as well, you can't deny  what kind of great person he is.  I think age is an issue whether you're a  man or a woman, going into this primary, I think, will you see Kamala  Harris taking a more prominent role, really putting herself out there, I  think she'll be there.  </p><p>I'm really interested to see President Obama has been meeting with a lot of  big-city mayors, I wonder where that'll go.  I don't think Eric Garcetti or  Mitch Landrieu will be our nominee, but I certainly to counter the  businessman president, to have someone with executive experience, I think,  is worthwhile.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here, I'm going to go out on a limb and say, one individual  who's not going to run for the presidency, would be Rahm Emanuel --</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  in terms of mayors in the city of Chicago, and he can't even --  and he can't even stop the death toll from rising from gun violence, we saw  that over the weekend.  Matt, your reaction to that, because Jessica did  mention, age is an issue in terms of the Democrats, but then, everybody  seems to turn their attention to Alexandria --</p><p>TARLOV:  Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ocasio-Cortez, thank you very much, who brags about having an  economics degree, but doesn't know how the unemployment rate is calculated.</p><p>BRAYNARD:  Yes.  I think that throwing names out like Joe Biden and Liz  Warren, is just a sign of weakness of the field.  They really don't have  any strong candidates.  And honestly, for them to suggest Liz Warren as a  credible candidate, somebody whose name we would never know had she not  lied about her ethnicity to go --</p><p>TARLOV:  Matt --</p><p>BRAYNARD:  It's just a sign of pure weakness on their part.  And I would  love to be throwing the briar patch of running a general election against  Liz Warren, but i don't think the Democratic Party is even that suicidal.   But I could be wrong.</p><p>TARLOV:  Well, I don't know if it's suicidal, you are wrong, and you are  also wrong about Liz Warren's name only being related to the fact that she  \"lied about her--</p><p>BRAYNARD:  She was --</p><p>TARLOV:  Listen.</p><p>BRAYNARD:  She got a job at Harvard because of that and that allowed her to  run to the senate in Massachusetts.</p><p>TARLOV:  This is a whole other segment that we should have, I think that's  incredibly irresponsible thing to say.</p><p>BRAYNARD:  I don't think we can bring up Liz Warren without -- it's the  truth.  I mean, I don't think we can -- I don't think we can let that  slide.  I mean, it's --</p><p>TARLOV:  I know that's the kind of campaign that you would run and if, you  know, work for President Trump, again, I'm sure you'll be out there on the  front lines doing something like that.  I just don't think it's responsible</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will weigh in on something, since this is a business show,  this is -- since this is a business show, I will weigh in on something that  I hear more and more from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I want to get her name  right, and Bernie Sanders and even Elizabeth Warren, Medicare for all.</p><p>TARLOV:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So we now know how much that's going to cost.</p><p>TARLOV:  30 trillion, thirty-two.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, almost $33 trillion over just the first 10 years.  You  would need to double what the federal government collects in individual and  corporate taxes to pay for it, and it still wouldn't cover the cost of it.</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And this is Medicare, is going broke in eight years.  Medicare,  the hospital trust fund is broke in eight years.  We haven't fixed it,  nobody talks about fixing it, but now, we're talk about Medicare for all.   I mean, it's a great tag line, Jessica --</p><p>TARLOV:  Of course, it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there's no plan to pay for it.</p><p>TARLOV:  Well, I'm sure they will get to you.  Bernie Sanders has been out  there, pumping it up.  I think there was report from the Cato Institute  about Medicare for all, conversations with the Koch brothers.  Listen, I  think that that interview with Trevor Noah was disastrous.  </p><p>For the Dems Socialist platform, there is now Medicare for all caucus, but  if you look at races like Ohio, tomorrow, for instance, special election  there.  Danny O'Connor is out there saying, not going to work, let's fix  Obamacare, which is exactly where Democrats should be, going into the 2018  election and making smart decisions.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let me -- we'll get into that, Jessica, because actually,  we got such good news on those premium increases.  The premium increases  that we've heard about in some states last week are lower than they've been  in recent years.  The premium increases in the Obamacare plans, they're  actually falling in some areas.</p><p>TARLOV:  Well, Obamacare has lowered the cost of healthcare across the  country in terms of the rate at which -- the rate at which healthcare costs  are increasing, lowered under President Obama, fact-check me, all day, on  that, Matt.</p><p>BRAYNARD:  Oh, yes.  The cost totally dropped, just as he promised they  would, dropped by an average of $2,500 per family, which he promised,  absolutely not, they continue to increase.  And just having you repeat  that, it's almost like getting banned on Twitter, it just excites  Conservatives more because --</p><p>TARLOV:  Conservatives hate me anyway.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Matt -- but Matt --</p><p>BRAYNARD:  I don't think they know who you are.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  my point in bringing up the lower increases in premiums by some  insurers in Obamacare plans, that benefits the Conservatives who failed the  Republicans, who fail to really fix Obamacare, except for the fact that  they repealed the individual mandate and the Trump administration through  rule-making, has opened the door for shorter-term health plans.</p><p>So I'm saying that that actually benefits Republicans, particularly those  in the Senate, who fail to get through the repeal and replace that passed  in the House, final word?</p><p>BRAYNARD:  Yes, I just want to say, I think, you're right there.  It will  be helpful but ultimately, what's important is the fact that healthcare  costs can be offset by the fact that there are more Americans employed more  than ever.  </p><p>The economy is growing faster than it ever has, in a long time, and a lot  of that credit goes to the President, and that's going to go down the  ticket when people decide who to vote for this November and perhaps,  tomorrow, on the special election.</p><p>TARLOV:  Healthcare issue, number one, in a lot of races, special elections  and primaries, Democrats are slaying on the healthcare issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will add this, I sat on this set with Kellyanne Conway right  when she joined the Trump campaign and the Hillary Clinton campaign  underestimated how much that would impact who people voted for that  November, and so the Republicans should not underestimate it in this  midterm election.  Jessica Tarlov, Matt Braynard, thank you both.</p><p>TARLOV:  Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Coming up, the California wildfires take on epic new  proportions as one blaze nearly doubles in size, we have the latest.  And  Samsung's new Galaxy Note 9, details are leaked from an interesting source,  more on that, in minutes.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of the world's greatest chefs has passed away.  Kristina  Partsinevelos has the details, Kristina?  </p><p>KRISTINA PATSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Dagen, Joel Robuchon  was named the -- the \"chef of the century\" by the famous French restaurant  guide Gault Millau in 1990.  He was known for mashed potatoes among other  dishes and had open restaurants in cities across the globe including Paris,  Monaco, Hong Kong, Las Vegas, Tokyo and New York.  His restaurants  currently hold a record of 32 Michelin stars; he also mentored numerous  other chefs such as T.V. personality: Gordon Ramsey.  Robuchon died at 73  after a long battle well cancer.  </p><p>And fans are also remembering Charlotte Rae actress best known as Mrs.  Garrett on the long-running sitcom, \"The Facts of Life\" has died.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CHARLOTTE RAE, ACTRESS:  I have to get going.  I got to make the bed, back  in the rug, do the laundry, scrub the floors, clean the windows, everything  has got to be perfect.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Her family says, she died peacefully in her home in Los  Angeles yesterday.  The cause of her death has not been released but last  year she did reveal she had been diagnosed with bone cancer.  The Tony and  Emmy-nominated actress' career spent six decades.  Charlotte Rae was 92  years old.  </p><p>And catastrophic wildfires continue to ravage California with one doubling  in size over the weekend, making it the fourth largest wild fire in state  history.  There are now a total of 17 fires burning across the state  claiming the lives of seven people and destroying thousands of acres.   Meanwhile, President Trump has declared a state of emergency in California  ordering federal funding to help with the recovery efforts but he also  tweeted: \"California wildfires are being magnified and made so much worse  by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amounts of  readily available water to be properly utilized.  It is being divert into  the Pacific Ocean.  Must also treat clear to stop fire spreading.\"  </p><p>And on a lighter note, we'll switch over to Nutella.  If you love Nutella,  then you're about to discover your dream job.  The Ferrero company, maker  of Nutella and Ferrero Rocher chocolates is looking for 60 sensory judges  who will get paid to taste its product after, of course, you need a three- month rigorous training course.  40 of the 60 people will go on to become  testers.  But there's a catch, you have to be willing to relocate to  Ferrero's headquarters in Alba, Italy.  So, I don't think this is too bad  of a gig.  What do you think, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I defer to my baker on that.  And thank you for the Joel  Robuchon --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  I don't know why I said it like that.  I know -- it just  came out naturally, I'm sorry.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, he's French.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  He is French.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you have to say it -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  And then I was going to say -- I don't know, I was just on  a roll there, just going back.  Quebec French.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll take it any day.  Nutella taster?  </p><p>BAKER:  Turn it into a reality show, right?  40 of the 60 contestants get  to on to become actual testers.  You got a three-months training.  This is  ready made.  You know, reality T.V. is all about finding something that's  already happening and throw in cameras in front of it.  So, that's what I'm  saying and, and otherwise I'm not a big fan of Nutella, what can I say?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because something is deeply wrong with you.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Warren Buffett becomes one of biggest winners as  Apple hits $1 trillion in market value.  After the magical milestone,  everyone has predictions for the tech giant's next move.  We take a closer  look next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Samsung's new Galaxy Note 9 launches on Thursday and the details  are being leaked by Samsung.  The box with the device was spotted at  Russian store revealing a 6.4-inch display, a dual rear camera with 12  mega-pixels, and an 8 mega-pixels front selfie camera.  As previously  reported, the note's pen will have remote-control type functionality.  </p><p>Meantime, Apple making investors happy after becoming the world's first $1  trillion company last week.  One of the winners is Warren Buffett who  (INAUDIBLE) are half way owned to five percent stake in Apple, now worth  nearly $50 billion.  Joining me now, CFRA Senior Equity Analyst, Angelo  Zino.  Angelo, Buffett usually shies away from tech stocks.  This is a  winner for him and also, what do you make about the Samsung phone given  Apple a run for its money.  </p><p>ANGELO ZINO, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, CFRA:  Yes, absolutely.  So, you know,  in terms of Samsung and these leaks going on, you wonder if there're  really, you know, leaks because, you know, at this point in time we  continue to see the stuff -- you know, ahead of these launches, you know,  year in and year out.  But that being said, I mean, when we look at kind of  some of the details of the event coming here on Thursday, little that, you  know, really gets us excited on the front of Samsung.  </p><p>That being said, as far as Apple is concerned -- I mean, the results last  week were absolutely spectacular.  Looking at Warren Buffett here, I mean,  I think he continues to kind of cement and put kind of the cherry on the  top as far as Apple is concerned.  Him being the third largest investor  there.  He is just naturally going to continue to up his stake just via the  buybacks you see from Apple here.  But, you know, all in all, we continue  to believe cash is king and Apple is here to stay with this trillion-dollar  valuation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I think Warren Buffett -- this is about Apple and not  Buffett.  Buffett is like a molt to a flame in terms of seeking media  attention.  He's going to glom onto Apple's success.  I'm not dismissing  the fact that he has stake in Apple, but again, this is Apple's story not  Buffet's story.  </p><p>BAKER:  No question.  Angelo, just take a look at Apple for a second,  what's next?  So, we're talking about Samsung, and that's just more product  innovation.  Is there around product innovation?  Do they stay with the  customer space, do they branch out the way Amazon has in terms of having  cloud business which is really a business to business, business?  </p><p>ZINO:  Yes.  So, when we look at Apple here, it's funny because most people  look at Apple and they say, hey, this is a one-hit wonder kind of company,  it's the iPhone and that's it.  And, you know, we continue to believe when  we look at Apple the next step forward for them continues to be on the  wearable side; that grew 60 percent year over year.  We expect something  along the lines of augmented reality glasses by 2020.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because that was such a winner for Google.  Those Google glass - - died on the vine.  </p><p>ZINO:  Right.  But, you know, we do think Apple is going to do a lot  better.  We're going to have 5D eventually roll out.  We think the  capability of 5D along with these A.R. glasses will be a big hit for Apple  over time.  I think also, of course, that service's business which grew  north of 30 percent as they shift toward more kind of subscription-based  offerings, I think that's the model for Apple.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Angelo good to see you, Angelo Zino, take care.  Still ahead,  it's National Root Beer Float Day.  We're raising a glass to this American  classic, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

Why isn't the go-to Alice?</p><p>CARTER:  How about Alice?</p><p>To our top story this hour, trade tensions.  China state media equating  U.S.-imposed tariffs to, quote, \"extortion\", as the U.S. plans to tax an  additional $16 billion worth of goods.  President Trump promising to stay  the course on his trade plans.</p><p>We don't have that sound.</p><p>Tennessee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann is here.  He's also on the House  Appropriations Committee.  Congressman -- China, in part, calling Trump's  trade plans a street fighter style, deceitful drama of extortion and  intimidation.  What are your thoughts?  </p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Well, I think that's unduly harsh  rhetoric on the part of the Chinese but let's face it, President Trump has  had a tremendous impact on this entire trade debate and I think he's  winning.</p><p>He's had an effect on the Chinese, on the Chinese markets.  And President  Trump wants to protect our intellectual property and he wants us to win.</p><p>So in a nutshell, I didn't expect them to remain silent.  This is an  ongoing negotiation process and it will play itself out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Trump raves confident on tariffs over the weekend.  He was not  only talking about them in a rally, he was also tweeting this --  Congressman.  \"Tariffs are working big time.  Every country on earth wants  to take wealth out of the United States always to our detriment.  I say as  they come, tax them.  If they don't want to be taxed, let them make or  build the product in the U.S.  In either event it means jobs and great  wealth.</p><p>Because of tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of  the $21 trillion in debt that's been accumulated, much by the Obama  administration, while at the same time reducing taxes for our people.  At  minimum, we will make much better trade deals for our country.\"</p><p>Congressman -- what I find astonishing about that is a tariff is a tax.   It's a tax ultimately if that is passed on to the U.S. consumer, which it's  already starting to happen whether it's Coca-Cola or Polaris or Winnebago  raising prices.  So how astonishing is it that you have a Republican  bragging about tax increases?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, let me say this.  I have long been a strong proponent  supporter of free trade.  My great state, Tennessee, has benefited in the  agricultural sector, in the manufacturing sector from free trade.  I think  we have to look at every arsenal in the toolbox.</p><p>I've never really been a fan of tariffs.  I think there are other ways to  go.  However, the President has felt that in a country by country, region  by region area, he has to look at this.</p><p>This is a negotiation process.  Let's face it.  I think the President's  goal ultimately is to remove tariffs everywhere.  That's what we want to  see.</p><p>Some countries, particularly China, have put up such burdensome tariffs and  they basically stack the deck; and the imbalance, the trade imbalance  short-term and long-term, has been so difficult.</p><p>So it's a process.  It's an ongoing process.  Let's hope we get to where we  were with the E.U. where both sides say let's work towards a system where  ultimately all tariffs go away.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The U.S. meantime is pushing for stronger penalties against  hackers who disrupt the electrical grid -- Department of Homeland Security  Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen emphasizing infrastructure's greatest threat.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  The biggest threat in my  mind is if we don't partner.  So what we see the adversaries doing is  they're crowd sourcing.  So they're using bots.  They're using paid  influencers.  They're using their governments.  They're using anyone and  everyone that can attack us.  So the biggest threat is if we don't work  together to counter that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- I want to get your reaction and then I'm going to  get Mike Baker in here.  But again -- this is a long time coming.  And  quite frankly those in Washington have been turning a blind eye to  basically threatening behavior in terms of putting our electrical grid at  risk from the likes of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, I'm privileged to serve on the House Appropriations  Committee and specifically on the Homeland Security Subcommittee on  Appropriations.  And we have had robust funding to fight cyber security or  to support fighting the attacks by foreign nations on our cyber security  system.</p><p>Let's face it.  Cyber security is national security.  With all of our  technological advances, and they've been outstanding, it has still made us  vulnerable to attack.</p><p>So House Republicans have done their job.  The administration is doing its  job.  But this is an all-out cyber security war.  We've got to defend our  grid.  We've got to defend our property.  And cyber security is very  critically important and there are a lot of bad actors engaging in this.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Mike -- they talk in Washington but they don't walk.  They  don't step, they don't get off their -- and do something about it.  This  has been going on for years.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Congressman -- Mike Baker here.  If I could just say a couple  of things.  I think we're really late to the game on this one.  It's been  well over a decade that you could ask anybody in the intel security  community, you know, what keeps them up at night.  And it would be an  attack on the power grid.</p><p>The power grid basically is the east grid, the west grid and Texas.  Texas  gets its own grid.  And it's a patchwork quilt.  But we've known, there  have been major assessments and studies, we've known for a long time that  this has been a problem and that state sponsored elements and others  hostile to us have been mapping and probing and targeting and looking at  the grid.</p><p>So I guess a couple of questions.  One, you know, why now instead of quite  some time ago hasn't this become a priority?  And I know that things happen  off the radar screen and we don't see what's going on oftentimes up on  Capitol Hill.</p><p>But do you think we've been late to the game?  And is this something we can  actually get bipartisan support on?  And is there money to resolve this?   The grid was never set up to withstand a physical or a cyber attack.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  There is tremendous bipartisan support for cyber security,  there's no question about that.  We've seen that with the votes on the  funding.  I want to commend the administration.  President Trump and Vice  President Pence have set up a special commission to deal with this.  So  there is a prioritization.</p><p>I would say this.  There is so much that goes on in the classified space,  there are protections out there fortunately that we've been working on a  long time.</p><p>However, it moves.  This is something that is not static.  Our enemies that  would engage in cyber security attacks are always changing.  So what is  good to protect today is not necessarily going to be good tomorrow.</p><p>So we've got to be vigilant, diligent.  We've got to put the dollars up to  defend against this.  Do we need to do a better job?  Absolutely.  Are we  addressing this in a bipartisan, bicameral and executive way?  Yes, I think  so.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- thank you for being here.  Congressman Chuck  Fleischmann.  Much to talk about.  Thank you so much.</p><p>And breaking news to bring you -- </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- from Pepsi.  The soft drink giant says Indra Nooyi will step  aside as the CEO after 12 years at the helm.  She will be replaced by  current president Ramon Laguarta on October 3rd.  Nooyi will stay on as  chairman until early 2019.  That stock edging lower on the news.</p><p>Mitch Roschelle -- if you have reaction also, Lee in terms of she being one  of the most prominent female corporate leaders in the world.  And again,  this seems to be a very well thought-out transition.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, it's interesting that it's a global business with all of  the globalization that's going on right now.  So whoever is taking over is  going to have some challenges.  Think about all of the trade talks that are  going on right now.  These are the types of consumer business that are  often impacted by trade.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because of the steel and aluminum prices.  I mentioned Coca-Cola  is raising prices because its materials cost have gone up.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  I think it's been a fascinating journey that she's had to see -- I  mean the soft drink business has really been under such attack and really  people -- it's not the business of the future.  But she really diversified  their portfolio and really started into food, had some great vision on what  it meant to have social value incorporated into the business with the  performance of purpose.  It's really going to be interesting to see what  her legacy is going to be now moving forward as this transition happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They've gotten into like the fizzy water business as well.   Pepsi has this.  And it's become kind of omnipresent in any story you go  into, they have this -- it's basically seltzer water.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's called bubbly.  But again that is one of the -- I would say  one of the hardest businesses to manage.  </p><p>CARTER:  Unbelievable.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, it is.  Unbelievable run at Pepsi.  So Indra Nooyi is  stepping down as the CEO.  Ramon Laguarta, the President of Pepsi will be  taking the top job.</p><p>Coming up, six arrested in an attempt on the Venezuelan president's life.   People there are bracing for massive crackdowns on anyone who opposes  Maduro.  More on the turmoil ahead.</p><p>Plus, a fight with that shake -- another brawl on the menu at McDonald's,  this time in Illinois.  We have the shocking footage, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Welcome back  to MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  I'm Kristina Partsinevelos.</p><p>There are fears of a crackdown on dissidents in Venezuela after a failed  attempt to assassinate President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.  Two  drones carrying explosives were detonated as Maduro spoke at a military  parade in Caracas on Saturday.  He was not injured but critics warned that  the socialist leader could use the attack as an excuse to threaten his  opponents.  Six people are under arrest and that number reportedly could  grow.  </p><p>National security adviser John Bolton on \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" denied any U.S.  government involvement.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  If the government of Venezuela has  hard information that they want to present to us that would show a  potential violation of U.S. criminal law, we'll take a serious look at it.   But in the meantime, I think what we really should focus on is the  corruption and the oppression of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Venezuela's economy is in chaos with inflation expected to  hit 1 million percent this year.</p><p>And a brawl breaking out at a McDonald's restaurant in Illinois.  The video  shows two women grabbing and punching each other behind the counter and a  female employee trying to remove a man from the work area.</p><p>This comes just weeks after a fight at a McDonald's branch in Nevada went  viral.  That video showed another female employee beating a woman who  reportedly threw a milkshake at her.</p><p>And since we want to stick with drinks, it's a perfect hot day in New York  City right now and across the country but it's also national root beer  float day.  We celebrate the refreshing mixture of vanilla ice cream and  root beer and A&amp;W restaurants nationwide are making the treats even tastier  -- we're going to try that out -- by giving them away today.  During the  celebration A&amp;W's restaurants nationwide will also raise money for disabled  American veterans.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I get a hell yes -- Mike Baker.  It's ice cream and root  beer and I'm guessing that -- </p><p>BAKER:  Dagen's gone right into the jug.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  NO.  But they put the jug in front of me because well, I'm a  hillbilly. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And so it evokes moonshine.  Not moonshine but it is root beer.   And I love root beer.  Are you going to have some of that?</p><p>BAKER:  It takes you back to your childhood, right.  You can't have a root  beer float without thinking what it was like when you were a kid.  </p><p>CARTER:  So true -- my great grandmother.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Trivia -- what does A&amp;W stand for?  </p><p>BAKER:  Oh, I knew that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Awesome and wonderful?  I don't know.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Allen and Wright.  I only -- I Googled -- </p><p>BAKER:  That's going to be -- that's going to be like question 14 on HQ.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So for -- I love root beer.  </p><p>CARTER:  It's so good.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  This is great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's a little tip because I'm full of useless facts.  There is  a drive-in in Bethel, Connecticut called The Sycamore and they make their  own root beer.  It's an old school drive-in.  They have like classic car  night on the weekend.  So go to -- for national root beer day, if you're  not near an A&amp;W, go The Sycamore in Bethel, Connecticut.  It's awesome.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  You know what you just did.  You've got to finish that whole  jug now.  Nobody else can drink out of that.  </p><p>BAKER:  That's your jug.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love root beer.  </p><p>BAKER:  It might get a little burpy around here later on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're going to make -- Mike is always -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  And there's ice cream in here, you know.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  That's the best part.  I'm going for more ice cream.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike is always watching his figure.  So I'm going to make him  drink that whole float.  By the way, if you don't have any ice cream, you  can always drink soda and milk together.  </p><p>BAKER:  Interesting.  </p><p>CARTER:  You've done that?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Milk and Pepsi.  I digress.</p><p>BAKER:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you -- Kristina.</p><p>Coming up -- tough action on Iran.  The U.S. re-imposing sanctions on the  country warning the world about getting its oil and gas from Iran.  We'll  explain.</p><p>Plus Lance Bass loses out on buying the iconic house featured in \"The Brady  Bunch\".  Why he thinks there may have been some strings attached.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Trump administration set to re-impose the first batch of  sanctions against Iran today, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.   They're expected to hit Iran's purchase of precious metals, gold and the  U.S. dollar.  On top of that, we're now less than 90 days away from the  November deadline set by the White House for countries to stop importing  oil from Iran.</p><p>What will this mean for oil and gas prices here at home?</p><p>Joining me now Tom Kloza, global head of energy and analysis for the Oil  Price Information Service.  Tom -- always great to see you.</p><p>Has that yet played out, these coming sanctions on Iranian oil, has that  yet played out in the oil market?  </p><p>TOM KLOZA, GLOBAL HEAD OF ENERGY AND ANALYSIS, OIL PRICE INFORMATION  SERVICE:  No.  I think the next 90 to 100 days are about as unpredictable  as any 90 or 100 days we're going to have. </p><p>I mean on the one hand, you could have really, really tough implementation  of sanctions and you could see Iranian production drop from let's say 2.2  on the export side to 1.5 million or less.</p><p>On the other hand, you might have political awareness raising the prospect  of sales of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  So you could make  a case for 90.  You could make a case for 50.  It's going to be that kind  of a period.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What will you be watching for, Tom, as an indication of where  that might go?  Is there any news event that you're looking for?  Again, it  would be a release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve?  </p><p>KLOZA:  Right.  We'll be watching.  I mean if there's a relief from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve, ostensibly it would be to put pressure on  Iran.  But it also would probably be to relieve pressure for the midterm  elections.</p><p>If midterm elections take place and gas prices of $3 in a lot of the  districts which went heavily for Republicans, you could have SPR sales.  It  might look blatantly political but what doesn't these days.</p><p>So those are the two elements that really make it very, very unpredictable.   Without that, we would need an event to take gasoline prices much, much  higher in the next hundred days; an event like a tropical storm, a  hurricane, or as we sort of hinted to, you know, something in Venezuela  that descends them into utter chaos.</p><p>ROSCHELL:  Tom -- Mitch Roschelle.  If you strip out all the politics that  -- geopolitics that are driving oil prices up and just look at it sort of  over the long term, is it right for me to assume that it's costing more and  more money to produce oil?  And if you look at our labor shortages that we  have in the United States, it's hard to find that labor.   so is that a bit  of a head wind on prices going forward?  </p><p>KLOZA:  No, it's really not.  You know, if we had the pipeline capacity  from west Texas to the Gulf Coast, into the coast, we could be producing  probably a million or two million barrels a day more.  The problem is the  ability to take away the crude.</p><p>The cost of crude and actually finding crude, notwithstanding the fact that  you've got truck drivers that are making well over $100,000 -- that cost is  coming down.</p><p>There are lots of fields where you can break even at $35, and there's  really a lot of fields where you can break even at $55 to $65.  So if  prices remain high, and you get rid of that bottleneck of moving crude from  west Texas to Corpus or to Houston, you could really see crude oil prices  move higher.  It's not a matter of the underlying cost necessarily going  higher.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I always point out too is that these steel tariffs  that have been slapped on, virtually every company that doesn't use U.S.  steel, it hurts because some of these companies that want to build  pipelines out of the Permian Basin, those plans have been disrupted because  of these steel tariffs.</p><p>Mike Baker has a question for you -- Tom.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, Tom -- I'm going to throw geopolitics back into the mix.  How  important is China in your view when assessing potential impact of the  sanctions on Iran?  </p><p>KLOZA:  Well, I think China, you know, the chalk for China, to use a horse- racing theme, is that China is going to continue to import more oil from  Iran.  And that means they're going to import less oil from the United  States.  That's going to be collateral damage, so-to-speak.</p><p>But I can't imagine under any circumstances that we would have some sort of  a detente with China where they're not going to bring in Iranian oil.  To a  certain extent they're going to be a beneficiary of that because the price  will have to be discounted. </p><p>So, you know, oil is what we call fungible.  It can be moved around  different places.  But we'll see how hard we really impose the sanctions  and if oil production gets cut by a million barrels a day, and the economy,  the global economy keeps chugging, we could have much, much higher prices  in 2019.  That's the worry year.  It's an off election year but that's the  year I worry about.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, before you go, Tom -- last week President Trump  proposed that plan to roll back the Obama era gas fuel efficiency standards  on automobiles.  What's the impact going to be on oil and gasoline prices,  do you think?  </p><p>KLOZA:  Well, first of all, the impact is full employment for lawyers  because the lawyers are going to make a fortune on this, particularly in  California and 13 other states.  I think the impact is that it slows the  efficiency improvements in the fleet.</p><p>And I'm not a big fan of it.  I mean, you know, you see the ads where  somebody's driving a big SUV and picking up a calf or delivering a calf.   In the northeast, it's on long island and what would you pick up?  A pound  of veal or something like that.</p><p>I think we'd all benefit if we live a little bit less large and don't drive  pope mobiles and stuff.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's going to save potentially half a trillion dollars for  consumers because, again, ultimately the cost of these fuel efficiency  standards, big picture is I think we can agree on this being from the east,  rather than the left coast, is that California -- the Trump administration  is saying to California you're not driving national policy on automobile  fuel efficiency.  No more.  </p><p>KLOZA:  No.  California, though, has been kind of the laboratory for what's  going to happen in the rest of the country.  So, you know, the one thing  you have to say about California is their air quality has improved  immeasurably since the Clean Air Act.</p><p>So we'll see a little bit of it.  And you know, if you've ever been coming  from Connecticut or upstate New York and see the ozone sometimes in those  real hot days, there's a good reason for trying to get a little bit of the  emissions down in the northeast.  It used to be much worse but it's getting  a little better.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you -- Tom.  Tom Kloza -- as always.</p><p>Coming up, five people are killed after a small plane crashes into a  parking lot in Los Angeles.  More on the deadly accident ahead.</p><p>Plus some Senate Democrats getting on board for Supreme Court nominee,  Brett Kavanaugh.  Details on why they may be going from a slow walk to the  fast track, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday August 6th, your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p>China hitting back at President Trump.  A state-run newspaper calling the  president's tariffs extortion.  President Trump explaining the need for  increased tariffs over the weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They're charging us a 50  percent tariff.  We're charging them a 20 percent tariff.  Do you think  that's okay?  No, sir, it's really not.  We want free trade.  I said what's  free when they charge us and we can't charge them.  What is going on here?   What's going on here?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Investors keeping an eye on trade tensions, 21-point gain on the  Dow Futures right now.  So, investors continue to shrug off those trade  concerns.  That was the same case last week.  We got that jobs report, the  overall job number, the creation wasn't as high as people were expecting  but nonetheless with the revisions, 215,000 jobs have been created on this  country on average every month for the first seven months of the year.  And  we had the Dow and the S&amp;P last week up for their fifth week in a row.  </p><p>In Europe we have some buying to report, in England, France and Germany,  gains across the board.  The DAX in Germany up half of one percent.  </p><p>The markets ending mostly in the red in Asia Overnight.  The only winner  there, the four major markets, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong up half of one  percent.  </p><p>Tragedy in Santa Ana, a small plane crashing into a parking lot.  We have  the very latest.  </p><p>And changes at the top of Pepsi, Indra Nooyi is stepping down as the chief  executive officer.  She will stay on as chairman until early 2019.  She  will be replaced at Pepsi by President Ramon Laguarta on October the 3rd.  </p><p>Another big week for earnings, kicking off SeaWorld reporting mixed results  this morning, missing out on earnings but beating on revenue.  This  afternoon we hear from Marriott, Hertz, Etsy and many more.  But earnings  in this period are up more than 24 percent for the companies that already  have been reported.  </p><p>And here's the story of a house from T.V.  The Brady house, Brady Bunch  house is off the market.  Lance Bass of NSYNC tried to buy it.  You won't  believe what happened.  </p><p>Plus, busted, former linebacker Ray Lewis inducted into the Hall -- the  Football Hall of Fame this weekend.  Why the bust they gave him is really  turning heads, coming up.  </p><p>Because it doesn't look like him.  I don't even know who it looks like.   Doesn't look like Ray Lewis.  </p><p>First, to our top story this half hour, the confirmation of Brett  Kavanaugh, senate Democrats will meet with President Trump Supreme Court  nominee in the coming weeks.  Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer was  leading the charge to slow walk the confirmation process for Kavanaugh.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  Why did the president  pick Kavanaugh?  He knows that Kavanaugh more than any of the 25 will roll  over the rule of law and get the president off the legal hook that he may  well be on.  We will not rest until Brett Kavanaugh is defeated and the  American people win.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now a change of tune?  Schumer and several other Democrats  ending their holdout and scheduling meetings with the president's pick to  replace Anthony Kennedy on the high court.  </p><p>Joining me now, one of my favorite people on planet earth.  Fox News senior  judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Is this really a change of  heart?  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  No, it's a  change of tactics.  It's not a change of heart.  And it's interesting,  because the target of these new tactics is not any of the Democrats, its  Senator Rand Paul.  Because the Democrats discovered that Brett Kavanaugh  was instrumental in the creation of the Patriot Act and probably, they  don't know this, but they suspect because he was present in rendition and  the use of harsh interrogation techniques.  </p><p>If they find one memo from Brett Kavanaugh endorsing this stuff, Rand Paul  is off the table and he votes with the Democrats to oppose him.  That of  course will force Mitch McConnell then to get Republican votes.  So, that's  what I think their target is.  </p><p>Every single Democratic senator is going to say to him, why can't we see  your papers?  Elena Kagen who worked for Barack Obama, they caught up a  million of her papers when the Republicans want them.  Why can't we see  yours?  And he's probably going to say, you know what, the papers in that  in -- they might papers I wrote them but I don't have them.  The National  Archives has them, you're welcome to go and get them.  I really have  nothing to do with it.  </p><p>And probably nothing will change, unless they find that smoking gun that  will pry loose Rand Paul and maybe Mike Lee and John McCain.  We all know  where he is on torture and this type of thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, what I hear you saying is this Supreme Court nomination  isn't a layup at this point based on what you just said.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  If they find it.  If they don't find it, I think it is a  layup.  I think the president has chosen a nominee and pushed to that  nominee in such a way as to make him appealing to Democratic senators  running for reelection in states that the president won handily, like Joe  Manchin and your home state of West Virginia like Claire McCaskill and  Missouri.  Like senator Heidi Heitkamp in -- forgive me, North or South  Dakota, I forget which.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Heitkamp and then Joe Donnelly in Indiana.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Joe Manchin in West Virginia, those are the three who voted  for Neil Gorsuch.  SO, there is pressure on those three individuals.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know, I don't want to get too in the weeds.  But --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Please.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are very, very, very different.   Kavanaugh is straight from the establishment, big government, the president  is usually right, the police are usually right, the spies are not regulated  by the Fourth Amendment.  Gorsuch is not in that category.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Sorry.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Gorsuch is a lot closer to Justice Scalia on all of those  issues.  I say that with great difference.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I know.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Sitting next to me who risked his life to allow me to be able  to say that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What were -- what were you going to say? (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>CARTER:  I do think it's an important point because in addition to what you  were talking about they might find out.  You had talked about this last  week, about on Kavanaugh's position on privacy issues.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  And that could be something I think that could really sway  opinion, don't you?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It could very well sway some Republicans.  Judge Kavanaugh has  written that the government -- I'm holding up my iPhone, the government has  access to everything I have in here, without a warrant, as long as its  purposes are intelligence rather than law enforcement.  He has this very,  very narrow view of the Fourth Amendment.  The Fourth Amendment only  regulates the government's prying eyes when it wants information to  prosecute us with.  </p><p>Now, there is no Supreme Court case standing for that.  It's a very, very  minority opinion.  But it's an opinion that Republican senators need to  think twice about before they vote to favor him.  Because this could come  back to bite everybody.  We all put things in here that we expect the  government is not going to see unless it gets a search warrant.  A search  warrant requires probable cause, evidence under oath to a federal judge  demonstrating why what's in here is criminal not lurid and interesting to  them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, and it's not just Kavanaugh.  But that's the  reason Apple has created these phones, every generation of this phone Apple  can no longer open it.  </p><p>BAKER:  So they say.  </p><p>Apple has no way of opening this phone.  They say.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, so they say.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's no back door.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Didn't Comey go to some Israeli group to open up the iPhones  of those monsters in San Bernardino.  Because Apple wouldn't help them.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes, that was -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The FBI couldn't go in there.</p><p>BAKER:  That was -- that was the story.  Yes, that was the story.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's what the story.</p><p>BAKER:  And what the Apple say and they wouldn't help.  By the way, yes.  I  agree with you on (INAUDIBLE).  We all put things on this that we expect  the government will not access.  </p><p>I don't put anything on here without the belief that Amazon or Google or  somebody else is going to access it.  I assume everything I put on here,  some tech company has got access to somehow.  So, I'm not -- I'm not -- I  agree with you.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The Fourth Amendment -- the Fourth Amendment only regulates  the government.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It doesn't regulate the manufacturer.  </p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely, I don't disagree with that.  Given the importance of  this issue, don't you suspect -- you mentioned -- you know, the importance  of reviewing his papers.  Don't you imagine that they've already done that,  they've already accessed every paper that's out there and they're starting  to review it?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  According to the National Archives, which has the papers from  the Bush administration, the papers they're looking for is when he was a  young lawyer, working in the White House for President Bush.  Those  documents cannot be available until mid or late October.  Now, the goal is  -- </p><p>BAKER:  Because?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The time it takes to get them, I assume.  The goal of Senator  McConnell and the White House is to have Judge Kavanaugh on the court by  the first Monday in October when the Supreme Court reconvenes.  My guess  is, the Democrats are not going to get these papers and he probably will  pass by a narrow margin.  </p><p>CARTER:  I think it's going to be really interesting to see what this means  for the midterms.  Because if he -- if he gets in by October, I think  that's going to energize Democrats even more.  If he doesn't, I'm not sure,  I think that's going to energize Republicans even more.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I've always wanted to ask you this.  Is something -- to me,  it's in the weeds how you vote for a nominee to the Supreme Court.  Are the  basis animated by this?  The Supreme Court nomination to blue collar people  in Western Pennsylvania and Ohio who always voted Democrat and voted for  Trump last time around, do they take this into account when they decide who  to vote for congress in November?  </p><p>CARTER:  You know, I think that there are a large number of people who have  -- who have voted for our president, in large part just because of the  Supreme Court.  Because it's that important to those folks who are pro- life, who are concerned about the sanctity of marriage.  And for those  folks, they will likely vote because of the Supreme Court.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And --</p><p>CARTER:  And I think that's really -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not just only issues, it's also on immigration.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  OK.  Let me say --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's also on immigration, like upholding the travel ban.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I have problems with Judge Kavanaugh because of his view in  Fourth Amendment but he is pro-life.  He is pro-gun.  He is anti-the  regulatory state.  He presses a lot of buttons that conservatives and even  libertarians like I am like a lot.  </p><p>So, the question is, can you overcome his views on the Fourth Amendment?   Will he be forth coming and truthful in his views on the Fourth Amendment  when he's talking to a senator who he knows disagrees with him?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will see you on \"OUTNUMBERED\".  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dear fellow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  A lot of friend.  A lot of (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You said that I'll rip -- I'll rip your head off, that is not  true.  I love you.  I never --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I was just trying to make you laugh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's a joke, It's not (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>BAKER:  You know, I would pay for a cage match between you two.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Actually, I'm not sure we agree on almost everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We agree on -- we agree on virtually everything.  Judge  Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure, guys.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love you much.</p><p>Coming up, missing out on buying \"The Brady Bunch\" house.  It's tearing up  Lance Bass' heart.

Kristina Partsinevelos has the details, Kristina.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Thank you.  A small plane crashed near Los Angeles killing  all five people on-board.  This dash cam video shows the plane spiraling  down into the Staples parking lot.  Look at that video.  </p><p>The crash site is about a mile away from an airport.  The pilot declared an  emergency shortly before the crash.  No one on the ground was hurt.  The  cause of the crash is still under investigation.  </p><p>Demi Lovato is breaking her silence since her drug overdose last month.   The star took to Instagram last night to thank her fans for their support.   I have always been transparent about my journey with addiction.  What I've  learned is that this illness os not something that disappears or fades with  time.  It is something I must continue to overcome and have not done yet.   I want to thank God for keeping me alive and well.  </p><p>Well that she was rushed to the hospital after allegedly requiring opioid  treatment drug Narcan.  Maria recently spoke to its inventor, Dr. Roger  Crystal.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ROGER CRYSTAL, CEO, OPIANT PHARMACEUTICALS:  What happened to Demi  Lovato, extremely unfortunate and really does depicts what happened -- is  happening now in this opioid crisis, which essentially is affecting all  Americans.  And what we're very fortunate for is that her friends  apparently were carrying the Narcan nasal spray and therefore were able to  revive her.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Reports in Lovato has agreed to enter rehab to combat her  growing problem with addiction.  </p><p>Lance Bass from NSYNC says he's heartbroken after he's lost his chance to  buy the house made famous in the Brady Bunch's T.V. show.  The former NSYNC  member posting this on Instagram.  Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.  I'm feeling  heartbroken today.  As many of you may have heard, we placed the winning  bid on the iconic Brady Bunch house, at least that's what we were told.  </p><p>The Bass' said a corporate buyer a Hollywood studio wanted the house at any  cost and he was discouraged by the seller's agent to submit a higher offer.   The singer claims he was used to drive up the price of the home and called  the incident shady.  </p><p>The property though went on the market last month for $1.88 million.  The  broker for the homes listing reportedly says the sale to Bass was never a  done deal.  </p><p>So what do you guys think?  Do you think that house is worth though 1.8 --  almost $2 million?  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  It's the Brady Bunch house.  Of course, it is, are you really  buried the lead, you should have led with this at the top of the show.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's in the Valley.  Google that, Mitch Roschelle.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As we -- as we discuss.  It's somewhere in the San Fernando  Valley.  Would you -- what do you think it's worth Lee Carter?  </p><p>CARTER:  I think it's worth whatever people would pay for it.  I personally  wouldn't want to live in it.  But you know what -- </p><p>BAKER:  Well, do you think the bad omen, the Hawaiian token is still there?   I don't think so.</p><p>CARTER:  Just don't play catch in the yard there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, nobody got my milk and Pepsi reference earlier.  </p><p>BAKER:  Nobody?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's Laverne and Shirley.  </p><p>Thank you very much.  By the way, the inside of the Brady Bunch house  clearly doesn't look like it did.</p><p>BAKER:  Back in the day.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, back in the day.  And can somebody please explain to me  the riddle of the universe, that you have six kids and one bathroom  upstairs.  Like they share the bath of six kids shared one bathroom.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And Alice was in the house too.  </p><p>BAKER:  No, but the parents had an en suite.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BAKER:  The parents had their own bathroom.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Alice had their own bathroom.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  The boys moved downstairs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, they were -- </p><p>BAKER:  Greg moved upstairs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Greg moved upstairs</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Can anybody name Alice's boyfriends name, who was the butcher?  </p><p>BAKER:  Sam the butcher.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sam.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Got to go.</p><p>Former linebacker Ray Lewis inducted into the Football Hall of Fame but his  bust steals the show.  We will tell you why, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  An emotional win for Justin Thomas at the Bridgestone  Invitational.  Mike Gunzelman has the details.  Hey, Mike.</p><p>MIKE GUNZELMAN, RADIO HOST, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Hey, Dagen.  That's  right.  And Justin Thomas put on a show.  It's his first tournament win in  five months and his first victory with his grandparents in attendance.  He  gave him a huge hug after his final putt.  Thomas came out far ahead  beating Kyle Stanley by four strokes.  </p><p>However, one golfer that was not on that leader board, Tiger Woods.   Terrible day for him.  He started day of with two birdies on the first two  holes.  And then things went off the rails from there.  Woods shot 73 on  the day and tied for 31st place, not good.  </p><p>We'll see if Tiger can bounce back when the PGA championship begins this  coming Thursday.  </p><p>Dagen, this story is for you.  Chase Elliott has won his first career  NASCAR race.  He was able to hold off Martin Truex Jr. in the final laps at  Watkins Glen.  He's just 22 years old and Elliott was the second youngest  driver to win a race this year.  And he did get a little help from his  teammate, Jimmie Johnson, to get to victory lane.  Apparently, Elliott  actually ran out of fuel just after the checkered flag, don't know how that  happened.  So, Johnson used his car to push him along.  </p><p>And now this, I love this story.  I'm a huge Conor McGregor fan, UFC fan.   My guy is back.  Conor McGregor is back.  His much-anticipated return to  the Octagon, however, won't be a hyped-up world tour.  </p><p>Now, one of the biggest fights in UFC history is planned for October 6th.   McGregor will be fighting Khabib Nurmagomedov for the lightweight title.   And it's supposed to be one of the biggest money fights in the sport's  history.  UFC's president Dana White says they don't have time to fit in a  world tour ahead of the bout in Las Vegas but still this is going to be a  battle.  </p><p>And to baseball we go with the Toronto Blue Jays visiting the Seattle  Mariners.  Seattle broke out the poutine.  This fan tried to catch a  baseball with a big bowl of poutine that didn't work out so well.  He  slammed into the field, spilling the dish everywhere hitting -- you know,  the ball hit his face.  It's like, come on, dude, you had one job.  Catch  the ball.  </p><p>And then of course there is this.  Ray Lewis was inducted into the pro  Football Hall of Fame over the weekend.  But everyone is talking about how  much his bronze bust looks nothing like him.  So take a look at this.  What  do you guys think?  Does that look like Ray Lewis?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>GUNZELMAN:  Not at all, right?  </p><p>BAKER:  No.</p><p>CARTER:  This has happened a few times.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is the sculptor anonymous?  Because maybe Ray Lewis wouldn't be  so happy.  Actually, do they care?</p><p>GUNZELMAN:  Some people -- somebody thought that it looks like perhaps  comedian one of the Wayans brothers, Damon Wayans.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Damon Wayans, yes.</p><p>CARTER:  I could see that.</p><p>GUNZELMAN:  But there have been some other renditions.  So, you might  remember Cristiano Ronaldo, he had one and that didn't look anything like  him.  That look like my 7-year-old niece did that.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Brandi Chastain, there was one that was off.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>GUNZELMAN:  Yes, definitely bad for sure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, just really quickly, Chase Elliott's dad is Bill Elliott  the fame race car driver and his nickname is Awesome Bill from Dawsonville.   So, that's my favorite nickname.  </p><p>BAKER:  OK, (INAUDIBLE) finish with NASCAR.  So, we got to finish off with  Conor McGregor.  Also, I'm a huge fan of McGregor.  Do you think they're  cutting back on the world tour because they want to minimize the chance to  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>GUNZELMAN:  Yes, absolutely yes.  Because it's Conor, absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Mike.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

It's Monday, August 6th, your top stories  at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Tough talk on trade.  China firing back against President Trump.  The state  media blasting the administration, saying extortion won't work.  The  President Trump, doubling down on his policies over the weekend at a rally  in Ohio.</p><p>Checking the markets, let's check.  You know what is going for President  Trump?  His rhetoric on trade it's working, he has his base fired up Lee  Carter is going to talk about that, coming up.  And also, this economy,  it's in Fuego.  And the futures are showing that this morning.</p><p>We have gained across the board.  This coming off the fifth week in a row  that the Dow and S&amp;P have been up, and the real winner has been the NASDAQ  in terms of top performance.  It was up nearly one percent on the week.   Apple, hitting a $1 trillion market cap.  The first U.S. company to ever do  that.</p><p>All of this in terms of wages growing at the fastest pace in 10 years.   Inflation still tame, you name it.  It's going well for the United States  of America.  In Europe, we have gains across the board to tell you about.   And England, France, and Germany, no we don't, the markets have completely  turned in the other direction.  We have losses at the moment.</p><p>In Asia, overnight it was mixed action.  The Shanghai composite the worst  performer there.  The Hang Seng managing to eke out a gain of half of one  percent.</p><p>Earnings season rolls on.  SeaWorld and Tyson among the names reporting  this morning.  What is driving stocks higher?  Coming up.  Try earnings  growth north of 24 percent.  That's much better than analysts expected to  start the reporting season.</p><p>A heroic rescue caught on camera.  Atlanta police pull a man out of a  burning car.  More of the unbelievable video later this hour.  Samsung set  to unveil its latest iPhone rival.  Images of the new device leaked,  Samsung is behind it.  And it's party time for one panda.  A zoo  celebrating the first birthday of its newest edition with a cake made of  bamboo and fruit.</p><p>All of that and so much more coming up this morning.  Maslansky and Partner  President Lee Carter, PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle, and former CIA operative  and Diligence president, Mike Baker.  I had to cut you off because we're up  against a hard break.  But I agree that Conor McGregor it is the fight of - - maybe the century so far, coming up.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE:  Yes, actually -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it but they got to keep them from getting in trouble because  the issue you were talking about is he was -- he threw a hand truck and a  van full of fighters out at the bar at the Barclays Center out in Brooklyn,  and he ended up being on the legal trouble.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes, no, look, he is a beast but -- you know, you can do a little  home predictable so I think they're going to try to manage -- you know,  this is lead up to the fight because this, I had a massive fight, the  payday is huge.</p><p>If you're talking about China, it's true, quick.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, please, quick.</p><p>BAKER:  I think, people need to watch what China is saying right now.   They're ratcheting up the rhetoric a little rhetoric a little bit, and it's  becoming more personal which is not typical for them.  So, I think what  we're seeing from that is their reaction to what's happening within their  own economy.</p><p>And this is a very interesting time, but also a very difficult time.  And  we need to manage this properly because again, and we talked about this  earlier, a destabilized Chinese economy is not going to do us any good in  the long run.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rhetoric that becomes increasingly personal against the  president.</p><p>BAKER:  Against the administration, against President Trump.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because we know he has talked about Xi Jinping, his friend.  But  -- </p><p>BAKER:  Who is president for life basically now?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, but -- you know, you start making it personal with  President Trump and things generally don't go well.  So -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Yes, but that thing said,  people really think that the president is doing the right thing by fan of  China, they're still supporting this on both like on all sides.  To say  they expect them like two-thirds of Americans think this is the right  strategy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And my issue is and I've been very vocal about it.  In the  meantime, we've taken aback to our allies at the same time.  And in  Americans whose jobs are at risk or have been hurt by higher prices.</p><p>So, there you go.  Let's talk China going in on Trump's tariff threats,  saying, he's starring in his own, \"Streetfighter style, deceitful drama of  extortion and intimidation.\"</p><p>The president plans to stay the course on trade.  Let's go to Blake Burman  live in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey near where the president is taking a  working vacation.  Blake, what's the latest?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  As you guys were just talking about the Chinese ratcheting  up the rhetoric over the weekend.  The latest coming in a state-run  editorial of the -- that editorial described the president as engaging in  what they described as \"Streetfighter style, deceitful drama of extortion,  and intimidation.\"</p><p>The president though over the weekend saying that he gets along with the  Chinese.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Look, I don't blame China.   I don't blame any of these countries, I don't have to go through them I've  got some good relationships.  Believe it or not they all like me, they  understand.  They can't believe themselves they got away with it.  They  can't believe that they got away with, but they have and we're turning it  around, we're turning it around fast.</p><p>BURMAN:  Both sides appear to be dug in here, because the Chinese saying  that the U.S. and China right now are engaged in a quote, \"zero-sum\" game.   While members of the Trump administration continue to say that President  Trump will not blink.</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  Don't underestimate  President Trump's resolve here.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:   How far are you prepared  to take those?</p><p>BOLTON:  Far enough to get China to change its behavior, and they need to  understand that.</p><p>WALLACE:  And, if they don't change their behavior?</p><p>BOLTON:  I think, the pressure will continue.  I think the president's made  that very clear.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BURMAN:  The president, now unveiling a new argument over the weekend  Dagen, he tweeted out the following at one point, writing, \"Because of  tariffs, we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21  trillion in debt that has been accumulated.  It's unclear though, Dagen, exactly how that specific math there checks  out?  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Blake.  Blake Burman for us in New Jersey.</p><p>BURMAN:  We got it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Mark Penn, a former Clinton adviser Stagwell  Group president, author of the book Microtrends Squared.  Mark, I said  earlier as a person, I consider myself to be a fiscal conservative.  I  don't think, I've ever seen a Republican president in my lifetime brag  about tax increases because that's essentially what he was doing.  And it's  actually not the first time I've heard him say that at least, one of the  rallies recently.</p><p>MARK PENN, FORMER ADVISER OF BILL CLINTON:  Well, I think you have to look  at these tariffs as strategic bargaining chips.  I mean, I think, you know  what, I've seen President Trump do over and over again is when he doesn't  really have anything to bargain with, he creates things to bargain with.</p><p>And that's what I think what he's done with the tariffs.  And when it comes  to China, the public really does support him in China.  They think China  has been stealing American jobs for a long time, stealing American  technology, and is out for world economic domination on the back of  America.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, Mark, this is Lee Carter speaking.  I am -- I'm  fascinated by how Americans are reacting to all of this.  And really -- in  general saying that they support what the president is doing with China,  and believe exactly what you said that these are really strategic  bargaining chips that he's using with.  And think in a long-term, we're  going to win.</p><p>And we're seeing the president's approval ratings eke up.  On the other  hand, we're seeing independents starting to -- in the most recent polls we  thought were just talking about NBC poll that just came out saying that the  independents are actually softening towards the president.  What are you  seeing in your polls?</p><p>PENN:  Well, look, we had at the Harvard caps, Harris Poll.  We had the  president at about 45 percent approval.  We didn't really show dramatic  change.  I think to the extent, the president is sticking up it's because  of the economic straight.</p><p>70 percent of Americans now say that we have a strong economy, and that  really is the biggest change in the poll in the last year.</p><p>I think that's up about 15 points or so.  And that is the tremendous shift,  and that is what is holding him up because he's got a 55 percent approval  there.  On the other side, immigration -- you know, the tariffs, he could  have waited till after the midterms on the tariffs because it does create - - you know, some controversy particularly in terms of Europe and Mexico,  and but not China, they do support him on China.  And that's kind of what  we're saying.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, the other thing that I'm really, really interested in  when it comes to the -- comes to the polling is voter enthusiasm.  And as  we're going into the midterms, it's sort of been flip-flopping over who's  more enthusiastic, Democrats or Republicans?</p><p>And as we're looking at the war on the media or the media -- you know, back  and forth between the president, and it seems like the war on what's  happening with the media, and the media attacking the president all the  time, did he energizing Republicans more?  What do you see?</p><p>PENN:  Yes, I think everybody is going to be energized.  I am going to be  fascinating, we're going to be fascinated about what happens on Tuesday  night here in this -- in this special election in a Republican district in  Ohio.</p><p>I -- look, I think that the president has made the choice here energize his  base.  Go out and rally after rally, and do what worked for him in the  presidential.</p><p>A little risky because the question is, \"Are independent women in suburban  districts who have voted more Republican than anybody realizes going to  drift Democratic?  And that's really the big question.  And the more he  plays to the base, to the working class that doesn't typically show out,  the show up in midterms, the more he may lose some of the well-educated  suburban voters who typically do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, Mark, I will say this, and we saw it in 2016.  Women,  wives, mothers vote on the economy.  This economy is growing at the fastest  pace in four years north of four percent it could grow even faster in the  current quarter based on the most recent estimates.</p><p>Job growth on average this year is faster than it was last year at this  time which is incredible for an economy into nine years of an expansion.   Wages are growing at the fastest pace in a decade.  And then, you have good  news even on Obamacare in premiums aren't going up as much as people  expected.  They're actually falling according to reports to some of these  state insurance commissioners.</p><p>I think that it's hard to find anything wrong.  This is -- and look at  this, the USDA showed that nearly 3 million Americans have come off of food  stamps since President took office.  Again, that's what women vote on.</p><p>PENN:  Well, and of course, if I were working with President Clinton, and  we had numbers like that, his ratings would be in the stratosphere and he'd  be untouchable.  So, the fact that's not the case shows you that, that  message hasn't gotten through yet. </p><p>Certainly, the idea that 3 million are off food stamps hasn't gotten  through.  It's an important message because the big question here with the  tax cuts is, \"Did it just benefit the big corporations or did the working  class and even the working poor benefit?  And truth is that you say a lot  of statistics are coming out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you need the message?  Do you need the messages, though?  90  percent of Americans got a pay hike because of the tax cuts earlier this  year.  90 percent of people are seeing fatter paychecks.  Do you need to  message that?</p><p>Do -- there -- again, it kind of comes back to do his approval ratings and  do the polls even matter because they sure as heck didn't matter going into  the election almost two years ago?</p><p>PENN:  Well, but the public is fed up, the Congress doesn't seem to be able  to do anything.  I do think the Republicans have a leader who has quit,  doesn't even support the President on tariffs.  And yet, is staying in  office.  I've said consistently with you that I think the biggest  Republican weakness is they have no message and the leadership.</p><p>The Democrats have weaknesses too.  You know, headed by Pelosi, someone  who's really disliked throughout the country and featuring socialist.   That's why a voter who is going to go into the polls who's not energized in  the middle is truly confused about which way to vote.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you said, Nancy Pelosi, let's also talk about Senator  Elizabeth Warren, which she was fueling rumors of a presidential run over  the week and saying, she well -- you can just listen to this, she's not  afraid to be the underdog.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  It won't be  easy.  We're going to have to fight uphill.  But me, I'm going up that hill  and I hope you are too.  And I hope that when you do, you'll reach your  hand out and bring someone else along for the climb.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of policy platform, it's abortion and open borders.  I  don't know how that wins.</p><p>PENN:  Well, if you look at the Democrats in the Democratic primary,  actually, Biden has been rising and not Elizabeth Warren.  Elizabeth Warren  gets all the publicity, but he went out -- you know, this week with  President Obama.</p><p>You know, I think begin -- he has been very quietly position himself.   Look, I don't think Elizabeth Warren would be the best Democratic  presidential candidate.  And -- you know, the Pelosi Warren team is really  too far to the left for America.</p><p>But I don't think that's where the rank-and-file Democrats are, and I don't  think that's how this is going to play out come three years from now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joe Biden taking a selfie with President Obama with a big grin  on his face.  Well, I think that every American could write the caption for  that.  Mark Penn, thank you so much.</p><p>PENN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you my friend, Mark Penn.  Coming up, an  unbelievable rescue.  Police in Atlanta pull a man out of a burning car.   Details on the heroic action straight ahead.  And Samsung unveiling its  newest phone this week.  The detail is already out because Samsung leaked  them.  That story later this hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news.  A Philadelphia Police Officer is in the hospital  after being shot in the face this morning.  Kristina Partsinevelos has the  details.  Kristina?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  The  officer was shot in the face while serving a warrant.  He is identified as  49-year-old Jason Potts.  A 20-year veteran of the force and a member of  the SWAT team.  Officer Potts suffered heavy bleeding and at least a broken  jaw.  Police say he is expected to survive though.  </p><p>Tourists are fleeing after a powerful earthquake in Indonesia.  Magnitude  7.0 quake hitting the tourist island of Lombok killing about 100 people.   More than 230 others seriously injured.  The death toll is expected to rise  and search operations continue.  It's the second deadly -- deadliest quack  in just one week to hit that island.  A July 29th quake killed 16 people  and damaged hundreds of homes.</p><p>And there is more trouble at Wells Fargo.  The bank said the calculation  error may have caused hundreds of people to lose their homes to foreclosure  between 2010 and 2015.  According to a regulatory filing, Wells Fargo said  the mistake was made in a formula used to qualify struggling homeowners for  Federally-backed assistance programs.  The bank has set aside $8 million or  about $20,000 per affected customer.</p><p>Shares of Wells Fargo are down three percent today but up this morning.

And at the time that Pepsi is under pressure in terms of its  fizzy drinks business but also with these tariffs.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And took global business and just not operating and selling  your product to consumers and business in one country, selling around the  world and that's a challenging job by any stretch with tariffs, it's even  more complicated.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And trade spats that are --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And currencies that are not moving in the direction people that  people thought they were moving, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's very difficult to plan your business that way but a  great run for a well-known woman at the top of one great American company.  </p><p>CARTER:  She is an extraordinary leader with an extraordinary vision.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You -- I want to give you a quiz.  I hate when people do this  but Pepsi was invented where?  Coke was invented in Atlanta.  Where was  Pepsi invented?  New Bern, North Carolina, Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>BAKER:  Oh, you think it was time to answer her.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he didn't know.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  OK.  I wrote it down right here, New Bern, North Carolina.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That's right.  Thank you so much.  Coming up.  A whale  sized surprise.

Twitter apologizing after it  suspended conservative commentator Candace Owens for response to a set of  anti-white tweets by New York Times editorial board member.  This is a new  higher.  This as reports indicate executives and top board members from the  social media giant have donated overwhelmingly to Democrats.</p><p>Lee, your reaction to this.  Candace Owens basically took anti-white tweets  from this new hire by the New York Times and replaced certain her words in  as -- to illustrate the insanity and hideousness of what this woman at The  New York Times had been tweeting.  That woman said that it was -- I guess  she was trying to illustrate irony or something like that.  Nevertheless,  your reaction.  </p><p>CARTER:  So my reaction is A, she should not have been suspended, B, I can  understand from a machine learning perspective how this could have been  taken down as hate speech.  But what I don't understand is why it just  would have been blocked like so many other things or rather than saying  that we're going to suspend her.  And thirdly, I really think that if this  is going to be the policy of a social media company like Twitter they need  to be able to respond more quickly.</p><p>To have this happen for 12 hours, to go with no response, to go and say  nothing for a long time is a real problem for them and when I think that  Twitter really needs to remember is that, there is a huge number of  conservatives between ages 27 and 32.  In fact there was more conservatives  than there are liberals.  So they better do something about this.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's become -- Mike, how do you feel of about this?  Because I  have noticed and I mentioned with Jessica Tarlov that conservatives have  put in a bright red X next to their names to push back on Twitter, their  way of expressing dissatisfaction with the shadow banning that we've been  going on like where in search results, conservative names are essentially  buried or don't even show up at all.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Look, I'm shocked that Twitter leadership overwhelmingly  supports Democrats.  I picked up the New York Times, I know I'm reading a  paper with a certain lean, right?  I pick up the Wall Street Journal same  way.  You know, it's the world we live in.  I get on Twitter, I know where  they're going, right?  I know what their agenda in a sense is, and so I'm  not surprised.</p><p>And -- I guess bigger issue for me is just we -- where is the civility in  any of the dialogue whether it's on social media or face to face or on, you  know, traditional media.  We seem to have lost the inability, right?  To  speak rationally speak to people having a different point of view.  We've  lost our --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here are the two things -- the most hideous things that have  been said to me on Twitter by people on left, they need to reopen Auschwitz  to gas and incinerate you and I can't wait until Iran wipes Israel off the  map so I can watch you cry.  These people were not disciplined by Twitter,  they shouldn't have accounts, should they?</p><p>It's a private organization, they should -- but again, the level of hate --  and these are people, who -- go by their own names who were sitting at home  spewing this kind of hatred and if I -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BAKER:  But it's on both sides.  It's on both -- to be honest it's -- both  the hard sides, right?  Both the far right, the far left are sitting in  their trenches throwing hand grenades saying equally despicable things.   Nobody exists in the center anymore.  You don't have to agree with  somebody's position, right?  You don't have to read -- you're just fine.   But figure out a way to have a conversation without being -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, on the left anti-semitism is alive and well and I  don't even -- and they don't -- people, liberals don't acknowledge it, I  see it every day and I can say with no hesitation that the nastiest that  ever been said to me on social media were from the left.  People who preach  -- you know, 40 years ago preaching peace, love, and happiness.  Let's all  locked arms and we are against big government and helping one another.</p><p>Well, that just died.  I don't know when but it just died. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, no doubt about it.  I mean, Antifa, the big joke about  them is that they think they are, you know, this group that's out to, you  know, to promote free speech and yet they bludgeon anybody who doesn't  agree with them.  And they don't get the joke about that, they don't see  how ironic that is.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And cowards wearing black masks, I should point that out.   Cowards wearing -- covering their faces.  </p><p>BAKER:  You're not a good look for them. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming.

President Trump using the stock market as a measure of who's winning the  trade dispute, and indicating that U.S. has a clear lead over China.   Listen to this:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p>TRUMP:  If I didn't do anything with the trade deals, if I said nothing,  we're going to let everybody continue to take our jobs, take our wealth,  let them continue -- you know, I bet our stock market is up almost 40  percent since I won.  But if I didn't do anything with trade, just kept  quiet, let them continue to take advantage of us.  Nobody says anything.  I  think you would've been up another 40, 50, 60 percent.  But eventually, you  would have had to pay the piper eventually, and we're not going to do.   We're going to do something, we're going to make our country so much richer  than it has ever been.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now: Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment  Institute Head Global Market Strategist.  Paul, why has the markets been  able to shake off the trade tensions, the trade worry so much?  </p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Well, though, the market believes and we agree, that a deal is  the ultimate goal here that the goal is not to run the Chinese economy into  the ground or the U.S. economy into ground with unending tariffs.  They can  get a negotiation on the trade deficit, getting the Chinese to buy more  from this country, and if they can get a deal on autos with the Mexicans,  the Canadians, and the Europeans then we think the trade talk, the  rhetoric, dies down a bit or is dialed back.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC U.S.:  Hey, Paul, Mitch Roschelle.  You  mentioned China and their economy, some of the challenges that their  economy sort of predate the trade war, their markets are sort of in free- fall, their currency is diminishing, and they are growing middle class, and  the funding of entitlements for the middle class is really starting to put  pressure on their ability to grow and you see that in GDP numbers.  So,  regardless, don't we still have a global challenge that China's economy  that's going to impact other global economies if this trade war isn't  sorted out.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, you're absolutely right, Mitch, the moderation in  growth around the world, Europe I mention, too had slowed down some.  That  is confusing the markets a little bit here.  They're thinking that all of  the slowdown is related to trade talk.  It's not.  The slowdown is  predating the trade talk and it's an important factor.  The Chinese -- we  need to remember, the Chinese have an economy that on the one hand, has  very strong consumer growth, and on the other hand has a lot of debt.  And  as you mentioned, some issues with the providing social welfare.  So, how  are they going to balance that going forward?  They need to be very careful  with that and they don't need extra variable in there, if you will, of  trade uncertainty.  So, we think there's pressure on Chinese internally to  come to the negotiating table.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Debt is a huge issue, though, Paul.  And let's talk about what  we're paying as nation to borrow right now.  JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie  Dimon, warning investors over the weekend to prepare for five percent  interest rates -- that would be yield on the 10-year treasury.  And this  certainly is a major concern; it's not showing up in the markets so much at  this point, but now that back to running one trillion-dollar deficits,  we're in a fight with one of the largest holders of our own debt.  Someone  we've leaned on China and relied upon to buy our debt and fund deficit.   Your reaction to this?  Is there any way in the near-term that we even get  back to four percent on the 10-year yield?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  We don't think that there's much chance of getting to back to  four percent any time soon.  On the 10-year yield, yes, the debt is a  weight on the economy, call it a headwind for growth.  And no, we don't  think the Chinese are about ready to dump their holdings of U.S.  Treasuries.  Treasuries are simply the largest, the most liquid market in  the world.  And if you're a government that needs to hold trillions of  dollars of reserves, there's no other place for you to go but to hold U.S.  Treasury. </p><p>So, we don't think there's a real threat there.  But yes, the debt is going  to be a headwind for the economy going forward.  On the other hand, you've  got, still, quite a demographic challenge going forward as many of us age  and get into the retirement years.  We're going to be holding a lot more  debt anyway, that's going to help keep yield a little lower.  Our target  for 10-year treasury of this year is in the low threes, and we don't see it  moving up to four any time soon -- rather low yields look to us to be  continue to be the main problem for investors.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, is an aging population and those who will be holding more  safe, if you will, treasuries, is that bad for the stock market then?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, what it does for the stock market when the yields are  low, relatively low on treasury, we've been hanging around three percent  here.  That means that you can have a little bit higher stock market  prices, before stocks get overvalued.  So, we don't think that stocks are  too rich right now, and part of that argument is that the 10-year is just  not making the sort of headway that would get you to four or five percent.   If we were to see that, we'd be more worried about stocks.  </p><p>BAKER:  Paul, going book to -- sorry, Mike Baker, here, going back to  tariffs question: There's a bit of a -- softening in the talk between U.S.  administration, and the E.U. now, and tariffs skirmish.  Do you expect the  same development in our conversations with China?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, the I think Chinese know that there's a deal available  for them any time they want to take it.  But they're just not sure whether,  whether they should go now or later.  We think there will be a deal  sometime.  There's a good window for that opening up in the fall.  But the  Chinese simply need to figure out a way to close that -- some of that trade  deficit.  They could buy more liquid natural gas, they could buy more crude  oil, they could buy more soybeans.  Certainly, they need all of those  things in greater quantities than before.  </p><p>And I think if they were to do that, they would make -- they would come a  long way towards meeting the president in a deal.  So, I think that's, in  the end, where they'll finally go is making some kind of deal on trade.   The U.S. and the Europeans also have talking to do, not a done deal yet  there either.  But, again, the president probably wants to see those two  things, some sort of deal on autos and some sort of deal with the Chinese  on the trade deficit.  And then we think that the trade negotiations seem  to a lower priority and for the markets and we can get back to thinking  about good earnings growth going forward. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Paul, real quick, why is the opening in terms of having  discussions with China, why is that in the fall what about the timing of  that?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, the -- you've got midterm elections coming up here --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  -- In U.S.  And the president is still putting out their  additional tariffs and the Chinese feel obliged to respond.  I think  they're still gauging each other's degree of seriousness that the president  in our view, since the beginning, has been serious.  But some people maybe  have been thinking that, well, he would be eventually bend or making  exceptions.  That's not been the case.  So, they need to get back talking  again.  There's some evidence that the Chinese are interested in that.  It  just has to happen sometime in the next few months, we thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the stock market just keeps chugging along.  Paul  Christopher, thank you so much.  Take care.    </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come back soon.  Coming up, incredible rescue caught on tape.

But Tyson Foods and Sea World have reported this morning.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more, Nicole. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Monday morning,  Dagen.  So, there's been a lot of optimism surrounding the earnings 24.2  percent gain for earnings overall, year-over-year growth.  So, that's  surpassing analysts' estimates in 43 companies this week.  Take a look at  two that have already kicked it out: Tyson Foods and Sea World.  Sea World  up 15 percent; Tyson Food up three percent, this morning.  So, Tyson Foods  CEO, we did see that Tyson Foods -- this was a beat on profit.  Also, the  cattle prices have been falling; the food prices have been falling, and  they've increased herd size, and size of the heavier animals.  That offset  the impact of falling bacon pork prices.  This is apparent of Ball Park  Frank's hot dogs and Jimmy Dean's sausages.  </p><p>And then, there's Sea World.  What the CEO is saying that the quarter  benefitted from new marketing initiatives, strategic pricing, positive  reception to rises and such, the attendance on rise, and it was the revenue  that wowed Wall Street.  In fact, this is the third time in a row, third  straight, beat on top lines.  So, this is a winner, no doubt, for Sea  World.  And you could see it is up 15 percent.  That's going to be heavily  traded in a big mover today.  </p><p>Just as far as market commentary, Jeff Saut over at Raymond James,  everybody's been somewhat concerned about the sector rotation out of tech - - out of tech and out of consumer cyclicals, and have they moved into cash?   No, in fact, they've moving been moving it into industrials and financials,  and some other consumer non-cyclicals.  And he said, this sector rotation  is healthy, it's associated with a healthy bull market.  They're also a  little positive on Apple, and little weak on CBS this morning.  Back to  you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Apple, the first to cross the finish line to  $1 trillion in its valuation.  Several other big tech names are close  behind.  Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  You  have a prediction, sir?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh, wait a minute, wait a  minute, wait a minute.  I just want to take our audience back to the Fox  News Channel on Friday afternoon where you made a stellar appearance on  \"THE FIVE,\" as I recall.  I thought you were really, really cool.  And it  occurred to me, you and I go back about 10 years now, working together in  the Fox Business Network for about 10 years.  What's the biggest story that  you and I have covered in those 10 years?  Don't answer, I think -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love you.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think it is the extraordinary performance and the gain in  valuation of those five big technology companies.  Apple is already worth a  trillion.  You've got Google, Amazon, and Microsoft really close, well  above 800 billion, and Facebook is down there at 500 billion.  But  essentially, I've never seen anything like this before.  You've never seen  the accumulation of wealth and power as we have seen in the last couple of  years in those five american technology companies.  There's going to be  cause to break them up, but nonetheless, they are there, they're  exceptionally powerful.  I think it's a unique moment in our financial  history.  Amazon, Google, microsoft, you get a good rally this year, and  from where we are now, and all three of them will join Apple at a trillion- dollar valuation, extraordinary stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It really is important though, Stuart, that you highlight it in  the way that you do every day on your show, but in this -- in this moment  as well, and I said this because we very often -- you know, the news media  gets criticized so much, but many people are quite frankly lazy about it.   They don't have to do any homework, they can talk about President Trump and  his mental state.  But this is important to breathe and look at and  highlight because this is American greatness.</p><p>VARNEY:  And it doesn't get much coverage in the establishment newpapers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>VARNEY:  They cover it in a negative way.  They've got too much power,  they've got too much wealth.  I cover it in a positive way.  All the money  they are making will flow out into different industries like cars, medical  devices, drugs, that -- money made out of computing power will flow out to  other industries and improve them.  I think it's very positive development.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And anybody in this country, if you own one share of an Apple or  a Microsoft or Amazon, or a Netflix, you're an owner in that company.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You own part of it and I think that that's worth -- that we're  all in it together.  We're all part of this greatness.</p><p>VARNEY:  Anybody with a 401(k), an IRA, a mutual fund, you benefited from  this, you've seen your retirement savings go up, and that is wholly good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amen and hallelujah.</p><p>VARNEY:  There's a mutual adoration society here, Dagen, I kind of like it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And thank you for the kind words.</p><p>VARNEY:  You're welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's why we like working here because these are the people we  work with and we actually like each other off in here, and not faking it --  we're not faking it.</p><p>VARNEY:  Incredible.</p><p>BAKER:  And Stuart --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, we got to go.</p><p>BAKER:  Oh, we got to go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love you, Mike.  That's Mike Baker.</p><p>VARNEY:  OK, Mike, love you, too.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A reminder, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts every day at 9:00 a.m.  Eastern.

But the cheese curds, when you chew them, they have to be  squeeky.  And there's an area in Quebec, St. Albert or St. Albert that  makes a lot of these cheese curds.  They're very popular, you can get all  kinds of topings on them, but the one you want to go for is the typical  gravy fries and cheese curds.

We have  over $700 billion being refinanced of the next two quarters and that really  concerns me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Federal Reserve is pulling back on its balance sheet at the  same time and we're running $1-trillion budget.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  This is going to be a trillion-dollar deficit this year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lee?</p><p>CARTER:  A lot of criticisms about the polls, and whether or not they're  reliable.  I think what's important to look at the polls for is for  momentum and direction, and it looks like the President has weathered a  really tough storm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Indeed, Lee Carter, Mitch Roschelle, and Mike Baker.

It's the best publicity we've had  in ages. </p><p>But it's a wonderful city, Wall Street Journal called Boise, Idaho--I know  people are saying, \"What is he talking about?\"  They call Wall Street --  the called Boise, Idaho the fastest growing city in America and it's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's -- and it's because you have like 80 children and --</p><p>BAKER:  And we -- who's counting?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just -- I'm just joking.  But we -- we're going to cover the  world for you this morning in the next three hours with Mike, Mitch, and  Lee.  Great to see all of you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So on to our top story this hour, trade tensions escalating,  Chinese state media bashing President Trump's trade tactic saying policies  of extortion and intimidation won't work.  The commander-in-chief with a  different view of the situation voicing support for his negotiating style  saying tariffs are working.  </p><p>Tweeting just yesterday this, \"Tariffs are working big time.  Every country  on earth wants to take wealth out of the United States always to our  detriment.  I say as they come, tax them, if they don't want to be taxed,  let them make or build the product in the U.S.  In either event, it means  jobs and great wealth.\"</p><p>\"Because of tariffs, we will be able to start paying down large amounts of  the $21 trillion in debt accumulated, much by the Obama Administration  while at the same time reducing taxes for our people.  At minimum, we will  make much better trade deals for our country.\"</p><p>Here now is Mark Avallone, President and Founder of Potomac Wealth  Advisors.  Mark, are you with us?</p><p>MARK AVALLONE, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS:  Yes.  Good  morning, good to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  What do you -- what do you make of this?  So far,  I don't -- I don't think it's a stretch to say that the market has largely  shrugged off what has been going on with the trade fight that started in  the spring.</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well it has shrugged it off, our market's up year-to-date across  the board and China's is down.  It's down 18 percent the beginning of the  year and it's in bear market going back to 2017.  </p><p>So the Trump strategy is to use our economic strength now while we have it  to enact much needed and frankly, much deserved parity.  He wants a fair  playing field with China.  The only problem with the trade policy is he  dragged in the Canadians and the E.U. which then you have us against the  world.</p><p>If we focus on China, keep it more of a microcosm then the stock market  appears to say, \"Hey, we can manage this.  Our economy is strong enough and  we'll push higher from here.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch, how much runway is the market or investors going to give  the Trump Administration because right now we've seen with the job's report  on Friday we created on average 215,000 jobs every month, that's faster  than the pace that we were at last -- last year, the first seven months of  the year which is really incredible for an economy that's been in expansion  mode since -- for nine years.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The interesting thing would be in -- I think the reason why the  market shrugged it off and to your point on runway is because corporate  earnings have been so robust.  </p><p>But what we're starting to see is the cost of the supply chain understand  the market perspective on this, the cost in the supply chain to go up.  And  if they cannot pass those cost to the customer, meaning customers won't pay  an increase price then we're going to see impact corporate profits.</p><p>The flip side is, if they can, we're going to see inflation.  So, I think  we're close to maybe in the next quarter getting to the point where the  market's going to have a hard time turning off --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well is that a lose lose because somebody bears that cost,  either it's corporations or if it's the consumer.  If it's the consumer, is  it more -- if the companies can passed those cost on the consumer, is it  more, I guess, the impact won't be as severe to the market.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It will -- it certainly won't be.  In fact, it will help grow  revenue because they're charging more for the products.  It may not  necessarily help margin, but it will certainly help the top line.</p><p>But the challenge is going to be how much can you pay for (INAUDIBLE)  before the market pushes back or there's another alternative that starts to  erode sales.  But Mark, I'm curious your perspective on that.</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well if it does as you say raise the price of the end good and  raising revenues for the corporation, then it is a tax on the consumer.   Ultimately it is going to be a drag.</p><p>But I think the play here is that are the consumer wages are so strong, the  individuals are flushed with cash, we can pay up for this without it  slowing down our economy too much.  China's limping along.  </p><p>So one a one-on-one basis, we can power through this.  If that wasn't the  outlook, we would have seen the stock market pull back by now.  The market  looks forward and yet it's been up for the year.  So I think all the news  is out and Wall Street is saying the global growth story that we heard, the  I.M. -- from the IMF this year for the G20, from we continue it here from  the Fed, the global growth story is strong enough that even if price is  raised, it's not going to slow down the U.S. economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch already mentioned this, there's a story in the Wall Street  Journal today, an article commenting on the strong earnings season.   Profits surging at big U.S. firm, strong economy, and tax cuts, fuel gains,  and embolden companies to raise prices.</p><p>This is a recent report by the UFDA showed nearly three million have come - - individuals have come all for food stamps since President Trump took  office.  Mark -- Mike Baker, you can see the world in terms of the business  that you do. </p><p>And Mark briefly mentioned this, that we do have the upper hand because  China is so weak right now, because the stock market is greater, their  economy is growing a great deal slower, and they are wash in debt.  So the  timing of this that people act like President Trump might be rash, but  there's some wiliness and some intelligence in why we pick right now to  take this fight on.</p><p>BAKER:  I think that's true.  I'm heading to Beijing tomorrow morning for a  week or so, very curious to kind of get the on the ground response from  just the, you know, local folks in business about how they perceive this  from their side.</p><p>I will say it's not in anybody's interest globally for -- to have an  unstable Chinese economy, it just -- it just not.  And so --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think they blank though?  That's been the question that  we raise last week, do you think China blanks on this?</p><p>BAKER:  I think ultimately they do because they're extremely pragmatic and  they understand what a chaotic problem they could have if the economy  continues to head south.  </p><p>And with -- a question from Mar is, you mentioned mark the idea that we  dragged in Canada and the E.U. into this overall trade issues, trade war,  do you think that that was more of a negotiating ploy with the president in  terms of overall objective for China or do you think in a sense, you know,  there's not really a grand strategy here?</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well it's tough to say with the president.  Maybe he's trying to  show the Chinese he's serious about this and hopefully, quietly behind the  scenes reaching an agreement.  </p><p>We saw that Mexico, we might update the NAFTA Agreement and start being on  a friendly playing field again.  That's really the hope.  You really don't  want to take on the entire world.  It's either take on China, and focus on  these legitimate inequities, technology transfer and others and let's have  our allies with us as we try to take on China.</p><p>Remember, China's also unfair to the E.U., let's make the E.U. our ally  against the number one trade offender and that is China.</p><p>CARTER:  This is Lee Carter, I -- one of the things that I've been  fascinated to watch is that most Americans really have been willing to give  the president a long runway here and that's been really surprising because  the most part people don't want to take short-term pain in order for the  long-term gain.</p><p>And China's known to have a long gain, really long gain.  We've got  election cycle after election cycle after election cycle and investor seem  to be giving in the past two.  But I'm just wondering how long do you think  Americans are going to give this runway before they're going to say, \"Wait,  this is too much?\"</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well, it's interesting that -- that's a great point because a  lot of the Trump voters are the ones that are negatively impacted by this  tariff skirmish.  You have farmers in the Midwest that voted for Trump that  are taking a lot of this.</p><p>And some of the manufacturing with the aluminum and steel tariffs could  have gone against a lot of his base.  But ironically, they are sticking  with him and we haven't seen the weakness just yet.  China on the other  hand doesn't have an election in November nor will they have an election.</p><p>So their government can continue to be autocratic and weighed out.  So if  Trump's playing the long game, he doesn't really have the upper hand in  that.  I think trying -- we keep saying is, is China going to blink?   That's the last thing we should say.  China's never going to publicly  blink.  </p><p>We want to work diplomatically behind the scenes and hope to get a  favorable outcome without letting the world thing we beat China or they  blink because they're not going to blink publicly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Would you add the stocks here Mark, U.S. stocks particularly  with the -- again, over the weekend I think that Jamie Dimon the head of  J.P. Morgan said that he -- that the -- this country should brace itself  for five percent interest rates.</p><p>He said that he thinks that the tenure yield should be at four percent  right now and we should brace for five, this is we're staring down $1  trillion annual budget deficits and the Treasury is going to be selling a  whole wash of debt in the coming weeks.</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well when I hear those Jamie Dimon comments I said perhaps.  But  we're in a global economy.  With the tenure boomed and the tenure in Japan  being, what, less than one half a percent close to zero in Japan.</p><p>So we cannot unilaterally raise our rates that rapidly, it's a global  economy.  There's a subtle currency we're going on where none of these  other entities want to raise their currencies, they're not going to  (INAUDIBLE) up interest rates.  A five percent tenure is not going to  happen.</p><p>We're lucky if we get to four percent in this country the way we have the  foreign pressure in the currency and in the interest rate markets.  I think  if you invest, you have to look domestically.  Our economy is too strong.  </p><p>I think small caps which earn about 75 percent of their revenue here  domestically versus the S&amp;P500 which get about half of their revenues  overseas, I think it's a safer place in case this trade skirmish continues.</p><p>And, again, since I don't see interest rates going anywhere near four  percent in the next 12 months, I think the U.S. economy manages any rate  hike and we continue to chug along.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mark, thank you so much, Mark Avallone.  And Mitch Roschelle,  when you're talking about the debt, the one thing that's on your mind is  the amount of supply coming in Treasury.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And also, look who buys them, central bankers are the biggest  buyers of our debt and it worries that we're sort of fighting with them on  other issues.  What if China decides to use how they behave the next  Treasury auction as a -- as a weapon. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  $769 billion in Treasury up for auction over what period of  time?  I'm reading an e-mail Mitch since --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  (INAUDIBLE) your head.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, when is it coming on?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I think it's over the next year.  I think that according to the  Journal but we can double check that.  But that's a big chunk of treasuries  that are up for sale and we could see rates go up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I -- when people always point to Japan and a slow interest  rates I'm like, \"Yes.\"  But Japan's kind of been in a recession for the  last 30 years on and off.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Since the 80s.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like we don't -- yes, since the late 80s.  We kind of hope that  we're not Japan.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Don't use -- don't use Japan as the benchmark please.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Coming up, death and  destruction as an earthquake rocks the popular Indonesian resort island.   More than 80 people dead.  Officials expect that death toll to rise.  </p><p>And another black eye for Wells Fargo, hundreds of people plunged into  foreclosure unfairly because of a software glitch.  The new fallout ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A deadly powerful earthquake striking a tourist island in  Indonesia.  Kristina Partsinevelos has the details.  Good morning Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   And that's right Dagen, at least 91 have been killed after a 7.0 magnitude  earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Lombok, hundreds have been  injured and thousands displaced as tourists flees the popular island.</p><p>The death toll is expected to rise as search and rescue teams expand their  efforts.  And they can't get a break because that area was still recovering  from a deadly 6.4 magnitude earthquake that hit last week.  </p><p>Goldman Sachs set to name a new co-head of its trading operation, the Wall  Street Journal says Jim Esposito will be tapped for the position.  The  newspaper says the move follows months of leadership on certainty in  Goldman's largest division.  </p><p>Goldman's incoming CEO David Sullivan reportedly could make an announcement  this morning.

Tom Cruise came out on top.  His  new film Mission Impossible Fallout hanging on to the number one spot for  the week, the second eek in a row breaking in an estimated $35 million.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Disney's Christopher Robin fell short of expectations earning  $25 million in its opening weekend.

Have you guys any of you seen these movies over the weekend?  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well you did -- did you, Mike Baker?</p><p>BAKER:  Christopher Robin.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You did?</p><p>CARTER:  You did?</p><p>BAKER:  Well I got three little kids.  It looks like I'm going to see  Winnie the Pooh.  Winnie the Pooh by the way in a real fight would kick Tom  Cruise's ass.  I don't know if I could say that but I just did.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You just said that.</p><p>BAKER:  I just did.  Sorry.  There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, why would -- I would put my money on Eeyore versus Tom  Cruise.</p><p>BAKER:  Well, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Eeyore is my spirit animal.</p><p>CARTER:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BAKER:  Here we go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Slow and grumpy morning, noon, and night grumpy.  Eeyore's in  it, isn't he?</p><p>BAKER:  You know, it's --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Don't ruin it for us.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes, I won't -- I won't tell you how it ends, let me just put it  that way.  Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Does he get the honey jar off his nose though?</p><p>BAKER:  If you got kids, who can't like Winnie the Pooh, come on?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Would you pay to see Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible?</p><p>BAKER:  No.  No.  But if Damon makes another Bourne movie, I'm there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.</p><p>BAKER:  All right. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So Bourne over Mission Impossible.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  I'm coming with you on that Mike Baker.  But I --  you frighten so, of course, I will --</p><p>BAKER:  I'm sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, a new crisis for Wells Fargo, hundreds of people  looking to save their homes are forced into foreclosure because of a  computer glitch.  The latest woes for Wells ahead.</p><p>And move to Italy and eat Nutella all day long, details on what some called  the world's yummiest jobs next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wells Fargo under fire again, hundreds of people losing their  homes due to a computer glitch.  Gerri Willis, you can't make it up.</p><p>WILLIS:  Here we go again, you got that right Dagen.  Wells Fargo admitting  to a glitch that led to hundreds of home for closures.  </p><p>Now the bank says that a calculation error led to as many as 400 struggling  home owners needlessly losing their homes to foreclosure, the culprit, a  modification tool online that wrongly factored lawyer's fees into a formula  that calculated government mortgages system in the wake of a housing crash.</p><p>As many as 650 applicants were incorrectly denied modifications.  Now the  details of this in a regulatory filing by the bank, the company setting  aside $8 million in the second quarter to fix the problem which were works  out to about $20,000 per home owner.  But this isn't the first problem for  Wells snapped by a long shot.</p><p>Check out this timeline of troubles for the bank and I should say here, we  don't have everything in this timeline because you don't have time for  everything in this timeline.  A fake account scandal revealed in September  of 2016, the SEC investigation of that account scandal in which bank  employees open accounts customers didn't need and didn't want in return for  bonuses.</p><p>But it wasn't just the consumer banking business an issue.  In July 2017,  allegations said the bank had properly sold auto insurance.  That same year  the bank was also accused of selling dangerous investments to brokerage  clients.  </p><p>The bank has been fined $1 billion for the -- from the CFPB for mortgage  abuses but the list of troubles goes on in nearly every line of businesses  seems to me including F.X., no matter where work -- look, whether the bank  was dealing with consumers or was dealing with their -- with their  institutional clients, big problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lee, how did they handle it in terms of messaging because this  just stinks to high heaven?</p><p>CARTER:  You know, I think that for the most part they've done a pretty  good job considering the magnitude of the problems that they've had.  Now,  the question I always have when you -- when you -- no matter how or who you  message, the more scandals that happen, trust the road.</p><p>Like you've got to get it all out at some point.  I think this is going to  be -- this of all of the problems I think is going to hurt.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I think these and other stories are going to be rallying  cry perhaps in the midterms around the deregulatory push that the  administration has and this is the reason why you have regulations in the  eyes of people who are in favor in regulations.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well I mean -- look, they have tried to set the record straight  here and move beyond it.  And what's interesting to me Dagen, I know you  watch this story very closely is that people haven't run away.</p><p>You know, the consumer is not gone from Wells Fargo.  I mean, that's' where  you would expect the pedal to really hit the metal as people see these  headlines, that consumers would take their accounts elsewhere.  We've some  of that but not a ton of that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's inertia, that's part of it.  But if -- in terms of big  banks, they're just not that many in the country.  But will you see people  turning to these smaller community banks because they are everywhere.   You're raising your hands.</p><p>BAKER:  I'll put my -- I'll put my hand up because I'm one of those people  that moved.  We were --</p><p>CARTER:  Really?</p><p>BAKER:  -- with Wells Fargo for a long time and we went through that  process.  I can tell you what I think one of the reasons why people don't  do it is because it's painful.  But you -- you -- there's a lot of work  involved and you're busy doing everything else in your day, right?</p><p>So all of a sudden you got to move your finances to a new institution.  So  -- but we did because after a while we just got fed up.</p><p>WILLIS:  Well -- and you know look, this is going to go on, people are  going to continue to watch this.  The fees are still piling up.  I  mentioned the $1 billion from the CFPB, but they've got lots of other fines  as well.  And you better bet after this news they're going to have mre.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I was thinking lawsuits.  That --</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- you kick people out of their homes unfairly, the trial  lawyers are running up.  </p><p>WILLIS:  They make people sign those agreements though to arbitrate.  So  that's one way they've stayed out of trouble in courthouses across the  country.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  Good point.  Good point.  Did you move your business  accounts too from Wells Fargo?</p><p>BAKER:  No.  No.  The long-time personal finances, but I have businesses  elsewhere, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But not at Wells Fargo?</p><p>BAKER:  That's a national security issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gerri, great -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gerri Willis.

It took me a  couple of days to figure out what the X's meant.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, it just makes a statement.</p><p>TARLOV:  Oh, it definitely does.  And picked them Socialists with the  wilting flowers, it's interesting when you see these trends happen like  that.  I think it's a very serious issue that we certainly should be  talking about.  I think there's a difference between what went on with Alex  Jones and what went on with Candace Owens.  </p><p>Here, they certainly made a mistake, and obviously, their algorithms picked  up what Candace was doing and she was making a point that I think does need  to be made about Sarah Jones' tweets, which apparently go back to 2012,  even it wasn't just the latest rash.  </p><p>As for Alex Jones, I don't know if you saw last week, that he's actually  suing parents whose child died in Sandy Hook for a hundred thousand dollars  to cover -- help him cover legal fees.  That family was forced to move six  or seven times, because of the fact that Alex Jones was not only spreading  lies at them.</p><p>You know, he said that they were actor -- child actors there, but releasing  information as to where they lived so they haven't been safe and they've  been moving with their daughter who's the same age, she was a twin with  their son that died.  So, there's a little bit of a difference there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I think that very often when you see companies shutting down  a podcast like with Apple and what Facebook did, Matt, it's -- they are  covering their you-know-whats because of legal liability.  </p><p>In some instances, that's my go-to thought, but I will say in terms of the  treatment of Conservatives, broadly speaking, looking at the Candace Owens  situation, it actually fuels the Trump base because they do feel like  they're being silenced and it actually makes them more -- I was talking to  Lee Carter and Lee's going to get into this as the show moves on.  </p><p>But, you look at -- she was testing these rallies and people are more  devoted to Trump than ever before.  What say you, Matt?</p><p>MATT BRAYNARD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LOOK AHEAD AMERICA:  Yes, I think the  real question here is, like, who's going to be next, because at least in  Alex Jones' case, the language that they used was that, you know, it was  hate speech.  And that's a very broad term and it's not really clear on any  given day what that means to these tech companies.</p><p>It's important to remember that the personnel is policy and stacked from  the bottom to the top of the corporate leadership.  Department heads of all  these tech companies, they are hard-core leftists.  </p><p>And if this is just the first example of them censoring somebody or going  after somebody, it just makes me wonder who is next, whose unfavorable  opinions will be targeted next for de-platforming by Apple or anyone of  these larger -- other large social media companies and will people who  opposed go immigration or question the latest on gender politics or pro- lifers.  </p><p>I mean, at what point does it cross that \"hate speech\" line, especially  relying on far left-organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center  to  define exactly what hate speech is, which includes this network here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Matt, what I'm saying is that, actually, that the outrage  at the social media sites is actually -- it's somehow in an upside down  world.  It works to the candidates' benefit.  It works to President Trump's  benefit.  </p><p>The laziness of many people on television media because it's just -- it's  easier to accuse President Trump of having lost his mind or being deranged  or being mentally ill, than to actually do policy work and understand, say,  his trade policy.</p><p>What I'm saying is the outrage generated by these social media platforms in  trying to censor Conservatives.  It actually whips up the base.</p><p>BRAYNARD:  I can see that there is definitely some pushback.  And when you  -- when these stories come out, it certainly does make people much more  skeptical of these large hegemonies of technology.  But it does concern us,  though, that they are essentially removing platform.  </p><p>The platform in many cases of funding and in the cases of Google, for  removing advertising options for right-wing Conservative voices, patriotic  voices, along with -- </p><p>You know, just deleting podcast, whole cell, not particular ones, but the  entire podcast series of Alex Jones.  And not to defend him but it does --  it is a troubling sign, as if there's no appeal in Facebook or Twitter  takes away your account or blocks you.  There's no remedy, you're just  stuck with it and because you have just a --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  With the podcast, you can deliver your own podcast and you can  still download -- like there are myriad podcast apps that you can use to  listen to a podcast.  It doesn't -- it might -- being on Apple's platform,  it does generate listeners.  </p><p>But I just want to make that point that if you can put it up on website and  people can listen to and watch what you put out there, because quite  frankly, the first amendment.</p><p>But I want to switch gears to Senator Elizabeth Warren, fuelling rumors,  Jessica Tarlov, over a 2020 run, this is over the weekend, here is what she  had to say, she's not afraid to be the underdog.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  It won't be easy.  We are going  to have to fight uphill.  But me, I'm going up that hill and I hope you are  too.  And I hope that when you do, you'll reach your hand out and bring  someone else along for the climb.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jessica, that was the Netroots conference, down in New Orleans,  I know you were glued to the internet watching those -- watching those --</p><p>TARLOV:  I didn't go out all weekend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a lot of slogan there, but what about policy?</p><p>TARLOV:  Well, she certainly has a set of policies and they're very aligned  with Bernie Sanders' policies and the Dems Socialist line, you can listen  to Cynthia Nixon, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance.  You can hear  what Elizabeth Warren is all about, and frankly, she has been incredibly  vocal for a long time now.  </p><p>And you do know what she stands for.  The Democrats feel, that I think the  most I've seen is a list of about 35, it is wide.  Apparently, Joe Biden is  the leader right now, in most of the polling, that seems -- I really do  love Joe Biden, but it feels like we need a fresher face, someone that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let me just be blunt, how excited are the Democrats about  running an old-white guy?</p><p>TARLOV:  I -- not great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He would appeal to some of the same base that President Trump  does, mid-Western grit --</p><p>TARLOV:  And Obama's base as well.  He is utterly beloved in the party, and  actually, a lot of Republicans are a fan of him, as well, you can't deny  what kind of great person he is.  I think age is an issue whether you're a  man or a woman, going into this primary, I think, will you see Kamala  Harris taking a more prominent role, really putting herself out there, I  think she'll be there.  </p><p>I'm really interested to see President Obama has been meeting with a lot of  big-city mayors, I wonder where that'll go.  I don't think Eric Garcetti or  Mitch Landrieu will be our nominee, but I certainly to counter the  businessman president, to have someone with executive experience, I think,  is worthwhile.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here, I'm going to go out on a limb and say, one individual  who's not going to run for the presidency, would be Rahm Emanuel --</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  in terms of mayors in the city of Chicago, and he can't even --  and he can't even stop the death toll from rising from gun violence, we saw  that over the weekend.  Matt, your reaction to that, because Jessica did  mention, age is an issue in terms of the Democrats, but then, everybody  seems to turn their attention to Alexandria --</p><p>TARLOV:  Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ocasio-Cortez, thank you very much, who brags about having an  economics degree, but doesn't know how the unemployment rate is calculated.</p><p>BRAYNARD:  Yes.  I think that throwing names out like Joe Biden and Liz  Warren, is just a sign of weakness of the field.  They really don't have  any strong candidates.  And honestly, for them to suggest Liz Warren as a  credible candidate, somebody whose name we would never know had she not  lied about her ethnicity to go --</p><p>TARLOV:  Matt --</p><p>BRAYNARD:  It's just a sign of pure weakness on their part.  And I would  love to be throwing the briar patch of running a general election against  Liz Warren, but i don't think the Democratic Party is even that suicidal.   But I could be wrong.</p><p>TARLOV:  Well, I don't know if it's suicidal, you are wrong, and you are  also wrong about Liz Warren's name only being related to the fact that she  \"lied about her--</p><p>BRAYNARD:  She was --</p><p>TARLOV:  Listen.</p><p>BRAYNARD:  She got a job at Harvard because of that and that allowed her to  run to the senate in Massachusetts.</p><p>TARLOV:  This is a whole other segment that we should have, I think that's  incredibly irresponsible thing to say.</p><p>BRAYNARD:  I don't think we can bring up Liz Warren without -- it's the  truth.  I mean, I don't think we can -- I don't think we can let that  slide.  I mean, it's --</p><p>TARLOV:  I know that's the kind of campaign that you would run and if, you  know, work for President Trump, again, I'm sure you'll be out there on the  front lines doing something like that.  I just don't think it's responsible</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will weigh in on something, since this is a business show,  this is -- since this is a business show, I will weigh in on something that  I hear more and more from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I want to get her name  right, and Bernie Sanders and even Elizabeth Warren, Medicare for all.</p><p>TARLOV:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So we now know how much that's going to cost.</p><p>TARLOV:  30 trillion, thirty-two.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, almost $33 trillion over just the first 10 years.  You  would need to double what the federal government collects in individual and  corporate taxes to pay for it, and it still wouldn't cover the cost of it.</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And this is Medicare, is going broke in eight years.  Medicare,  the hospital trust fund is broke in eight years.  We haven't fixed it,  nobody talks about fixing it, but now, we're talk about Medicare for all.   I mean, it's a great tag line, Jessica --</p><p>TARLOV:  Of course, it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there's no plan to pay for it.</p><p>TARLOV:  Well, I'm sure they will get to you.  Bernie Sanders has been out  there, pumping it up.  I think there was report from the Cato Institute  about Medicare for all, conversations with the Koch brothers.  Listen, I  think that that interview with Trevor Noah was disastrous.  </p><p>For the Dems Socialist platform, there is now Medicare for all caucus, but  if you look at races like Ohio, tomorrow, for instance, special election  there.  Danny O'Connor is out there saying, not going to work, let's fix  Obamacare, which is exactly where Democrats should be, going into the 2018  election and making smart decisions.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let me -- we'll get into that, Jessica, because actually,  we got such good news on those premium increases.  The premium increases  that we've heard about in some states last week are lower than they've been  in recent years.  The premium increases in the Obamacare plans, they're  actually falling in some areas.</p><p>TARLOV:  Well, Obamacare has lowered the cost of healthcare across the  country in terms of the rate at which -- the rate at which healthcare costs  are increasing, lowered under President Obama, fact-check me, all day, on  that, Matt.</p><p>BRAYNARD:  Oh, yes.  The cost totally dropped, just as he promised they  would, dropped by an average of $2,500 per family, which he promised,  absolutely not, they continue to increase.  And just having you repeat  that, it's almost like getting banned on Twitter, it just excites  Conservatives more because --</p><p>TARLOV:  Conservatives hate me anyway.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Matt -- but Matt --</p><p>BRAYNARD:  I don't think they know who you are.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  my point in bringing up the lower increases in premiums by some  insurers in Obamacare plans, that benefits the Conservatives who failed the  Republicans, who fail to really fix Obamacare, except for the fact that  they repealed the individual mandate and the Trump administration through  rule-making, has opened the door for shorter-term health plans.</p><p>So I'm saying that that actually benefits Republicans, particularly those  in the Senate, who fail to get through the repeal and replace that passed  in the House, final word?</p><p>BRAYNARD:  Yes, I just want to say, I think, you're right there.  It will  be helpful but ultimately, what's important is the fact that healthcare  costs can be offset by the fact that there are more Americans employed more  than ever.  </p><p>The economy is growing faster than it ever has, in a long time, and a lot  of that credit goes to the President, and that's going to go down the  ticket when people decide who to vote for this November and perhaps,  tomorrow, on the special election.</p><p>TARLOV:  Healthcare issue, number one, in a lot of races, special elections  and primaries, Democrats are slaying on the healthcare issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will add this, I sat on this set with Kellyanne Conway right  when she joined the Trump campaign and the Hillary Clinton campaign  underestimated how much that would impact who people voted for that  November, and so the Republicans should not underestimate it in this  midterm election.  Jessica Tarlov, Matt Braynard, thank you both.</p><p>TARLOV:  Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Coming up, the California wildfires take on epic new  proportions as one blaze nearly doubles in size, we have the latest.  And  Samsung's new Galaxy Note 9, details are leaked from an interesting source,  more on that, in minutes.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of the world's greatest chefs has passed away.  Kristina  Partsinevelos has the details, Kristina?  </p><p>KRISTINA PATSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Dagen, Joel Robuchon  was named the -- the \"chef of the century\" by the famous French restaurant  guide Gault Millau in 1990.  He was known for mashed potatoes among other  dishes and had open restaurants in cities across the globe including Paris,  Monaco, Hong Kong, Las Vegas, Tokyo and New York.  His restaurants  currently hold a record of 32 Michelin stars; he also mentored numerous  other chefs such as T.V. personality: Gordon Ramsey.  Robuchon died at 73  after a long battle well cancer.  </p><p>And fans are also remembering Charlotte Rae actress best known as Mrs.  Garrett on the long-running sitcom, \"The Facts of Life\" has died.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CHARLOTTE RAE, ACTRESS:  I have to get going.  I got to make the bed, back  in the rug, do the laundry, scrub the floors, clean the windows, everything  has got to be perfect.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Her family says, she died peacefully in her home in Los  Angeles yesterday.  The cause of her death has not been released but last  year she did reveal she had been diagnosed with bone cancer.  The Tony and  Emmy-nominated actress' career spent six decades.  Charlotte Rae was 92  years old.  </p><p>And catastrophic wildfires continue to ravage California with one doubling  in size over the weekend, making it the fourth largest wild fire in state  history.  There are now a total of 17 fires burning across the state  claiming the lives of seven people and destroying thousands of acres.   Meanwhile, President Trump has declared a state of emergency in California  ordering federal funding to help with the recovery efforts but he also  tweeted: \"California wildfires are being magnified and made so much worse  by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amounts of  readily available water to be properly utilized.  It is being divert into  the Pacific Ocean.  Must also treat clear to stop fire spreading.\"  </p><p>And on a lighter note, we'll switch over to Nutella.  If you love Nutella,  then you're about to discover your dream job.  The Ferrero company, maker  of Nutella and Ferrero Rocher chocolates is looking for 60 sensory judges  who will get paid to taste its product after, of course, you need a three- month rigorous training course.  40 of the 60 people will go on to become  testers.  But there's a catch, you have to be willing to relocate to  Ferrero's headquarters in Alba, Italy.  So, I don't think this is too bad  of a gig.  What do you think, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I defer to my baker on that.  And thank you for the Joel  Robuchon --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  I don't know why I said it like that.  I know -- it just  came out naturally, I'm sorry.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, he's French.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  He is French.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you have to say it -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  And then I was going to say -- I don't know, I was just on  a roll there, just going back.  Quebec French.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll take it any day.  Nutella taster?  </p><p>BAKER:  Turn it into a reality show, right?  40 of the 60 contestants get  to on to become actual testers.  You got a three-months training.  This is  ready made.  You know, reality T.V. is all about finding something that's  already happening and throw in cameras in front of it.  So, that's what I'm  saying and, and otherwise I'm not a big fan of Nutella, what can I say?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because something is deeply wrong with you.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Warren Buffett becomes one of biggest winners as  Apple hits $1 trillion in market value.  After the magical milestone,  everyone has predictions for the tech giant's next move.  We take a closer  look next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Samsung's new Galaxy Note 9 launches on Thursday and the details  are being leaked by Samsung.  The box with the device was spotted at  Russian store revealing a 6.4-inch display, a dual rear camera with 12  mega-pixels, and an 8 mega-pixels front selfie camera.  As previously  reported, the note's pen will have remote-control type functionality.  </p><p>Meantime, Apple making investors happy after becoming the world's first $1  trillion company last week.  One of the winners is Warren Buffett who  (INAUDIBLE) are half way owned to five percent stake in Apple, now worth  nearly $50 billion.  Joining me now, CFRA Senior Equity Analyst, Angelo  Zino.  Angelo, Buffett usually shies away from tech stocks.  This is a  winner for him and also, what do you make about the Samsung phone given  Apple a run for its money.  </p><p>ANGELO ZINO, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, CFRA:  Yes, absolutely.  So, you know,  in terms of Samsung and these leaks going on, you wonder if there're  really, you know, leaks because, you know, at this point in time we  continue to see the stuff -- you know, ahead of these launches, you know,  year in and year out.  But that being said, I mean, when we look at kind of  some of the details of the event coming here on Thursday, little that, you  know, really gets us excited on the front of Samsung.  </p><p>That being said, as far as Apple is concerned -- I mean, the results last  week were absolutely spectacular.  Looking at Warren Buffett here, I mean,  I think he continues to kind of cement and put kind of the cherry on the  top as far as Apple is concerned.  Him being the third largest investor  there.  He is just naturally going to continue to up his stake just via the  buybacks you see from Apple here.  But, you know, all in all, we continue  to believe cash is king and Apple is here to stay with this trillion-dollar  valuation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I think Warren Buffett -- this is about Apple and not  Buffett.  Buffett is like a molt to a flame in terms of seeking media  attention.  He's going to glom onto Apple's success.  I'm not dismissing  the fact that he has stake in Apple, but again, this is Apple's story not  Buffet's story.  </p><p>BAKER:  No question.  Angelo, just take a look at Apple for a second,  what's next?  So, we're talking about Samsung, and that's just more product  innovation.  Is there around product innovation?  Do they stay with the  customer space, do they branch out the way Amazon has in terms of having  cloud business which is really a business to business, business?  </p><p>ZINO:  Yes.  So, when we look at Apple here, it's funny because most people  look at Apple and they say, hey, this is a one-hit wonder kind of company,  it's the iPhone and that's it.  And, you know, we continue to believe when  we look at Apple the next step forward for them continues to be on the  wearable side; that grew 60 percent year over year.  We expect something  along the lines of augmented reality glasses by 2020.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because that was such a winner for Google.  Those Google glass - - died on the vine.  </p><p>ZINO:  Right.  But, you know, we do think Apple is going to do a lot  better.  We're going to have 5D eventually roll out.  We think the  capability of 5D along with these A.R. glasses will be a big hit for Apple  over time.  I think also, of course, that service's business which grew  north of 30 percent as they shift toward more kind of subscription-based  offerings, I think that's the model for Apple.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Angelo good to see you, Angelo Zino, take care.  Still ahead,  it's National Root Beer Float Day.  We're raising a glass to this American  classic, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

Why isn't the go-to Alice?</p><p>CARTER:  How about Alice?</p><p>To our top story this hour, trade tensions.  China state media equating  U.S.-imposed tariffs to, quote, \"extortion\", as the U.S. plans to tax an  additional $16 billion worth of goods.  President Trump promising to stay  the course on his trade plans.</p><p>We don't have that sound.</p><p>Tennessee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann is here.  He's also on the House  Appropriations Committee.  Congressman -- China, in part, calling Trump's  trade plans a street fighter style, deceitful drama of extortion and  intimidation.  What are your thoughts?  </p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Well, I think that's unduly harsh  rhetoric on the part of the Chinese but let's face it, President Trump has  had a tremendous impact on this entire trade debate and I think he's  winning.</p><p>He's had an effect on the Chinese, on the Chinese markets.  And President  Trump wants to protect our intellectual property and he wants us to win.</p><p>So in a nutshell, I didn't expect them to remain silent.  This is an  ongoing negotiation process and it will play itself out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Trump raves confident on tariffs over the weekend.  He was not  only talking about them in a rally, he was also tweeting this --  Congressman.  \"Tariffs are working big time.  Every country on earth wants  to take wealth out of the United States always to our detriment.  I say as  they come, tax them.  If they don't want to be taxed, let them make or  build the product in the U.S.  In either event it means jobs and great  wealth.</p><p>Because of tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of  the $21 trillion in debt that's been accumulated, much by the Obama  administration, while at the same time reducing taxes for our people.  At  minimum, we will make much better trade deals for our country.\"</p><p>Congressman -- what I find astonishing about that is a tariff is a tax.   It's a tax ultimately if that is passed on to the U.S. consumer, which it's  already starting to happen whether it's Coca-Cola or Polaris or Winnebago  raising prices.  So how astonishing is it that you have a Republican  bragging about tax increases?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, let me say this.  I have long been a strong proponent  supporter of free trade.  My great state, Tennessee, has benefited in the  agricultural sector, in the manufacturing sector from free trade.  I think  we have to look at every arsenal in the toolbox.</p><p>I've never really been a fan of tariffs.  I think there are other ways to  go.  However, the President has felt that in a country by country, region  by region area, he has to look at this.</p><p>This is a negotiation process.  Let's face it.  I think the President's  goal ultimately is to remove tariffs everywhere.  That's what we want to  see.</p><p>Some countries, particularly China, have put up such burdensome tariffs and  they basically stack the deck; and the imbalance, the trade imbalance  short-term and long-term, has been so difficult.</p><p>So it's a process.  It's an ongoing process.  Let's hope we get to where we  were with the E.U. where both sides say let's work towards a system where  ultimately all tariffs go away.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The U.S. meantime is pushing for stronger penalties against  hackers who disrupt the electrical grid -- Department of Homeland Security  Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen emphasizing infrastructure's greatest threat.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  The biggest threat in my  mind is if we don't partner.  So what we see the adversaries doing is  they're crowd sourcing.  So they're using bots.  They're using paid  influencers.  They're using their governments.  They're using anyone and  everyone that can attack us.  So the biggest threat is if we don't work  together to counter that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- I want to get your reaction and then I'm going to  get Mike Baker in here.  But again -- this is a long time coming.  And  quite frankly those in Washington have been turning a blind eye to  basically threatening behavior in terms of putting our electrical grid at  risk from the likes of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, I'm privileged to serve on the House Appropriations  Committee and specifically on the Homeland Security Subcommittee on  Appropriations.  And we have had robust funding to fight cyber security or  to support fighting the attacks by foreign nations on our cyber security  system.</p><p>Let's face it.  Cyber security is national security.  With all of our  technological advances, and they've been outstanding, it has still made us  vulnerable to attack.</p><p>So House Republicans have done their job.  The administration is doing its  job.  But this is an all-out cyber security war.  We've got to defend our  grid.  We've got to defend our property.  And cyber security is very  critically important and there are a lot of bad actors engaging in this.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Mike -- they talk in Washington but they don't walk.  They  don't step, they don't get off their -- and do something about it.  This  has been going on for years.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Congressman -- Mike Baker here.  If I could just say a couple  of things.  I think we're really late to the game on this one.  It's been  well over a decade that you could ask anybody in the intel security  community, you know, what keeps them up at night.  And it would be an  attack on the power grid.</p><p>The power grid basically is the east grid, the west grid and Texas.  Texas  gets its own grid.  And it's a patchwork quilt.  But we've known, there  have been major assessments and studies, we've known for a long time that  this has been a problem and that state sponsored elements and others  hostile to us have been mapping and probing and targeting and looking at  the grid.</p><p>So I guess a couple of questions.  One, you know, why now instead of quite  some time ago hasn't this become a priority?  And I know that things happen  off the radar screen and we don't see what's going on oftentimes up on  Capitol Hill.</p><p>But do you think we've been late to the game?  And is this something we can  actually get bipartisan support on?  And is there money to resolve this?   The grid was never set up to withstand a physical or a cyber attack.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  There is tremendous bipartisan support for cyber security,  there's no question about that.  We've seen that with the votes on the  funding.  I want to commend the administration.  President Trump and Vice  President Pence have set up a special commission to deal with this.  So  there is a prioritization.</p><p>I would say this.  There is so much that goes on in the classified space,  there are protections out there fortunately that we've been working on a  long time.</p><p>However, it moves.  This is something that is not static.  Our enemies that  would engage in cyber security attacks are always changing.  So what is  good to protect today is not necessarily going to be good tomorrow.</p><p>So we've got to be vigilant, diligent.  We've got to put the dollars up to  defend against this.  Do we need to do a better job?  Absolutely.  Are we  addressing this in a bipartisan, bicameral and executive way?  Yes, I think  so.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- thank you for being here.  Congressman Chuck  Fleischmann.  Much to talk about.  Thank you so much.</p><p>And breaking news to bring you -- </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- from Pepsi.  The soft drink giant says Indra Nooyi will step  aside as the CEO after 12 years at the helm.  She will be replaced by  current president Ramon Laguarta on October 3rd.  Nooyi will stay on as  chairman until early 2019.  That stock edging lower on the news.</p><p>Mitch Roschelle -- if you have reaction also, Lee in terms of she being one  of the most prominent female corporate leaders in the world.  And again,  this seems to be a very well thought-out transition.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, it's interesting that it's a global business with all of  the globalization that's going on right now.  So whoever is taking over is  going to have some challenges.  Think about all of the trade talks that are  going on right now.  These are the types of consumer business that are  often impacted by trade.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because of the steel and aluminum prices.  I mentioned Coca-Cola  is raising prices because its materials cost have gone up.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  I think it's been a fascinating journey that she's had to see -- I  mean the soft drink business has really been under such attack and really  people -- it's not the business of the future.  But she really diversified  their portfolio and really started into food, had some great vision on what  it meant to have social value incorporated into the business with the  performance of purpose.  It's really going to be interesting to see what  her legacy is going to be now moving forward as this transition happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They've gotten into like the fizzy water business as well.   Pepsi has this.  And it's become kind of omnipresent in any story you go  into, they have this -- it's basically seltzer water.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's called bubbly.  But again that is one of the -- I would say  one of the hardest businesses to manage.  </p><p>CARTER:  Unbelievable.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, it is.  Unbelievable run at Pepsi.  So Indra Nooyi is  stepping down as the CEO.  Ramon Laguarta, the President of Pepsi will be  taking the top job.</p><p>Coming up, six arrested in an attempt on the Venezuelan president's life.   People there are bracing for massive crackdowns on anyone who opposes  Maduro.  More on the turmoil ahead.</p><p>Plus, a fight with that shake -- another brawl on the menu at McDonald's,  this time in Illinois.  We have the shocking footage, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Welcome back  to MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  I'm Kristina Partsinevelos.</p><p>There are fears of a crackdown on dissidents in Venezuela after a failed  attempt to assassinate President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.  Two  drones carrying explosives were detonated as Maduro spoke at a military  parade in Caracas on Saturday.  He was not injured but critics warned that  the socialist leader could use the attack as an excuse to threaten his  opponents.  Six people are under arrest and that number reportedly could  grow.  </p><p>National security adviser John Bolton on \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" denied any U.S.  government involvement.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  If the government of Venezuela has  hard information that they want to present to us that would show a  potential violation of U.S. criminal law, we'll take a serious look at it.   But in the meantime, I think what we really should focus on is the  corruption and the oppression of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Venezuela's economy is in chaos with inflation expected to  hit 1 million percent this year.</p><p>And a brawl breaking out at a McDonald's restaurant in Illinois.  The video  shows two women grabbing and punching each other behind the counter and a  female employee trying to remove a man from the work area.</p><p>This comes just weeks after a fight at a McDonald's branch in Nevada went  viral.  That video showed another female employee beating a woman who  reportedly threw a milkshake at her.</p><p>And since we want to stick with drinks, it's a perfect hot day in New York  City right now and across the country but it's also national root beer  float day.  We celebrate the refreshing mixture of vanilla ice cream and  root beer and A&amp;W restaurants nationwide are making the treats even tastier  -- we're going to try that out -- by giving them away today.  During the  celebration A&amp;W's restaurants nationwide will also raise money for disabled  American veterans.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I get a hell yes -- Mike Baker.  It's ice cream and root  beer and I'm guessing that -- </p><p>BAKER:  Dagen's gone right into the jug.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  NO.  But they put the jug in front of me because well, I'm a  hillbilly. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And so it evokes moonshine.  Not moonshine but it is root beer.   And I love root beer.  Are you going to have some of that?</p><p>BAKER:  It takes you back to your childhood, right.  You can't have a root  beer float without thinking what it was like when you were a kid.  </p><p>CARTER:  So true -- my great grandmother.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Trivia -- what does A&amp;W stand for?  </p><p>BAKER:  Oh, I knew that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Awesome and wonderful?  I don't know.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Allen and Wright.  I only -- I Googled -- </p><p>BAKER:  That's going to be -- that's going to be like question 14 on HQ.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So for -- I love root beer.  </p><p>CARTER:  It's so good.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  This is great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's a little tip because I'm full of useless facts.  There is  a drive-in in Bethel, Connecticut called The Sycamore and they make their  own root beer.  It's an old school drive-in.  They have like classic car  night on the weekend.  So go to -- for national root beer day, if you're  not near an A&amp;W, go The Sycamore in Bethel, Connecticut.  It's awesome.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  You know what you just did.  You've got to finish that whole  jug now.  Nobody else can drink out of that.  </p><p>BAKER:  That's your jug.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love root beer.  </p><p>BAKER:  It might get a little burpy around here later on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're going to make -- Mike is always -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  And there's ice cream in here, you know.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  That's the best part.  I'm going for more ice cream.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike is always watching his figure.  So I'm going to make him  drink that whole float.  By the way, if you don't have any ice cream, you  can always drink soda and milk together.  </p><p>BAKER:  Interesting.  </p><p>CARTER:  You've done that?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Milk and Pepsi.  I digress.</p><p>BAKER:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you -- Kristina.</p><p>Coming up -- tough action on Iran.  The U.S. re-imposing sanctions on the  country warning the world about getting its oil and gas from Iran.  We'll  explain.</p><p>Plus Lance Bass loses out on buying the iconic house featured in \"The Brady  Bunch\".  Why he thinks there may have been some strings attached.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Trump administration set to re-impose the first batch of  sanctions against Iran today, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.   They're expected to hit Iran's purchase of precious metals, gold and the  U.S. dollar.  On top of that, we're now less than 90 days away from the  November deadline set by the White House for countries to stop importing  oil from Iran.</p><p>What will this mean for oil and gas prices here at home?</p><p>Joining me now Tom Kloza, global head of energy and analysis for the Oil  Price Information Service.  Tom -- always great to see you.</p><p>Has that yet played out, these coming sanctions on Iranian oil, has that  yet played out in the oil market?  </p><p>TOM KLOZA, GLOBAL HEAD OF ENERGY AND ANALYSIS, OIL PRICE INFORMATION  SERVICE:  No.  I think the next 90 to 100 days are about as unpredictable  as any 90 or 100 days we're going to have. </p><p>I mean on the one hand, you could have really, really tough implementation  of sanctions and you could see Iranian production drop from let's say 2.2  on the export side to 1.5 million or less.</p><p>On the other hand, you might have political awareness raising the prospect  of sales of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  So you could make  a case for 90.  You could make a case for 50.  It's going to be that kind  of a period.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What will you be watching for, Tom, as an indication of where  that might go?  Is there any news event that you're looking for?  Again, it  would be a release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve?  </p><p>KLOZA:  Right.  We'll be watching.  I mean if there's a relief from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve, ostensibly it would be to put pressure on  Iran.  But it also would probably be to relieve pressure for the midterm  elections.</p><p>If midterm elections take place and gas prices of $3 in a lot of the  districts which went heavily for Republicans, you could have SPR sales.  It  might look blatantly political but what doesn't these days.</p><p>So those are the two elements that really make it very, very unpredictable.   Without that, we would need an event to take gasoline prices much, much  higher in the next hundred days; an event like a tropical storm, a  hurricane, or as we sort of hinted to, you know, something in Venezuela  that descends them into utter chaos.</p><p>ROSCHELL:  Tom -- Mitch Roschelle.  If you strip out all the politics that  -- geopolitics that are driving oil prices up and just look at it sort of  over the long term, is it right for me to assume that it's costing more and  more money to produce oil?  And if you look at our labor shortages that we  have in the United States, it's hard to find that labor.   so is that a bit  of a head wind on prices going forward?  </p><p>KLOZA:  No, it's really not.  You know, if we had the pipeline capacity  from west Texas to the Gulf Coast, into the coast, we could be producing  probably a million or two million barrels a day more.  The problem is the  ability to take away the crude.</p><p>The cost of crude and actually finding crude, notwithstanding the fact that  you've got truck drivers that are making well over $100,000 -- that cost is  coming down.</p><p>There are lots of fields where you can break even at $35, and there's  really a lot of fields where you can break even at $55 to $65.  So if  prices remain high, and you get rid of that bottleneck of moving crude from  west Texas to Corpus or to Houston, you could really see crude oil prices  move higher.  It's not a matter of the underlying cost necessarily going  higher.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I always point out too is that these steel tariffs  that have been slapped on, virtually every company that doesn't use U.S.  steel, it hurts because some of these companies that want to build  pipelines out of the Permian Basin, those plans have been disrupted because  of these steel tariffs.</p><p>Mike Baker has a question for you -- Tom.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, Tom -- I'm going to throw geopolitics back into the mix.  How  important is China in your view when assessing potential impact of the  sanctions on Iran?  </p><p>KLOZA:  Well, I think China, you know, the chalk for China, to use a horse- racing theme, is that China is going to continue to import more oil from  Iran.  And that means they're going to import less oil from the United  States.  That's going to be collateral damage, so-to-speak.</p><p>But I can't imagine under any circumstances that we would have some sort of  a detente with China where they're not going to bring in Iranian oil.  To a  certain extent they're going to be a beneficiary of that because the price  will have to be discounted. </p><p>So, you know, oil is what we call fungible.  It can be moved around  different places.  But we'll see how hard we really impose the sanctions  and if oil production gets cut by a million barrels a day, and the economy,  the global economy keeps chugging, we could have much, much higher prices  in 2019.  That's the worry year.  It's an off election year but that's the  year I worry about.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, before you go, Tom -- last week President Trump  proposed that plan to roll back the Obama era gas fuel efficiency standards  on automobiles.  What's the impact going to be on oil and gasoline prices,  do you think?  </p><p>KLOZA:  Well, first of all, the impact is full employment for lawyers  because the lawyers are going to make a fortune on this, particularly in  California and 13 other states.  I think the impact is that it slows the  efficiency improvements in the fleet.</p><p>And I'm not a big fan of it.  I mean, you know, you see the ads where  somebody's driving a big SUV and picking up a calf or delivering a calf.   In the northeast, it's on long island and what would you pick up?  A pound  of veal or something like that.</p><p>I think we'd all benefit if we live a little bit less large and don't drive  pope mobiles and stuff.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's going to save potentially half a trillion dollars for  consumers because, again, ultimately the cost of these fuel efficiency  standards, big picture is I think we can agree on this being from the east,  rather than the left coast, is that California -- the Trump administration  is saying to California you're not driving national policy on automobile  fuel efficiency.  No more.  </p><p>KLOZA:  No.  California, though, has been kind of the laboratory for what's  going to happen in the rest of the country.  So, you know, the one thing  you have to say about California is their air quality has improved  immeasurably since the Clean Air Act.</p><p>So we'll see a little bit of it.  And you know, if you've ever been coming  from Connecticut or upstate New York and see the ozone sometimes in those  real hot days, there's a good reason for trying to get a little bit of the  emissions down in the northeast.  It used to be much worse but it's getting  a little better.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you -- Tom.  Tom Kloza -- as always.</p><p>Coming up, five people are killed after a small plane crashes into a  parking lot in Los Angeles.  More on the deadly accident ahead.</p><p>Plus some Senate Democrats getting on board for Supreme Court nominee,  Brett Kavanaugh.  Details on why they may be going from a slow walk to the  fast track, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday August 6th, your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p>China hitting back at President Trump.  A state-run newspaper calling the  president's tariffs extortion.  President Trump explaining the need for  increased tariffs over the weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They're charging us a 50  percent tariff.  We're charging them a 20 percent tariff.  Do you think  that's okay?  No, sir, it's really not.  We want free trade.  I said what's  free when they charge us and we can't charge them.  What is going on here?   What's going on here?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Investors keeping an eye on trade tensions, 21-point gain on the  Dow Futures right now.  So, investors continue to shrug off those trade  concerns.  That was the same case last week.  We got that jobs report, the  overall job number, the creation wasn't as high as people were expecting  but nonetheless with the revisions, 215,000 jobs have been created on this  country on average every month for the first seven months of the year.  And  we had the Dow and the S&amp;P last week up for their fifth week in a row.  </p><p>In Europe we have some buying to report, in England, France and Germany,  gains across the board.  The DAX in Germany up half of one percent.  </p><p>The markets ending mostly in the red in Asia Overnight.  The only winner  there, the four major markets, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong up half of one  percent.  </p><p>Tragedy in Santa Ana, a small plane crashing into a parking lot.  We have  the very latest.  </p><p>And changes at the top of Pepsi, Indra Nooyi is stepping down as the chief  executive officer.  She will stay on as chairman until early 2019.  She  will be replaced at Pepsi by President Ramon Laguarta on October the 3rd.  </p><p>Another big week for earnings, kicking off SeaWorld reporting mixed results  this morning, missing out on earnings but beating on revenue.  This  afternoon we hear from Marriott, Hertz, Etsy and many more.  But earnings  in this period are up more than 24 percent for the companies that already  have been reported.  </p><p>And here's the story of a house from T.V.  The Brady house, Brady Bunch  house is off the market.  Lance Bass of NSYNC tried to buy it.  You won't  believe what happened.  </p><p>Plus, busted, former linebacker Ray Lewis inducted into the Hall -- the  Football Hall of Fame this weekend.  Why the bust they gave him is really  turning heads, coming up.  </p><p>Because it doesn't look like him.  I don't even know who it looks like.   Doesn't look like Ray Lewis.  </p><p>First, to our top story this half hour, the confirmation of Brett  Kavanaugh, senate Democrats will meet with President Trump Supreme Court  nominee in the coming weeks.  Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer was  leading the charge to slow walk the confirmation process for Kavanaugh.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  Why did the president  pick Kavanaugh?  He knows that Kavanaugh more than any of the 25 will roll  over the rule of law and get the president off the legal hook that he may  well be on.  We will not rest until Brett Kavanaugh is defeated and the  American people win.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now a change of tune?  Schumer and several other Democrats  ending their holdout and scheduling meetings with the president's pick to  replace Anthony Kennedy on the high court.  </p><p>Joining me now, one of my favorite people on planet earth.  Fox News senior  judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Is this really a change of  heart?  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  No, it's a  change of tactics.  It's not a change of heart.  And it's interesting,  because the target of these new tactics is not any of the Democrats, its  Senator Rand Paul.  Because the Democrats discovered that Brett Kavanaugh  was instrumental in the creation of the Patriot Act and probably, they  don't know this, but they suspect because he was present in rendition and  the use of harsh interrogation techniques.  </p><p>If they find one memo from Brett Kavanaugh endorsing this stuff, Rand Paul  is off the table and he votes with the Democrats to oppose him.  That of  course will force Mitch McConnell then to get Republican votes.  So, that's  what I think their target is.  </p><p>Every single Democratic senator is going to say to him, why can't we see  your papers?  Elena Kagen who worked for Barack Obama, they caught up a  million of her papers when the Republicans want them.  Why can't we see  yours?  And he's probably going to say, you know what, the papers in that  in -- they might papers I wrote them but I don't have them.  The National  Archives has them, you're welcome to go and get them.  I really have  nothing to do with it.  </p><p>And probably nothing will change, unless they find that smoking gun that  will pry loose Rand Paul and maybe Mike Lee and John McCain.  We all know  where he is on torture and this type of thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, what I hear you saying is this Supreme Court nomination  isn't a layup at this point based on what you just said.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  If they find it.  If they don't find it, I think it is a  layup.  I think the president has chosen a nominee and pushed to that  nominee in such a way as to make him appealing to Democratic senators  running for reelection in states that the president won handily, like Joe  Manchin and your home state of West Virginia like Claire McCaskill and  Missouri.  Like senator Heidi Heitkamp in -- forgive me, North or South  Dakota, I forget which.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Heitkamp and then Joe Donnelly in Indiana.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Joe Manchin in West Virginia, those are the three who voted  for Neil Gorsuch.  SO, there is pressure on those three individuals.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know, I don't want to get too in the weeds.  But --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Please.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are very, very, very different.   Kavanaugh is straight from the establishment, big government, the president  is usually right, the police are usually right, the spies are not regulated  by the Fourth Amendment.  Gorsuch is not in that category.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Sorry.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Gorsuch is a lot closer to Justice Scalia on all of those  issues.  I say that with great difference.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I know.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Sitting next to me who risked his life to allow me to be able  to say that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What were -- what were you going to say? (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>CARTER:  I do think it's an important point because in addition to what you  were talking about they might find out.  You had talked about this last  week, about on Kavanaugh's position on privacy issues.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  And that could be something I think that could really sway  opinion, don't you?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It could very well sway some Republicans.  Judge Kavanaugh has  written that the government -- I'm holding up my iPhone, the government has  access to everything I have in here, without a warrant, as long as its  purposes are intelligence rather than law enforcement.  He has this very,  very narrow view of the Fourth Amendment.  The Fourth Amendment only  regulates the government's prying eyes when it wants information to  prosecute us with.  </p><p>Now, there is no Supreme Court case standing for that.  It's a very, very  minority opinion.  But it's an opinion that Republican senators need to  think twice about before they vote to favor him.  Because this could come  back to bite everybody.  We all put things in here that we expect the  government is not going to see unless it gets a search warrant.  A search  warrant requires probable cause, evidence under oath to a federal judge  demonstrating why what's in here is criminal not lurid and interesting to  them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, and it's not just Kavanaugh.  But that's the  reason Apple has created these phones, every generation of this phone Apple  can no longer open it.  </p><p>BAKER:  So they say.  </p><p>Apple has no way of opening this phone.  They say.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, so they say.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's no back door.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Didn't Comey go to some Israeli group to open up the iPhones  of those monsters in San Bernardino.  Because Apple wouldn't help them.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes, that was -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The FBI couldn't go in there.</p><p>BAKER:  That was -- that was the story.  Yes, that was the story.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's what the story.</p><p>BAKER:  And what the Apple say and they wouldn't help.  By the way, yes.  I  agree with you on (INAUDIBLE).  We all put things on this that we expect  the government will not access.  </p><p>I don't put anything on here without the belief that Amazon or Google or  somebody else is going to access it.  I assume everything I put on here,  some tech company has got access to somehow.  So, I'm not -- I'm not -- I  agree with you.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The Fourth Amendment -- the Fourth Amendment only regulates  the government.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It doesn't regulate the manufacturer.  </p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely, I don't disagree with that.  Given the importance of  this issue, don't you suspect -- you mentioned -- you know, the importance  of reviewing his papers.  Don't you imagine that they've already done that,  they've already accessed every paper that's out there and they're starting  to review it?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  According to the National Archives, which has the papers from  the Bush administration, the papers they're looking for is when he was a  young lawyer, working in the White House for President Bush.  Those  documents cannot be available until mid or late October.  Now, the goal is  -- </p><p>BAKER:  Because?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The time it takes to get them, I assume.  The goal of Senator  McConnell and the White House is to have Judge Kavanaugh on the court by  the first Monday in October when the Supreme Court reconvenes.  My guess  is, the Democrats are not going to get these papers and he probably will  pass by a narrow margin.  </p><p>CARTER:  I think it's going to be really interesting to see what this means  for the midterms.  Because if he -- if he gets in by October, I think  that's going to energize Democrats even more.  If he doesn't, I'm not sure,  I think that's going to energize Republicans even more.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I've always wanted to ask you this.  Is something -- to me,  it's in the weeds how you vote for a nominee to the Supreme Court.  Are the  basis animated by this?  The Supreme Court nomination to blue collar people  in Western Pennsylvania and Ohio who always voted Democrat and voted for  Trump last time around, do they take this into account when they decide who  to vote for congress in November?  </p><p>CARTER:  You know, I think that there are a large number of people who have  -- who have voted for our president, in large part just because of the  Supreme Court.  Because it's that important to those folks who are pro- life, who are concerned about the sanctity of marriage.  And for those  folks, they will likely vote because of the Supreme Court.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And --</p><p>CARTER:  And I think that's really -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not just only issues, it's also on immigration.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  OK.  Let me say --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's also on immigration, like upholding the travel ban.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I have problems with Judge Kavanaugh because of his view in  Fourth Amendment but he is pro-life.  He is pro-gun.  He is anti-the  regulatory state.  He presses a lot of buttons that conservatives and even  libertarians like I am like a lot.  </p><p>So, the question is, can you overcome his views on the Fourth Amendment?   Will he be forth coming and truthful in his views on the Fourth Amendment  when he's talking to a senator who he knows disagrees with him?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will see you on \"OUTNUMBERED\".  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dear fellow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  A lot of friend.

This dash cam video shows the plane spiraling  down into the Staples parking lot.  Look at that video.  </p><p>The crash site is about a mile away from an airport.  The pilot declared an  emergency shortly before the crash.  No one on the ground was hurt.  The  cause of the crash is still under investigation.  </p><p>Demi Lovato is breaking her silence since her drug overdose last month.   The star took to Instagram last night to thank her fans for their support.   I have always been transparent about my journey with addiction.  What I've  learned is that this illness os not something that disappears or fades with  time.  It is something I must continue to overcome and have not done yet.   I want to thank God for keeping me alive and well.  </p><p>Well that she was rushed to the hospital after allegedly requiring opioid  treatment drug Narcan.  Maria recently spoke to its inventor, Dr. Roger  Crystal.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ROGER CRYSTAL, CEO, OPIANT PHARMACEUTICALS:  What happened to Demi  Lovato, extremely unfortunate and really does depicts what happened -- is  happening now in this opioid crisis, which essentially is affecting all  Americans.  And what we're very fortunate for is that her friends  apparently were carrying the Narcan nasal spray and therefore were able to  revive her.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Reports in Lovato has agreed to enter rehab to combat her  growing problem with addiction.  </p><p>Lance Bass from NSYNC says he's heartbroken after he's lost his chance to  buy the house made famous in the Brady Bunch's T.V. show.  The former NSYNC  member posting this on Instagram.  Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.  I'm feeling  heartbroken today.  As many of you may have heard, we placed the winning  bid on the iconic Brady Bunch house, at least that's what we were told.  </p><p>The Bass' said a corporate buyer a Hollywood studio wanted the house at any  cost and he was discouraged by the seller's agent to submit a higher offer.   The singer claims he was used to drive up the price of the home and called  the incident shady.  </p><p>The property though went on the market last month for $1.88 million.  The  broker for the homes listing reportedly says the sale to Bass was never a  done deal.  </p><p>So what do you guys think?  Do you think that house is worth though 1.8 --  almost $2 million?  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  It's the Brady Bunch house.  Of course, it is, are you really  buried the lead, you should have led with this at the top of the show.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's in the Valley.  Google that, Mitch Roschelle.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As we -- as we discuss.  It's somewhere in the San Fernando  Valley.  Would you -- what do you think it's worth Lee Carter?  </p><p>CARTER:  I think it's worth whatever people would pay for it.  I personally  wouldn't want to live in it.  But you know what -- </p><p>BAKER:  Well, do you think the bad omen, the Hawaiian token is still there?   I don't think so.</p><p>CARTER:  Just don't play catch in the yard there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, nobody got my milk and Pepsi reference earlier.  </p><p>BAKER:  Nobody?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's Laverne and Shirley.  </p><p>Thank you very much.  By the way, the inside of the Brady Bunch house  clearly doesn't look like it did.</p><p>BAKER:  Back in the day.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, back in the day.  And can somebody please explain to me  the riddle of the universe, that you have six kids and one bathroom  upstairs.  Like they share the bath of six kids shared one bathroom.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And Alice was in the house too.  </p><p>BAKER:  No, but the parents had an en suite.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BAKER:  The parents had their own bathroom.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Alice had their own bathroom.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  The boys moved downstairs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, they were -- </p><p>BAKER:  Greg moved upstairs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Greg moved upstairs</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Can anybody name Alice's boyfriends name, who was the butcher?  </p><p>BAKER:  Sam the butcher.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sam.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Got to go.</p><p>Former linebacker Ray Lewis inducted into the Football Hall of Fame but his  bust steals the show.  We will tell you why, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  An emotional win for Justin Thomas at the Bridgestone  Invitational.  Mike Gunzelman has the details.  Hey, Mike.</p><p>MIKE GUNZELMAN, RADIO HOST, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Hey, Dagen.  That's  right.  And Justin Thomas put on a show.  It's his first tournament win in  five months and his first victory with his grandparents in attendance.  He  gave him a huge hug after his final putt.  Thomas came out far ahead  beating Kyle Stanley by four strokes.  </p><p>However, one golfer that was not on that leader board, Tiger Woods.   Terrible day for him.  He started day of with two birdies on the first two  holes.  And then things went off the rails from there.  Woods shot 73 on  the day and tied for 31st place, not good.  </p><p>We'll see if Tiger can bounce back when the PGA championship begins this  coming Thursday.  </p><p>Dagen, this story is for you.  Chase Elliott has won his first career  NASCAR race.  He was able to hold off Martin Truex Jr. in the final laps at  Watkins Glen.  He's just 22 years old and Elliott was the second youngest  driver to win a race this year.  And he did get a little help from his  teammate, Jimmie Johnson, to get to victory lane.  Apparently, Elliott  actually ran out of fuel just after the checkered flag, don't know how that  happened.  So, Johnson used his car to push him along.  </p><p>And now this, I love this story.  I'm a huge Conor McGregor fan, UFC fan.   My guy is back.  Conor McGregor is back.  His much-anticipated return to  the Octagon, however, won't be a hyped-up world tour.  </p><p>Now, one of the biggest fights in UFC history is planned for October 6th.   McGregor will be fighting Khabib Nurmagomedov for the lightweight title.   And it's supposed to be one of the biggest money fights in the sport's  history.  UFC's president Dana White says they don't have time to fit in a  world tour ahead of the bout in Las Vegas but still this is going to be a  battle.  </p><p>And to baseball we go with the Toronto Blue Jays visiting the Seattle  Mariners.  Seattle broke out the poutine.  This fan tried to catch a  baseball with a big bowl of poutine that didn't work out so well.  He  slammed into the field, spilling the dish everywhere hitting -- you know,  the ball hit his face.  It's like, come on, dude, you had one job.  Catch  the ball.  </p><p>And then of course there is this.  Ray Lewis was inducted into the pro  Football Hall of Fame over the weekend.  But everyone is talking about how  much his bronze bust looks nothing like him.  So take a look at this.  What  do you guys think?  Does that look like Ray Lewis?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>GUNZELMAN:  Not at all, right?  </p><p>BAKER:  No.</p><p>CARTER:  This has happened a few times.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is the sculptor anonymous?  Because maybe Ray Lewis wouldn't be  so happy.  Actually, do they care?</p><p>GUNZELMAN:  Some people -- somebody thought that it looks like perhaps  comedian one of the Wayans brothers, Damon Wayans.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Damon Wayans, yes.</p><p>CARTER:  I could see that.</p><p>GUNZELMAN:  But there have been some other renditions.  So, you might  remember Cristiano Ronaldo, he had one and that didn't look anything like  him.  That look like my 7-year-old niece did that.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Brandi Chastain, there was one that was off.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>GUNZELMAN:  Yes, definitely bad for sure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, just really quickly, Chase Elliott's dad is Bill Elliott  the fame race car driver and his nickname is Awesome Bill from Dawsonville.   So, that's my favorite nickname.  </p><p>BAKER:  OK, (INAUDIBLE) finish with NASCAR.  So, we got to finish off with  Conor McGregor.  Also, I'm a huge fan of McGregor.  Do you think they're  cutting back on the world tour because they want to minimize the chance to  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>GUNZELMAN:  Yes, absolutely yes.  Because it's Conor, absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Mike.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

It's Monday, August 6th, your top stories  at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Tough talk on trade.  China firing back against President Trump.  The state  media blasting the administration, saying extortion won't work.  The  President Trump, doubling down on his policies over the weekend at a rally  in Ohio.</p><p>Checking the markets, let's check.  You know what is going for President  Trump?  His rhetoric on trade it's working, he has his base fired up Lee  Carter is going to talk about that, coming up.  And also, this economy,  it's in Fuego.  And the futures are showing that this morning.</p><p>We have gained across the board.  This coming off the fifth week in a row  that the Dow and S&amp;P have been up, and the real winner has been the NASDAQ  in terms of top performance.  It was up nearly one percent on the week.   Apple, hitting a $1 trillion market cap.  The first U.S. company to ever do  that.</p><p>All of this in terms of wages growing at the fastest pace in 10 years.   Inflation still tame, you name it.  It's going well for the United States  of America.  In Europe, we have gains across the board to tell you about.   And England, France, and Germany, no we don't, the markets have completely  turned in the other direction.  We have losses at the moment.</p><p>In Asia, overnight it was mixed action.  The Shanghai composite the worst  performer there.  The Hang Seng managing to eke out a gain of half of one  percent.</p><p>Earnings season rolls on.  SeaWorld and Tyson among the names reporting  this morning.  What is driving stocks higher?  Coming up.  Try earnings  growth north of 24 percent.  That's much better than analysts expected to  start the reporting season.</p><p>A heroic rescue caught on camera.  Atlanta police pull a man out of a  burning car.  More of the unbelievable video later this hour.  Samsung set  to unveil its latest iPhone rival.  Images of the new device leaked,  Samsung is behind it.  And it's party time for one panda.  A zoo  celebrating the first birthday of its newest edition with a cake made of  bamboo and fruit.</p><p>All of that and so much more coming up this morning.  Maslansky and Partner  President Lee Carter, PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle, and former CIA operative  and Diligence president, Mike Baker.  I had to cut you off because we're up  against a hard break.  But I agree that Conor McGregor it is the fight of - - maybe the century so far, coming up.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE:  Yes, actually -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it but they got to keep them from getting in trouble because  the issue you were talking about is he was -- he threw a hand truck and a  van full of fighters out at the bar at the Barclays Center out in Brooklyn,  and he ended up being on the legal trouble.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes, no, look, he is a beast but -- you know, you can do a little  home predictable so I think they're going to try to manage -- you know,  this is lead up to the fight because this, I had a massive fight, the  payday is huge.</p><p>If you're talking about China, it's true, quick.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, please, quick.</p><p>BAKER:  I think, people need to watch what China is saying right now.   They're ratcheting up the rhetoric a little rhetoric a little bit, and it's  becoming more personal which is not typical for them.  So, I think what  we're seeing from that is their reaction to what's happening within their  own economy.</p><p>And this is a very interesting time, but also a very difficult time.  And  we need to manage this properly because again, and we talked about this  earlier, a destabilized Chinese economy is not going to do us any good in  the long run.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rhetoric that becomes increasingly personal against the  president.</p><p>BAKER:  Against the administration, against President Trump.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because we know he has talked about Xi Jinping, his friend.  But  -- </p><p>BAKER:  Who is president for life basically now?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, but -- you know, you start making it personal with  President Trump and things generally don't go well.  So -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Yes, but that thing said,  people really think that the president is doing the right thing by fan of  China, they're still supporting this on both like on all sides.  To say  they expect them like two-thirds of Americans think this is the right  strategy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And my issue is and I've been very vocal about it.  In the  meantime, we've taken aback to our allies at the same time.  And in  Americans whose jobs are at risk or have been hurt by higher prices.</p><p>So, there you go.  Let's talk China going in on Trump's tariff threats,  saying, he's starring in his own, \"Streetfighter style, deceitful drama of  extortion and intimidation.\"</p><p>The president plans to stay the course on trade.  Let's go to Blake Burman  live in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey near where the president is taking a  working vacation.  Blake, what's the latest?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  As you guys were just talking about the Chinese ratcheting  up the rhetoric over the weekend.  The latest coming in a state-run  editorial of the -- that editorial described the president as engaging in  what they described as \"Streetfighter style, deceitful drama of extortion,  and intimidation.\"</p><p>The president though over the weekend saying that he gets along with the  Chinese.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Look, I don't blame China.   I don't blame any of these countries, I don't have to go through them I've  got some good relationships.  Believe it or not they all like me, they  understand.  They can't believe themselves they got away with it.  They  can't believe that they got away with, but they have and we're turning it  around, we're turning it around fast.</p><p>BURMAN:  Both sides appear to be dug in here, because the Chinese saying  that the U.S. and China right now are engaged in a quote, \"zero-sum\" game.   While members of the Trump administration continue to say that President  Trump will not blink.</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  Don't underestimate  President Trump's resolve here.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:   How far are you prepared  to take those?</p><p>BOLTON:  Far enough to get China to change its behavior, and they need to  understand that.</p><p>WALLACE:  And, if they don't change their behavior?</p><p>BOLTON:  I think, the pressure will continue.  I think the president's made  that very clear.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BURMAN:  The president, now unveiling a new argument over the weekend  Dagen, he tweeted out the following at one point, writing, \"Because of  tariffs, we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21  trillion in debt that has been accumulated.  It's unclear though, Dagen, exactly how that specific math there checks  out?  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Blake.  Blake Burman for us in New Jersey.</p><p>BURMAN:  We got it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Mark Penn, a former Clinton adviser Stagwell  Group president, author of the book Microtrends Squared.  Mark, I said  earlier as a person, I consider myself to be a fiscal conservative.  I  don't think, I've ever seen a Republican president in my lifetime brag  about tax increases because that's essentially what he was doing.  And it's  actually not the first time I've heard him say that at least, one of the  rallies recently.</p><p>MARK PENN, FORMER ADVISER OF BILL CLINTON:  Well, I think you have to look  at these tariffs as strategic bargaining chips.  I mean, I think, you know  what, I've seen President Trump do over and over again is when he doesn't  really have anything to bargain with, he creates things to bargain with.</p><p>And that's what I think what he's done with the tariffs.  And when it comes  to China, the public really does support him in China.  They think China  has been stealing American jobs for a long time, stealing American  technology, and is out for world economic domination on the back of  America.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, Mark, this is Lee Carter speaking.  I am -- I'm  fascinated by how Americans are reacting to all of this.  And really -- in  general saying that they support what the president is doing with China,  and believe exactly what you said that these are really strategic  bargaining chips that he's using with.  And think in a long-term, we're  going to win.</p><p>And we're seeing the president's approval ratings eke up.  On the other  hand, we're seeing independents starting to -- in the most recent polls we  thought were just talking about NBC poll that just came out saying that the  independents are actually softening towards the president.  What are you  seeing in your polls?</p><p>PENN:  Well, look, we had at the Harvard caps, Harris Poll.  We had the  president at about 45 percent approval.  We didn't really show dramatic  change.  I think to the extent, the president is sticking up it's because  of the economic straight.</p><p>70 percent of Americans now say that we have a strong economy, and that  really is the biggest change in the poll in the last year.</p><p>I think that's up about 15 points or so.  And that is the tremendous shift,  and that is what is holding him up because he's got a 55 percent approval  there.  On the other side, immigration -- you know, the tariffs, he could  have waited till after the midterms on the tariffs because it does create - - you know, some controversy particularly in terms of Europe and Mexico,  and but not China, they do support him on China.  And that's kind of what  we're saying.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, the other thing that I'm really, really interested in  when it comes to the -- comes to the polling is voter enthusiasm.  And as  we're going into the midterms, it's sort of been flip-flopping over who's  more enthusiastic, Democrats or Republicans?</p><p>And as we're looking at the war on the media or the media -- you know, back  and forth between the president, and it seems like the war on what's  happening with the media, and the media attacking the president all the  time, did he energizing Republicans more?  What do you see?</p><p>PENN:  Yes, I think everybody is going to be energized.  I am going to be  fascinating, we're going to be fascinated about what happens on Tuesday  night here in this -- in this special election in a Republican district in  Ohio.</p><p>I -- look, I think that the president has made the choice here energize his  base.  Go out and rally after rally, and do what worked for him in the  presidential.</p><p>A little risky because the question is, \"Are independent women in suburban  districts who have voted more Republican than anybody realizes going to  drift Democratic?  And that's really the big question.  And the more he  plays to the base, to the working class that doesn't typically show out,  the show up in midterms, the more he may lose some of the well-educated  suburban voters who typically do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, Mark, I will say this, and we saw it in 2016.  Women,  wives, mothers vote on the economy.  This economy is growing at the fastest  pace in four years north of four percent it could grow even faster in the  current quarter based on the most recent estimates.</p><p>Job growth on average this year is faster than it was last year at this  time which is incredible for an economy into nine years of an expansion.   Wages are growing at the fastest pace in a decade.  And then, you have good  news even on Obamacare in premiums aren't going up as much as people  expected.  They're actually falling according to reports to some of these  state insurance commissioners.</p><p>I think that it's hard to find anything wrong.  This is -- and look at  this, the USDA showed that nearly 3 million Americans have come off of food  stamps since President took office.  Again, that's what women vote on.</p><p>PENN:  Well, and of course, if I were working with President Clinton, and  we had numbers like that, his ratings would be in the stratosphere and he'd  be untouchable.  So, the fact that's not the case shows you that, that  message hasn't gotten through yet. </p><p>Certainly, the idea that 3 million are off food stamps hasn't gotten  through.  It's an important message because the big question here with the  tax cuts is, \"Did it just benefit the big corporations or did the working  class and even the working poor benefit?  And truth is that you say a lot  of statistics are coming out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you need the message?  Do you need the messages, though?  90  percent of Americans got a pay hike because of the tax cuts earlier this  year.  90 percent of people are seeing fatter paychecks.  Do you need to  message that?</p><p>Do -- there -- again, it kind of comes back to do his approval ratings and  do the polls even matter because they sure as heck didn't matter going into  the election almost two years ago?</p><p>PENN:  Well, but the public is fed up, the Congress doesn't seem to be able  to do anything.  I do think the Republicans have a leader who has quit,  doesn't even support the President on tariffs.  And yet, is staying in  office.  I've said consistently with you that I think the biggest  Republican weakness is they have no message and the leadership.</p><p>The Democrats have weaknesses too.  You know, headed by Pelosi, someone  who's really disliked throughout the country and featuring socialist.   That's why a voter who is going to go into the polls who's not energized in  the middle is truly confused about which way to vote.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you said, Nancy Pelosi, let's also talk about Senator  Elizabeth Warren, which she was fueling rumors of a presidential run over  the week and saying, she well -- you can just listen to this, she's not  afraid to be the underdog.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  It won't be  easy.  We're going to have to fight uphill.  But me, I'm going up that hill  and I hope you are too.  And I hope that when you do, you'll reach your  hand out and bring someone else along for the climb.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of policy platform, it's abortion and open borders.  I  don't know how that wins.</p><p>PENN:  Well, if you look at the Democrats in the Democratic primary,  actually, Biden has been rising and not Elizabeth Warren.  Elizabeth Warren  gets all the publicity, but he went out -- you know, this week with  President Obama.</p><p>You know, I think begin -- he has been very quietly position himself.   Look, I don't think Elizabeth Warren would be the best Democratic  presidential candidate.  And -- you know, the Pelosi Warren team is really  too far to the left for America.</p><p>But I don't think that's where the rank-and-file Democrats are, and I don't  think that's how this is going to play out come three years from now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joe Biden taking a selfie with President Obama with a big grin  on his face.  Well, I think that every American could write the caption for  that.  Mark Penn, thank you so much.</p><p>PENN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you my friend, Mark Penn.  Coming up, an  unbelievable rescue.  Police in Atlanta pull a man out of a burning car.   Details on the heroic action straight ahead.  And Samsung unveiling its  newest phone this week.  The detail is already out because Samsung leaked  them.  That story later this hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news.  A Philadelphia Police Officer is in the hospital  after being shot in the face this morning.  Kristina Partsinevelos has the  details.  Kristina?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  The  officer was shot in the face while serving a warrant.  He is identified as  49-year-old Jason Potts.  A 20-year veteran of the force and a member of  the SWAT team.  Officer Potts suffered heavy bleeding and at least a broken  jaw.  Police say he is expected to survive though.  </p><p>Tourists are fleeing after a powerful earthquake in Indonesia.  Magnitude  7.0 quake hitting the tourist island of Lombok killing about 100 people.   More than 230 others seriously injured.  The death toll is expected to rise  and search operations continue.  It's the second deadly -- deadliest quack  in just one week to hit that island.  A July 29th quake killed 16 people  and damaged hundreds of homes.</p><p>And there is more trouble at Wells Fargo.  The bank said the calculation  error may have caused hundreds of people to lose their homes to foreclosure  between 2010 and 2015.  According to a regulatory filing, Wells Fargo said  the mistake was made in a formula used to qualify struggling homeowners for  Federally-backed assistance programs.  The bank has set aside $8 million or  about $20,000 per affected customer.</p><p>Shares of Wells Fargo are down three percent today but up this morning.   And PepsiCo CEO announcing plans to step down after leading the company for  12 years.  Indra Nooyi will leave in October and she will be succeeded by  Ramon Laguarta.  Nooyi, a 24-year old veteran at PepsiCo will remain  chairman at the board until early next year.  Shares of PepsiCo slightly in  premarket trading.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Kristina.  Extremely tough job, Mitch  Roschelle.  And at the time that Pepsi is under pressure in terms of its  fizzy drinks business but also with these tariffs.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And took global business and just not operating and selling  your product to consumers and business in one country, selling around the  world and that's a challenging job by any stretch with tariffs, it's even  more complicated.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And trade spats that are --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And currencies that are not moving in the direction people that  people thought they were moving, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's very difficult to plan your business that way but a  great run for a well-known woman at the top of one great American company.  </p><p>CARTER:  She is an extraordinary leader with an extraordinary vision.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You -- I want to give you a quiz.  I hate when people do this  but Pepsi was invented where?  Coke was invented in Atlanta.  Where was  Pepsi invented?  New Bern, North Carolina, Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>BAKER:  Oh, you think it was time to answer her.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he didn't know.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  OK.  I wrote it down right here, New Bern, North Carolina.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That's right.  Thank you so much.  Coming up.  A whale  sized surprise.  Seaworld reporting better-than-expected sales.  The stock  jumping on the news.  A closer look at what people back to the park  straight ahead.  Plus, a birthday bash fit for a giant panda.  A zoo  celebrates its newest bear cub with a cake of bamboo and fruit. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Social media gets political again.  Twitter apologizing after it  suspended conservative commentator Candace Owens for response to a set of  anti-white tweets by New York Times editorial board member.  This is a new  higher.  This as reports indicate executives and top board members from the  social media giant have donated overwhelmingly to Democrats.</p><p>Lee, your reaction to this.  Candace Owens basically took anti-white tweets  from this new hire by the New York Times and replaced certain her words in  as -- to illustrate the insanity and hideousness of what this woman at The  New York Times had been tweeting.  That woman said that it was -- I guess  she was trying to illustrate irony or something like that.  Nevertheless,  your reaction.  </p><p>CARTER:  So my reaction is A, she should not have been suspended, B, I can  understand from a machine learning perspective how this could have been  taken down as hate speech.  But what I don't understand is why it just  would have been blocked like so many other things or rather than saying  that we're going to suspend her.  And thirdly, I really think that if this  is going to be the policy of a social media company like Twitter they need  to be able to respond more quickly.</p><p>To have this happen for 12 hours, to go with no response, to go and say  nothing for a long time is a real problem for them and when I think that  Twitter really needs to remember is that, there is a huge number of  conservatives between ages 27 and 32.  In fact there was more conservatives  than there are liberals.  So they better do something about this.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's become -- Mike, how do you feel of about this?  Because I  have noticed and I mentioned with Jessica Tarlov that conservatives have  put in a bright red X next to their names to push back on Twitter, their  way of expressing dissatisfaction with the shadow banning that we've been  going on like where in search results, conservative names are essentially  buried or don't even show up at all.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Look, I'm shocked that Twitter leadership overwhelmingly  supports Democrats.  I picked up the New York Times, I know I'm reading a  paper with a certain lean, right?  I pick up the Wall Street Journal same  way.  You know, it's the world we live in.  I get on Twitter, I know where  they're going, right?  I know what their agenda in a sense is, and so I'm  not surprised.</p><p>And -- I guess bigger issue for me is just we -- where is the civility in  any of the dialogue whether it's on social media or face to face or on, you  know, traditional media.  We seem to have lost the inability, right?  To  speak rationally speak to people having a different point of view.  We've  lost our --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here are the two things -- the most hideous things that have  been said to me on Twitter by people on left, they need to reopen Auschwitz  to gas and incinerate you and I can't wait until Iran wipes Israel off the  map so I can watch you cry.  These people were not disciplined by Twitter,  they shouldn't have accounts, should they?</p><p>It's a private organization, they should -- but again, the level of hate --  and these are people, who -- go by their own names who were sitting at home  spewing this kind of hatred and if I -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BAKER:  But it's on both sides.  It's on both -- to be honest it's -- both  the hard sides, right?  Both the far right, the far left are sitting in  their trenches throwing hand grenades saying equally despicable things.   Nobody exists in the center anymore.  You don't have to agree with  somebody's position, right?  You don't have to read -- you're just fine.   But figure out a way to have a conversation without being -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, on the left anti-semitism is alive and well and I  don't even -- and they don't -- people, liberals don't acknowledge it, I  see it every day and I can say with no hesitation that the nastiest that  ever been said to me on social media were from the left.  People who preach  -- you know, 40 years ago preaching peace, love, and happiness.  Let's all  locked arms and we are against big government and helping one another.</p><p>Well, that just died.  I don't know when but it just died. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, no doubt about it.  I mean, Antifa, the big joke about  them is that they think they are, you know, this group that's out to, you  know, to promote free speech and yet they bludgeon anybody who doesn't  agree with them.  And they don't get the joke about that, they don't see  how ironic that is.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And cowards wearing black masks, I should point that out.   Cowards wearing -- covering their faces.  </p><p>BAKER:  You're not a good look for them. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming.  A massive pile up twisted steel and metal left behind  after freight train derails in Pittsburgh.  The latest on the investigation  into that crash.

It's  Monday, August 6th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  China state  media attacks President Trump, over his proposed tariffs.  Look out a  state-run paper calling the tariffs extortion saying that president is  starring in his own street fighter style defeatful drama.  President Trump  says that the tariffs are all about getting America on track.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p>TRUMP:  But America's economic surrender ended the day that I took office,  folks.  Now after years of rebuilding foreign countries, we are finally  rebuilding our country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike Baker said look out because China is getting all the more  personal, and when people make personal attacks on President Trump -- we've  kind of seen that movie before, we know what happens to them.  </p><p>Futures are showing a flat market at the start of trading to start this new  week.  We have some slight gains on the Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ 100 futures.   But last week, the Dow and S&amp;P up for their fifth week in a row.

We will  play panda videos and baby goat videos all day long.    </p><p>To our top story this half hour.  Markets shaking up trade tensions.   President Trump using the stock market as a measure of who's winning the  trade dispute, and indicating that U.S. has a clear lead over China.   Listen to this:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p>TRUMP:  If I didn't do anything with the trade deals, if I said nothing,  we're going to let everybody continue to take our jobs, take our wealth,  let them continue -- you know, I bet our stock market is up almost 40  percent since I won.  But if I didn't do anything with trade, just kept  quiet, let them continue to take advantage of us.  Nobody says anything.  I  think you would've been up another 40, 50, 60 percent.  But eventually, you  would have had to pay the piper eventually, and we're not going to do.   We're going to do something, we're going to make our country so much richer  than it has ever been.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now: Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment  Institute Head Global Market Strategist.  Paul, why has the markets been  able to shake off the trade tensions, the trade worry so much?  </p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Well, though, the market believes and we agree, that a deal is  the ultimate goal here that the goal is not to run the Chinese economy into  the ground or the U.S. economy into ground with unending tariffs.  They can  get a negotiation on the trade deficit, getting the Chinese to buy more  from this country, and if they can get a deal on autos with the Mexicans,  the Canadians, and the Europeans then we think the trade talk, the  rhetoric, dies down a bit or is dialed back.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC U.S.:  Hey, Paul, Mitch Roschelle.  You  mentioned China and their economy, some of the challenges that their  economy sort of predate the trade war, their markets are sort of in free- fall, their currency is diminishing, and they are growing middle class, and  the funding of entitlements for the middle class is really starting to put  pressure on their ability to grow and you see that in GDP numbers.  So,  regardless, don't we still have a global challenge that China's economy  that's going to impact other global economies if this trade war isn't  sorted out.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, you're absolutely right, Mitch, the moderation in  growth around the world, Europe I mention, too had slowed down some.  That  is confusing the markets a little bit here.  They're thinking that all of  the slowdown is related to trade talk.  It's not.  The slowdown is  predating the trade talk and it's an important factor.  The Chinese -- we  need to remember, the Chinese have an economy that on the one hand, has  very strong consumer growth, and on the other hand has a lot of debt.  And  as you mentioned, some issues with the providing social welfare.  So, how  are they going to balance that going forward?  They need to be very careful  with that and they don't need extra variable in there, if you will, of  trade uncertainty.  So, we think there's pressure on Chinese internally to  come to the negotiating table.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Debt is a huge issue, though, Paul.  And let's talk about what  we're paying as nation to borrow right now.  JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie  Dimon, warning investors over the weekend to prepare for five percent  interest rates -- that would be yield on the 10-year treasury.  And this  certainly is a major concern; it's not showing up in the markets so much at  this point, but now that back to running one trillion-dollar deficits,  we're in a fight with one of the largest holders of our own debt.  Someone  we've leaned on China and relied upon to buy our debt and fund deficit.   Your reaction to this?  Is there any way in the near-term that we even get  back to four percent on the 10-year yield?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  We don't think that there's much chance of getting to back to  four percent any time soon.  On the 10-year yield, yes, the debt is a  weight on the economy, call it a headwind for growth.  And no, we don't  think the Chinese are about ready to dump their holdings of U.S.  Treasuries.  Treasuries are simply the largest, the most liquid market in  the world.  And if you're a government that needs to hold trillions of  dollars of reserves, there's no other place for you to go but to hold U.S.  Treasury. </p><p>So, we don't think there's a real threat there.  But yes, the debt is going  to be a headwind for the economy going forward.  On the other hand, you've  got, still, quite a demographic challenge going forward as many of us age  and get into the retirement years.  We're going to be holding a lot more  debt anyway, that's going to help keep yield a little lower.  Our target  for 10-year treasury of this year is in the low threes, and we don't see it  moving up to four any time soon -- rather low yields look to us to be  continue to be the main problem for investors.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, is an aging population and those who will be holding more  safe, if you will, treasuries, is that bad for the stock market then?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, what it does for the stock market when the yields are  low, relatively low on treasury, we've been hanging around three percent  here.  That means that you can have a little bit higher stock market  prices, before stocks get overvalued.  So, we don't think that stocks are  too rich right now, and part of that argument is that the 10-year is just  not making the sort of headway that would get you to four or five percent.   If we were to see that, we'd be more worried about stocks.  </p><p>BAKER:  Paul, going book to -- sorry, Mike Baker, here, going back to  tariffs question: There's a bit of a -- softening in the talk between U.S.  administration, and the E.U. now, and tariffs skirmish.  Do you expect the  same development in our conversations with China?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, the I think Chinese know that there's a deal available  for them any time they want to take it.  But they're just not sure whether,  whether they should go now or later.  We think there will be a deal  sometime.  There's a good window for that opening up in the fall.  But the  Chinese simply need to figure out a way to close that -- some of that trade  deficit.  They could buy more liquid natural gas, they could buy more crude  oil, they could buy more soybeans.  Certainly, they need all of those  things in greater quantities than before.  </p><p>And I think if they were to do that, they would make -- they would come a  long way towards meeting the president in a deal.  So, I think that's, in  the end, where they'll finally go is making some kind of deal on trade.   The U.S. and the Europeans also have talking to do, not a done deal yet  there either.  But, again, the president probably wants to see those two  things, some sort of deal on autos and some sort of deal with the Chinese  on the trade deficit.  And then we think that the trade negotiations seem  to a lower priority and for the markets and we can get back to thinking  about good earnings growth going forward. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Paul, real quick, why is the opening in terms of having  discussions with China, why is that in the fall what about the timing of  that?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, the -- you've got midterm elections coming up here --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  -- In U.S.  And the president is still putting out their  additional tariffs and the Chinese feel obliged to respond.  I think  they're still gauging each other's degree of seriousness that the president  in our view, since the beginning, has been serious.  But some people maybe  have been thinking that, well, he would be eventually bend or making  exceptions.  That's not been the case.  So, they need to get back talking  again.  There's some evidence that the Chinese are interested in that.  It  just has to happen sometime in the next few months, we thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the stock market just keeps chugging along.  Paul  Christopher, thank you so much.  Take care.    </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come back soon.  Coming up, incredible rescue caught on tape.  A  police officer in Atlanta pulls a man out of a burning car.  You have to  see more of this hero in action.  Plus, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, all  aiming to be the next to join Apple at a $1 trillion valuation.  Stuart  Varney makes a big prediction about those tech titans.  Mitch Roschelle is  going hmm, we all are.  Mr. Varney is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Second quarters earning season rolls on this week at a slower  pace.  But Tyson Foods and Sea World have reported this morning.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more, Nicole. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Monday morning,  Dagen.  So, there's been a lot of optimism surrounding the earnings 24.2  percent gain for earnings overall, year-over-year growth.  So, that's  surpassing analysts' estimates in 43 companies this week.  Take a look at  two that have already kicked it out: Tyson Foods and Sea World.  Sea World  up 15 percent; Tyson Food up three percent, this morning.  So, Tyson Foods  CEO, we did see that Tyson Foods -- this was a beat on profit.  Also, the  cattle prices have been falling; the food prices have been falling, and  they've increased herd size, and size of the heavier animals.  That offset  the impact of falling bacon pork prices.  This is apparent of Ball Park  Frank's hot dogs and Jimmy Dean's sausages.  </p><p>And then, there's Sea World.  What the CEO is saying that the quarter  benefitted from new marketing initiatives, strategic pricing, positive  reception to rises and such, the attendance on rise, and it was the revenue  that wowed Wall Street.  In fact, this is the third time in a row, third  straight, beat on top lines.  So, this is a winner, no doubt, for Sea  World.  And you could see it is up 15 percent.  That's going to be heavily  traded in a big mover today.  </p><p>Just as far as market commentary, Jeff Saut over at Raymond James,  everybody's been somewhat concerned about the sector rotation out of tech - - out of tech and out of consumer cyclicals, and have they moved into cash?   No, in fact, they've moving been moving it into industrials and financials,  and some other consumer non-cyclicals.  And he said, this sector rotation  is healthy, it's associated with a healthy bull market.  They're also a  little positive on Apple, and little weak on CBS this morning.  Back to  you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Apple, the first to cross the finish line to  $1 trillion in its valuation.  Several other big tech names are close  behind.  Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  You  have a prediction, sir?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh, wait a minute, wait a  minute, wait a minute.  I just want to take our audience back to the Fox  News Channel on Friday afternoon where you made a stellar appearance on  \"THE FIVE,\" as I recall.  I thought you were really, really cool.  And it  occurred to me, you and I go back about 10 years now, working together in  the Fox Business Network for about 10 years.  What's the biggest story that  you and I have covered in those 10 years?  Don't answer, I think -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love you.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think it is the extraordinary performance and the gain in  valuation of those five big technology companies.  Apple is already worth a  trillion.  You've got Google, Amazon, and Microsoft really close, well  above 800 billion, and Facebook is down there at 500 billion.  But  essentially, I've never seen anything like this before.  You've never seen  the accumulation of wealth and power as we have seen in the last couple of  years in those five american technology companies.  There's going to be  cause to break them up, but nonetheless, they are there, they're  exceptionally powerful.  I think it's a unique moment in our financial  history.  Amazon, Google, microsoft, you get a good rally this year, and  from where we are now, and all three of them will join Apple at a trillion- dollar valuation, extraordinary stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It really is important though, Stuart, that you highlight it in  the way that you do every day on your show, but in this -- in this moment  as well, and I said this because we very often -- you know, the news media  gets criticized so much, but many people are quite frankly lazy about it.   They don't have to do any homework, they can talk about President Trump and  his mental state.  But this is important to breathe and look at and  highlight because this is American greatness.</p><p>VARNEY:  And it doesn't get much coverage in the establishment newpapers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>VARNEY:  They cover it in a negative way.  They've got too much power,  they've got too much wealth.  I cover it in a positive way.  All the money  they are making will flow out into different industries like cars, medical  devices, drugs, that -- money made out of computing power will flow out to  other industries and improve them.  I think it's very positive development.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And anybody in this country, if you own one share of an Apple or  a Microsoft or Amazon, or a Netflix, you're an owner in that company.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You own part of it and I think that that's worth -- that we're  all in it together.  We're all part of this greatness.</p><p>VARNEY:  Anybody with a 401(k), an IRA, a mutual fund, you benefited from  this, you've seen your retirement savings go up, and that is wholly good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amen and hallelujah.</p><p>VARNEY:  There's a mutual adoration society here, Dagen, I kind of like it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And thank you for the kind words.</p><p>VARNEY:  You're welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's why we like working here because these are the people we  work with and we actually like each other off in here, and not faking it --  we're not faking it.</p><p>VARNEY:  Incredible.</p><p>BAKER:  And Stuart --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, we got to go.</p><p>BAKER:  Oh, we got to go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love you, Mike.  That's Mike Baker.</p><p>VARNEY:  OK, Mike, love you, too.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A reminder, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts every day at 9:00 a.m.  Eastern.  He is coming up in almost 11 minutes.  A birthday bash fit for a  giant panda.  A zoo celebrates its newest beer cub with a delicious treat  for a party of one.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  -- tumbling down on a hill on to light rail tracks, so  that's what you're seeing in the screen right now, the cars were carrying  consumer products but just food and housewares.  No injuries luckily have  been reported, and an investigation into the derailment is underway.  Train  service, though, has been suspended in the area.</p><p>An Atlanta Police officer is being hailed a hero this morning after saving  a passenger from a burning car last night, and it was all caught on his  body camera.  You can see the officer, he's about to run from the vehicle  and is dousing with a fire extinguisher.  Authorities say the car's engine  went up in flames after the car hit a metal utility pole.  Officials say  three people were taken to a local hospital.  Another officer suffered  minor scrapes and bruises.  What a video.</p><p>Samsung is out with a new sneak peek on its new Galaxy Note 9.  The company  unveiling this video for the smartphone in its YouTube channel.  It all but  confirms that the Note 9 will have the option for one terabyte of memory, a  massive amount of storage for all those videos and pictures we take.  The  Note 9 will apparently also come with 512 gigabytes of built in memory and  support for 512 gigabytes microsdcards, something not supported by the  iPhone, so those are difference right there.  </p><p>And we have to end the morning of the hour with a lovely video of a french  baby panda which treated to a unique cake to celebrate its first birthday,  bamboo, honey, and a variety of fruits went into the colorful cake.  The  young panda weighs about 60 pounds and probably packed a few more after his  B-Day celebration. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was in France, so of course, they have a delicious cake.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Chocolate cake, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  We need to get your expertise on something when guns  did the sports earlier, we had this video of a Mariners fan trying to catch  a ball with a bowl of poutine and failing miserably.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh, no, it's all over the floor.  So shameful, shameful.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Please explain what poutine is.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Poutine is or just like greasy French fry's gravy and  cheese curds.  But the cheese curds, when you chew them, they have to be  squeeky.  And there's an area in Quebec, St. Albert or St. Albert that  makes a lot of these cheese curds.  They're very popular, you can get all  kinds of topings on them, but the one you want to go for is the typical  gravy fries and cheese curds.  Super fatenning for you.</p><p>BAKER:  But now, Canada is not claiming they invented cheese curds, are  they?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  No, no, but we didn't -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARTER:  I'm an American now but (INAUDIBLE) invented the poutine back in  the late 1950s.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In a trucker.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  See, there's so much shared heritage and love of food between  the Canadians and people in the United States.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Yes, exactly.  That's why I'm here, too.  We all get along.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, again, we're build -- we're building some bridges.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Yes.  I believe that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tariffs be dammed.  We're building culinary --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- we're building culinary bridges.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAKER:  Over cheese kurds, yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Yes, exactly.  Poutine, yes.</p><p>BAKER:  Poutine.  So, you heard it here.  You heard it here.  The U.S. and  Canada should be allies.  OK.  Got it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  I'm glad I'm the expert.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hey, you're killing it today.  (INAUDIBLE) the whole nine yards.   Kristina Partsinevelos.  Coming up, final thoughts from our all stars when  we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We picked that song because it's one of Mike Baker's top  favorite songs of all-time.  Final thoughts from our all-stars.  Go!</p><p>BAKER:  Sure.  I can confirm that in Boise, we do have the goats gone wild  situation under control.  It is now safe to go back to Boise, it won't be  acoasted by roaming goats.  That's all I got.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We rank guys -- no, you've got more.  Give me something on China  real quick.</p><p>BAKER:  Heading there tomorrow.  We'll be back here with you guys in a  couple of weeks and we'll be looking forward to talking about what it looks  like on the ground there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they going to give, are they going to step up and let us  actually negotiate different trade deals, Mitch?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The thing that concerns me is growing national debt.  We have  over $700 billion being refinanced of the next two quarters and that really  concerns me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Federal Reserve is pulling back on its balance sheet at the  same time and we're running $1-trillion budget.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  This is going to be a trillion-dollar deficit this year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lee?</p><p>CARTER:  A lot of criticisms about the polls, and whether or not they're  reliable.  I think what's important to look at the polls for is for  momentum and direction, and it looks like the President has weathered a  really tough storm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Indeed, Lee Carter, Mitch Roschelle, and Mike Baker.  Thanks to  one and all, travel safely, we will see you tomorrer (ph) -- excuse me --  tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts right now.  Stuart, it is all yours.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, it is, Dagen, good morning to you, thank you very much,  indeed.  And good morning, everyone.

Chris Beauchamp, thank you so much. Thank you for being with us today. Dagen, it's yours.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I can't wait to see you two ladies coming up, Gerri, because you've got a really good story for us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WILLIS: Yes, ma'am.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MCDOWELL: It will make everyone in this country really angry, right?</p><p>WILLIS: That is right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is Gerri's wheelhouse. So thank you so much for that Kristine and Gerri. Good morning everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, August 6th. Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Tough talk on trade, China firing back against President Trump, state media blasting the administration saying extortion won't work. President Trump doubling down on his policies over the weekend however at a rally in Ohio.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But if I didn't do anything with trade, just kept quiet, let them continue to take advantage of us, nobody says anything, I think you would have been up another 40, 50, 60 percent.</p><p>But eventually, you would have had to pay the piper eventually. And we're not going to do that, we're going to do something, we're going to make our country so much richer than it's ever been.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Trade uncertainty weighing in on the market a little bit. Futures have turned around however, 17-point gain on the Dow Futures right here right now. Broadly speaking, the markets have shrugged off everything that's been going on with tariffs and the trade fight. This after gains on Wall Street last week, the Dow Industrials and the S&amp;P500 posting gains for five weeks in a row.</p><p>In Europe checking on England, France, and Germany, at the moment we have gains across the board as well. The biggest winner, the DAX Index in Germany up one-third of one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed action, the Shanghai Composite the worst performer there, down one and a third percent in Shanghai.</p><p>Devastation in Indonesia, a major earthquake striking, killing dozens of people in more than 100 aftershocks felt throughout the region.</p><p>Another scandal for Wells Fargo, this is what I'm talking about, Gerri's going to be up shortly discussing the bank revealed that hundreds of people lost their homes because of a computer glitch. They were foreclosed on unfairly. Let's talk about the compensation, that will be coming up.</p><p>And Samsung taking on the iPhone, the tech giant confirming upgrades to its Galaxy Note 9.</p><p>And talk about a dream job, the maker of Nutella is hiring tasters. Let's all raise our hands for that.</p><p>All of that and so much more coming up this morning. Maslansky &amp; Partners President Lee Carter. PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle. And former CIA Operative, Diligence President Mike Baker. The only reason we booked you is to show the goat video from Boise, there you go.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC: Everybody's going crazy about the goat video, rapid goats in Boise, Idaho. It's the best publicity we've had in ages.</p><p>But it's a wonderful city, Wall Street Journal called Boise, Idaho--I know people are saying, \"What is he talking about?\" They call Wall Street -- the called Boise, Idaho the fastest growing city in America and it's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it's -- and it's because you have like 80 children and --</p><p>BAKER: And we -- who's counting?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm just -- I'm just joking. But we -- we're going to cover the world for you this morning in the next three hours with Mike, Mitch, and Lee. Great to see all of you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Great to be here.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So on to our top story this hour, trade tensions escalating, Chinese state media bashing President Trump's trade tactic saying policies of extortion and intimidation won't work. The commander-in-chief with a different view of the situation voicing support for his negotiating style saying tariffs are working.</p><p>Tweeting just yesterday this, \"Tariffs are working big time. Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the United States always to our detriment. I say as they come, tax them, if they don't want to be taxed, let them make or build the product in the U.S. In either event, it means jobs and great wealth.\"</p><p>\"Because of tariffs, we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 trillion in debt accumulated, much by the Obama Administration while at the same time reducing taxes for our people. At minimum, we will make much better trade deals for our country.\"</p><p>Here now is Mark Avallone, President and Founder of Potomac Wealth Advisors. Mark, are you with us?</p><p>MARK AVALLONE, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS: Yes. Good morning, good to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning. What do you -- what do you make of this? So far, I don't -- I don't think it's a stretch to say that the market has largely shrugged off what has been going on with the trade fight that started in the spring.</p><p>AVALLONE: Well it has shrugged it off, our market's up year-to-date across the board and China's is down. It's down 18 percent the beginning of the year and it's in bear market going back to 2017.</p><p>So the Trump strategy is to use our economic strength now while we have it to enact much needed and frankly, much deserved parity. He wants a fair playing field with China. The only problem with the trade policy is he dragged in the Canadians and the E.U. which then you have us against the world.</p><p>If we focus on China, keep it more of a microcosm then the stock market appears to say, \"Hey, we can manage this. Our economy is strong enough and we'll push higher from here.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch, how much runway is the market or investors going to give the Trump Administration because right now we've seen with the job's report on Friday we created on average 215,000 jobs every month, that's faster than the pace that we were at last -- last year, the first seven months of the year which is really incredible for an economy that's been in expansion mode since -- for nine years.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: The interesting thing would be in -- I think the reason why the market shrugged it off and to your point on runway is because corporate earnings have been so robust.</p><p>But what we're starting to see is the cost of the supply chain understand the market perspective on this, the cost in the supply chain to go up. And if they cannot pass those cost to the customer, meaning customers won't pay an increase price then we're going to see impact corporate profits.</p><p>The flip side is, if they can, we're going to see inflation. So, I think we're close to maybe in the next quarter getting to the point where the market's going to have a hard time turning off --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well is that a lose lose because somebody bears that cost, either it's corporations or if it's the consumer. If it's the consumer, is it more -- if the companies can passed those cost on the consumer, is it more, I guess, the impact won't be as severe to the market.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: It will -- it certainly won't be. In fact, it will help grow revenue because they're charging more for the products. It may not necessarily help margin, but it will certainly help the top line.</p><p>But the challenge is going to be how much can you pay for (INAUDIBLE) before the market pushes back or there's another alternative that starts to erode sales. But Mark, I'm curious your perspective on that.</p><p>AVALLONE: Well if it does as you say raise the price of the end good and raising revenues for the corporation, then it is a tax on the consumer. Ultimately it is going to be a drag.</p><p>But I think the play here is that are the consumer wages are so strong, the individuals are flushed with cash, we can pay up for this without it slowing down our economy too much. China's limping along.</p><p>So one a one-on-one basis, we can power through this. If that wasn't the outlook, we would have seen the stock market pull back by now. The market looks forward and yet it's been up for the year. So I think all the news is out and Wall Street is saying the global growth story that we heard, the I.M. -- from the IMF this year for the G20, from we continue it here from the Fed, the global growth story is strong enough that even if price is raised, it's not going to slow down the U.S. economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch already mentioned this, there's a story in the Wall Street Journal today, an article commenting on the strong earnings season. Profits surging at big U.S. firm, strong economy, and tax cuts, fuel gains, and embolden companies to raise prices.</p><p>This is a recent report by the UFDA showed nearly three million have come - - individuals have come all for food stamps since President Trump took office. Mark -- Mike Baker, you can see the world in terms of the business that you do.</p><p>And Mark briefly mentioned this, that we do have the upper hand because China is so weak right now, because the stock market is greater, their economy is growing a great deal slower, and they are wash in debt. So the timing of this that people act like President Trump might be rash, but there's some wiliness and some intelligence in why we pick right now to take this fight on.</p><p>BAKER: I think that's true. I'm heading to Beijing tomorrow morning for a week or so, very curious to kind of get the on the ground response from just the, you know, local folks in business about how they perceive this from their side.</p><p>I will say it's not in anybody's interest globally for -- to have an unstable Chinese economy, it just -- it just not. And so --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you think they blank though? That's been the question that we raise last week, do you think China blanks on this?</p><p>BAKER: I think ultimately they do because they're extremely pragmatic and they understand what a chaotic problem they could have if the economy continues to head south.</p><p>And with -- a question from Mar is, you mentioned mark the idea that we dragged in Canada and the E.U. into this overall trade issues, trade war, do you think that that was more of a negotiating ploy with the president in terms of overall objective for China or do you think in a sense, you know, there's not really a grand strategy here?</p><p>AVALLONE: Well it's tough to say with the president. Maybe he's trying to show the Chinese he's serious about this and hopefully, quietly behind the scenes reaching an agreement.</p><p>We saw that Mexico, we might update the NAFTA Agreement and start being on a friendly playing field again. That's really the hope. You really don't want to take on the entire world. It's either take on China, and focus on these legitimate inequities, technology transfer and others and let's have our allies with us as we try to take on China.</p><p>Remember, China's also unfair to the E.U., let's make the E.U. our ally against the number one trade offender and that is China.</p><p>CARTER: This is Lee Carter, I -- one of the things that I've been fascinated to watch is that most Americans really have been willing to give the president a long runway here and that's been really surprising because the most part people don't want to take short-term pain in order for the long-term gain.</p><p>And China's known to have a long gain, really long gain. We've got election cycle after election cycle after election cycle and investor seem to be giving in the past two. But I'm just wondering how long do you think Americans are going to give this runway before they're going to say, \"Wait, this is too much?\"</p><p>AVALLONE: Well, it's interesting that -- that's a great point because a lot of the Trump voters are the ones that are negatively impacted by this tariff skirmish. You have farmers in the Midwest that voted for Trump that are taking a lot of this.</p><p>And some of the manufacturing with the aluminum and steel tariffs could have gone against a lot of his base. But ironically, they are sticking with him and we haven't seen the weakness just yet. China on the other hand doesn't have an election in November nor will they have an election.</p><p>So their government can continue to be autocratic and weighed out. So if Trump's playing the long game, he doesn't really have the upper hand in that. I think trying -- we keep saying is, is China going to blink? That's the last thing we should say. China's never going to publicly blink.</p><p>We want to work diplomatically behind the scenes and hope to get a favorable outcome without letting the world thing we beat China or they blink because they're not going to blink publicly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Would you add the stocks here Mark, U.S. stocks particularly with the -- again, over the weekend I think that Jamie Dimon the head of J.P. Morgan said that he -- that the -- this country should brace itself for five percent interest rates.</p><p>He said that he thinks that the tenure yield should be at four percent right now and we should brace for five, this is we're staring down $1 trillion annual budget deficits and the Treasury is going to be selling a whole wash of debt in the coming weeks.</p><p>AVALLONE: Well when I hear those Jamie Dimon comments I said perhaps. But we're in a global economy. With the tenure boomed and the tenure in Japan being, what, less than one half a percent close to zero in Japan.</p><p>So we cannot unilaterally raise our rates that rapidly, it's a global economy. There's a subtle currency we're going on where none of these other entities want to raise their currencies, they're not going to (INAUDIBLE) up interest rates. A five percent tenure is not going to happen.</p><p>We're lucky if we get to four percent in this country the way we have the foreign pressure in the currency and in the interest rate markets. I think if you invest, you have to look domestically. Our economy is too strong.</p><p>I think small caps which earn about 75 percent of their revenue here domestically versus the S&amp;P500 which get about half of their revenues overseas, I think it's a safer place in case this trade skirmish continues.</p><p>And, again, since I don't see interest rates going anywhere near four percent in the next 12 months, I think the U.S. economy manages any rate hike and we continue to chug along.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mark, thank you so much, Mark Avallone. And Mitch Roschelle, when you're talking about the debt, the one thing that's on your mind is the amount of supply coming in Treasury.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And also, look who buys them, central bankers are the biggest buyers of our debt and it worries that we're sort of fighting with them on other issues. What if China decides to use how they behave the next Treasury auction as a -- as a weapon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: $769 billion in Treasury up for auction over what period of time? I'm reading an e-mail Mitch since --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: (INAUDIBLE) your head.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, when is it coming on?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I think it's over the next year. I think that according to the Journal but we can double check that. But that's a big chunk of treasuries that are up for sale and we could see rates go up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. I -- when people always point to Japan and a slow interest rates I'm like, \"Yes.\" But Japan's kind of been in a recession for the last 30 years on and off.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes. Since the 80s.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like we don't -- yes, since the late 80s. We kind of hope that we're not Japan.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes. Don't use -- don't use Japan as the benchmark please.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. Coming up, death and destruction as an earthquake rocks the popular Indonesian resort island. More than 80 people dead.

Have you guys any of you seen these movies over the weekend?</p><p>BAKER: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well you did -- did you, Mike Baker?</p><p>BAKER: Christopher Robin.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You did?</p><p>CARTER: You did?</p><p>BAKER: Well I got three little kids. It looks like I'm going to see Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh by the way in a real fight would kick Tom Cruise's ass. I don't know if I could say that but I just did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You just said that.</p><p>BAKER: I just did. Sorry. There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wait, why would -- I would put my money on Eeyore versus Tom Cruise.</p><p>BAKER: Well, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Eeyore is my spirit animal.</p><p>CARTER: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BAKER: Here we go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Slow and grumpy morning, noon, and night grumpy. Eeyore's in it, isn't he?</p><p>BAKER: You know, it's --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Don't ruin it for us.</p><p>BAKER: Yes, I won't -- I won't tell you how it ends, let me just put it that way. Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Does he get the honey jar off his nose though?</p><p>BAKER: If you got kids, who can't like Winnie the Pooh, come on?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Would you pay to see Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible?</p><p>BAKER: No. No. But if Damon makes another Bourne movie, I'm there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK.</p><p>BAKER: All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So Bourne over Mission Impossible.</p><p>BAKER: Yes. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. I'm coming with you on that Mike Baker. But I -- you frighten so, of course, I will --</p><p>BAKER: I'm sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, a new crisis for Wells Fargo, hundreds of people looking to save their homes are forced into foreclosure because of a computer glitch. The latest woes for Wells ahead.</p><p>And move to Italy and eat Nutella all day long, details on what some called the world's yummiest jobs next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wells Fargo under fire again, hundreds of people losing their homes due to a computer glitch. Gerri Willis, you can't make it up.</p><p>WILLIS: Here we go again, you got that right Dagen. Wells Fargo admitting to a glitch that led to hundreds of home for closures.</p><p>Now the bank says that a calculation error led to as many as 400 struggling home owners needlessly losing their homes to foreclosure, the culprit, a modification tool online that wrongly factored lawyer's fees into a formula that calculated government mortgages system in the wake of a housing crash.</p><p>As many as 650 applicants were incorrectly denied modifications. Now the details of this in a regulatory filing by the bank, the company setting aside $8 million in the second quarter to fix the problem which were works out to about $20,000 per home owner. But this isn't the first problem for Wells snapped by a long shot.</p><p>Check out this timeline of troubles for the bank and I should say here, we don't have everything in this timeline because you don't have time for everything in this timeline. A fake account scandal revealed in September of 2016, the SEC investigation of that account scandal in which bank employees open accounts customers didn't need and didn't want in return for bonuses.</p><p>But it wasn't just the consumer banking business an issue. In July 2017, allegations said the bank had properly sold auto insurance. That same year the bank was also accused of selling dangerous investments to brokerage clients.</p><p>The bank has been fined $1 billion for the -- from the CFPB for mortgage abuses but the list of troubles goes on in nearly every line of businesses seems to me including F.X., no matter where work -- look, whether the bank was dealing with consumers or was dealing with their -- with their institutional clients, big problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lee, how did they handle it in terms of messaging because this just stinks to high heaven?</p><p>CARTER: You know, I think that for the most part they've done a pretty good job considering the magnitude of the problems that they've had. Now, the question I always have when you -- when you -- no matter how or who you message, the more scandals that happen, trust the road.</p><p>Like you've got to get it all out at some point. I think this is going to be -- this of all of the problems I think is going to hurt.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And I think these and other stories are going to be rallying cry perhaps in the midterms around the deregulatory push that the administration has and this is the reason why you have regulations in the eyes of people who are in favor in regulations.</p><p>WILLIS: Well I mean -- look, they have tried to set the record straight here and move beyond it. And what's interesting to me Dagen, I know you watch this story very closely is that people haven't run away.</p><p>You know, the consumer is not gone from Wells Fargo. I mean, that's' where you would expect the pedal to really hit the metal as people see these headlines, that consumers would take their accounts elsewhere. We've some of that but not a ton of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's inertia, that's part of it. But if -- in terms of big banks, they're just not that many in the country. But will you see people turning to these smaller community banks because they are everywhere. You're raising your hands.</p><p>BAKER: I'll put my -- I'll put my hand up because I'm one of those people that moved. We were --</p><p>CARTER: Really?</p><p>BAKER: -- with Wells Fargo for a long time and we went through that process. I can tell you what I think one of the reasons why people don't do it is because it's painful. But you -- you -- there's a lot of work involved and you're busy doing everything else in your day, right?</p><p>So all of a sudden you got to move your finances to a new institution. So -- but we did because after a while we just got fed up.</p><p>WILLIS: Well -- and you know look, this is going to go on, people are going to continue to watch this. The fees are still piling up. I mentioned the $1 billion from the CFPB, but they've got lots of other fines as well. And you better bet after this news they're going to have mre.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I was thinking lawsuits. That --</p><p>CARTER: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- you kick people out of their homes unfairly, the trial lawyers are running up.</p><p>WILLIS: They make people sign those agreements though to arbitrate. So that's one way they've stayed out of trouble in courthouses across the country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. Good point. Good point. Did you move your business accounts too from Wells Fargo?</p><p>BAKER: No. No. The long-time personal finances, but I have businesses elsewhere, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But not at Wells Fargo?</p><p>BAKER: That's a national security issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Gerri, great --</p><p>WILLIS: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Gerri Willis.

It took me a couple of days to figure out what the X's meant.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, again, it just makes a statement.</p><p>TARLOV: Oh, it definitely does. And picked them Socialists with the wilting flowers, it's interesting when you see these trends happen like that. I think it's a very serious issue that we certainly should be talking about. I think there's a difference between what went on with Alex Jones and what went on with Candace Owens.</p><p>Here, they certainly made a mistake, and obviously, their algorithms picked up what Candace was doing and she was making a point that I think does need to be made about Sarah Jones' tweets, which apparently go back to 2012, even it wasn't just the latest rash.</p><p>As for Alex Jones, I don't know if you saw last week, that he's actually suing parents whose child died in Sandy Hook for a hundred thousand dollars to cover -- help him cover legal fees. That family was forced to move six or seven times, because of the fact that Alex Jones was not only spreading lies at them.</p><p>You know, he said that they were actor -- child actors there, but releasing information as to where they lived so they haven't been safe and they've been moving with their daughter who's the same age, she was a twin with their son that died. So, there's a little bit of a difference there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I think that very often when you see companies shutting down a podcast like with Apple and what Facebook did, Matt, it's -- they are covering their you-know-whats because of legal liability.</p><p>In some instances, that's my go-to thought, but I will say in terms of the treatment of Conservatives, broadly speaking, looking at the Candace Owens situation, it actually fuels the Trump base because they do feel like they're being silenced and it actually makes them more -- I was talking to Lee Carter and Lee's going to get into this as the show moves on.</p><p>But, you look at -- she was testing these rallies and people are more devoted to Trump than ever before. What say you, Matt?</p><p>MATT BRAYNARD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LOOK AHEAD AMERICA: Yes, I think the real question here is, like, who's going to be next, because at least in Alex Jones' case, the language that they used was that, you know, it was hate speech. And that's a very broad term and it's not really clear on any given day what that means to these tech companies.</p><p>It's important to remember that the personnel is policy and stacked from the bottom to the top of the corporate leadership. Department heads of all these tech companies, they are hard-core leftists.</p><p>And if this is just the first example of them censoring somebody or going after somebody, it just makes me wonder who is next, whose unfavorable opinions will be targeted next for de-platforming by Apple or anyone of these larger -- other large social media companies and will people who opposed go immigration or question the latest on gender politics or pro- lifers.</p><p>I mean, at what point does it cross that \"hate speech\" line, especially relying on far left-organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center to define exactly what hate speech is, which includes this network here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Matt, what I'm saying is that, actually, that the outrage at the social media sites is actually -- it's somehow in an upside down world. It works to the candidates' benefit. It works to President Trump's benefit.</p><p>The laziness of many people on television media because it's just -- it's easier to accuse President Trump of having lost his mind or being deranged or being mentally ill, than to actually do policy work and understand, say, his trade policy.</p><p>What I'm saying is the outrage generated by these social media platforms in trying to censor Conservatives. It actually whips up the base.</p><p>BRAYNARD: I can see that there is definitely some pushback. And when you -- when these stories come out, it certainly does make people much more skeptical of these large hegemonies of technology. But it does concern us, though, that they are essentially removing platform.</p><p>The platform in many cases of funding and in the cases of Google, for removing advertising options for right-wing Conservative voices, patriotic voices, along with --</p><p>You know, just deleting podcast, whole cell, not particular ones, but the entire podcast series of Alex Jones. And not to defend him but it does -- it is a troubling sign, as if there's no appeal in Facebook or Twitter takes away your account or blocks you. There's no remedy, you're just stuck with it and because you have just a --</p><p>MCDOWELL: With the podcast, you can deliver your own podcast and you can still download -- like there are myriad podcast apps that you can use to listen to a podcast. It doesn't -- it might -- being on Apple's platform, it does generate listeners.</p><p>But I just want to make that point that if you can put it up on website and people can listen to and watch what you put out there, because quite frankly, the first amendment.</p><p>But I want to switch gears to Senator Elizabeth Warren, fuelling rumors, Jessica Tarlov, over a 2020 run, this is over the weekend, here is what she had to say, she's not afraid to be the underdog.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS: It won't be easy. We are going to have to fight uphill. But me, I'm going up that hill and I hope you are too. And I hope that when you do, you'll reach your hand out and bring someone else along for the climb.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jessica, that was the Netroots conference, down in New Orleans, I know you were glued to the internet watching those -- watching those --</p><p>TARLOV: I didn't go out all weekend.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's a lot of slogan there, but what about policy?</p><p>TARLOV: Well, she certainly has a set of policies and they're very aligned with Bernie Sanders' policies and the Dems Socialist line, you can listen to Cynthia Nixon, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance. You can hear what Elizabeth Warren is all about, and frankly, she has been incredibly vocal for a long time now.</p><p>And you do know what she stands for. The Democrats feel, that I think the most I've seen is a list of about 35, it is wide. Apparently, Joe Biden is the leader right now, in most of the polling, that seems -- I really do love Joe Biden, but it feels like we need a fresher face, someone that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, let me just be blunt, how excited are the Democrats about running an old-white guy?</p><p>TARLOV: I -- not great.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He would appeal to some of the same base that President Trump does, mid-Western grit --</p><p>TARLOV: And Obama's base as well. He is utterly beloved in the party, and actually, a lot of Republicans are a fan of him, as well, you can't deny what kind of great person he is. I think age is an issue whether you're a man or a woman, going into this primary, I think, will you see Kamala Harris taking a more prominent role, really putting herself out there, I think she'll be there.</p><p>I'm really interested to see President Obama has been meeting with a lot of big-city mayors, I wonder where that'll go. I don't think Eric Garcetti or Mitch Landrieu will be our nominee, but I certainly to counter the businessman president, to have someone with executive experience, I think, is worthwhile.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here, I'm going to go out on a limb and say, one individual who's not going to run for the presidency, would be Rahm Emanuel --</p><p>TARLOV: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: in terms of mayors in the city of Chicago, and he can't even -- and he can't even stop the death toll from rising from gun violence, we saw that over the weekend. Matt, your reaction to that, because Jessica did mention, age is an issue in terms of the Democrats, but then, everybody seems to turn their attention to Alexandria --</p><p>TARLOV: Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ocasio-Cortez, thank you very much, who brags about having an economics degree, but doesn't know how the unemployment rate is calculated.</p><p>BRAYNARD: Yes. I think that throwing names out like Joe Biden and Liz Warren, is just a sign of weakness of the field. They really don't have any strong candidates. And honestly, for them to suggest Liz Warren as a credible candidate, somebody whose name we would never know had she not lied about her ethnicity to go --</p><p>TARLOV: Matt --</p><p>BRAYNARD: It's just a sign of pure weakness on their part. And I would love to be throwing the briar patch of running a general election against Liz Warren, but i don't think the Democratic Party is even that suicidal. But I could be wrong.</p><p>TARLOV: Well, I don't know if it's suicidal, you are wrong, and you are also wrong about Liz Warren's name only being related to the fact that she \"lied about her--</p><p>BRAYNARD: She was --</p><p>TARLOV: Listen.</p><p>BRAYNARD: She got a job at Harvard because of that and that allowed her to run to the senate in Massachusetts.</p><p>TARLOV: This is a whole other segment that we should have, I think that's incredibly irresponsible thing to say.</p><p>BRAYNARD: I don't think we can bring up Liz Warren without -- it's the truth. I mean, I don't think we can -- I don't think we can let that slide. I mean, it's --</p><p>TARLOV: I know that's the kind of campaign that you would run and if, you know, work for President Trump, again, I'm sure you'll be out there on the front lines doing something like that. I just don't think it's responsible</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I will weigh in on something, since this is a business show, this is -- since this is a business show, I will weigh in on something that I hear more and more from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I want to get her name right, and Bernie Sanders and even Elizabeth Warren, Medicare for all.</p><p>TARLOV: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So we now know how much that's going to cost.</p><p>TARLOV: 30 trillion, thirty-two.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, almost $33 trillion over just the first 10 years. You would need to double what the federal government collects in individual and corporate taxes to pay for it, and it still wouldn't cover the cost of it.</p><p>TARLOV: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And this is Medicare, is going broke in eight years. Medicare, the hospital trust fund is broke in eight years. We haven't fixed it, nobody talks about fixing it, but now, we're talk about Medicare for all. I mean, it's a great tag line, Jessica --</p><p>TARLOV: Of course, it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But there's no plan to pay for it.</p><p>TARLOV: Well, I'm sure they will get to you. Bernie Sanders has been out there, pumping it up. I think there was report from the Cato Institute about Medicare for all, conversations with the Koch brothers. Listen, I think that that interview with Trevor Noah was disastrous.</p><p>For the Dems Socialist platform, there is now Medicare for all caucus, but if you look at races like Ohio, tomorrow, for instance, special election there. Danny O'Connor is out there saying, not going to work, let's fix Obamacare, which is exactly where Democrats should be, going into the 2018 election and making smart decisions.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, let me -- we'll get into that, Jessica, because actually, we got such good news on those premium increases. The premium increases that we've heard about in some states last week are lower than they've been in recent years. The premium increases in the Obamacare plans, they're actually falling in some areas.</p><p>TARLOV: Well, Obamacare has lowered the cost of healthcare across the country in terms of the rate at which -- the rate at which healthcare costs are increasing, lowered under President Obama, fact-check me, all day, on that, Matt.</p><p>BRAYNARD: Oh, yes. The cost totally dropped, just as he promised they would, dropped by an average of $2,500 per family, which he promised, absolutely not, they continue to increase. And just having you repeat that, it's almost like getting banned on Twitter, it just excites Conservatives more because --</p><p>TARLOV: Conservatives hate me anyway.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But Matt -- but Matt --</p><p>BRAYNARD: I don't think they know who you are.</p><p>MCDOWELL: my point in bringing up the lower increases in premiums by some insurers in Obamacare plans, that benefits the Conservatives who failed the Republicans, who fail to really fix Obamacare, except for the fact that they repealed the individual mandate and the Trump administration through rule-making, has opened the door for shorter-term health plans.</p><p>So I'm saying that that actually benefits Republicans, particularly those in the Senate, who fail to get through the repeal and replace that passed in the House, final word?</p><p>BRAYNARD: Yes, I just want to say, I think, you're right there. It will be helpful but ultimately, what's important is the fact that healthcare costs can be offset by the fact that there are more Americans employed more than ever.</p><p>The economy is growing faster than it ever has, in a long time, and a lot of that credit goes to the President, and that's going to go down the ticket when people decide who to vote for this November and perhaps, tomorrow, on the special election.</p><p>TARLOV: Healthcare issue, number one, in a lot of races, special elections and primaries, Democrats are slaying on the healthcare issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I will add this, I sat on this set with Kellyanne Conway right when she joined the Trump campaign and the Hillary Clinton campaign underestimated how much that would impact who people voted for that November, and so the Republicans should not underestimate it in this midterm election. Jessica Tarlov, Matt Braynard, thank you both.</p><p>TARLOV: Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Coming up, the California wildfires take on epic new proportions as one blaze nearly doubles in size, we have the latest. And Samsung's new Galaxy Note 9, details are leaked from an interesting source, more on that, in minutes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: One of the world's greatest chefs has passed away. Kristina Partsinevelos has the details, Kristina?</p><p>KRISTINA PATSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Dagen, Joel Robuchon was named the -- the \"chef of the century\" by the famous French restaurant guide Gault Millau in 1990. He was known for mashed potatoes among other dishes and had open restaurants in cities across the globe including Paris, Monaco, Hong Kong, Las Vegas, Tokyo and New York. His restaurants currently hold a record of 32 Michelin stars; he also mentored numerous other chefs such as T.V. personality: Gordon Ramsey. Robuchon died at 73 after a long battle well cancer.</p><p>And fans are also remembering Charlotte Rae actress best known as Mrs. Garrett on the long-running sitcom, \"The Facts of Life\" has died.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHARLOTTE RAE, ACTRESS: I have to get going. I got to make the bed, back in the rug, do the laundry, scrub the floors, clean the windows, everything has got to be perfect.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Her family says, she died peacefully in her home in Los Angeles yesterday. The cause of her death has not been released but last year she did reveal she had been diagnosed with bone cancer. The Tony and Emmy-nominated actress' career spent six decades. Charlotte Rae was 92 years old.</p><p>And catastrophic wildfires continue to ravage California with one doubling in size over the weekend, making it the fourth largest wild fire in state history. There are now a total of 17 fires burning across the state claiming the lives of seven people and destroying thousands of acres. Meanwhile, President Trump has declared a state of emergency in California ordering federal funding to help with the recovery efforts but he also tweeted: \"California wildfires are being magnified and made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being divert into the Pacific Ocean. Must also treat clear to stop fire spreading.\"</p><p>And on a lighter note, we'll switch over to Nutella. If you love Nutella, then you're about to discover your dream job. The Ferrero company, maker of Nutella and Ferrero Rocher chocolates is looking for 60 sensory judges who will get paid to taste its product after, of course, you need a three- month rigorous training course. 40 of the 60 people will go on to become testers. But there's a catch, you have to be willing to relocate to Ferrero's headquarters in Alba, Italy. So, I don't think this is too bad of a gig. What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I defer to my baker on that. And thank you for the Joel Robuchon --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: I don't know why I said it like that. I know -- it just came out naturally, I'm sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, he's French.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: He is French.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And you have to say it --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: And then I was going to say -- I don't know, I was just on a roll there, just going back. Quebec French.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll take it any day. Nutella taster?</p><p>BAKER: Turn it into a reality show, right? 40 of the 60 contestants get to on to become actual testers. You got a three-months training. This is ready made. You know, reality T.V. is all about finding something that's already happening and throw in cameras in front of it. So, that's what I'm saying and, and otherwise I'm not a big fan of Nutella, what can I say?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because something is deeply wrong with you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, Warren Buffett becomes one of biggest winners as Apple hits $1 trillion in market value. After the magical milestone, everyone has predictions for the tech giant's next move. We take a closer look next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Samsung's new Galaxy Note 9 launches on Thursday and the details are being leaked by Samsung. The box with the device was spotted at Russian store revealing a 6.4-inch display, a dual rear camera with 12 mega-pixels, and an 8 mega-pixels front selfie camera. As previously reported, the note's pen will have remote-control type functionality.</p><p>Meantime, Apple making investors happy after becoming the world's first $1 trillion company last week. One of the winners is Warren Buffett who (INAUDIBLE) are half way owned to five percent stake in Apple, now worth nearly $50 billion. Joining me now, CFRA Senior Equity Analyst, Angelo Zino. Angelo, Buffett usually shies away from tech stocks. This is a winner for him and also, what do you make about the Samsung phone given Apple a run for its money.</p><p>ANGELO ZINO, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, CFRA: Yes, absolutely. So, you know, in terms of Samsung and these leaks going on, you wonder if there're really, you know, leaks because, you know, at this point in time we continue to see the stuff -- you know, ahead of these launches, you know, year in and year out. But that being said, I mean, when we look at kind of some of the details of the event coming here on Thursday, little that, you know, really gets us excited on the front of Samsung.</p><p>That being said, as far as Apple is concerned -- I mean, the results last week were absolutely spectacular. Looking at Warren Buffett here, I mean, I think he continues to kind of cement and put kind of the cherry on the top as far as Apple is concerned. Him being the third largest investor there. He is just naturally going to continue to up his stake just via the buybacks you see from Apple here. But, you know, all in all, we continue to believe cash is king and Apple is here to stay with this trillion-dollar valuation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I think Warren Buffett -- this is about Apple and not Buffett. Buffett is like a molt to a flame in terms of seeking media attention. He's going to glom onto Apple's success. I'm not dismissing the fact that he has stake in Apple, but again, this is Apple's story not Buffet's story.</p><p>BAKER: No question. Angelo, just take a look at Apple for a second, what's next? So, we're talking about Samsung, and that's just more product innovation. Is there around product innovation? Do they stay with the customer space, do they branch out the way Amazon has in terms of having cloud business which is really a business to business, business?</p><p>ZINO: Yes. So, when we look at Apple here, it's funny because most people look at Apple and they say, hey, this is a one-hit wonder kind of company, it's the iPhone and that's it. And, you know, we continue to believe when we look at Apple the next step forward for them continues to be on the wearable side; that grew 60 percent year over year. We expect something along the lines of augmented reality glasses by 2020.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because that was such a winner for Google. Those Google glass - - died on the vine.</p><p>ZINO: Right. But, you know, we do think Apple is going to do a lot better. We're going to have 5D eventually roll out. We think the capability of 5D along with these A.R. glasses will be a big hit for Apple over time. I think also, of course, that service's business which grew north of 30 percent as they shift toward more kind of subscription-based offerings, I think that's the model for Apple.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Angelo good to see you, Angelo Zino, take care. Still ahead, it's National Root Beer Float Day. We're raising a glass to this American classic, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, August 6th, your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern. Escalating trade tensions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018080601cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SYY-8WN1-DXH2-603M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7899\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 6, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

Since 2014, she has slapped Google with eye-popping multibillion-dollar antitrust penalties, ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes and fined Facebook over its WhatsApp acquisition - flagship enforcement cases that have struck fear into Silicon Valley while drawing attention in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Now, in her final year in office, the 50-year-old Danish politician is laying the groundwork for a new phase of regulation beyond the end of her term in October.</p><p>She's planning a report meant to guide EU competition policies in the era of digitization. Feedback from companies, business groups and experts shows many see the need for more regulation and when it's published in March, the report by three expert advisers will reflect the need for new or tougher rules, she told The Associated Press in a recent interview.</p><p>\"The most important thing is that the majority of input is pro-enforcement,\" Vestager said during one of her frequent visits to Copenhagen from her Brussels base. The digital technology industry can no longer be allowed to shape itself, she added. \"We are way beyond that.\"</p><p>It's unclear yet what shape the new enforcement will take but it may not bode well for the big U.S. technology companies that have landed in Vestager's crosshairs.</p><p>Vestager has cultivated a down-to-earth image - she likes to knit elephants during meetings - that belies her formidable powers of enforcement.</p><p>She opened three antitrust cases against Google, including one that resulted in a record 4.3 billion euro ($5 billion) fine for forcing cellphone makers to use the internet giant's software on Android phones. Another 2.4 billion euro ($2.8 billion) penalty was punishment for manipulating shopping search results. She aims to wrap up a probe before her term ends of whether Google blocked rivals from its AdSense ad service.</p><p>Vestager ordered Apple to pay back up to 13 billion euros ($15 billion) in back taxes from Ireland. Apple CEO Tim Cook called it \"total political crap\" and President Donald Trump referred to her as the \"tax lady\" who \"really hates the U.S.\"</p><p>The EU competition commissioner, with a 900-strong staff, is unusually powerful in the Brussels bureaucracy because it can enforce bloc-wide rules, giving it the power to take on countries and companies. Other departments typically share regulatory duties with national governments.</p><p>Vestager's job includes approving or rejecting mergers and investigating cartels and antitrust behavior. She also makes sure EU states don't give tax breaks to individual companies that are not available to other corporations - legitimate business strategy in the U.S. but illegal in Europe.</p><p>A lot of attention is now falling on data, the commodity that drives the digital economy.</p><p>Information collected by web browsers, apps, smartphones and other devices can be enormously valuable to companies because they can provide insight about, for example, an individual's buying habits and movements. Data can power artificial intelligence or be used to show targeted advertisements. Vestager is concerned that a small group of companies could corner the market and abuse their power.</p><p>She started confronting the problem with an informal probe launched last year into whether online shopping giant Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. She hopes to decide within six months whether to open a formal investigation.</p><p>Many people still aren't sure how to take control of their personal information. New European privacy rules introduced last year were a start, obliging companies to be more transparent with customers about what they do with people's data. But consumers are often still overwhelmed by detailed consent forms for third-party tracking on each new site they visit or the fine print of an app's service terms.</p><p>Vestager, a member of a small left-wing political party who believes in free markets, said the private sector can play a role in finding solutions.</p><p>\"I think you need products that will help you exercise your rights. Independent digital assistants that will make sure that your privacy settings are maintained no matter where you go. That kind of stuff,\" she said.</p><p>Vestager, whose party was founded by her great-grandfather, was Denmark's deputy prime minister and economy minister before taking up her post in Brussels in late 2014. She reportedly keeps a sculpture of a hand with an extended middle finger in her office, a gift from a Danish trade union angered by her welfare cuts.</p><p>She's said to be one of the inspirations for the lead character in the Danish TV show \"Borgen,\" about an ambitious minor politician trying to become the country's first female prime minister.</p><p>Although Vestager's term runs out in October, she's hoping for a second stint, an unlikely prospect because her party is out of power in Denmark and its prospects look uncertain in upcoming elections. The EU's executive commissioners are nominated by their country's governments.</p><p>\"Sometimes things are unlikely but not impossible,\" Vestager said. \"I'm in the middle of something and we're not done yet,\" she added, referring to the new era of digital regulation.</p><p>Vestager brushes off criticism that she's stifling innovation by targeting U.S. companies to help prop up European firms. She has also taken on Starbucks, McDonald's and this month opened an investigation into Nike's tax arrangements. But other targets have included Italian automaker Fiat and Russian gas giant Gazprom.</p><p>\"When you look at our cases, you'd see that what they have in common is not nationality. It's the fact that they're multinationals.\"</p><p>Her aim, she says, is to keep competition fair.</p><p>\"That was the idea before the world became digital,\" Vestager said. \"And it becomes an even more important idea when the world becomes digital because things are so fast moving.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-d5877bf6210b11e98204bca9cec3800d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9P-JV81-JBKM-D0MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 28, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Google and Facebook together controlled 60% of mobile ad revenue and 51% of digital ad revenue globally in 2018, according to eMarketer. In the US, Apple has about 45% of the smartphone market; about 47% of all US e-commerce sales go through Amazon.com.<br/>Under modern antitrust enforcement, however, those percentages alone aren't enough to alarm regulators in the US. What's illegal is for a monopoly to abuse its market power to prevent rivals from threatening its position. <br/>US courts ruled Microsoft did so in the 1990s.<br/>But the EU law sets a lower bar for finding abuse of dominance. It's evidenced by three antitrust actions against Google in as many years carrying penalties that total $9.3bn. <br/>Interestingly, the US chose not to bring charges against Google for the same conduct the EU found illegal.<br/>The US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which both have a mandate to enforce antitrust laws, are now working together to ramp up oversight of the technology giants. <br/>In Asia, Japan's Fair Trade Commission says Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon need to be examined for possible abuse of their market dominance. South Korea's commission was reported last year to be looking into whether Google Korea was abusing its market position to pressure local game companies to upload their products only onto the Google Play platform. <br/>In China, censorship and government control over Internet access have made it difficult for US techies to compete with the likes of Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent.<br/>For sure, tech giants like Amazon and Facebook have leverage over both producers and consumers. They are also growing by snapping up potential rivals that might threaten market share. Data compiled by Bloomberg show the big five - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft - have made 431 acquisitions worth $155.7bn over the last decade. <br/>The companies also have control over vast amounts of data about their customers, raising concerns about threats to privacy.<br/>The Silicon Valley executives are waking up to the backlash, striking a more conciliatory note and saying they want to work with authorities on a range of challenges. They argue that their dominance is hardly durable because barriers to entry are low for new competitors. <br/>Google is fond of saying competition is just \"one click away.\" <br/>Fundamentally, social media users are driven by the same ancient desire: Human Connection. But that has for long been crowded out by addictive technology, amazing products and invasive corporate branding.<br/>Longer term, the inescapable truth for the Big Tech is growing loud and clear: Techies can thrive only if people and regulators trust them. Amid a growing backlash, tech superpowers will need to figure out how to regain that trust.</p><p><br/> Gulf Times Newspaper 2019  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLFTMS-154210677</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLFTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2V-Y0H1-JDJN-618D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381159</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"545\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf Times Newspaper Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Personal data is subsequently repackaged - anonymised or not - and sold to advertisers and marketers. Some form of equilibrium establishes itself - in theory - between convenience and value for the users, to whom the services appear to be free, and financial rewards for the platforms which monetize the personal data collected to generate revenues. </p><p>In reality, the balance has been tilted over time in colossal proportions towards tech firms, whose valuations and profits have soared to historic heights as a result. Yet it seems that this model may be reaching crisis point. The Pew Research Center recently reported that 64% of Americans have personally experienced a major data breach. And beyond technical and financial considerations, this also impacts confidence negatively, as highlighted by the Axios-Harris Poll 100[1], suggesting that Americans consider data privacy as the top priority companies should address. This follows a record number of data breaches reported since 2016, in particular in the US. Following scandals such as the one surrounding Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, people have become increasingly aware of their online vulnerability and distrust [2]for large platforms is setting in more widely. The unavoidable rise of the Internet of Things will only make the issue more complex, as increasingly more intrusive and personal data will start to be collected about each of us \u2014 sometimes unbeknownst to us. Smart speakers, for example, bring intensive, real-time data collection to the comfort of our own living-rooms. This poses new challenges around the issue of consent and privacy: Why would you agree to have your conversation with your friends recorded simply because they own a certain type of smart assistant device? The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), was a first step to ensure individuals' hold over their data. Yet, it remains a European initiative and it is still too early[3] to draw conclusions on its actual impact. In some industries, the quality expectations around the data required are so high that organisations willingly pay for it. This is the case for example in academic research in which field experiments often require highly precise data. Researchers usually conduct deeply informative surveys on a wide number of participants (to obtain representative samples) who are remunerated for their answers. If big tech firms were to move towards similar business models where they pay their users for their personal data, could it be a first step towards more transparency and the rebuilding of trust? (a key factor for their long-term success, and the digital transformation of society at large, free of excessive regulation). The question around data monetization should be at the heart of the evolution of the tech industry for the next decade, but how can it be fair for all, transparent and work at scale? A first approach to this question could be a top-down valuation of personal data established by online platforms. For example, economists drafted an experiment to value the free services, currently subsidized by the trading of personal data, of some web platforms. Participants on average responded that they were willing to leave Facebook for 110$ and Whatsapp for 600$[4] - thus valuing the personal data they deliberately provide to those platforms at those prices. Such model would however require a tougher enforcement of cybersecurity measures to guarantee that data usage is - and remains - as authorized by the user. As platforms would now be paying for our data, chances are that they would be able to use it but not possess it. In case of data breaches, they would therefore incur a greater liability with respect to their users who will now own and 'lend' their data. An alternative to this top-down model thought by and for large platforms is nonetheless possible. The tokenization[5] - the process of replacing and valuing data with a secured identification symbol - offers such perspective. If tokens were to be backed by personal data and decentralized into a public blockchain, a new, bottom-up, market mechanism could emerge. Cryptocurrencies might be a channel through which individuals value data. Large platforms needing to access and crawl data, such as Facebook or Google, would purchase the token corresponding to personal data directly to their miners (their users), in a secured way. In turn, the aggregation of tokens sold by individuals and purchased by firms would generate a new market thereby establishing a natural valuation of available tokens. Such mechanism offers interesting perspectives as users would easily track their personal data value but also actively engage in the data market over which they will be able to share directly the growing benefits. Yet answering the question of scalability isn't that easy. The boom and bust witnessed by the ICO market in 2018 proved that the relative convenience and liquidity of tokens can easily lead to large speculative trends. And while trading with cryptocurrencies which did not back highly tangible products or services had no real impact besides financial losses and ecological damages, a similar situation with our personal data would present very high risks for society. The scalability of such project thus presents as many hopes as risks - that shall be further investigated before diving in a new paradigm. Originally published here[6].

The session was moderated by ICCSL Chairman Dinesh Weerakkody and Standard Chartered Bank former economist Samantha Amerasinghe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our financial system has proved very resilient over the past 50 years. No reason to doubt it will bounce back after this crisis. The 'bounce back' is the unknown this time. Little of what we know, are familiar with and can deal with successfully, will be the same as before - customers, demand, value propositions, savings habits, revenue streams. An eminent panel which included Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy former Governor Central Bank of Sri Lanka, and a cross-section of business leaders from the banking sector, consulting firms, academia and multilateral institutions shared their invaluable insights on building resiliency in the financial system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The panellists shed light on how businesses and countries are navigating through these challenging times, this so-called paradigm shift brought about by COVID-19. It was clear from the remarks of the panellists that resilience in the financial system is imperative to weather the storms in this era of disruption.</p><p>Opportunities and threats for the financial sector</p><p>Dr. Coomaraswamy shared his insights on the opportunities and threats for the financial sector stating that he sees two mitigating factors - first the medical aspects of the pandemic have been handled well and he expressed confidence that we should see a recovery if we are able to contain the pandemic. As the economy was not in a sound position pre-COVID, Sri Lanka will need to undertake structural reforms and have a sound medium-term macroeconomic framework in place to ensure a robust 'bounce back'. The second mitigating factor is that 70-75% of aggregate demand is accounted for by domestic demand. In normal circumstances this would be a drag on growth but at this juncture, being insulated from the external sector is an advantage.</p><p>He also opined that banks have played a unique role in Sri Lanka, while in other countries governments and central banks have taken the lead in terms of providing fiscal stimulus to keep businesses and households afloat. In Sri Lanka, the government has played a crucial role but it has been constrained by a severe lack of fiscal space. Dr. Coomaraswamy also asserted that the fiscal constraints afflicting the country are not the responsibility of one government but the collective failure of a succession of governments over the decades. He emphasised that all banks must do the maximum to ensure that asset quality does not deteriorate to the point where solvency of banks becomes a threat. Dr. Jameel Khadaroo, former Deputy Governor at the Central Bank of Mauritius also underscored the importance of rethinking structural policies to adapt to the 'new normal'.</p><p>Presenting the right picture to potential investors</p><p>CA President Manil Jayasinghe stressed the importance of presenting the 'right picture to potential investors' in terms of impairment provisioning. He commented that the moratoriums ending in September 2020 should not impact impairment provisioning. If credit risk in banks has worsened, then provisions need to be put in place now. Banks should not 'hide behind the moratorium' and subsequently have huge provisions when the moratorium ends.</p><p>What Sri Lanka needs to do after the crisis</p><p>Given the huge push globally to keep SMEs alive during this pandemic, IFC South Asia Regional Manager Rolf Behrndt highlighted that the IFC has initiated an $ 8 billion COVID fund to provide liquidity to help clients in the financial sector as a conduit to reach SMEs. Behrndt shared his thoughts on what Sri Lanka needs to do to rebound after the crisis; he asserted that Sri Lanka needs to move towards keeping value-added in manufacturing in the country and that there are opportunities in the agriculture and ICT sectors for Sri Lanka to move up the value chain in processing.</p><p>On the topic of making South Asia's economies more resilient to climate change, Behrndt commented that the sustainable finance roadmap launched by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has the support of the IFC and in terms of renewable energy initiatives the IFC is working in close collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka to add 380 MW of wind and solar power to the energy grid. Dr. Coomaraswamy added that the Central Bank is working closely with the IFC on Green Finance initiatives and has made some headway with banks in terms of tapping into global and regional funds.</p><p>Policies around data governance and open banking critical for financial sector</p><p>SCB CEO Bingumal Thewarathanthri stated that he would like to see banking sector practices evolving in a post-COVID world to embrace working from home, digitisation and the introduction of a digital ID for the country as a means to real time digital onboarding and cited policies around data governance and open banking as critical for the financial sector.</p><p>Thewarathanthri asserted that the pandemic has presented banks and corporates with a great opportunity to change work practices, but that it's imperative that they recognise the opportunity to partner with fintechs to provide value-added services to the bankable population. He also identified two critical success factors - the need for one integrated digital platform for all government payments and a cohesive approach in the banking sector with all banks working towards a common end-goal.</p><p>Reeling from the shock</p><p>On the question of what would be the 'new normal' for venture capital, private equity and hedge funds, McKinsey India Senior Partner Toshan Tamhane emphasised that though these firms are reeling from the shock caused by COVID-19 and are undergoing major stress in their ability to infuse new funds, they are also seeking new opportunities. Many companies are reassessing their supply chains and there has been significant interest in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, energy and renewables and financial services (banking and insurance).</p><p>Regulators have to grapple with creating the right framework for building stability given that from a resiliency standpoint threats to the financial sector such as cyber-attacks are often not in the country itself. He added, 'Innovation and stability will have to go hand-in-hand if we are to take advantage of this paradigm shift and the opportunities it has provided.'</p><p>Mastercard India Head of Engagement Santosh Kumar commented that he has seen a shift in the manner in which people transact on e-commerce and digital platforms away from tourism and hotels and towards essential items. Many merchants are also moving to the digital ecosystem. He further stated that big tech firms are disrupting the business model with more countries moving to a cashless society.</p><p>Investment in foresight capabilities is imperative</p><p>Dr. Noel Tagoe expressed his disappointment with governments across the world as he believes they have 'focused too much on saving lives and not enough on saving livelihoods.' Governments' in his view should 'see sooner, act faster'.</p><p>Dr. Tagoe stressed that investment in foresight capabilities is imperative if we are to move ahead of the curve and we have the tech tools to enable us to do so. He pointed out that there needs to be a 'cultural and mindset shift' for accountants and finance professionals to embrace new technologies. Furthermore, there needs to be policy flexibility and the international community must work together. Restoring trust and confidence in institutions through humility in leadership and transparency is the key to moving forward in the 'new normal'.</p><p>'New normal' unique to each country and sector</p><p>The concept of the 'new normal' was questioned by UNESCAP Economist Dr. Masato Abe, who stated that this phenomenon is unique to each country and sector. He stated that the ESG framework should be embedded in the political and financial systems and there needs to be greater collaboration among governments, financial institutions, businesses and SMEs to ensure that available funds are utilised in the region.</p><p>Moving to a multipolar world</p><p>Another salient point discussed by Dr. Coomaraswamy is that we are living in a world with an increased propensity for major shocks emanating from volatile capital flows, climate extremes and pandemics. We are moving to a multipolar world in which geopolitical risks have been elevated.</p><p>These major shocks translate into disruption of supply chains, international trade and technology. He opined that with all these sources of shocks becoming more prevalent, it is more difficult to deregulate the sector and said that it is 'better to err on the side of caution'. He pointed out that the drive for less regulation was evident even before COVID. The argument that global standards were designed for advanced economies and are too restrictive for developing economies has now gained momentum.</p><p>Dr. Coomaraswamy also emphasised that one needs to strike a balance between embracing technological change and creating the incentives to facilitate the banking sector to become more competitive in the fintech space, while maintaining stability in the system. 'Regulators need to make sure that they don't go too fast so as to undermine the traditional banking sector,' and to avoid major disruption. Dr. Khadaroo also recognised that regulators have a critical role to play in order to maintain the balance between ensuring innovation and preserving financial stability due to the disruption caused by fintechs.</p><p>When asked, 'What is the biggest constraint to achieving financial resilience?' Dr. Coomaraswamy mentioned that financial institutions need to be geared up to support their customers to deal with the following three key elements of the 'new normal' - digitalisation, the entire ESG agenda (not just climate change but also addressing concerns about inequality and diversity), and a less globalised, more local/regional world which will result in businesses having to deal with the trade-offs between efficiency and resilience in their supply chains. From the perspective of the payments industry, Santosh Kumar stated that the biggest constraint is anything that is a hindrance to the world moving to a digital, cashless society. Fractured regulation and the lack of investor confidence were also highlighted as constraints.</p><p>The new normal for Sri Lanka</p><p>To wrap up the session, a final question was posed to all panellists, 'What will the new normal look like for businesses once the crisis is over?' Toshan Tamhane emphasised the need for creative disruption and for understanding the 'new social contract,' the role of governments, corporations and talent in this new normal. Dr. Coomaraswamy summed up the session with one powerful takeaway.</p><p>He stated: 'While all panellists recognise the damage the pandemic has caused, there is also an underlying optimism that we can build back better, and that's what we need to do.'</p><p>The new normal for Sri Lanka, which we have been talking about for decades is to have a stable framework for monetary and fiscal policy and depoliticised institutions which delivers sound macroeconomic fundamentals and also a strong focus on structural reforms which will boost productivity and competitiveness of the economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT070820200000500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JM-21K1-F00C-653P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 7, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0008C7J</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0005JEZ</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED BANK ZIMBABWE LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DFWM</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED BANK NEPAL LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00064QT</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (THAI) PCL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00080WB</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED AUSTRALIA LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0007NIT</classCode><className>BANK OF MAURITIUS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522293 INTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp;

To read more about the exciting opportunities that lie await for the UK, and KTN\u2019s proposed approach, read our new report here.</p><p>During the early years of the internet (in which ARPA, the predecessor of DARPA, played a central role in its development), it would have been hard to imagine some of its present-day applications. In the same way it is difficult to foresee the full impact neurotechnology might have in the future, but new platform technologies that can make use of neural data and link human brains to artificial intelligence are likely to have an enormous economical and societal impact.</p><p>No country yet has an unassailable lead in neurotechnology; however, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 (e.g Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Tencent, Alibaba) and governments across the world, especially in the EU, US and China, are investing considerable amounts of money into its development.</p><p>With the emergence of new neural interface technologies, the UK has the opportunity to be home to a new generation of technology companies. In order to achieve this aspiration, significant investment is needed to develop and grow a UK ecosystem for neurotechnology. Moreover, by ensuring that the UK has a competitive neurotechnology sector, it will have an active role in the development of new international frameworks in ethics, regulations and data security. The importance of this is cast into sharper focus when considering some of the possible risks associated with neurotechnology, such as thoughts and emotions being monitored or even manipulated by companies, governments or others.</p><p>The recent decision to remove all Huawei equipment from UK 5G networks by 2027 demonstrates the government\u2019s commitment to protect the UK\u2019s data from external threats. It is essential that that the government takes an early lead in safeguarding neural data.

He says digitisation has been used to promote deep reductions in the overall welfare budget, a narrowing of the beneficiary pool, the elimination of services, the introduction of demanding and intrusive forms of conditionality, and the pursuit of behavioural modification goals.Digital welfare states risk becoming Trojan Horses for neoliberal hostility towards social protection and regulation, he states. </p><p>\"Moreover, empowering governments in countries with significant rule of law deficits by endowing them with the level of control and the potential for abuse provided by these biometric ID systems should send shudders down the spine of anyone even vaguely concerned to ensure that the digital age will be a human rights friendly one.'And the leading role of the private sector in designing, constructing and often operating significant parts of the digital welfare state is serious reason for concern.'Most governments have stopped short of requiring Big Tech companies to abide by human rights standards, and because the companies themselves have steadfastly resisted any such efforts, the companies often operate in a virtually human rights free-zone,\" says Alston.He points out that while there is no shortage of analyses warning of the dangers for human rights of various manifestations of digital technology and especially artificial intelligence, 'none has adequately captured the full array of threats represented by the emergence of the digital welfare state'. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BRDE107705157164888909325176900113</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRDE-6558</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9Y-77P1-F03R-N1W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"318\"/><timeReceived>9:08 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Brand-e.biz</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 21, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>society</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001591</classCode><className>WELFARE BENEFITS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFNA</classCode><className>RULE OF LAW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;

Although Warren has painted tech giants such as Google and Facebook as modern-day villains in her scathing picture of the American economy, she is emerging as a top choice for donations from tech workers, according to an analysis of campaign contributions by The Boston Globe.</p><p>With her denunciations of big tech and corporate greed, Warren has tapped into simmering discontent within the industry itself about the size, power, and ethics of its companies. So, while tech executives have often resisted calls from Washington to regulate the industry, employees are contributing to Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, the candidates with the most aggressive positions on corporate oversight.</p><p>\"I agree tech companies are becoming increasingly powerful,\" said Vicki Tardif, who works on search products at Google and helped organize a major protest there last fall. She says she has contributed to Warren. \"I'm a citizen first \u2014 I'm a Google employee second.\"</p><p>Looking at just the big four tech companies that she wants to break apart \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google \u2014 and some of their affiliates, Warren received some $144,000 in itemized donations from their employees over the first six months of the year.</p><p>She was second only to Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who raised nearly $149,000 from those employees, in part by holding the kind of private Silicon Valley fund-raisers that Warren eschews. Sanders and California Senator Kamala Harris also raised more than $100,000 from employees of these companies.</p><p>The actual amount of donations from people in the tech industry is certainly higher, but campaign filings list information only about donors who give more than $200; moreover, the names of donors' employers are not always reported consistently.</p><p>Her second-quarter finance report also showed Warren's appeal more broadly across the tech sector, raising at least $142,000 from employees of the big four and seven other US tech giants, including Microsoft and Intel. Buttigieg was tops at $176,000, while Sanders was third, at $95,000.</p><p>Warren has been a particularly vocal critic of big tech in recent months. In March, she detailed a plan that would require the biggest companies \u2014 those with annual revenue of $25\u2009billion \u2014 to separate their technology platforms from their e-commerce activities. So Google's massive ad-sales operation would split off from its ubiquitous search engine; Amazon could not have both an e-commerce platform and a sales business on it.</p><p>She also called for the undoing of \"anticompetitive\" mergers, naming Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp as an example.</p><p>The technology blog Recode greeted the plan with the headline, \"Elizabeth Warren just lost the Silicon Valley vote,\" and Warren herself promptly appeared at the technology conference South by Southwest to face her critics.</p><p>\"Monopolists will make fewer monopoly profits,\" she said then. \"Boo-hoo.\"</p><p>Warren looks to be setting the tone in a Democratic field that is generally taking a harder line toward the industry. Former vice president Joe Biden and Harris have said it is worth taking a look at her plan, but stopped short of a full-throated endorsement. Buttigieg has said he \"potentially\" agrees with it, but, during a town hall in March, raised questions about other aspects of big tech: \"It's not how big they are, it's how they act.\" In May, Sanders said he agreed Facebook should be broken up.</p><p>Warren and other candidates have also called for big corporations such as Amazon to pay significantly more in taxes. But she, in particular, has drawn the ire of conservative tech mogul and Trump ally Peter Thiel, who called her the Democratic candidate he is most scared of.</p><p>In some ways, well-to-do tech employees backing populists such as Warren and Sanders are acting against their own interests. Both candidates are antitrust hawks who want to limit the reach of big corporations; both have supported job actions by low-wage workers at Amazon and drivers for Uber and Lyft.</p><p>Warren's and Sanders' success with tech workers is partially due to the industry's liberal leanings, and many employees interviewed for this story emphasized her overall candidacy in describing her appeal, not her specific positions on big tech.</p><p>\"She's a wonk,\" said Alex Whitworth, a data scientist at Facebook who kicked $250 toward her campaign. \"That's strongly appealing to me, as a wonk.\"</p><p>For other tech donors, their willingness to back candidates critical of their industry may also be due in part to tensions with their bosses. The tech industry has been roiled by walkouts and protests over contracts with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other government agencies and the military. There is also lingering anger over the role social media networks played in the disinformation campaign Russians used in the 2016 elections.</p><p>\"We have this tech-lash phenomenon that's been building over the past few years,\" said Ben Tarnoff, editor of Logic magazine, which covers technology. \"There's a large and vocal constituency in the tech sector that is making the case these companies have a responsibility for the tech they're building.\"</p><p>Interviews with tech employees who support Warren and Sanders reveal a well of reservations about the increasing power of big corporations and enthusiasm for candidates who are addressing it head-on.</p><p>\"I like working at Amazon. It's been the best job of my career,\" said Michael Sokolov, a senior software development engineer who donated $250 to Warren. \"However, I don't like the fact that our economy is dominated by gigantic super-corporations.\"</p><p>Many Democratic candidates have criticized the tech industry while mingling with its luminaries at fund-raisers. Warren's success among its employees could undermine her image as a fierce critic, although her campaign pointed out it has a policy of not holding private fund-raisers or reaching out directly to members of any industry.</p><p>And some of Warren's tech-industry supporters acknowledged being wary about the specifics of her plans to break up their employers.</p><p>Sanders' appeal among tech workers is not new. In 2016, he drew more donations from workers at Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, than from any other employer, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance. And his class-based analysis of the nation's economic ills still appeals to tech employees concerned about low-paid workers in their companies' warehouses, and the insecurity that comes with working as an independent contractor in the gig economy.</p><p>And some of Sanders' tech supporters want him to drill down even further.</p><p>\"I think we expect to see more \u2014 maybe see some politics about collective data regulation,\" said Will Luckman, who is part of a tech-focused working group within the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, which supports Sanders. \"We'd like to see some stuff about gig workers, and how they might be able to reclassify themselves and get collective bargaining rights.\"</p><p>Some of Sanders' 2016 supporters from the tech industry have switched to Warren.</p><p>\"What I have seen from Sanders is mostly calls for a movement without a lot of detail,\" said Annabelle Backman, a software engineer at Amazon who was a state delegate for Sanders in the 2016 primary but has contributed $2,700 to Warren in this cycle.</p><p>And some of Warren's long-held positions align directly with demands of tech workers scrutinizing their own industry. Last fall, thousands of Google employees walked out in protest of the company's policy requiring workers to settle disputes in forced arbitration, instead of through lawsuits, which workers said has allowed Google to keep accusations of serious problems such as sexual assault secret. Warren has been a vocal opponent of forced arbitration for years and proposed prohibiting companies that use the practice from getting federal contracts.</p><p>\"We've been advocating for an end to forced arbitration. We had to push our company for that,\" said Tanuja Gupta, another organizer of the Google walkouts, who has donated $333.82 to Warren's campaign. \"I find it incredibly appealing that there's a political candidate who's willing to do that for all workers and end forced arbitration.\"</p><p>Several donors expressed reservations about Warren's plan to break up tech companies, including whether it would do enough to address the industry's problems.</p><p>\"There's a lot of attention on social media companies failing to rein in fake posts and fake stories and bots and whatnot,\" Backman said. \"Breaking up the social networks is not going to do anything to help that.\"</p><p>But others, wistful for the days when the industry had fewer dominant players and thus more latitude for workers, said Warren's plan was worth a shot.</p><p>\"There's a lot of people in this industry who are amenable to some sort of breakup of big tech,\" Few said. \"It's the penance we must pay for allowing this to get out of control.\"</p><p>Todd Wallack of the Globe staff contributed to this report.
