Today it has not only recovered all its losses, but also hit new record highs having rallied more than 55% from its trough.</p><p>Investors betting against this market have been crushed, leaving short positions at their lowest level in more than a decade. The speed and velocity of this recovery have also been exceptional. By way of comparison, during the 2008 financial crisis, it took four years to recover all the losses from the lows and almost five years to recover from the dot.com bubble sell-off.</p><p>But the record high on the S&amp;P 500 does not explain the full story of this market recovery.</p><p>While Tech and Consumer Discretionary stocks are up 28.6% and 23.1% year to date (YTD) respectively, Energy and Financials are down 41% and 21.2%. That is probably the most uneven recovery we have seen throughout history.</p><p>Today the FAAMG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google) represent 24% of the S&amp;P 500's $29.77 trln market cap. A 5% rally in Apple alone contributes 0.35% to the S&amp;P 500. In short, the S&amp;P 500 no longer represents the 500 largest US companies, but instead a handful of Tech stocks. That also means performance on the index will be vulnerable to any correction in these big names.</p><p>From a valuation perspective, the technology titans are way overvalued compared to the index.</p><p>Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet are all trading at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) multiple above 30, Facebook is slightly below 30, while the outlier Amazon is trading at a forward PE of 83. But if we exclude these five big behemoths, the S&amp;P 500 is only on a forward multiple of 20.</p><p>While the overall index might look cheap when compared to these tech firms, it has never traded above this multiple since 2002.</p><p>Monetary and fiscal policies may justify overstretched valuations for an extended period of time. With interest rates near zero and long-term rates expected to remain at current low levels, investors have few options to choose from and that's why tech firms are enjoying the limelight.</p><p>However, if other sectors do not start catching up, this would send a very alarming signal. If interest rates explained the full story, then Japan's stocks should have been outperforming all their major peers, but that's not the case.</p><p>Economic activity is nowhere near its pre-pandemic level and so far, we have no clue when a Covid-19 vaccine will arrive, and if it does arrive when the mass population will be vaccinated.</p><p>The US election is another risk looming with only 70 days remaining to the big day on November 3. These risks need to be taken into consideration if one still wants to participate in this most uneven of bull markets.</p><p>For information, disclaimer and risk warning note visit: FXTM</p><p>FXTM Brand: ForexTime Limited is regulated by CySEC and licensed by the SA FSCA.

This is how firms determined that, for example, minutes from meetings of the board compensation committee (where stock options grants were approved) be kept permanently.</p><p>As the ''fortuitous'' timing of so many options grants made by US firms proves, however, the dates on paper records can be added later, or one paper document can easily enough be substituted for another.</p><p>And in any case, in an era when over 90 per cent of business records are never committed to paper -- they remain in electronic form forever -- traditional paper documents kept in archives long ceased to be the place where the real action took place.</p><p>Government regulators such as the SEC and FDA have understood this for years, and over recent times responded by trying to broaden the scope of laws ordering companies to keep information on their actions to encompass data such as emails and electronic forms or transaction records.</p><p>Codifying this more explicitly and holding companies in heavily regulated sectors such as finance and drug and medical device manufacturing more accountable was a key part of the shift in the US regulatory climate that took place after 2000.</p><p>The Sarbanes Oxley Act included similar requirements among its many diverse demands on companies -- stating, for instance, that companies must preserve all financial information and working documents used in the preparation of public financial statements or audits for seven years. That rule applies to an emailed spreadsheet as much as to the signed opinion letter from a company's auditors.</p><p>Although the so-called ''internal controls'' clause of Sarbanes -- which places direct responsibility on a firm's top managers to prove their firm is adhering to all the rules in its operations -- is probably the single biggest driver of regulatory cost for US listed firms covered by the law, record-keeping and information management are No2.</p><p>In a sense, in fact, the information technology group at regulated firms over the past few years became the fall guy in the regulatory crackdown.</p><p>The IT infrastructure was where most of the hot information likely to be needed in a lawsuit was to be found, so it bore the brunt of the push for greater transparency and disclosure.</p><p>And this became a driver for all kinds of technologies and products designed to help companies find, capture, preserve and manage the information wanted by regulators and the courts. These ranged from powerful indexing and search software -- to trawl through vast volumes of data -- to online disk storage that can lock up records so that after they are written they cannot be altered. The cost and complexity of all this angered most corporate leaders but provided a pleasant pick-me-up for the technology industry as it struggled to bounce back from the wreckage of the internet bubble.</p><p>But as the stock option backdating furore makes clear, higher costs and new IT infrastructure caused by tighter regulation were just the beginning -- an even bigger impact will come from the similar forces being unleashed by the threat of litigation, from shareholders or the authorities.</p><p>Almost every firm that has been investigated over its stock option grant practices is now looking for systems and solutions that can be used to prove that future grants were made on the date claimed. Too little and too late, sneer investor activist groups -- and they are right. None of this restores the trust between management and investors, or redresses the economic costs to shareholders from dubious grants.</p><p>But it does mean that many of the big tech firms will be able to sell more of their compliance-related products -- IBM, EMC, HP, Sun, Symantec and, to an extent, Microsoft are all likely beneficiaries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS0609041030338810</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4KT8-VTM0-TX52-F268-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian (Australia)</publicationName><edition>All-round Country Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>September 4, 2006 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Danger and outrages loom. A Mexican politician threatens the ''takeover'' of several American states. Police officers are kicked out of an Arizona Starbucks. Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, proposes a ''$100 billion handout'' for black families. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The Western Journal is not quite a household name. Until recently, some of its most prolific writers used pseudonyms. Though it publishes scores of stories each week about national politics, the company has no Washington bureau, or any other bureaus. Indeed, it rarely dispatches reporters into the world to gather news firsthand.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In the parallel universe of Facebook, though, The Western Journal has been among the most popular and influential publications in America, shaping the political beliefs of more than 36 million deeply loyal readers and followers. In the three years ending in March, according to a New York Times analysis, Western Journal's Facebook posts earned three-quarters of a billion shares, likes and comments, almost as many as the combined tally of 10 leading American news organizations that together employ thousands of reporters and editors.</p><p>  But in the last year, as Facebook and Google tried to rein in their own freewheeling, largely unregulated information ecosystems, The Western Journal's publishers have been thrust into a high-stakes clash between the tech industry and Washington.</p><p>  [Here are three takeaways from The Times's investigation into The Western Journal.]</p><p>  The Western Journal rose on the forces that have remade -- and warped -- American politics, as activists, publishers and politicians harnessed social media's power and reach to serve fine-tuned ideological content to an ever-agitated audience. Founded by the veteran conservative provocateur Floyd G. Brown, who began his career with the race-baiting ''Willie Horton'' ad during the 1988 presidential campaign, and run by his younger son, Patrick, The Western Journal used misleading headlines and sensationalized stories to attract partisans, then profit from their anger.</p><p>  But Silicon Valley's efforts to crack down on clickbait and disinformation have pummeled traffic to The Western Journal and other partisan news sites. Some leading far-right figures have been kicked off social media platforms entirely, after violating rules against hate speech and incitement. Republican politicians and activists have alleged that the tech companies are unfairly censoring the right, threatening conservatives' ability to sway public opinion and win elections.</p><p>  Those attacks have been led by President Trump. While he and his aides once credited his 2016 upset victory to the power of Facebook and Twitter, they now routinely accuse the same companies of bias.</p><p>  In July, Mr. Trump hosted a ''social media summit'' featuring conservative activists who claim to have been censored online. His administration is drafting an executive order that would impose federal oversight of the platforms' content-moderation policies, a startling departure from decades of deregulatory orthodoxy on the right.</p><p>  Now The Western Journal -- like Mr. Trump -- is battling the very technology firms that enabled its rise. Its Facebook traffic has declined sharply. Google News blacklisted the publication last year for what Google ruled were deceptive business practices. Apple News followed suit in June, saying one or more Western Journal stories had advocated ''views overwhelmingly rejected by the scientific community.''</p><p>  ''Facebook has determined to put The Western Journal out of business,'' Floyd Brown wrote in a June email to many of the site's 1.6 million newsletter subscribers.</p><p>  The Western Journal's parent company has hired a Washington lobbyist to push back against digital censorship, and the website has published a series of stories and in-house studies claiming that Silicon Valley's new rules have discriminated against conservative publishers and politicians. The Browns have also sought to join Mr. Trump's anti-Silicon Valley crusade, dispatching Herman Cain, the onetime presidential candidate and a prominent Western Journal contributor, to represent it at the White House summit in July.</p><p>  ''We are committed to the truth,'' said Patrick Brown. ''We are real people. We are a digital media company,'' he continued. ''We are not disinformation.''</p><p>  Both Facebook and Google have denied that they systematically censor conservative views. Many instances of alleged censorship have been traced to user behavior that triggered the platforms' automated safeguards against spam and impersonation.</p><p>  ''We enforce our policies vigorously, consistently and without consideration of any perceived political leanings of any site,'' said Maggie Shiels, a Google spokeswoman.</p><p>  On Tuesday, Facebook released preliminary findings from an outside review of censorship complaints. Although the report provided no new evidence to support the allegations, Facebook said it would make its content-moderation policies more transparent, a sign of the pressure from Washington.</p><p>  Lauren Svensson, a Facebook spokeswoman, said the company had worked aggressively to cut back on false news, but that suppressing content on the basis of political viewpoint ''would be directly contrary to our mission.''</p><p>  The censorship debate underscores the vast power tech platforms have amassed, and the sometimes unnerving opacity with which they exercise it. Silicon Valley's ever-evolving rule books and secretive enforcement procedures determine how news flows to billions of people. The industry's efforts at reform have disrupted political strategies and business models alike, particularly on the right.</p><p>  Highly partisan news sites on the right far outnumber those on the left, according to a tally published last fall by NewsWhip, an analytics company. Conservative readers rely significantly more on hyperpartisan sites for news than liberal ones, and Facebook itself remains a major source of news for older Americans, who will be central to Republicans' electoral fortunes next year.</p><p>  ''These are tactics that some people have been using for a long time,'' said Camille Fran\u00e7ois, a former disinformation researcher at Google who is now chief innovation officer at Graphika, a social media data firm. ''This is how they structured their campaigns. This is how they built their businesses.''</p><p>  The Browns did both: For decades, the family's enterprises have blended political campaigns and partisan journalism, helping reshape American politics and earning tens of millions of dollars along the way. Mr. Trump's movement was the family's most lucrative opportunity yet. Now, it may save the Browns -- or ruin them.</p><p>  A Platform Unlike Any Other</p><p>  Patrick Brown presents as an unlikely merchant of outrage. He is 6-foot-6, but stoop-shouldered and soft-spoken. When expressing a thought that might draw dispute, he often shrugs uncomfortably and spreads his hands, as if to cushion the blow. Mr. Brown attended a small Christian college in Pennsylvania, and his first company, a site called Liftable.com, featured viral, often religious-themed stories meant to inspire readers rather than enrage them: Good Samaritans who saved the life of an accident victim, for example, or the actor Johnny Depp visiting  a children's hospital.</p><p>  ''I grew up not liking politics,'' Mr. Brown said in an interview. ''I grew up seeing just people being jerks to each other.''</p><p>  His exposure to politics came through his father, a larger-than-life veteran of Washington's partisan wars. Floyd G. Brown reveled in the infamy surrounding his successful Horton ads, which featured mug shots of a black convicted murderer to stoke fears that the Democratic candidate, Michael Dukakis, was soft on crime. Over the following decades, Mr. Brown would start political organizations employing the same basic formula: Apocalyptic direct-mail appeals to raise money, innuendo-laden ads to thrash Democrats and outrageous claims to draw mainstream news interest.</p><p>  During the 1990s, Mr. Brown ran a tax-exempt group, Citizens United, and a subscription newsletter, Clintonwatch, that peddled opposition research and outright conspiracy theories about Bill Clinton. When Barack Obama first ran for president, Mr. Brown helped form a network of political action committees that made anti-Obama attack ads, including one questioning whether Mr. Obama might secretly be Muslim. (The PACs raised millions of dollars -- and paid out hundreds of thousands to companies controlled by Mr. Brown or his associates.)</p><p>  After Mr. Obama won, Mr. Brown revived a defunct conservative journalism nonprofit, now called the Western Center for Journalism.</p><p>  ''I'm essentially a political activist,'' he said in an interview. He focused on writing, he said, after realizing that ''the safest venue for the advocacy of ideas in the United States of America was as a publisher and writer.''</p><p>  Mr. Brown relocated his family to Anthem, an exurb of Phoenix, and began blogging at WesternJournalism.com, a precursor to today's Western Journal site. At the height of the Tea Party movement, he worked the right-wing conference circuit. (''Obama hates Christianity,'' Mr. Brown declared at a 2010 event, according to a recording published by Media Matters, the liberal watchdog group. ''He is a Muslim.'') WesternJournalism.com ran stories exploring whether Eric Holder, then the United States attorney general, had covered up a murder, and promoting the lie that Mr. Obama was not an American citizen. One direct-mail piece accused Mr. Obama of pledging to ban criticism of Islam to ''please his jihadist 'masters.'''</p><p>  But social media provided Mr. Brown with a platform unlike any other. He discovered he could use Facebook ads to find alienated, angry conservative users. ''I really built Western Journalism with one really unique ad,'' he said at a 2016 conference in Las Vegas, speaking on a panel titled ''How to Change the World and Get Rich Through Social Media.'' As Mr. Brown recounted: ''I went in and I wrote an ad that just said, 'Click ''like'' if you think Barack Obama should be impeached.'''</p><p>  By May 2014, over four million people a month were visiting the Western Journalism site, which delivered steady attacks on the mainstream media and Democrats, and headlines like ''Florida Democrats Just Voted to Impose Sharia Law on Women.'' WesternJournalism.com took in $1.9 million that year, almost three-quarters of the center's revenue.</p><p>  At first, Floyd Brown's son worked behind the scenes. During summers home from college, Patrick Brown built websites for his father's PACs, like ExposeObama.com, and taught himself coding and social media marketing. After graduating, he ran the Western Center's marketing department, posting its stories on Facebook and studying what made people click the ''like'' button.</p><p>  While Floyd Brown credits his son with WesternJournalism.com's rapid growth -- ''it was his technology,'' he said -- Patrick Brown described the period with some misgiving. He disliked working on the PACs, he said in a recent interview, and did not share his father's views about Mr. Obama's faith. (''My perspective is that if he says he's a Christian, he's a Christian.'') In 2012, Patrick and his wife moved to Vietnam to help start an elementary school. When they returned, he worked again briefly at the Western Center, then quit. In summer 2014, with financial backing from his parents, he started Liftable Media, working the sunny end of the Facebook clickbait spectrum.</p><p>  In an interview, Patrick Brown described his motivation as ''wanting to be in charge of my own company, wanting to do something my way that I can really feel at the end of the day very proud of.''</p><p>  But within months, he returned to the family business. In January 2015, Liftable acquired WesternJournalism.com from the tax-exempt nonprofit run by his father. The transaction was highly favorable to the Browns: Liftable paid $626,157, according to federal tax records, a fraction of the site's annual advertising revenue. The sale effectively stripped the Western Center of its most valuable asset, built with tax-exempt contributions, and transferred it to a for-profit company owned by the Browns. Not long after, according to corporate records, Mr. Brown's parents joined Liftable's board.</p><p>  ''I came to the realization that politics is not in and of itself a bad thing,'' Patrick Brown said.</p><p>  Over the next two years, he built one of the most influential political sites in America. With Floyd Brown as chairman, Liftable bought up a slew of rival publishers, such as Conservative Tribune and Liberty Alliance. The acquisitions brought the Browns millions of email addresses and increased to close to 60 their stable of popular conservative Facebook pages with names like Saving Our Future and Trump Truck.</p><p>  To expand their reach, the Browns struck deals with dozens of conservative politicians and celebrities, including Joe Arpaio, the anti-immigrant Arizona sheriff. The politicians posted Western Journalism and Conservative Tribune stories to their own widely followed Facebook pages in return for a cut of the ad revenue. (Facebook has since banned this practice, which violates Federal Trade Commission rules against undisclosed sponsorships.)</p><p>  Coursing through the Browns' Facebook empire was a torrent of sensationalized, misleading, or entirely made-up stories, often aimed at Muslims and immigrants, and pumped out through dozens of seemingly unconnected Facebook pages that in practice functioned as part of a single publication. Liftable's sites were cited more than a dozen times by fact-checking watchdogs like Snopes.com and FactCheck.org. In a report titled ''Bloodlust,'' The Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights group, charged WesternJournalism and other fringe web publishers with engaging in ''the monetizing of digital mobs.''</p><p>Liftable's political content lived alongside more lighthearted fare -- a sports website; stories about cancer survivors; ''Dancing with the Stars'' recaps -- in a full-spectrum assault on the viral news market. Liftable soared. Its sites reached nearly a billion page views in the run-up to the 2016 election, according to SimilarWeb, an analytics company. By the time Mr. Trump was sworn in, more than 12 million people were arriving on the sites each month through Facebook or other social media, driving a torrent of advertising revenue. In 2016, the company took in more than $16 million. Instead of leaving the family business, Mr. Brown had supercharged it.</p><p>  ''It's as if these publishers discovered -- or created, or radicalized -- a huge market niche that simply had not been tapped before,'' said Paul Quigley, the chief executive of NewsWhip.</p><p>  Blacklisted, Then Resurrected</p><p>  But by 2017, tech companies were coming under enormous pressure from regulators and lawmakers. Media and government investigations had revealed how Russian agents used Facebook and Twitter to help Mr. Trump get elected, in part by targeting voters with divisive or misleading stories.</p><p>Facebook had begun incorporating fact-checking ratings into its algorithm, eventually down-ranking content flagged as misleading or false. Both Twitter and Facebook began rooting out networks of secretly coordinated social accounts and web domains, aiming at both state actors, like Russia, and publishers of spam. Facebook also began asking users which publications they trusted most, and ranked content accordingly.</p><p>  The cumulative changes slowed Facebook traffic to media outlets across the publishing industry. But for some, including The Western Journal, it was devastating. The accumulation of ''false'' ratings from fact-checking sites meant that Western Journal and Conservative Tribune stories were less likely to pop up in users' feeds. The company -- hidden behind its own blizzard of Facebook pages, little-known as a news brand in its own right -- ranked poorly on Facebook's trust surveys, hurting their reach still more.</p><p>  In fall 2017, Facebook traffic to Liftable's properties began to drop. By early last year, it was nearly zero.</p><p>  Patrick Brown's team scrambled. In 2018, Mr. Brown resurrected his site as WesternJournal.com, a new domain that had never been blacklisted by advertising networks or flagged by fact checkers. He began working with Facebook to rename most of his company's stable of Facebook pages to tie them more closely to The Western Journal. (A page once called Donald Trump Is the Man, for example, is now called Donald Trump News by WJ.) Others were shut down.</p><p>  Mr. Brown also introduced a corrections page and published editorial standards that stated, among other things, that The Western Journal's ''first value as a company is truth.'' Thousands of old WesternJournalism.com stories, including most of Floyd Brown's columns, were removed.</p><p>  In February, Patrick Brown greeted two reporters at the Liftable offices in Anthem, wearing jeans and a faded T-shirt. ''I'd say we're backing into something that looks more like a traditional media company,'' he said in his small office with sweeping views of the Sonoran Desert.</p><p>  Over a series of conversations, Mr. Brown answered detailed questions about his business and Liftable's efforts to navigate social media's fast-changing landscape. ''Our goal is to show you who we are and be transparent,'' he said. ''We haven't done this before, so we're nervous.''</p><p>  While Facebook's algorithm changes had knocked around his business, Mr. Brown acknowledged, most of them were about ''protecting the user -- and you know, we support that.''</p><p>  His father had little involvement with the company day to day, Mr. Brown said, and served mostly as a sounding board on business and management issues. When asked whether Liftable had anything in common with his father's PACs, Mr. Brown demurred.</p><p>  ''I would never want to do what he did,'' Mr. Brown said. ''When you make an ad or something, you are -- your whole goal is to just convince someone of something, right? I mean, our goal is not that. Our No. 1 goal is to inform -- truthfully.''</p><p>  Yet the reborn Western Journal functions almost like a news outlet in reverse. In interviews, the website's editors spoke often about narratives -- narratives in the mainstream media, narratives they wanted to counter, narratives they were seeking. Each workday, a small team of editors, known as ''story finders,'' scours social media data and newswires. ''They're looking for information, narratives that will inform and equip and motivate our audience,'' said Shaun Hair, a former litigator who is The Western Journal's executive editor.</p><p>  The message comes first, then facts carefully selected to support it. Only after editors decide the framing of a story, and write the headline, is it handed off to a pool of contract writers, most working remotely. Deadlines are tight: Most articles are filed within an hour or two, and some breaking-news stories are written in as little as 30 minutes.</p><p>  Western Journal editors stressed that headlines and frames were often adjusted later to ensure accuracy, and that writers were encouraged to pitch ideas. But as with stories from some other ideological media outlets, those from Western Journal often feel tailored to the daily political needs of one faction. Mr. Brown describes the intended audience as the ''forgotten people'' of heartland America -- a staple of Mr. Trump's speeches -- and The Western Journal's narratives often echo and amplify those spun by the president.</p><p>  Mr. Trump's targets, too, reliably become The Western Journal's: the CNN reporter Jim Acosta, Joy Behar of ''The View,'' Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Last fall, when Mr. Trump sought to mobilize Republican voters by campaigning against the caravan of Central Americans headed toward the United States, The Western Journal published more than 150 stories about the migrants. Most complemented Mr. Trump's message, for example by likening the caravan to a \"mob\" or ''an army,'' and emphasizing instances of violence.</p><p>  Mr. Brown and his colleagues argue that, unlike mainstream outlets, they are at least transparent about the values that color their content.</p><p>  ''We're conservative,'' Mr. Hair said. ''And our news is both curated and approached from a conservative reality.''</p><p>  As Big Tech cracked down, the Browns promoted another emerging narrative: that platforms like Google and Facebook were biased against the right.</p><p>  In March 2018, Floyd Brown declared on Fox News that Facebook had been ''optimized to the thought police.'' The same month, The Western Journal published an in-house study concluding that Facebook's algorithm changes disproportionately favored liberal news outlets. (Cameron Hickey, a disinformation researcher at Harvard, told The Times he considered the study's methodology flawed, since it did not assess the quality or reliability of the news sources, merely their purported ideological tilt.)</p><p>  A few months later, another Western Journal study asserted that the changes had cost Republican members of Congress more Facebook reach than their Democratic counterparts. The company also hired a Republican lobbyist in Washington, Alex Shively, to arrange meetings with lawmakers.</p><p>  The claim of censorship was not only a political battle cry. It was a business imperative. As Liftable's Facebook traffic declined, it had moved more aggressively into direct marketing, pitching its reader data and email lists as tool for conservative politicians and political organizations to reach voters. In spring 2018, Liftable hired Gabriel S. Joseph III, a Washington-based operative and a longtime friend of Floyd Brown, to spearhead the business. It was later spun off into a company called Firefly Engagement. Like the elder Mr. Brown, Mr. Joseph has a knack for brass-knuckle political marketing. He is currently appealing a $32 million judgment for a class-action claim that his company illegally spammed millions of people to promote a video about the so-called War on Christmas.</p><p>  The new business was critical for Liftable. Even after The Western Journal's reinvention, the site drew only about half the traffic it had during the 2016 campaign. Although it still had some of the highest Facebook engagement rates of any publication, total traffic referred from the social media network had declined catastrophically, according to SimilarWeb data. By the end of 2018, only about two million readers a month were coming to the website from Facebook. After Google News blacklisted the site, the publication lost two-thirds of its traffic from Google's search engine -- and with it, ad revenue.</p><p>  Correspondence that Patrick Brown shared with The Times shows that, at first, a Google representative blamed the drop on a technical error.</p><p>  In a later email, a Google representative offered Mr. Brown a new, different reason: The Western Journal had engaged in practices that ''can be reasonably construed by users as deceptive behavior.''</p><p>  Ms. Shiels, the Google spokeswoman, said that Google News, which includes roughly 80,000 news sources, had blocked about 800 sites for policy violations. She declined to name the sites, but said they spanned the political spectrum.</p><p>Google's decision to blacklist The Western Journal was informed in part by the work of an outside security firm, CounterAction, according to a person briefed on the matter. The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of contractual agreements around CounterAction's work, said the firm was one of several that Google worked with to detect and deter disinformation campaigns.</p><p>  But Patrick viewed the blacklisting as further evidence of bias. His staff spent weeks vetting their content and procedures against Google News's rules for publishers, even hiring a consultant to audit their practices. ''There was no reason that he could see why we would be removed, except for political bias,'' Mr. Brown said. The financial crunch became so severe, he said, that he and his father temporarily gave up their salaries.</p><p>  ''What is happening to Liftable Media isn't important in and of itself,'' Mr. Brown added. ''Except in the way that it's reflecting a clampdown on speech in general in America.''</p><p>  'Who Controls the Microphones'</p><p>  A few months ago, Floyd Brown and Mr. Joseph helped organize a new group, the Coalition for Standardized Digital Media and IT, to call attention to supposed tech censorship.</p><p>  In May, Mr. Joseph oversaw the coalition's launch event at the National Press Club in Washington. The gathering featured Laura Loomer, an anti-Muslim activist whom Facebook banned for posts inciting violence against the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar as well as more credentialed conservatives with Trump ties, such as Mr. Cain and Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, now acting director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p><p>  ''There are a lot of folks who depended on Facebook and Google,'' Mr. Cain said in an interview. ''And then, all of a sudden, they begin trying to decide what is 'appropriate.''' He emphasized the last word skeptically, with air quotes.</p><p>  Independent experts have largely dismissed the claim that platforms are systematically discriminating against conservative content. (The most successful publisher on Facebook in 2019 is FoxNews.com.) But the complaints echo longstanding conservative attacks on the mainstream media, a onetime gatekeeper whose powers have long since been diminished by openly ideological outlets.</p><p>  ''This is an argument that is very familiar through history -- the idea of one faction being shut out from public debate because of who controls the microphones,'' said Ms. Fran\u00e7ois, the former Google disinformation researcher.</p><p>  To prevent publishers from gaming their rules, platforms like Facebook and Google News typically do not identify precisely what content or action will result in a penalty.</p><p>  But a review of Liftable's operations showed a range of potential violations of Google's policies against spam, misrepresentation and overreliance on other outlets' content -- activities that, taken together, would help explain the company's suspension.</p><p>  Almost none of The Western Journal's news coverage arises from original reporting, for example. Almost all of it is ''aggregated'' -- borrowed and rewritten, with attribution -- from stories on other sites, ranging from Breitbart and Daily Caller to traditional news organizations like the The Times and The Washington Post. For much of this year, The Western Journal's home page was dominated by headlines that linked to other media outlets, such as Fox News or CNN, without clearly indicating that the stories had not originated on The Western Journal.</p><p>  Western Journal authors do not always use their real names, another violation of Google News policies. In late 2018, when Western Journal was suspended, a search for some of the site's most prominent bylines yielded no digital fingerprints beyond Liftable. A few of the writers, Mr. Brown explained at the time, used pseudonyms or middle names. After The Times asked about the practice, those authors began using their real names. But some Western Journal bylines are still pseudonyms, like an author named C. O. Jones (i.e., ''Cojones.'')</p><p>  Mr. Brown also appears to have used frowned-upon techniques to game Google's algorithms. At The Times's request, Matthew Hindman, a professor at George Washington University and author of ''The Internet Trap,'' found at least 50 domains linked to the Browns that appeared to be promoting The Western Journal.</p><p>  Those domains, which included ExposeObama.com, the former website of Floyd Brown's anti-Obama PAC, have posted nearly 150,000 links to Western Journal articles since 2017, a technique known as ''spammy backlinking.'' Some are still configured as ''doorway sites,'' with little more than a rotating collection of Western Journal headlines and links, a tactic to create the appearance of popularity but explicitly banned by Google.</p><p>  ''This is not a new technique,'' Mr. Hindman said. ''And they can't have been surprised that Google thought it was cheating.''</p><p>  Most striking, the Browns' company also has unusually close ties with a pro-Trump PAC, America Fighting Back. The PAC was co-founded last September by Mr. Cain, shortly before The Western Journal absorbed his personal website and began hosting his internet radio show. The PAC's chief strategist, Todd Ceferrati, is also a consultant to Liftable. Floyd Brown is the PAC's chairman.</p><p>  Almost every post on the PAC's Facebook page is a link to a Western Journal story or commentary. Most of the PAC's email solicitations are sent out over Liftable-owned domains, according to a Times review, and feature Western Journal stories. A welcome message on the America Fighting Back site celebrates the PAC's ''amazing group of marketing and social media and grass-roots experts dedicated to our nation, President Trump and his agenda.''</p><p>Liftable appears to have shut down its backlinking network sometime this year; most of the sites now merely direct readers to WesternJournal.com. Executives said this summer that they had made further changes to the site to hew more closely to Google's public policies, and appealed the suspension.</p><p>  But the PAC appears to be a sticking point: In July, shortly after the White House summit, a Google representative told Mr. Brown's team that The Western Journal was not adequately disclosing to readers its relationship with the political organization. It was hard to tell, the representative seemed to suggest, where The Western Journal ended and the PAC began.</p><p>Liftable editors said it had no formal connection to the PAC; the group simply employed Liftable and Firefly as vendors. In an email to The Times, Mr. Brown accused Google of a double standard.</p><p>  ''I challenge Google to remove The Washington Post from Google News because of the political contributions and political activities of Jeff Bezos,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Americans of all political persuasions used to be allowed their personal political beliefs, but Google punishes our entire company because of my personal giving and activities. All we have ever asked for is to be treated with equality.''</p><p>  A Direct Line</p><p>  In mid-August, Patrick Brown told Liftable's staff he was stepping down as chief executive to take a medical leave. The elder Mr. Brown now runs the family business once again, right as Liftable is fighting for its life. The company has parted ways with some freelancers and left some openings unfilled. Today, according to Floyd Brown, Liftable Media is half its former size.</p><p>  But the Browns have always adapted. Later this year, a new company started by the Browns and Mr. Ceferrati will release a smartphone app called Feedme. Created by Patrick Brown, the app is designed to neuter Silicon Valley's control over its own platforms. Feedme will allow users to import public content from Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms, but decide which of the content they see, instead of letting those companies' algorithms decide. In theory, it could allow the Browns to broadcast anything to their Facebook followers, without interference.</p><p>  A marketing email sent to Western Journal readers in July presented Feedme as a solution to ''Silicon Valley's theft of the First Amendment.'' The message -- political and commercial -- will be bolstered by Floyd Brown's next book, due out in September: ''Big Tech Tyrants: How Silicon Valley's Stealth Practices Addict Teens, Silence Speech, and Steal Your Privacy.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: During the 1992 presidential campaign, Floyd G.

Dan Goldstein, the president and owner of the digital marketing agency Page 1 Solutions, said he worried that a dividend could lead to more costly marketing.</p><p>\u201cIf they are taxing Facebook and taxing Google or any of the other major marketers, the tax is going to get passed on in advertising rates,\u201d Goldstein said, adding that he wasn\u2019t sure if the proposal would lead to \u201cmeaningful\u201d benefit to consumers.</p><p>Right now, big tech makes billions off the data harvested from its users, who freely give up their personal information in exchange for the use of their platforms and services. Marketers, too, benefit when they pay tech companies to aim their advertising toward certain users. Some privacy advocates and entrepreneurs have expressed concern that big tech is raking in huge profits off consumer data, while those consumers see no direct financial compensation.</p><p>Shane Green, the CEO of the consumer data-sharing platform Digi.me and the co-founder of the data marketplace UBDI, said that the proposal, while light on specifics, represented a \u201clandmark moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople have certainly talked about and worked on these ideas around how people can participate in the economics of their data,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t recall a politician of his magnitude saying that this is something that needs to happen.\u201d</p><p>The concept of a government-arranged dividend for state residents isn\u2019t a new one; Alaska, as Forbes noted, has for decades maintained a state fund that collects a percentage of oil royalties from the oil industry and then compensates residents annually. But the idea of providing a payout to consumers whose data is being used by big tech has not attracted much attention from legislators until now, Green said.</p><p>Neil Sweeney, the founder and CEO of the first-party data platform Freckle and the consent-management platform Killi, said the proposal was \u201cinevitable\u201d when considering the record profit companies like Facebook are making from consumer data.</p><p>\u201cAt some point or another, the value proposition erodes,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be the big corporations or big tech companies who are the beneficiaries.\u201d</p><p>Sweeney and Green both compared the concept of a data dividend to a universal basic income, a guaranteed cash payment or stipend given without requirements like a means test. Proponents of a UBI include Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>Green said it was particularly notable that Newsom defined the reasoning of the data dividend based not on the geography of the tech companies\u2014many of which have major presences in Silicon Valley\u2014but on the fact that those corporations profit from Californians\u2019 data. That distinction, Green said, indicated to him that Newsom\u2019s team has a good understanding of the value big tech wrings out of the data it harvests.</p><p>That\u2019s not to say those companies will embrace the idea, though.</p><p>\u201cThe big companies themselves are very unlikely to lean into this for the same reasons that the big companies don\u2019t have a vested interest in educating consumers about how their data is being used, or the value of their data,\u201d Sweeney said.</p><p>California proved itself to be a regulatory testing ground when it comes to consumer data rights when it passed the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which will require that tech companies give consumers more control over how their data is collected and used when it goes into effect in 2020. The tech industry has been critical of some of the provisions in that bill and has lobbied for a more lenient federal privacy bill that would preempt the CCPA.</p><p>As for how Facebook and Google feel about the so-called \u201cdata dividend,\u201d Adweek can\u2019t say; spokespeople for the companies did not respond to requests for comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1023468</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VF0-PP71-JC8H-T4R1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 14, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

That violence live streamed on Facebook and spread like a virus throughout the darkest corner of the internet. Now, Ardern, together with French president, Emmanuel Macron, is meeting with government and tech leaders from around the world, pushing for a pledge to eradicate this kind of extreme content online.</p><p>But though Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, was in Paris this week, he didn't stay for these talks. Despite representing a country of just 5 million people, Jacinda Ardern has become a political heavyweight, leading the way on this issue as well as on gun control.</p><p>I traveled to Paris to talk to her, about what she calls her duty of care.</p><p>Prime minister, welcome to the program.</p><p>ARDERN: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Here you are in Paris, you're going to be co-chairing with President Macron the so-called Christchurch call. What exactly do you hope to get out of this?</p><p>ARDERN: You know, in the wake of the 15th of March, you know, there were a number of things that we as New Zealanders could do to respond to what was a horrific and jarring terrorist attack on our soil. You know, we could deal with our gun laws and we have. We could look into the way that our security and intelligences are focused and reviewed and we are.</p><p>But when it came to the way that this attack was specifically designed to be broadcast and to go viral, the response to that needed a global solution. And so, that was why we immediately got in contact with international counterparts, those who are like-minded when it comes to the notion of an open and secure internet, and use that as the basis to say there is more work to be done here when it comes to stopping the proliferation of online and violent extremism. So, that was the basis of the call.</p><p>It is really an action plan. It's the start of something. It won't be the beginning and end, but I hope the start of preventing this kind of activity online happening again.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, you have said, and you wrote an op-ed about it, that you can't do all this alone.</p><p>ARDERN: No.</p><p>AMANPOUR: The corporations have to do their part as well and obviously governments as well. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook was here.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But he's not here for the conference. He did meet with President Macron. Have you actually spoken to him? What --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Has he given you a pledge? Because this is a voluntary call.</p><p>ARDERN: It is, it is. And look, there's good logistical reasons for this. This is an action plan that we wanted to start the work on in the immediate aftermath of the 15th of March. And here we are, you know, roughly two months later pulling together both countries and companies, and that is a big distinction from what's happened before.</p><p>We were all around the table, setting forth the kind of areas of work the public can have a reasonable expectation where things need to change. If we had gone to a treaty level document, that generally would have excluded private companies and they would have taken a very long time. So, we are asking for cooperation, and I think it's the least that can be offered in these circumstances.</p><p>I've spoken to Mark Zuckerberg directly twice now. And actually, we've had good ongoing engagement with Facebook. And the last time I spoke to him a matter of days ago, he did give Facebook's support to this call to action.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And what? Because, for instance, I spoke to Eric Schmidt yesterday and he obviously is the former CEO and chairman of Google and he was quite exorcised by the idea that any government would consider regulation or that companies should be broken up for anti-trust or other such reason.</p><p>He said, you know, \"Give this duty to us. We will regulate ourselves. Just give us more time, we'll develop the tools.\"</p><p>ARDERN: Yes. [13:05:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you buy that?</p><p>ARDERN: Well, I think this is about acknowledging that actually we've seen to-date a proliferation of domestic regulation, and for good reason. You know, we as leaders have a duty of care and when we see harm being done and the proliferation of terrorism and violent extremism, people look to us for answers. So, we have seen domestic responses in that way.</p><p>But actually, most of those tend to focus on takedown periods, penalties if you see objectionable material continue to proliferate, we need to get in front of this before the harm is done. For instance, that video after the 15th of March, it was taken down by Facebook 1.5 million times. It was uploaded once every second on YouTube for a period in those first 24 hours.</p><p>Now, in New Zealand they're not alone, I know 8,000 New Zealanders called a mental health support line because they saw the video and it caused them distress. So, my view is what can we do to get in front of this? Technology is moving quite quickly. We may not have all of the responses we need now but we need to work on them and we need to work together.</p><p>So, that's why this call to action is not just about regulation, but instead about bringing companies to the table, saying, \"You have a role too and we have expectations of you.\"</p><p>AMANPOUR: To that point, you've written quite dramatically about how pervasive that video was. First of all, you've said the attack was part of a horrifying new trend that seems to be spreading around the world, designed to be broadcast on the internet. And you've also said that you, yourself, accidentally inadvertently came across it.</p><p>ARDERN: I did. I did.</p><p>AMANPOUR: How did that affect you? You've talked about the mental health trauma of those in New Zealand who saw it?</p><p>ARDERN: You know, all of that has done is highlight for me two things, really just how available it was. My recollection, because it was in the first early period, was going to post information out using my social media channels because I manage my own social media and it means I have that experience of what it is to use these platforms and how they can be used as a tool for good.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>ARDERN: And there it was. And so, I know that a lot of New Zealanders and a lot of people globally will inadvertently have seen this video, but it also then gave me insight into what exactly it looked like. And for me, that just only enhances that since that I have a duty of care, and in fact, we all do.</p><p>Those tech companies, I do not for a moment believe they wanted to see their platforms used for such a vile, heinous act, but I don't think it's enough for us to say well and accepting that we all want an open and a free and secure internet that we have to accept that these kinds of activities will happen as a by-product, we don't have to accept that, but we have to put our minds collectively to the solution.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And obviously, there's a lot talked about, 8chan.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: This platform which is host to so much extremist content, including the New Zealand --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- shooter.</p><p>ARDERN: It was.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And even the synagogue shooter in the United States.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Again, that's specific sort of dark area --</p><p>ARDERN: It is</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- where this extremist content lives --</p><p>ARDERN: IT is.</p><p>AMANPOUR: and proliferates.</p><p>ARDERN: It is. And, you know, we find ourselves now in the challenging space, of course, you know, with the call to action that we're involved in here, actually we're dealing with those mainstream tech companies. There is -- there are platforms out there who are never going to engage in this way with government, who are never going to see that they have any duty of care or sense of responsibility, and that's why we cannot take off the table governments actually looking at the other tools they have, because platforms like that, that was actively used by the terrorists in this situation.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I just want to ask you about whether you think these companies have become too powerful. For instance, Chris Hughes, who is one of the co-founders of --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- Facebook has recently said that because --</p><p>ARDERN: A very significant piece.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Very significant. Because Facebook so dominate social networking, faces no market-based accountability. This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern, first outrage, then disappointment and finally resignation.</p><p>And actually, your own privacy commission, he tweeted something very, very pointed \"Facebook cannot be trusted. They are morally bankrupt pathological liars who enable genocide,\" he's talking about Myanmar and the killing of the Rohingya Muslims there, \"facilitate foreign undermining of democratic institutions, Russia, in election, allow the livestreaming of suicides, rapes and murders, continue to host and publish and mosque attack video, allow advertisers to target Jew haters and other harmful market segments. Refuse to accept any responsibility for any content or harm. They #dontgiveazuck.\"</p><p>Now, he did take it down. But nonetheless, that's what he feels.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes. And that was our privacy commissioner, obviously, focused on the protection of New Zealander' data and information. And he, of course, [13:10:00] expressed a huge -- a strong sense of responsibility in those comments. You know --</p><p>AMANPOUR: But do you think like he doesn't think that you can actually work with the CEOs, that they're not necessarily going to do the right thing. They don't have the duty of care that you have.</p><p>ARDERN: Well, the alternative, however, is to do nothing. And I do not accept that as an option. That's the first point. The second point, you know, in the aftermath of the 15th of March, it was only a few days after, I traveled to Christchurch and visited a high school where pupils from that high school were being affected directly by the attack.</p><p>And I asked them, you know, some questions, because one of the student leaders there had been involved in organizing a spontaneous gathering of young people, and the pack near the mosque where the attack occurred. And that gathering was just a chance for those young people to come together, show their support for the New Zealand Muslim community and to grieve together. And it was an incredible sight and they did that through social media.</p><p>So, I asked these students who have actually -- who was involved in it, because they saw those messages and joined together and all the hands went up. And I said, \"Who equally has seen things online that they would consider to be harmful, distressing and obscene?\" Now, all the hands go up.</p><p>Now, this in one place is a tool that has a huge potential to do good. But at the same time, if left unchecked, we've seen just the harm that can be done as well. You know, and as someone who has been a user of Facebook since the very beginning, I can see that it has grown and turned into a hugely significant platform, probably outstripping some of those early founders' expectations. But now, we are therefore having to retrofit a response as a as a result.</p><p>But I don't think it's enough to say that just because it's growing in this unwieldy way that we don't have that duty, and I'm not willing to sit back and say it can't be done. And I don't think they are either.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. They may not be and say that they don't want to see their platforms used that way but they also made a lot of money. They made a lot of money from --</p><p>ARDERN: Sure.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- the live streaming of this terrible massacre in your country. I wonder whether you feel that you have the moral high ground, that you can actually -- I mean, I'm not going to say beat them over the head, but nonetheless, exert that moral imperative after what happened in your country, for the first time ever, there's never been such a terrifying, terrible massacre like that.</p><p>ARDERN: I guess there are two high grounds here, though, when it comes to the debate in this space and civil society reach -- you know, rightly needs to have its voice here as well. Because our focus is very much on violent extremism and terrorism online, and we've been specific about that, because, you know, this doesn't need to dip into, therefore debate around curtailing freedom of expression because that's something that New Zealanders hold very dear too.</p><p>We're an opinionated country. We like the ability to share our minds. We don't want it to be constrained by border. We certainly don't want it constrained by government. But that's why we have seen, look, let's look at the area where we can agree, where we can maintain that principle of an open, free and secure internet, that actually where we collectively reject the idea then holding to those principles, you allow violent extremism. And so, that's our starting point.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I want to show you something, which I'm sure you've actually seen. So, a month ago --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- when your little daughter was nine months old, your partner, her father, said, \"For her nine-month birthday today, we received the gift of crawling, while her mom got her the gift of having a safer country to grow up in.\" That is a really clever way of --</p><p>ARDERN: Of telling me she's crawling.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- of telling you she's crawling. But also, perhaps reacting to what you did so swiftly with your political partners and opponents, toughen up your gun laws.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You know, even President Obama couldn't do that in the United States after the massacre of children at Sandy Hook.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But you did. In a matter of 26 days, legislation was passed.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes. I think that speaks to the impact of the 15th of March on New Zealand. We did have permissive gun laws, we did. And, you know, there is, of course, a very practical use for the guns that we do use and license in New Zealand, but there is actually a whole set of weapons that were just available but unjustifiably so.</p><p>And so, I remember very distinctly sitting in a briefing where the police told me the weapons that have been used on the 15th of March and how easily they were legally obtained and then illegally modified for the purposes of that attack. And there was no [13:15:00] question in my mind that our laws needed to change in that moment.</p><p>What I'm heartened by is that I did not question for a moment that parliament would support that law change.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>ARDERN: And that absolutely proved to be the case. Not only did we change our laws but that law basically moved through in roughly the course of two weeks.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. I mean, it's remarkable.</p><p>ARDERN: But I think it just --</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean --</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- speaks to the strength of feeling in the aftermath of that attack. You know, we had debated gun law change before in New Zealand, we had. And periodically, it had come up over the years but it hadn't led to substantive change.</p><p>But after you witness 51 of your New Zealand Muslim community be attacked in that way, you know, the only answer was to do everything we could to prevent it every happening again.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, just to remind, over 110 mass shooting in the United States since 1982, according to an investigative site, 15 school shootings alone this year. It's a really difficult topic to grapple. I mean, I wonder whether you ever think that other countries can learn from what you did and actually, from what neighboring Australia did after their massacre --</p><p>ARDERN: Absolutely.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- in 1996, a conservative government passed tough gun laws.</p><p>ARDERN: And in both cases, you know -- and again, I have to acknowledge, New Zealand had pretty permissive gun legislation.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, actually, some of your people said, you know, \"We feed half the world. We're hunters.\"</p><p>ARDERN: And we are, and we will continue to be a food-producing nation that deals with animal welfare issues and so on and has a practical purpose and use for guns, but you can draw a line and say that that does not mean that you need access to military-style semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles. You do not.</p><p>And New Zealand is by and large absolutely agreed with that position. Australia experienced a massacre and changed their laws. New Zealand had its experience and changed its laws. To be honest with you, I do not understand the United States.</p><p>AMANPOUR: What kind of a conversation did you have with President Trump after the massacre? I know you spoke by phone. You refused to name the shooter.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You won't say his name. The media also is joining in not showing his manifesto.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes,</p><p>AMANPOUR: They pledge not to broadcast any White nationalist --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- signs he might make in trial.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: This, again, is quite rare --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- to get that level of cooperation. This was a White nationalist terrorist. What did you say to President Trump about naming and calling out this kind of terrorism?</p><p>ARDERN: Well, at that point, it was very early on that I had a conversation with President Trump. Certainly, I had been calling since the day of the attack, I had been calling it a terrorist attack. And so, naturally did in the conversation as well.</p><p>But at that time, actually, my view around never mentioning his name specifically, that was something that I really came to form a strong view over the course of a few days and it just seemed instinctive to me that that would be the way we should respond. And so, it was a couple of days later that I really decided I would formalize that openly and declare I would never use his name.</p><p>I think, you know, that there was from the call with President Trump, he expressed, you know, very sincerely the condolences of the people of the United States. And in that moment, I simply reflected back that the New Zealand community at that moment in time would totally focus on our Muslim community, because they were -- you know, they are a part of our nation, and we felt that duty of care, and we hadn't been able to keep them safe.</p><p>And so, that was my response to him, was that at this time, I think globally, that's when members of our Muslim community would have been feeling it beyond New Zealand's shores.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you asked him to share the love --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes, yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- of the Muslim community.</p><p>ARDERN: Because that's exactly what New Zealanders were doing.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, you shared the love. You have become incredibly prominent, because of your reaction after this massacre. You know, it's said that leaders are tested at the height of the worst crises that their countries face. And you have suddenly become the poster prime minister for, dare I say, enlightened and most definitely compassionate leadership, that's what everybody is saying about you.</p><p>I wonder how that feels and I wonder what your instinct was, you know, when you entered the hospitals, when you went into the mosque --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- when you went to their community in the immediate aftermath.</p><p>ARDERN: You know, I'd like to think that actually, any words I uttered or actions, even decisions to be amongst those who were grieving at any given time was actually just the exact same response that you were seeing from New Zealanders. And many will have seen images in the aftermath [13:20:00] and the days after New Zealanders just instinctively, even if I've never visited before, went to their local mosque, even if it was to stand outside and make sure that our New Zealand Muslim community felt safe to return for the call to prayer. They left flowers. They spontaneously sang. They embraced one another.</p><p>And so, my response at the time in the privileged position of being a prime minister was simply to echo that, exactly -- echo exactly what New Zealanders were intuitively doing. And when you think about those moments of grief, I'd like to think that we would all just respond in the same way if we had, you know, grief in our family, you embrace one another, you look after one another. You think about each other's well-being. You think about whether or not people feel safe, because a lot of our Muslim women didn't, and still don't.</p><p>And to me, that is just intuitive. I would like to think any leader would just respond in the most human of ways, and that's all I did. Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I just want to quickly move on to climate, because you're a big proponent of duty of care to the climate as well, to the planet. And obviously, you are a low-lying nation.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And we're talking about rising seas and all the rest of it. I wonder how much impact these phenomenal young people have had, led by Greta Thunberg --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- in Sweden but spreading to New Zealand, to Australia and all over the world, telling our generation --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- to get serious.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Just how much impact did have they had? Because there's a bill tabled also in your parliament --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- calling for carbon neutral, zero-carbon by 2050.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes. Yes, there is. And --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Is that enough, by the way? Some people are saying --</p><p>ARDERN: Not for us. So, we've not only committed to zero-carbon by 2050, we've also embedded a 1.5-degree target within our legislation as well. Now, that's different. Not everyone is doing that but we were deliberate about that because yes of the voice of young people in New Zealand but also because we are a member of the Pacific.</p><p>And if we were to sit in aspiration of anything above 1.5, we would be accepting that our Pacific neighbors would weigh the consequence of catastrophic sea level rises, and devastating effects, and we couldn't accept that. How could we put in a tolerance into our legislation and just accept that that was going to be a fight (ph) of complaint, so we don't. And so, our zero-carbon legislation covers both this -- an aspiration of being rich in carbon neutrality but also that very important target around warming.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you feel sort of panicky? I mean, we seem to have got to a head, you know, the U.N. report on the million species that have already been extinct.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, the terrible fear we're headed beyond 1.5 --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- and none of the countries have kept up their commitments --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- under the Paris Accord. Of course, the United States is pulling out of it.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Are you concerned that we may be beyond the point of no return?</p><p>ARDERN: I feel a huge sense of urgency. I feel a huge sense of responsibility. But the last thing, the last perception that I would want left is this idea that it's too late. We can't do anything. So, why bother? Because that actually takes the responsibility away.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>ARDERN: That says to leaders and nations, you don't have to change or commit, because there's nothing we can do about it. We can do something about it. The science tells us what we need to do now and what we need to do in the long-term. We just need to listen to the science and we then need to act. And perhaps it is because we're sitting on the doorstep of (INAUDIBLE), this isn't hypothetical anymore. How can we look our Pacific neighbors in the eye and say it's too late? And so, I urge any leader, come to the Pacific. You know, hear it for yourselves. Take that home and share it with your communities.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And I cannot leave you without asking you a final personal question. At Easter time, your partner, the father of your daughter, proposed to you.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes, he did. Very surprising.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Did you not see it coming?</p><p>ARDERN: No. Nope. Not at all. Not for a moment.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Bended knee? I mean, is that a beautiful engagement ring you're fashioning around?</p><p>ARDERN: Yes, that is. That is. It's his grandmother's and so, it doesn't fit on the actual finger. So, no, I was very surprised. I was, you know, a pair of tights and cap and my sneakers. You know, we went for a walk up the hill and yes, he asked me there. It was lovely.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Good. Well, congratulations to you --</p><p>ARDERN: Thank you very much.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- and to your family.</p><p>ARDERN: We do not have time for a wedding. So, we'll see.</p><p>AMANPOUR: No wedding in office.</p><p>ARDERN: I have no idea, but we'll do it sometime. Things are very busy.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes, they are. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, thank you so much for joining me. [13:25:00]</p><p>ARDERN: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Very busy indeed with all the politics she has. Now, of course, American officials are in touch with her government, but senior representatives will be absent from the tech control summit in Paris she's co-chairing.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo however is meeting President Vladimir Putin in Russia instead. It is the first such meeting since the release of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Masha Gessen is a Russian-American journalist with intimate knowledge of both countries. And her latest book, \"The Future is History,\" is a gripping look at the toxic legacy of the Soviet era. She sat down with Michel Martin to discuss the release of the Mueller report and Putin's end game.</p><p>MICHEL MARTIN, CORRESPONDENT: Masha Gessen, thanks for talking with us.</p><p>MASHA GESSEN, STAFF WRITER, THE NEW YORKER: Thank you for having me.</p><p>MARTIN: Now, you occupy this very unique position in journalism, both having a deep background in Russian journalism and then a deep background in American media, but you were skeptical of the Mueller report, at least you were skeptical that it would demonstrate some, I don't know what word would you want to use, some sort of smoking gun?</p><p>So, the first question I wanted to ask you is why were you skeptical?</p><p>GESSEN: I was skeptical for a couple of reasons. One is that, and I think we know this now, right, it's very difficult to demonstrate any kind of impact on the outcome of the election, it's probably impossible, and I think we knew that going in, but there is a little bit of magical thinking that somehow it was the whole election was going to be exposed as a fraud because of Russian interference.</p><p>But the other -- the bigger reason I was skeptical and I think it has been borne out, is that I just know how haphazard and incompetent and decentralized and how much of a hustle the Russian government is. And I read the volume one of the Mueller report as a story of swindlers and hustlers and conmen who don't have a conspiracy because they don't actually have a common goal. Each one of them is out for himself, mostly it's men, with one exception, I think. Each one has his own con, each one has his own agenda, and each one is trying to con everybody else.</p><p>So, in a sense, it's the opposite of a conspiracy. It is not what we want in government and I think, you know, it certainly does not make Trump look good, and I wouldn't call it an exoneration. I think people who find Trump not only unfit but unimaginable, right. We're hoping that the report would say, OK, he came from outer space or at least from Russia, right. He is not a president elected by Americans, in some definitive way. That didn't happen. There isn't a story that can be neatly tied up like that.</p><p>MARTIN: So, what did you find in the Mueller report? What do you think the Mueller report shows?</p><p>GESSEN: Well, I spent most of my time reading volume one, which is the Russia part of the story, right. So, it's not the obstruction of justice part, which is much more straightforward and I think definitive, right. The Russia part is fascinating to me because it is a story of cons. And I think that -- and this actually -- you know, this is why I think that the story of the Mueller report is actually part and parcel of the \"New York Times\" report that came out on Trump's taxes, right. There's a swindler, a con man who has conned the country into making him president, and that's how I read the Mueller report.</p><p>MARTIN: So, the other thing that has fascinated me about your reporting is that you have suggested that the American media have maybe -- is it the media or is it the American public or some segments of the American public are completely overreacting to Putin or to Russia that they kind of -- that this -- that Russia just looms too large in the American consciousness right now. Could you talk more about why you've been saying that as well?</p><p>GESSEN: It's a tricky position for me to find myself in, because not that many years ago, I wrote a biography of Putin in which I portray him as a very dangerous, very scary man, and he is. He absolutely is. He is a tyrant. He's a dictator. He murders and jails his opponents. He is as dangerous as those kinds of men are.</p><p>He's also a small-time dictator and not a very intelligent man, one who doesn't have a master plan, one who is a different kind of con man but he has somehow now managed to con his way into the American imagination as the master mastermind behind everything. And there is no master or anything there, right.</p><p>There is a lot of meaningless (ph), there is a lot of scrappiness, there are some good instincts, good power instincts, but there isn't what Americans imagine. You know, the master plan, the concerted attack on American democracy.</p><p>MARTIN: You remind me of something that former President Obama said. He said this is a small regional power with nuclear weapons and a dwindling supply of oil.</p><p>GESSEN: Right.</p><p>MARTIN: That's what he said.</p><p>GESSEN: I think that is an accurate assessment. It has a bigger ambition than that but that's an accurate assessment of Russian status.</p><p>MARTIN: So what is Putin's goal?</p><p>GESSEN: Putin's goal is to reestablish Russia as a superpower. He will use anything that he can get his hands on to do that. He has very successfully, for example, used Syria to reestablish Russia as a superpower.</p><p>Syria, in some ways, was Putin's -- at a certain moment looked like Putin's downfall and a certain moment the was his -- the height of his strength. Putin swooped in and basically hijacked Syria.</p><p>This is summer, September of 2013, which culminates with the Putin op-ed in the \"New York Times\" which he uses American language to call out American exceptionalism. He promised that he would disarm Bashar al Assad and get rid of the chemical weapons.</p><p>Well, six years later, we know that that didn't happen. We know that, in fact, Putin helped Assad win the war and chemical weapons have been used.</p><p>MARTIN: So his goal is to make Russia a superpower to what end? Because I think Americans have a really hard time visualizing like what is the goal of this power? Because in the American imagination, yes, it's true that America has an expansionist past. But I think if we were to stop most Americans on the street right now, they don't see themselves as wanting to conquer the world just to do it.</p><p>GESSEN: Russia is an empire. Never stopped being an empire. It briefly considered not being an empire and decided that that wasn't such a great idea.</p><p>So Russia wants to reclaim its greatness. There's a great sense of nostalgic bitterness in Russia after '91 that Putin has weaponized. So that's part of it.</p><p>Another part is -- and it's related, right. There's a sense of humiliation, a sense of resentment that Putin has also weaponized very well. So being a superpower is an end in itself.</p><p>Being a superpower doesn't necessarily mean annexing other countries that serve the imperial impulse. Being a superpower just means having other countries scared of you and having the United States know that it can't take a step without consulting Russia.</p><p>MARTIN: How do you understand Putin's recent moves, and say North Korea, and Venezuela? Well, of course, we talked about Syria but how do you understand those recent moves?</p><p>GESSEN: Well, Putin doesn't have long-term plans. He is a quintessential opportunist. So when he sees an opportunity open up, he always uses it.</p><p>The opportunity with North Korea is quite obvious, talks with the United States broke down, so there's a space there that he could step into, which he needed. Venezuela is a little bit more interesting in a sense because I think that he has a way of identifying with dictators who are facing mass protest and foreign intervention. So I think that he identifies with the leader of Venezuela, and fears that if he is removed, then that means that something like that could happen to Putin as well.</p><p>MARTIN: Tell me what the Trump-Putin relationship. How do you read it?</p><p>GESSEN: Well, yes. I mean one of the things that gets lost in talking about Russia and how cozy some Americans imagine Trump to be with Russia is just how terrible the Russian-American relationship is at the moment. It's at its lowest point since the end of the Cold War.</p><p>We are this close to having no diplomatic relations at all. There are consulates in St. Petersburg and there is a Russian Consulate in San Francisco, in a tit-for-tat attack, these were shut down but also the embassy in Moscow has been designated. So many diplomats were expelled that cultural programs and educational programs have been kicked out.</p><p>What that means is that there's such a thin diplomatic relationship right now between the United States and Russia. That's a very dangerous situation, right. When we read histories of the Cold War, at least I'm always struck by moments of crisis when relationships between [13:35:00] diplomats on the ground made the difference between total annihilation of the world, as we know it, and some kind of bad peaks.</p><p>We don't have that anymore. And that's a deterioration that has happened particularly in the last couple of years.</p><p>MARTIN: But could this -- given that scenario, could then the perceived closeness between President Trump and President Putin be to the benefit of the world? I mean I'm noting as you and I are speaking now that the two presidents had an hour-long conversation which was outrageous to many American political leaders for the opposition, from the Democratic side.</p><p>They thought this is outrageous that you're having this hour-long conversation with him, when you never mentioned Russian meddling, at least according to the accounting of both sides. But is there a way their personal relationship, for whatever motivates it, could be to the benefit of the world?</p><p>GESSEN: Well, I do find that cold comfort to think that the fate of the world depends on Putin and Trump being able to get on the phone. I would really much rather imagine that it is in the hands of more intelligent, less temperamental diplomats, but also because -- and this I think is very important, right.</p><p>When we talk about diplomatic relations, we talk about national interests. We talk about normal countries where institutions exist to promote national interests as it is generally understood.</p><p>Putin runs a mafia state. There's no such thing in Russia as a national interest that is distinct from Putin's personal accrual of power and money. It's different from any kind of dictatorship or tyranny. A mafia state is a distinct phenomenon.</p><p>And we have Trump who I think would have a mafia state if he could get away with it and that's certainly what he has been trying to build.</p><p>MARTIN: So what is your worst case scenario given all that? I think the operating theory of I'll just articulate it, I'm not endorsing it, I'm just articulating it that I think the operating theory on behalf of the people who are opposed to Trump is that he has some sort of financial relationship with the Russians, that he is beholden to them in some way.</p><p>That is one reason why there is such a deep interest in his personal finance, and however disturbing and corrupt that may be, the argument I think then becomes that there is -- that both parties have an investment in maintaining cordial relations because both -- their financial interests would be jeopardized.</p><p>GESSEN: I think that misunderstands the nature of the beast, right. It misunderstands the mafia state because there's an assumption I think inherent to what you said that Putin is -- represents Russia in some sort of national way, right, and not just himself, that Trump would represent the United States in some sort of national way and not just his own financial interest.</p><p>I also don't subscribe to that theory that Trump is financially beholden to Putin for a couple of reasons. One, which is that we just don't have enough evidence to support it and I don't like theories. They're entirely connecting the dots.</p><p>But also because it's an unnecessary explanation for his admiration for Putin. He admires all dictators. He admires people who perform and exercise raw power. That's what he wants to be.</p><p>He doesn't need to be financially beholden to any of them in order to admire them.</p><p>MARTIN: You said, look, I don't like theories that are based on speculation and not about facts. More broadly, does that concern you? I mean do you think that the American media have veered too far in the direction of speculating about this president and his behavior?</p><p>GESSEN: There is a kind of mentality that I think suggests that a journalist's job is to expose secrets. And I think that exposing secrets is great but focusing on truth is actually much more important. And the distinction between truth and secrets is that truth can be observed.</p><p>We can observe reality together. And that's another way of building connections, political connections between journalists and other members of the public, whereas secrets have to be revealed. And I think that we would all be much better off analyzing together what we can observe together.</p><p>There's enough that Trump is giving us about the way he talks, the things that he says are important, the way he talks about Russia, but also the way he talks about the media, the way he talks about politics, the way he talks about protests, the way he talks about his opponents. There's enough there to not have to hypothesize that he's beholden to Putin and still be disturbing and actually still have valuable observations about his relationship to Russia and to other dictators.</p><p>[13:40:00] MARTIN: Looking back to what we talked about at the beginning, I mean you have a deep record both working in Russia as a journalist and then many, many years working here in the United States. And I'm wondering how you think that experience may inform how you look at this?</p><p>GESSEN: You know, what I actually think informs me more is that I got my start in community publishing. I started out in the Gay Press in the '80s. I worked in the Gay Press also during the aids crisis, right.</p><p>So I really knew from the time I was a teenager, which is when I started working there, that getting information to people was a political act, that it made the difference between life and death for some people. You could go and write about drug trials and you could go and write about act upon act up came on the scene, and that just writing was political, and just writing was activism.</p><p>MARTIN: How does this address the current problem where the president has explicitly identified the mainstream media, except for his preferred conservative outlet, as the enemy of the people? And we -- there's certainly nothing to take comfort from in the Russian example.</p><p>GESSEN: Well, I mean the reason the president identifies the media as the enemy of the people, and not only gets away with it but gets points for it, is that there's a crisis of trust in the media, is that there's a huge constituency in this country that feels justly not represented by the media.</p><p>And I think that the way that we address that crisis, right, not the crisis that is presented by the president, but the crisis of trust is by representing better, by situating ourselves in communities, and by being more transparent, which is something that inherently leads to more trust.</p><p>MARTIN: Masha Gessen, thank you so much for talking to us.</p><p>GESSEN: Thank you for having me.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And finally tonight, we turn to the story of a classic hero who always maintains his trust in his fellow man. Don Quixote, the heart and soul of one of the greatest Broadway musicals, Man of La Mancha, award- winning actor Kelsey Grammer and world-renowned opera star Danielle de Niese are bringing the timeless story back to London's acclaimed colosseum, which is home of the English National Opera.</p><p>They join me to talk about reviving the story of Don Quixote about idealism and daring to dream that impossible dream.</p><p>Danielle de Niese and Kelsey Grammer, welcome to the program.</p><p>DANIELLE DE NIESE, OPERA SINGER AND ACTOR, MAN OF LA MANCHA: Thank you.</p><p>KELSEY GRAMMER, ACTOR, MAN OF LA MANCHA: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Here we are, the London Colosseum, home of the English National Opera and you're doing Man of La Mancha. What made you -- what attracted you to this script to this performance? Why did you come here to do it?</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, I guess it's the song, the big song, the \"Impossible Dream.\" I grew up listening to it. I heard every version as a child, my mom driving a car, it was on the radio, but I always loved it. I always thought, boy, that's a powerful vision to dream the impossible dream.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Care to give us a couple of bars?</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, I could just do a bar. To dream the impossible dream, to fight the unbeatable foe. Yes, it's --</p><p>DE NIESE: The words, the words are so great too.</p><p>GRAMMER: It's an extraordinary song.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And the feeling and sort of the inspirational quality of it. I mean you are a professional opera singer and here you are doing this musical which is slightly different.</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean it's very clear that you are a great opera singer when you're there. How do you like that song?</p><p>DE NIESE: The song is amazing. I get to sing it at the end. And it's a hugely inspirational song and it's the song that transcended the musical in a way and sort of seeped into their mass cultural consciousness.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Any lines from you?</p><p>DE NIESE: To bear with unbearable sorrow.</p><p>GRAMMER: Lovely.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It's really beautiful. I guess I'm sort of concentrating on these words because I've also been really sort of attracted to this performance and the film back in 1972.</p><p>And I think it really, and you can tell from the audience, strikes a chord because it's about inspiration, it's about idealism, it's about, well, trying to beat and battle the odds.</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes. I'll tell you a funny story. I took a date to the film. I was in my late teens I think and I just started to weep at the end. And I sort of bolted out the side of the movie theater.</p><p>And this lovely young lady came up behind me and said gosh, \"I guess you kind of related.\" I guess so. I'm not sure our future was destined to go anywhere after that, but you know.</p><p>DE NIESE: It's great, though. I mean it's also a piece about redemption, which is a big journey that some of the characters have to make, to find the way in which they can see themselves and see the hope that lies within them. Because [13:45:00] I think your character has a tremendous amount of hope, but nobody has any hope in you.</p><p>And then my character has no hope in herself at all and needs to find that inspiration through meeting Don Quixote, to have any hope at all.</p><p>GRAMMER: You know it's funny. It just -- it has this gift that gives people the idea that you can be seen by someone else as pure, more beautiful than you even know you are. And I think that is such a magnificent thing and they do it for one another.</p><p>She reminds him of the hope and the beauty that lives in him that he's forgotten because of this drama. And she's had a whole life that's been sort of beaten down when he says I see you as something else.</p><p>DE NIESE: We had to take on the decision to really go in the direction of what the music and the text were leading us to. There's a very brutal abduction scene.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I was going to get to that because it is very uncomfortable to watch.</p><p>DE NIESE: It's not an easy scene and we have to really take a conscious decision.</p><p>AMANPOUR: That's where your character is abducted and we think raped.</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes. Well, Aldanza, basically as soon as she starts to --</p><p>GRAMMER: Oh, yes, no question.</p><p>DE NIESE: -- she starts to believe in what he's saying and --</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, it's so tragic.</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes. And she thinks well, actually, yes, I'm going to be a bigger, better person. I'm going to go and help the people who have hurt me. And as she goes to do that, they decide, no, you don't, we're going to show you exactly where you belong and it's below us.</p><p>GRAMMER: He calls her \"blessed one\" just before she's raped.</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes. No, it's horrifying but we did have to take the decision, are we going to represent this for what it is? And it's funny, it's one of the scenes that I think could be controversial but this is happening. This is happening right now in 70 countries, in war-torn countries where people can really be taken advantage of.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, I mean it's interesting because you do, you sit there, and you think wow, some of these things are actually happening now. I mean it's eternally relevant to the period. And you talk, for instance, I mean obviously there's the windmills and it takes place in this dungeon, but we learn that line tilting at windmills I guess from Don Quixote and also you say facts are the enemy of truth.</p><p>DE NIESE: What a line.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Because you're performing and you're being a character within a character. That's a pretty brutal line today.</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes, isn't it?</p><p>DE NIESE: It is a tough line. I think it's a line that if people take it and put it in the parameters of today's world, then you go, that doesn't make any sense. But I think in the context of this play, what that means is that the brutal reality that they're looking at doesn't have any hope in it.</p><p>And Cervantes is a poet. He's an author. He's trying to find a greater truth that's greater than the brutal reality.</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, for instance, we're sitting in a dungeon and I'm doing a play. I'm playing basically three characters at the same time. The truth has nothing to do with those things but those are the facts. So there we are.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Can I ask you, Kelsey, because we are talking obviously about today's politics and it's very divisive, it's very partisan, whether it's in the United States, whether it's here. You are one of those rare Hollywood beasts who is conservative and you voted for Donald Trump.</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And I just wonder, what, whether you sort of took any hits in Hollywood for that? Did you feel that you were sort of marginalized?</p><p>GRAMMER: I'm unaware of taking a hit for it. Now, certainly, there is -- passions run high and certainly, he has touched on extraordinarily passionate response. I don't know if it's as serious or horrible as everybody wants it to be.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I was wondering whether you thought the sort of, many people believe this sort of fabric is being disrupted and people --</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, I think the fabric being disrupted is a good thing.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You do?</p><p>GRAMMER: Oh, yes. I do not think Washington was doing us any favors for the last 50, 60 years. I think they've all been sort of just the same party, the same bunch of clowns, the same bunch of really unpleasant people. And I don't think they've been helping anybody but themselves. So that's been --</p><p>AMANPOUR: And what about people?</p><p>GRAMMER: People --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you wonder -- I mean here with Brexit how can people sort of get back together again?</p><p>GRAMMER: I think the English people should be just fine because they've been through a lot worse.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And the American people?</p><p>GRAMMER: And the American people will be just fine too. We've been through a lot worse.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I just want to turn to some real misfortunes that you've had in your life. I mean it is amazing that you, I mean, are still standing frankly --</p><p>GRAMMER: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- when you read what happened to your father, what happened to --</p><p>GRAMMER: Father, sister, brother.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It is almost -- I can't almost bring myself to say, murdered, died in accidents, et cetera. How do you work through that?</p><p>GRAMMER: At first, it was pretty hard. And I had -- you know, I had a rather famous battle with addiction and --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Because?</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, possibly -- yes, you know that's -- somebody once said to me, addiction is really caused by unresolved grief. [13:50:00] And I thought to myself, boy, that makes a lot of sense. And that was one of the first lights at the end of the tunnel for me where I just suddenly thought, oh, I don't need this.</p><p>And, of course, I still famously, I still have a drink. I enjoy my life but I have no use for addiction anymore. And so my life is quite good.</p><p>It just that I had to forgive whatever part of myself thought I was responsible for it. I had to understand that grief was something you have to do and do it fully and get through it and then to enjoy living. And I was able to put, the tragedy of those events in my life is not my tragedy, it's theirs.</p><p>And I think about my sister every day and I wish she was still here. I go to Colorado Springs every couple of years to keep the man who killed her in jail and these are the things we do.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And yet I was stunned to read that you said you forgave.</p><p>GRAMMER: I think you have to. I think that's how you grieve.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But you will not allow them to enjoy the liberty they have deprived your sister of.</p><p>GRAMMER: I don't see how they have that option. They killed seven people so it wasn't -- yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Does that grief come to play in this performance?</p><p>GRAMMER: Always. It is part of who I am. What is wonderful about it, I'm not a method actor. This is where I start to sound like I know everything that exists in the universe. I don't think you need that.</p><p>I think if you are reasonable, if you are an energy -- a person who relates to things who can relate to language, this is great language in this play, if by happenstance your own tragedy or your own feelings bleed through, it's just like icing on the cake.</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes.</p><p>GRAMMER: You don't have to insist that a play as big as this one come down to your level, somehow be informed by only your experience, because your experience is not a universal experience. This is a universal experience. It's supernatural. And that's what's great about theater.</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes.</p><p>GRAMMER: Shortly. I did it quickly.</p><p>AMANPOUR: No. I mean you must have seen Frazier.</p><p>DE NIESE: Of course.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And now he's coming back, right?</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes. Well, we may be coming back. We're working on -- we're cutting a new idea that we'll see if it's going to fly.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And fans of Frazier, should they be optimistic?</p><p>GRAMMER: I think they should be optimistic.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Is it more than 50/50?</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, for me, it's more than 50/50. We still have to find somebody who will pay for it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you want the whole same crew to come back?</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes. Except John, of course, he's gone but we have a way of dealing with all that.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And Danielle, you are a Glyndebourne star which is as everybody knows this sort of open-air summertime opera. And I believe you're married to the director and you live out there, right?</p><p>DE NIESE: I do, yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you're coming in here every day to London to do the performance?</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes. I'm doing two projects at the same time. As soon as Man of La Mancha opened, I started performances for Cinderella by Glyndebourne.</p><p>Glyndebourne is a fantastic theater in the countryside so it's a whole experience in addition to just great music. You got the countryside, wonderful food. It's a whole way of experiencing art that's very different and slower in a great way, because it's music and nature, and Cinderella is going to be quite a show.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So I have to let you go because you're going now for your fight rehearsal.</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But I just want to know, before you go, what do you hope to inspire your audience with, with this play? What do you want them to leave the theater with?</p><p>GRAMMER: It's always about love. It's just about love, love fully, love hard. Love the best you can every day.</p><p>DE NIESE: What do I want? I think this is like one of the best musicals to experience because you can see a musical which is just entertaining but this is both entertaining and you come away thinking about yourself and your life and what you want for yourself.</p><p>And I want people to come away going, I want to believe in the world again. I want to believe in humanity. I want to believe that people can try to be the best version of themselves, like these people found in each other.</p><p>I kind of come away hoping that that still -- we still have that capacity as humanity in the midst of all this turmoil.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I always think this way, other people talked about the rape scene for instance. It's still an exception that that's our behavior. That's not happening every day. It's happening every day somewhere but it is not the first impulse of most people.</p><p>Most people are good people. Most of the people I meet are good people. Most of the eyeballs I see into have light behind them and that's who we're talking to.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I can't let you go without asking about Sideshow Bob.</p><p>GRAMMER: All right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: He's not a good person.</p><p>GRAMMER: No, pretty irredeemable. However, he is the villain that casts a shadow through the universe.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do people stop you in the theater? Could they fully see you?</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes, they do.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do they hear your voice?</p><p>GRAMMER: Younger people especially. But I mean that show has been on for so long now but it [13:55:00] still tends to skew the younger. And so somebody, oh my god, it's him.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Sideshow Bob, Man of La La Mancha.</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Kelsey Grammer, Danielle De Niese, thank you so much for joining me.</p><p>DE NIESE: Thank you.</p><p>GRAMMER: Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And that is it for us for now. Thanks so much for watching and goodbye from London.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019051401cbk28</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W42-3621-JB20-G2YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9086\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 14, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>Terrorist, the internet, live streaming on social media, they all collided in the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand. And now, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has come to Paris to rally the world.</p><p>51 Muslim worshippers were brutally murdered by a White nationalist extremist two months ago. That violence live streamed on Facebook and spread like a virus throughout the darkest corner of the internet. Now, Ardern, together with French president, Emmanuel Macron, is meeting with government and tech leaders from around the world, pushing for a pledge to eradicate this kind of extreme content online.</p><p>But though Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, was in Paris this week, he didn't stay for these talks. Despite representing a country of just 5 million people, Jacinda Ardern has become a political heavyweight, leading the way on this issue as well as on gun control.</p><p>I traveled to Paris to talk to her, about what she calls her duty of care.</p><p>Prime minister, welcome to the program.</p><p>ARDERN: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Here you are in Paris, you're going to be co-chairing with President Macron the so-called Christchurch call. What exactly do you hope to get out of this?</p><p>ARDERN: You know, in the wake of the 15th of March, you know, there were a number of things that we as New Zealanders could do to respond to what was a horrific and jarring terrorist attack on our soil. You know, we could deal with our gun laws and we have. We could look into the way that our security and intelligences are focused and reviewed and we are.</p><p>But when it came to the way that this attack was specifically designed to be broadcast and to go viral, the response to that needed a global solution. And so, that was why we immediately got in contact with international counterparts, those who are like-minded when it comes to the notion of an open and secure internet, and use that as the basis to say there is more work to be done here when it comes to stopping the proliferation of online and violent extremism. So, that was the basis of the call.</p><p>It is really an action plan. It's the start of something. It won't be the beginning and end, but I hope the start of preventing this kind of activity online happening again.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, you have said, and you wrote an op-ed about it, that you can't do all this alone.</p><p>ARDERN: No.</p><p>AMANPOUR: The corporations have to do their part as well and obviously governments as well. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook was here.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But he's not here for the conference. He did meet with President Macron. Have you actually spoken to him? What --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Has he given you a pledge? Because this is a voluntary call.</p><p>ARDERN: It is, it is. And look, there's good logistical reasons for this. This is an action plan that we wanted to start the work on in the immediate aftermath of the 15th of March. And here we are, you know, roughly two months later pulling together both countries and companies, and that is a big distinction from what's happened before.</p><p>We were all around the table, setting forth the kind of areas of work the public can have a reasonable expectation where things need to change. If we had gone to a treaty level document, that generally would have excluded private companies and they would have taken a very long time. So, we are asking for cooperation, and I think it's the least that can be offered in these circumstances.</p><p>I've spoken to Mark Zuckerberg directly twice now. And actually, we've had good ongoing engagement with Facebook. And the last time I spoke to him a matter of days ago, he did give Facebook's support to this call to action.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And what? Because, for instance, I spoke to Eric Schmidt yesterday and he obviously is the former CEO and chairman of Google and he was quite exorcised by the idea that any government would consider regulation or that companies should be broken up for [13:05:00] anti-trust or other such reason.</p><p>He said, you know, \"Give this duty to us. We will regulate ourselves. Just give us more time, we'll develop the tools.\"</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you buy that?</p><p>ARDERN: Well, I think this is about acknowledging that actually we've seen to-date a proliferation of domestic regulation, and for good reason. You know, we as leaders have a duty of care and when we see harm being done and the proliferation of terrorism and violent extremism, people look to us for answers. So, we have seen domestic responses in that way.</p><p>But actually, most of those tend to focus on takedown periods, penalties if you see objectionable material continue to proliferate, we need to get in front of this before the harm is done. For instance, that video after the 15th of March, it was taken down by Facebook 1.5 million times. It was uploaded once every second on YouTube for a period in those first 24 hours.</p><p>Now, in New Zealand they're not alone, I know 8,000 New Zealanders called a mental health support line because they saw the video and it caused them distress. So, my view is what can we do to get in front of this? Technology is moving quite quickly. We may not have all of the responses we need now but we need to work on them and we need to work together.</p><p>So, that's why this call to action is not just about regulation, but instead about bringing companies to the table, saying, \"You have a role too and we have expectations of you.\"</p><p>AMANPOUR: To that point, you've written quite dramatically about how pervasive that video was. First of all, you've said the attack was part of a horrifying new trend that seems to be spreading around the world, designed to be broadcast on the internet. And you've also said that you, yourself, accidentally inadvertently came across it.</p><p>ARDERN: I did. I did.</p><p>AMANPOUR: How did that affect you? You've talked about the mental health trauma of those in New Zealand who saw it?</p><p>ARDERN: You know, all of that has done is highlight for me two things, really just how available it was. My recollection, because it was in the first early period, was going to post information out using my social media channels because I manage my own social media and it means I have that experience of what it is to use these platforms and how they can be used as a tool for good.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>ARDERN: And there it was. And so, I know that a lot of New Zealanders and a lot of people globally will inadvertently have seen this video, but it also then gave me insight into what exactly it looked like. And for me, that just only enhances that since that I have a duty of care, and in fact, we all do.</p><p>Those tech companies, I do not for a moment believe they wanted to see their platforms used for such a vile, heinous act, but I don't think it's enough for us to say well and accepting that we all want an open and a free and secure internet that we have to accept that these kinds of activities will happen as a by-product, we don't have to accept that, but we have to put our minds collectively to the solution.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And obviously, there's a lot talked about, 8chan.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: This platform which is host to so much extremist content, including the New Zealand --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- shooter.</p><p>ARDERN: It was.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And even the synagogue shooter in the United States.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Again, that's specific sort of dark area --</p><p>ARDERN: It is</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- where this extremist content lives --</p><p>ARDERN: IT is.</p><p>AMANPOUR: and proliferates.</p><p>ARDERN: It is. And, you know, we find ourselves now in the challenging space, of course, you know, with the call to action that we're involved in here, actually we're dealing with those mainstream tech companies. There is -- there are platforms out there who are never going to engage in this way with government, who are never going to see that they have any duty of care or sense of responsibility, and that's why we cannot take off the table governments actually looking at the other tools they have, because platforms like that, that was actively used by the terrorists in this situation.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I just want to ask you about whether you think these companies have become too powerful. For instance, Chris Hughes, who is one of the co-founders of --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- Facebook has recently said that because --</p><p>ARDERN: A very significant piece.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Very significant. Because Facebook so dominate social networking, faces no market-based accountability. This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern, first outrage, then disappointment and finally resignation.</p><p>And actually, your own privacy commission, he tweeted something very, very pointed \"Facebook cannot be trusted. They are morally bankrupt pathological liars who enable genocide,\" he's talking about Myanmar and the killing of the Rohingya Muslims there, \"facilitate foreign undermining of democratic institutions, Russia, in election, allow the livestreaming of suicides, rapes and murders, continue to host and publish and mosque attack video, allow advertisers to target Jew haters and other harmful market segments. Refuse to accept any responsibility for any content or harm. They #dontgiveazuck.\"</p><p>Now, he did take it down. But nonetheless, [13:10:00] that's what he feels.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes. And that was our privacy commissioner, obviously, focused on the protection of New Zealander' data and information. And he, of course, expressed a huge -- a strong sense of responsibility in those comments. You know --</p><p>AMANPOUR: But do you think like he doesn't think that you can actually work with the CEOs, that they're not necessarily going to do the right thing. They don't have the duty of care that you have.</p><p>ARDERN: Well, the alternative, however, is to do nothing. And I do not accept that as an option. That's the first point. The second point, you know, in the aftermath of the 15th of March, it was only a few days after, I traveled to Christchurch and visited a high school where pupils from that high school were being affected directly by the attack.</p><p>And I asked them, you know, some questions, because one of the student leaders there had been involved in organizing a spontaneous gathering of young people, and the pack near the mosque where the attack occurred. And that gathering was just a chance for those young people to come together, show their support for the New Zealand Muslim community and to grieve together. And it was an incredible sight and they did that through social media.</p><p>So, I asked these students who have actually -- who was involved in it, because they saw those messages and joined together and all the hands went up. And I said, \"Who equally has seen things online that they would consider to be harmful, distressing and obscene?\" Now, all the hands go up.</p><p>Now, this in one place is a tool that has a huge potential to do good. But at the same time, if left unchecked, we've seen just the harm that can be done as well. You know, and as someone who has been a user of Facebook since the very beginning, I can see that it has grown and turned into a hugely significant platform, probably outstripping some of those early founders' expectations. But now, we are therefore having to retrofit a response as a as a result.</p><p>But I don't think it's enough to say that just because it's growing in this unwieldy way that we don't have that duty, and I'm not willing to sit back and say it can't be done. And I don't think they are either.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. They may not be and say that they don't want to see their platforms used that way but they also made a lot of money. They made a lot of money from --</p><p>ARDERN: Sure.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- the live streaming of this terrible massacre in your country. I wonder whether you feel that you have the moral high ground, that you can actually -- I mean, I'm not going to say beat them over the head, but nonetheless, exert that moral imperative after what happened in your country, for the first time ever, there's never been such a terrifying, terrible massacre like that.</p><p>ARDERN: I guess there are two high grounds here, though, when it comes to the debate in this space and civil society reach -- you know, rightly needs to have its voice here as well. Because our focus is very much on violent extremism and terrorism online, and we've been specific about that, because, you know, this doesn't need to dip into, therefore debate around curtailing freedom of expression because that's something that New Zealanders hold very dear too.</p><p>We're an opinionated country. We like the ability to share our minds. We don't want it to be constrained by border. We certainly don't want it constrained by government. But that's why we have seen, look, let's look at the area where we can agree, where we can maintain that principle of an open, free and secure internet, that actually where we collectively reject the idea then holding to those principles, you allow violent extremism. And so, that's our starting point.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I want to show you something, which I'm sure you've actually seen. So, a month ago --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- when your little daughter was nine months old, your partner, her father, said, \"For her nine-month birthday today, we received the gift of crawling, while her mom got her the gift of having a safer country to grow up in.\" That is a really clever way of --</p><p>ARDERN: Of telling me she's crawling.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- of telling you she's crawling. But also, perhaps reacting to what you did so swiftly with your political partners and opponents, toughen up your gun laws.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You know, even President Obama couldn't do that in the United States after the massacre of children at Sandy Hook.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But you did. In a matter of 26 days, legislation was passed.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes. I think that speaks to the impact of the 15th of March on New Zealand. We did have permissive gun laws, we did. And, you know, there is, of course, a very practical use for the guns that we do use and license in New Zealand, but there is actually a whole set of weapons that were just available but unjustifiably so.</p><p>And so, I remember very distinctly sitting in a briefing where the police told me the weapons that have been used on the [13:15:00] 15th of March and how easily they were legally obtained and then illegally modified for the purposes of that attack. And there was no question in my mind that our laws needed to change in that moment.</p><p>What I'm heartened by is that I did not question for a moment that parliament would support that law change.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>ARDERN: And that absolutely proved to be the case. Not only did we change our laws but that law basically moved through in roughly the course of two weeks.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. I mean, it's remarkable.</p><p>ARDERN: But I think it just --</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean --</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- speaks to the strength of feeling in the aftermath of that attack. You know, we had debated gun law change before in New Zealand, we had. And periodically, it had come up over the years but it hadn't led to substantive change.</p><p>But after you witness 51 of your New Zealand Muslim community be attacked in that way, you know, the only answer was to do everything we could to prevent it every happening again.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, just to remind, over 110 mass shooting in the United States since 1982, according to an investigative site, 15 school shootings alone this year. It's a really difficult topic to grapple. I mean, I wonder whether you ever think that other countries can learn from what you did and actually, from what neighboring Australia did after their massacre --</p><p>ARDERN: Absolutely.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- in 1996, a conservative government passed tough gun laws.</p><p>ARDERN: And in both cases, you know -- and again, I have to acknowledge, New Zealand had pretty permissive gun legislation.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, actually, some of your people said, you know, \"We feed half the world. We're hunters.\"</p><p>ARDERN: And we are, and we will continue to be a food-producing nation that deals with animal welfare issues and so on and has a practical purpose and use for guns, but you can draw a line and say that that does not mean that you need access to military-style semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles. You do not.</p><p>And New Zealand is by and large absolutely agreed with that position. Australia experienced a massacre and changed their laws. New Zealand had its experience and changed its laws. To be honest with you, I do not understand the United States.</p><p>AMANPOUR: What kind of a conversation did you have with President Trump after the massacre? I know you spoke by phone. You refused to name the shooter.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You won't say his name. The media also is joining in not showing his manifesto.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes,</p><p>AMANPOUR: They pledge not to broadcast any White nationalist --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- signs he might make in trial.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: This, again, is quite rare --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- to get that level of cooperation. This was a White nationalist terrorist. What did you say to President Trump about naming and calling out this kind of terrorism?</p><p>ARDERN: Well, at that point, it was very early on that I had a conversation with President Trump. Certainly, I had been calling since the day of the attack, I had been calling it a terrorist attack. And so, naturally did in the conversation as well.</p><p>But at that time, actually, my view around never mentioning his name specifically, that was something that I really came to form a strong view over the course of a few days and it just seemed instinctive to me that that would be the way we should respond. And so, it was a couple of days later that I really decided I would formalize that openly and declare I would never use his name.</p><p>I think, you know, that there was from the call with President Trump, he expressed, you know, very sincerely the condolences of the people of the United States. And in that moment, I simply reflected back that the New Zealand community at that moment in time would totally focus on our Muslim community, because they were -- you know, they are a part of our nation, and we felt that duty of care, and we hadn't been able to keep them safe.</p><p>And so, that was my response to him, was that at this time, I think globally, that's when members of our Muslim community would have been feeling it beyond New Zealand's shores.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you asked him to share the love --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes, yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- of the Muslim community.</p><p>ARDERN: Because that's exactly what New Zealanders were doing.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, you shared the love. You have become incredibly prominent, because of your reaction after this massacre. You know, it's said that leaders are tested at the height of the worst crises that their countries face. And you have suddenly become the poster prime minister for, dare I say, enlightened and most definitely compassionate leadership, that's what everybody is saying about you.</p><p>I wonder how that feels and I wonder what your instinct was, you know, when you entered the hospitals, when you went into the mosque --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- when you went to their community in the immediate aftermath.</p><p>ARDERN: You know, I'd like to think that actually, any words I uttered or actions, even decisions to [13:20:00] be amongst those who were grieving at any given time was actually just the exact same response that you were seeing from New Zealanders. And many will have seen images in the aftermath and the days after New Zealanders just instinctively, even if I've never visited before, went to their local mosque, even if it was to stand outside and make sure that our New Zealand Muslim community felt safe to return for the call to prayer. They left flowers. They spontaneously sang. They embraced one another.</p><p>And so, my response at the time in the privileged position of being a prime minister was simply to echo that, exactly -- echo exactly what New Zealanders were intuitively doing. And when you think about those moments of grief, I'd like to think that we would all just respond in the same way if we had, you know, grief in our family, you embrace one another, you look after one another. You think about each other's well-being. You think about whether or not people feel safe, because a lot of our Muslim women didn't, and still don't.</p><p>And to me, that is just intuitive. I would like to think any leader would just respond in the most human of ways, and that's all I did. Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I just want to quickly move on to climate, because you're a big proponent of duty of care to the climate as well, to the planet. And obviously, you are a low-lying nation.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And we're talking about rising seas and all the rest of it. I wonder how much impact these phenomenal young people have had, led by Greta Thunberg --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- in Sweden but spreading to New Zealand, to Australia and all over the world, telling our generation --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- to get serious.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Just how much impact did have they had? Because there's a bill tabled also in your parliament --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- calling for carbon neutral, zero-carbon by 2050.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes. Yes, there is. And --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Is that enough, by the way? Some people are saying --</p><p>ARDERN: Not for us. So, we've not only committed to zero-carbon by 2050, we've also embedded a 1.5-degree target within our legislation as well. Now, that's different. Not everyone is doing that but we were deliberate about that because yes of the voice of young people in New Zealand but also because we are a member of the Pacific.</p><p>And if we were to sit in aspiration of anything above 1.5, we would be accepting that our Pacific neighbors would weigh the consequence of catastrophic sea level rises, and devastating effects, and we couldn't accept that. How could we put in a tolerance into our legislation and just accept that that was going to be a fight (ph) of complaint, so we don't. And so, our zero-carbon legislation covers both this -- an aspiration of being rich in carbon neutrality but also that very important target around warming.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you feel sort of panicky? I mean, we seem to have got to a head, you know, the U.N. report on the million species that have already been extinct.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, the terrible fear we're headed beyond 1.5 --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- and none of the countries have kept up their commitments --</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- under the Paris Accord. Of course, the United States is pulling out of it.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Are you concerned that we may be beyond the point of no return?</p><p>ARDERN: I feel a huge sense of urgency. I feel a huge sense of responsibility. But the last thing, the last perception that I would want left is this idea that it's too late. We can't do anything. So, why bother? Because that actually takes the responsibility away.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>ARDERN: That says to leaders and nations, you don't have to change or commit, because there's nothing we can do about it. We can do something about it. The science tells us what we need to do now and what we need to do in the long-term. We just need to listen to the science and we then need to act. And perhaps it is because we're sitting on the doorstep of (INAUDIBLE), this isn't hypothetical anymore. How can we look our Pacific neighbors in the eye and say it's too late? And so, I urge any leader, come to the Pacific. You know, hear it for yourselves. Take that home and share it with your communities.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And I cannot leave you without asking you a final personal question. At Easter time, your partner, the father of your daughter, proposed to you.</p><p>ARDERN: Yes, he did. Very surprising.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Did you not see it coming?</p><p>ARDERN: No. Nope. Not at all. Not for a moment.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Bended knee? I mean, is that a beautiful engagement ring you're fashioning around?</p><p>ARDERN: Yes, that is. That is. It's his grandmother's and so, it doesn't fit on the actual finger. So, no, I was very surprised. I was, you know, a pair of tights and cap and my sneakers. You know, we went for a walk up the hill and yes, he asked me there. It was lovely.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Good. Well, congratulations to you --</p><p>ARDERN: Thank you very much.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- and to your family. [13:25:00]</p><p>ARDERN: We do not have time for a wedding. So, we'll see.</p><p>AMANPOUR: No wedding in office.</p><p>ARDERN: I have no idea, but we'll do it sometime. Things are very busy.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes, they are. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, thank you so much for joining me.</p><p>ARDERN: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Very busy indeed with all the politics she has. Now, of course, American officials are in touch with her government, but senior representatives will be absent from the tech control summit in Paris she's co-chairing.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo however is meeting President Vladimir Putin in Russia instead. It is the first such meeting since the release of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Masha Gessen is a Russian-American journalist with intimate knowledge of both countries. And her latest book, \"The Future is History,\" is a gripping look at the toxic legacy of the Soviet era. She sat down with Michel Martin to discuss the release of the Mueller report and Putin's end game.</p><p>MICHEL MARTIN, CORRESPONDENT: Masha Gessen, thanks for talking with us.</p><p>MASHA GESSEN, STAFF WRITER, THE NEW YORKER: Thank you for having me.</p><p>MARTIN: Now, you occupy this very unique position in journalism, both having a deep background in Russian journalism and then a deep background in American media, but you were skeptical of the Mueller report, at least you were skeptical that it would demonstrate some, I don't know what word would you want to use, some sort of smoking gun?</p><p>So, the first question I wanted to ask you is why were you skeptical?</p><p>GESSEN: I was skeptical for a couple of reasons. One is that, and I think we know this now, right, it's very difficult to demonstrate any kind of impact on the outcome of the election, it's probably impossible, and I think we knew that going in, but there is a little bit of magical thinking that somehow it was the whole election was going to be exposed as a fraud because of Russian interference.</p><p>But the other -- the bigger reason I was skeptical and I think it has been borne out, is that I just know how haphazard and incompetent and decentralized and how much of a hustle the Russian government is. And I read the volume one of the Mueller report as a story of swindlers and hustlers and conmen who don't have a conspiracy because they don't actually have a common goal. Each one of them is out for himself, mostly it's men, with one exception, I think. Each one has his own con, each one has his own agenda, and each one is trying to con everybody else.</p><p>So, in a sense, it's the opposite of a conspiracy. It is not what we want in government and I think, you know, it certainly does not make Trump look good, and I wouldn't call it an exoneration. I think people who find Trump not only unfit but unimaginable, right. We're hoping that the report would say, OK, he came from outer space or at least from Russia, right. He is not a president elected by Americans, in some definitive way. That didn't happen. There isn't a story that can be neatly tied up like that.</p><p>MARTIN: So, what did you find in the Mueller report? What do you think the Mueller report shows?</p><p>GESSEN: Well, I spent most of my time reading volume one, which is the Russia part of the story, right. So, it's not the obstruction of justice part, which is much more straightforward and I think definitive, right. The Russia part is fascinating to me because it is a story of cons. And I think that -- and this actually -- you know, this is why I think that the story of the Mueller report is actually part and parcel of the \"New York Times\" report that came out on Trump's taxes, right. There's a swindler, a con man who has conned the country into making him president, and that's how I read the Mueller report.</p><p>MARTIN: So, the other thing that has fascinated me about your reporting is that you have suggested that the American media have maybe -- is it the media or is it the American public or some segments of the American public are completely overreacting to Putin or to Russia that they kind of -- that this -- that Russia just looms too large in the American consciousness right now. Could you talk more about why you've been saying that as well?</p><p>GESSEN: It's a tricky position for me to find myself in, because not that many years ago, I wrote a biography of Putin in which I portray him as a very dangerous, very scary man, and he is. He absolutely is. He is a tyrant. He's a dictator. He murders and jails his opponents. He is as dangerous as those kinds of men are.</p><p>He's also a small-time dictator and not a very intelligent man, one who doesn't have a master plan, one who is a different kind of con man but he has somehow now managed to con his way into the American imagination as the master mastermind behind everything. And there is no master or anything there, right.</p><p>There is a lot of meaningless (ph), there is a lot of scrappiness, there are some good instincts, good power instincts, but there isn't what Americans imagine.</p><p>[13:30:00]</p><p>You know, the master plan, the concerted attack on American democracy.</p><p>MARTIN: You remind me of something that former President Obama said. He said this is a small regional power with nuclear weapons and a dwindling supply of oil.</p><p>GESSEN: Right.</p><p>MARTIN: That's what he said.</p><p>GESSEN: I think that is an accurate assessment. It has a bigger ambition than that but that's an accurate assessment of Russian status.</p><p>MARTIN: So what is Putin's goal?</p><p>GESSEN: Putin's goal is to reestablish Russia as a superpower. He will use anything that he can get his hands on to do that. He has very successfully, for example, used Syria to reestablish Russia as a superpower.</p><p>Syria, in some ways, was Putin's -- at a certain moment looked like Putin's downfall and a certain moment the was his -- the height of his strength. Putin swooped in and basically hijacked Syria.</p><p>This is summer, September of 2013, which culminates with the Putin op-ed in the \"New York Times\" which he uses American language to call out American exceptionalism. He promised that he would disarm Bashar al Assad and get rid of the chemical weapons.</p><p>Well, six years later, we know that that didn't happen. We know that, in fact, Putin helped Assad win the war and chemical weapons have been used.</p><p>MARTIN: So his goal is to make Russia a superpower to what end? Because I think Americans have a really hard time visualizing like what is the goal of this power?</p><p>Because in the American imagination, yes, it's true that America has an expansionist past. But I think if we were to stop most Americans on the street right now, they don't see themselves as wanting to conquer the world just to do it.</p><p>GESSEN: Russia is an empire. Never stopped being an empire. It briefly considered not being an empire and decided that that wasn't such a great idea.</p><p>So Russia wants to reclaim its greatness. There's a great sense of nostalgic bitterness in Russia after '91 that Putin has weaponized. So that's part of it.</p><p>Another part is -- and it's related, right. There's a sense of humiliation, a sense of resentment that Putin has also weaponized very well. So being a superpower is an end in itself.</p><p>Being a superpower doesn't necessarily mean annexing other countries that serve the imperial impulse. Being a superpower just means having other countries scared of you and having the United States know that it can't take a step without consulting Russia.</p><p>MARTIN: How do you understand Putin's recent moves, and say North Korea, and Venezuela? Well, of course, we talked about Syria but how do you understand those recent moves?</p><p>GESSEN: Well, Putin doesn't have long-term plans. He is a quintessential opportunist. So when he sees an opportunity open up, he always uses it.</p><p>The opportunity with North Korea is quite obvious, talks with the United States broke down, so there's a space there that he could step into, which he needed. Venezuela is a little bit more interesting in a sense because I think that he has a way of identifying with dictators who are facing mass protest and foreign intervention. So I think that he identifies with the leader of Venezuela, and fears that if he is removed, then that means that something like that could happen to Putin as well.</p><p>MARTIN: Tell me what the Trump-Putin relationship. How do you read it?</p><p>GESSEN: Well, yes. I mean one of the things that gets lost in talking about Russia and how cozy some Americans imagine Trump to be with Russia is just how terrible the Russian-American relationship is at the moment. It's at its lowest point since the end of the Cold War.</p><p>We are this close to having no diplomatic relations at all. There are consulates in St. Petersburg and there is a Russian Consulate in San Francisco, in a tit-for-tat attack, these were shut down but also the embassy in Moscow has been designated. So many diplomats were expelled that cultural programs and educational programs have been kicked out.</p><p>What that means is that there's such a thin diplomatic relationship right now between the United States and Russia. That's a very dangerous situation, right.</p><p>[13:35:00] When we read histories of the Cold War, at least I'm always struck by moments of crisis when relationships between diplomats on the ground made the difference between total annihilation of the world, as we know it, and some kind of bad peaks.</p><p>We don't have that anymore. And that's a deterioration that has happened particularly in the last couple of years.</p><p>MARTIN: But could this -- given that scenario, could then the perceived closeness between President Trump and President Putin be to the benefit of the world? I mean I'm noting as you and I are speaking now that the two presidents had an hour-long conversation which was outrageous to many American political leaders for the opposition, from the Democratic side.</p><p>They thought this is outrageous that you're having this hour-long conversation with him, when you never mentioned Russian meddling, at least according to the accounting of both sides. But is there a way their personal relationship, for whatever motivates it, could be to the benefit of the world?</p><p>GESSEN: Well, I do find that cold comfort to think that the fate of the world depends on Putin and Trump being able to get on the phone. I would really much rather imagine that it is in the hands of more intelligent, less temperamental diplomats, but also because -- and this I think is very important, right.</p><p>When we talk about diplomatic relations, we talk about national interests. We talk about normal countries where institutions exist to promote national interests as it is generally understood.</p><p>Putin runs a mafia state. There's no such thing in Russia as a national interest that is distinct from Putin's personal accrual of power and money.</p><p>It's different from any kind of dictatorship or tyranny. A mafia state is a distinct phenomenon.</p><p>And we have Trump who I think would have a mafia state if he could get away with it and that's certainly what he has been trying to build.</p><p>MARTIN: So what is your worst case scenario given all that? I think the operating theory of I'll just articulate it, I'm not endorsing it, I'm just articulating it that I think the operating theory on behalf of the people who are opposed to Trump is that he has some sort of financial relationship with the Russians, that he is beholden to them in some way.</p><p>That is one reason why there is such a deep interest in his personal finance, and however disturbing and corrupt that may be, the argument I think then becomes that there is -- that both parties have an investment in maintaining cordial relations because both -- their financial interests would be jeopardized.</p><p>GESSEN: I think that misunderstands the nature of the beast, right. It misunderstands the mafia state because there's an assumption I think inherent to what you said that Putin is -- represents Russia in some sort of national way, right, and not just himself, that Trump would represent the United States in some sort of national way and not just his own financial interest.</p><p>I also don't subscribe to that theory that Trump is financially beholden to Putin for a couple of reasons. One, which is that we just don't have enough evidence to support it and I don't like theories. They're entirely connecting the dots.</p><p>But also because it's an unnecessary explanation for his admiration for Putin. He admires all dictators. He admires people who perform and exercise raw power. That's what he wants to be.</p><p>He doesn't need to be financially beholden to any of them in order to admire them.</p><p>MARTIN: You said, look, I don't like theories that are based on speculation and not about facts. More broadly, does that concern you? I mean do you think that the American media have veered too far in the direction of speculating about this president and his behavior?</p><p>GESSEN: There is a kind of mentality that I think suggests that a journalist's job is to expose secrets. And I think that exposing secrets is great but focusing on truth is actually much more important. And the distinction between truth and secrets is that truth can be observed.</p><p>We can observe reality together. And that's another way of building connections, political connections between journalists and other members of the public, whereas secrets have to be revealed. And I think that we would all be much better off analyzing together what we can observe together.</p><p>There's enough that Trump is giving us about the way he talks, the things that he says are important, the way he talks about Russia, but also the way he talks about the media, the way he talks about politics, the way he talks about protests, the way he talks about his opponents.</p><p>There's enough there [13:40:00] to not have to hypothesize that he's beholden to Putin and still be disturbing and actually still have valuable observations about his relationship to Russia and to other dictators.</p><p>MARTIN: Looking back to what we talked about at the beginning, I mean you have a deep record both working in Russia as a journalist and then many, many years working here in the United States. And I'm wondering how you think that experience may inform how you look at this?</p><p>GESSEN: You know, what I actually think informs me more is that I got my start in community publishing. I started out in the Gay Press in the '80s. I worked in the Gay Press also during the aids crisis, right.</p><p>So I really knew from the time I was a teenager, which is when I started working there, that getting information to people was a political act, that it made the difference between life and death for some people. You could go and write about drug trials and you could go and write about act upon act up came on the scene, and that just writing was political, and just writing was activism.</p><p>MARTIN: How does this address the current problem where the president has explicitly identified the mainstream media, except for his preferred conservative outlet, as the enemy of the people? And we -- there's certainly nothing to take comfort from in the Russian example.</p><p>GESSEN: Well, I mean the reason the president identifies the media as the enemy of the people, and not only gets away with it but gets points for it, is that there's a crisis of trust in the media, is that there's a huge constituency in this country that feels justly not represented by the media.</p><p>And I think that the way that we address that crisis, right, not the crisis that is presented by the president, but the crisis of trust is by representing better, by situating ourselves in communities, and by being more transparent, which is something that inherently leads to more trust.</p><p>MARTIN: Masha Gessen, thank you so much for talking to us.</p><p>GESSEN: Thank you for having me.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And finally tonight, we turn to the story of a classic hero who always maintains his trust in his fellow man. Don Quixote, the heart and soul of one of the greatest Broadway musicals, Man of La Mancha, award- winning actor Kelsey Grammer and world-renowned opera star Danielle de Niese are bringing the timeless story back to London's acclaimed colosseum, which is home of the English National Opera.</p><p>They join me to talk about reviving the story of Don Quixote about idealism and daring to dream that impossible dream.</p><p>Danielle de Niese and Kelsey Grammer, welcome to the program.</p><p>DANIELLE DE NIESE, OPERA SINGER AND ACTOR, MAN OF LA MANCHA: Thank you.</p><p>KELSEY GRAMMER, ACTOR, MAN OF LA MANCHA: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Here we are, the London Colosseum, home of the English National Opera and you're doing Man of La Mancha. What made you -- what attracted you to this script to this performance? Why did you come here to do it?</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, I guess it's the song, the big song, the \"Impossible Dream.\" I grew up listening to it. I heard every version as a child, my mom driving a car, it was on the radio, but I always loved it. I always thought, boy, that's a powerful vision to dream the impossible dream.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Care to give us a couple of bars?</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, I could just do a bar. To dream the impossible dream, to fight the unbeatable foe. Yes, it's --</p><p>DE NIESE: The words, the words are so great too.</p><p>GRAMMER: It's an extraordinary song.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And the feeling and sort of the inspirational quality of it. I mean you are a professional opera singer and here you are doing this musical which is slightly different.</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean it's very clear that you are a great opera singer when you're there. How do you like that song?</p><p>DE NIESE: The song is amazing. I get to sing it at the end. And it's a hugely inspirational song and it's the song that transcended the musical in a way and sort of seeped into their mass cultural consciousness.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Any lines from you?</p><p>DE NIESE: To bear with unbearable sorrow.</p><p>GRAMMER: Lovely.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It's really beautiful. I guess I'm sort of concentrating on these words because I've also been really sort of attracted to this performance and the film back in 1972.</p><p>And I think it really, and you can tell from the audience, strikes a chord because it's about inspiration, it's about idealism, it's about, well, trying to beat and battle the odds.</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes. I'll tell you a funny story. I took a date to the film. I was in my late teens I think and I just started to weep at the end. And I sort of bolted out the side of the movie theater.</p><p>And this lovely young lady came up behind me and said gosh, \"I guess you kind of related.\" I guess so. I'm not sure our future was destined to go anywhere after that, but you know.</p><p>DE NIESE: It's great, though. I mean it's also a piece about redemption, which is a big journey that some of the characters have to make, to find the [13:45:00] way in which they can see themselves and see the hope that lies within them. Because I think your character has a tremendous amount of hope, but nobody has any hope in you.</p><p>And then my character has no hope in herself at all and needs to find that inspiration through meeting Don Quixote, to have any hope at all.</p><p>GRAMMER: You know it's funny. It just -- it has this gift that gives people the idea that you can be seen by someone else as pure, more beautiful than you even know you are. And I think that is such a magnificent thing and they do it for one another.</p><p>She reminds him of the hope and the beauty that lives in him that he's forgotten because of this drama. And she's had a whole life that's been sort of beaten down when he says I see you as something else.</p><p>DE NIESE: We had to take on the decision to really go in the direction of what the music and the text were leading us to. There's a very brutal abduction scene.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I was going to get to that because it is very uncomfortable to watch.</p><p>DE NIESE: It's not an easy scene and we have to really take a conscious decision.</p><p>AMANPOUR: That's where your character is abducted and we think raped.</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes. Well, Aldanza, basically as soon as she starts to --</p><p>GRAMMER: Oh, yes, no question.</p><p>DE NIESE: -- she starts to believe in what he's saying and --</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, it's so tragic.</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes. And she thinks well, actually, yes, I'm going to be a bigger, better person. I'm going to go and help the people who have hurt me. And as she goes to do that, they decide, no, you don't, we're going to show you exactly where you belong and it's below us.</p><p>GRAMMER: He calls her \"blessed one\" just before she's raped.</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes. No, it's horrifying but we did have to take the decision, are we going to represent this for what it is? And it's funny, it's one of the scenes that I think could be controversial but this is happening. This is happening right now in 70 countries, in war-torn countries where people can really be taken advantage of.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, I mean it's interesting because you do, you sit there, and you think wow, some of these things are actually happening now. I mean it's eternally relevant to the period. And you talk, for instance, I mean obviously there's the windmills and it takes place in this dungeon, but we learn that line tilting at windmills I guess from Don Quixote and also you say facts are the enemy of truth.</p><p>DE NIESE: What a line.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Because you're performing and you're being a character within a character. That's a pretty brutal line today.</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes, isn't it?</p><p>DE NIESE: It is a tough line. I think it's a line that if people take it and put it in the parameters of today's world, then you go, that doesn't make any sense. But I think in the context of this play, what that means is that the brutal reality that they're looking at doesn't have any hope in it.</p><p>And Cervantes is a poet. He's an author. He's trying to find a greater truth that's greater than the brutal reality.</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, for instance, we're sitting in a dungeon and I'm doing a play. I'm playing basically three characters at the same time. The truth has nothing to do with those things but those are the facts. So there we are.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Can I ask you, Kelsey, because we are talking obviously about today's politics and it's very divisive, it's very partisan, whether it's in the United States, whether it's here. You are one of those rare Hollywood beasts who is conservative and you voted for Donald Trump.</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And I just wonder, what, whether you sort of took any hits in Hollywood for that? Did you feel that you were sort of marginalized?</p><p>GRAMMER: I'm unaware of taking a hit for it. Now, certainly, there is -- passions run high and certainly, he has touched on extraordinarily passionate response. I don't know if it's as serious or horrible as everybody wants it to be.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I was wondering whether you thought the sort of, many people believe this sort of fabric is being disrupted and people --</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, I think the fabric being disrupted is a good thing.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You do?</p><p>GRAMMER: Oh, yes. I do not think Washington was doing us any favors for the last 50, 60 years. I think they've all been sort of just the same party, the same bunch of clowns, the same bunch of really unpleasant people. And I don't think they've been helping anybody but themselves. So that's been --</p><p>AMANPOUR: And what about people?</p><p>GRAMMER: People --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you wonder -- I mean here with Brexit how can people sort of get back together again?</p><p>GRAMMER: I think the English people should be just fine because they've been through a lot worse.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And the American people?</p><p>GRAMMER: And the American people will be just fine too. We've been through a lot worse.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I just want to turn to some real misfortunes that you've had in your life. I mean it is amazing that you, I mean, are still standing frankly --</p><p>GRAMMER: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- when you read what happened to your father, what happened to --</p><p>GRAMMER: Father, sister, brother.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It is almost -- I can't almost bring myself to say, murdered, died in accidents, et cetera. How do you work through that?</p><p>GRAMMER: At first, it was pretty hard. And I had -- you know, I had a rather famous battle with addiction and --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Because?</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, [13:50:00] possibly -- yes, you know that's -- somebody once said to me, addiction is really caused by unresolved grief. And I thought to myself, boy, that makes a lot of sense. And that was one of the first lights at the end of the tunnel for me where I just suddenly thought, oh, I don't need this.</p><p>And, of course, I still famously, I still have a drink. I enjoy my life but I have no use for addiction anymore. And so my life is quite good.</p><p>It just that I had to forgive whatever part of myself thought I was responsible for it. I had to understand that grief was something you have to do and do it fully and get through it and then to enjoy living. And I was able to put, the tragedy of those events in my life is not my tragedy, it's theirs.</p><p>And I think about my sister every day and I wish she was still here. I go to Colorado Springs every couple of years to keep the man who killed her in jail and these are the things we do.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And yet I was stunned to read that you said you forgave.</p><p>GRAMMER: I think you have to. I think that's how you grieve.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But you will not allow them to enjoy the liberty they have deprived your sister of.</p><p>GRAMMER: I don't see how they have that option. They killed seven people so it wasn't -- yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Does that grief come to play in this performance?</p><p>GRAMMER: Always. It is part of who I am. What is wonderful about it, I'm not a method actor. This is where I start to sound like I know everything that exists in the universe. I don't think you need that.</p><p>I think if you are reasonable, if you are an energy -- a person who relates to things who can relate to language, this is great language in this play, if by happenstance your own tragedy or your own feelings bleed through, it's just like icing on the cake.</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes.</p><p>GRAMMER: You don't have to insist that a play as big as this one come down to your level, somehow be informed by only your experience, because your experience is not a universal experience. This is a universal experience. It's supernatural. And that's what's great about theater.</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes.</p><p>GRAMMER: Shortly. I did it quickly.</p><p>AMANPOUR: No. I mean you must have seen Frazier.</p><p>DE NIESE: Of course.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And now he's coming back, right?</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes. Well, we may be coming back. We're working on -- we're cutting a new idea that we'll see if it's going to fly.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And fans of Frazier, should they be optimistic?</p><p>GRAMMER: I think they should be optimistic.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Is it more than 50/50?</p><p>GRAMMER: Well, for me, it's more than 50/50. We still have to find somebody who will pay for it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you want the whole same crew to come back?</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes. Except John, of course, he's gone but we have a way of dealing with all that.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And Danielle, you are a Glyndebourne star which is as everybody knows this sort of open-air summertime opera. And I believe you're married to the director and you live out there, right?</p><p>DE NIESE: I do, yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you're coming in here every day to London to do the performance?</p><p>DE NIESE: Yes. I'm doing two projects at the same time. As soon as Man of La Mancha opened, I started performances for Cinderella by Glyndebourne.</p><p>Glyndebourne is a fantastic theater in the countryside so it's a whole experience in addition to just great music. You got the countryside, wonderful food. It's a whole way of experiencing art that's very different and slower in a great way, because it's music and nature, and Cinderella is going to be quite a show.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So I have to let you go because you're going now for your fight rehearsal.</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But I just want to know, before you go, what do you hope to inspire your audience with, with this play? What do you want them to leave the theater with?</p><p>GRAMMER: It's always about love. It's just about love, love fully, love hard. Love the best you can every day.</p><p>DE NIESE: What do I want? I think this is like one of the best musicals to experience because you can see a musical which is just entertaining but this is both entertaining and you come away thinking about yourself and your life and what you want for yourself.</p><p>And I want people to come away going, I want to believe in the world again. I want to believe in humanity. I want to believe that people can try to be the best version of themselves, like these people found in each other.</p><p>I kind of come away hoping that that still -- we still have that capacity as humanity in the midst of all this turmoil.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I always think this way, other people talked about the rape scene for instance. It's still an exception that that's our behavior.</p><p>That's not happening every day. It's happening every day somewhere but it is not the first impulse of most people.</p><p>Most people are good people. Most of the people I meet are good people. Most of the eyeballs I see into have light behind them and that's who we're talking to.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I can't let you go without asking about Sideshow Bob.</p><p>GRAMMER: All right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: He's not a good person.</p><p>GRAMMER: No, pretty irredeemable. However, he is the villain that casts a shadow through the universe.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do people [13:55:00] stop you in the theater? Could they fully see you?</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes, they do.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do they hear your voice?</p><p>GRAMMER: Younger people especially. But I mean that show has been on for so long now but it still tends to skew the younger. And so somebody, oh my god, it's him.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Sideshow Bob, Man of La La Mancha.</p><p>GRAMMER: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Kelsey Grammer, Danielle De Niese, thank you so much for joining me.</p><p>DE NIESE: Thank you.</p><p>GRAMMER: Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And that is it for us for now. Thanks so much for watching and goodbye from London.</p><p>[14:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019082201cbk28</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWB-VB91-JB20-G460-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9108\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 22, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The petition will be sent to millions of supporters on its email and text message lists and through social media, including Facebook, imploring them to sign the letter. The campaign will also release a video this week to be shared across social media to explain the issue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''Real changes to Facebook's policies for their platform and how they enforce them are necessary to protect against a repeat of the role that disinformation played in the 2016 election and that continues to threaten our democracy today,'' said Bill Russo, a spokesman for the Biden campaign.</p><p>  The move puts the Biden camp in the center of a raging debate about the role and responsibility of tech platforms. Civil rights leaders, Democratic lawmakers and many of Facebook's own employees say that big tech companies have a responsibility to prevent false and hateful information from being shared widely.</p><p>  But conservatives, including Mr. Trump, accuse social media companies that have tightened their speech policies, like Twitter and Snap, of political bias. Two weeks ago, after Twitter attached fact-checking notices to two of the president's tweets that made false claims about voter fraud, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that would make it easier for federal regulators to argue that the companies are suppressing free speech.</p><p>  The Biden team's offensive also intensifies pressure on Facebook, which faced a public backlash last week after it did nothing about inflammatory posts by Mr. Trump. Employees resigned, hundreds participated in a virtual walkout, advertisers canceled their accounts, and nonprofits in Washington ceased sponsorships from the company.</p><p>  The criticism poses one of most serious challenges to the leadership of Mr. Zuckerberg since he helped start the company 15 years ago. But faced with opposition in the past, the 36-year-old's instinct has been to dig in his heels. Mr. Zuckerberg feels strongly that his platform should be neutral and believes the debate on speech is about preserving a diversity of ideas, even if those ideas are false or harmful.</p><p>  ''We live in a democracy, where the elected officials decide the rules around campaigns,'' Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said on Thursday. ''Two weeks ago the president of the United States issued an executive order directing federal agencies to prevent social media sites from engaging in activities like fact-checking political statements.</p><p>  ''This week, the Democratic candidate for president started a petition calling on us to do the exact opposite. Just as they have done with broadcast networks -- where the U.S. government prohibits rejecting politicians' campaign ads -- the people's elected representatives should set the rules, and we will follow them. There is an election coming in November and we will protect political speech, even when we strongly disagree with it.''</p><p>  Tim Murtaugh, the director of communications for Mr. Trump's campaign, said, ''The American people can think for themselves. They don't want big tech companies telling them how to think.''</p><p>  Joe Biden has been buoyed in recent weeks by new financial and online support. His campaign has had a surge in fund-raising, and it has collected 1.2 million more email signatures in the past seven days. Numerous political polls have shown him gaining ground on Mr. Trump.</p><p>  Even though he plans to attack Facebook, Mr. Biden is increasingly turning to the site to reach voters with ads. In recent days, he spent $5 million in advertising on Facebook, surging past political ad spending by Mr. Trump, who has dominated Facebook throughout the campaign season.</p><p>  ''Biden is doing the right thing by pushing the platform to be more ethical and by not walking away from it, which is not realistic,'' said Erik Smith, a former Democratic strategist and co-founder of Seven Letter, a crisis communications firm. ''But he's running a race against an opponent who has a 10-mile head start on Facebook.''</p><p>  The open letter being sent on Thursday will say that ''Trump and his allies have used Facebook to spread fear and misleading information about voting, attempting to compromise the means of holding power to account: our voices and our ballot boxes.''</p><p>  It calls on the company to take several steps to limit misinformation and hateful language on the site, including making clear rules ''that prohibit threatening behavior and lies about how to participate in the election.''</p><p>  The video criticizing Facebook will be narrated by Mr. Biden's deputy campaign director, Kate Bedingfield. It will warn that Facebook's inaction toward Mr. Trump threatens the election and puts Americans in harm's way. The goal is to publicly pressure Facebook's leadership to restrict misinformation by politicians and to fact-check political ads ahead of the November election.</p><p>  The tensions between the Biden campaign and Facebook began last October, in the heat of Mr. Trump's impeachment battle. The Trump campaign released ads on Facebook that falsely claimed that Mr. Biden offered to bribe Ukrainian officials to drop an investigation into his son. The claims in the video ads were not substantiated, and television networks, including CNN, declined to run the ads.</p><p>  The campaign complained to Facebook and demanded that the videos, which were viewed and shared millions of times, be removed. But the company said the videos didn't clearly violate its policies against misinformation and that comments by politicians and their campaigns, even if false, were newsworthy and important for public discourse.</p><p>  Mr. Zuckerberg later that month defended that decision in a speech at Georgetown University, arguing that he believed political speech did not need to be fact-checked or moderated by the company because comments by political figures were deeply scrutinized by the public.</p><p>  In January, in an interview with The New York Times's editorial board, Mr. Biden criticized Mr. Zuckerberg personally.</p><p>  ''I've never been a big Zuckerberg fan,'' Mr. Biden said. ''I think he's a real problem.''</p><p>  Mr. Biden also called for the end of the legal shield Mr. Trump targeted recently in his executive order. The vice president said Facebook's inaction demonstrated the need to revoke the law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields them from most liability for the content they host.</p><p>  Behind the scenes, the campaign had continued to negotiate with top Facebook executives and lobbyists, according to letters obtained by The Times. In April, senior campaign officials wrote Brian Rice, the top Democratic lobbyist for Facebook, with proposals to improve fact-checking ahead of the election. The campaign called for Facebook to fact check new political ads two weeks ahead of the Nov. 3 election, and to restrict campaigns and candidates from sharing content already deemed false by third-party fact checkers.</p><p>  On May 26, the campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, wrote a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg to again push for changes to political speech policies and noted that often content by super PACs is checked only days after it has been posted and gone viral, even though it contains misinformation. Mr. Zuckerberg didn't respond, though Facebook did.</p><p>  The campaign decided to take its fight public after Mr. Trump's posts in recent days. He falsely claimed that mail-in ballots would lead to voter fraud. And his warning that ''when the looting starts, the shooting starts,'' startled people on the campaign.</p><p>  ''You seem to carve out an exception for Donald Trump that permits him to abuse your platform because he is the president,'' Ms. Dillon wrote in a separate letter on June 5 to Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global policy and communications. ''But it is surely clear that precisely because Donald Trump is the president, these abuses take on major significance.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief, has said he will take a handsoff approach toward misleading or harmful political posts.

In Walia\u2019s view, it would be a smart business decision to reach new customers and repair Big Tech\u2019s reputation.</p><p>\u201cRarely in my investment career do I see what\u2019s good for society is also good for investment returns,\u201d Walia told me.</p><p>Walia is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">far from the first</url> person to highlight the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">digital divide along race and income lines</url>. But the messenger and his proposed way of tackling the problem are an unusual combination of the cold language of return on investment and outrage about racial inequality.</p><p>Walia\u2019s proposal also points to the reality that to get an essential service to more Americans, we might need a scattershot approach with both more effective government policies and actions by self-interested corporations.</p><p>America\u2019s \u201cdigital divide\u201d is at least two problems. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">In less populated parts of the United States</url>, it doesn\u2019t always make financial sense for internet providers to build service lines to people\u2019s homes.</p><p>And in heavily wired population centers, there are internet deserts where internet access isn\u2019t available or is subpar, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods. If it is offered, not all households can afford internet service or think it\u2019s a priority. There are government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">subsidies</url> to address some of these gaps, but they haven\u2019t always worked.</p><p>Walia\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">research</url> \u2014 based on surveys, existing data, interviews with experts and an analysis of cellphone location information \u2014 reinforced existing data that Black and Latino Americans are far less likely to have internet access and computers at home. Walia also found that Black people are more likely than white Americans to have poor quality internet service.</p><p>He penciled out a five-year plan for big tech companies to collectively spend about $15 billion on three things for millions of Black and Latino households with an annual income below $30,000: providing discounted internet service, supplying basic computers, and providing mentorship and education on technical skills.</p><p>Why would tech companies do this? Self-interest.</p><p>This internet gap is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">an economic liability</url> for these Americans and the country as more jobs have digital components, Walia said. It\u2019s bad for tech companies, too. \u201cThis is about investing in a market that is going to be a large demographic group in a generation,\u201d he said.</p><p>Walia also said that by starting to tackle the digital divide, tech companies build good will among lawmakers and regulators, who are more closely watching how Big Tech uses its power.</p><p>I asked Walia whether there is a risk of tech companies barreling in with magical fixes for a problem they don\u2019t understand. He said that his proposal wouldn\u2019t be a cure all, and that tech companies have the competence and cash to implement comprehensive programs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a meaningful start,\u201d Walia said.</p><p>In defense of pressuring corporations</p><p>A number of readers disagreed with Friday\u2019s newsletter, which examined how best to influence policies at companies like Facebook. Instead of boycotting companies to demand  change, I wrote, what if people demanded that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">elected officials change laws that apply to the company</url></p><p>Some of you emphasized the importance of people pushing for change with our wallets and habits. Others said that  pressuring companies to change their behavior is pragmatic because our elected officials are often less responsive and effective than corporations. (My astute analysis: This is true, and, wow, it bums me out.)</p><p>These reader emails have been lightly edited:</p><p>\u201cCitizens need to be more consciously involved in the society and norms we produce. The most effective way to do that is through our consumption. Relying on the government (which is only an extension of us) to have the answer is avoiding our responsibility and historically ineffective.\u201d \u2014 Mike </p><p>\u201cThe outset of this missive misses the point that boycotting or changing personal habits to reduce their revenue is an accessible, tangible way to influence the companies mentioned. We can vote sporadically but even that won\u2019t necessarily result in the changes desired. It also isn\u2019t either or!\u201d \u2014Conrad </p><p>\u201cThe reason people do not look to the government for changes to Facebook is that our government has been decimated by individuals who use their seat in government for their own profit. America is shocked, disappointed, used and abused by their own government. It\u2019s no place to get action or to resolve problems.\u201d \u2014 Johanna Baynard</p><p>Before we go \u2026</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>United States vs. Google: It\u2019s been coming for a long time.

It has been the subject of hearings, with Polka himself recently testifying; of letters from Congress to the FCC; and of President Donald Trump's promise of connected agriculture for his between-the coasts constituency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ACA this week (March 19-21) is hosting its annual ACA Summit in Washington, D.C., where some 350 small and midsized independent cable providers will gather at the Grand Hyatt Washington to talk shop and take their concerns in person to Capitol Hill and to FCC officials. On their collective mind: retransmission consent, C-band satellite spectrum management and more.</p><p>Polka said the ACA supports bipartisan legislation restoring bright-line net neutrality rules, a big priority, but only if those rules are applied to such edge providers as Netflix and Google as well as ISPs.</p><p>Polka paused in his pre-show adrenaline rush to talk with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">B&amp;C</emphasis> about the key issues motivating his members.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B&amp;C: Your members are in the vanguard of one of the hot issues of the day, rural broadband deployment. What help do you need from the FCC on that front?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew Polka:</emphasis> The first thing I would say is that the FCC has already done the biggest thing for our members, which was to eliminate heavy-handed regulation under Title II, which has encouraged investment in deployment.</p><p>That single act by chairman Ajit Pai and the FCC in December 2017 has done more for our members' ability to deploy broadband and seek and secure investment than anything I could ever ask for, which is why one of the things that we will be talking about with the Hill next Thursday is that the light-touch of regulation on ISPs [under Pai's Restoring Internet Freedom order] has also worked for consumers, who are receiving greater service in smaller, rural, hard-to-reach areas than they have ever received before. So, 'stay that course' would be the first thing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B&amp;C: And about mapping, which is another hot-button issue?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> I do think that better mapping will be helpful in many, many ways. Mapping today is better than when we started this national broadband effort in 2009 because of form 477 [with broadband deployment data], as well as that the challenge process in the Connect America Fund to is more precise about where broadband is. But ultimately, we believe that if broadband is to be included in an infrastructure package, mapping of wired broadband is essential.</p><p>The third thing is regarding funding, whether it is the FCC's Connect America Fund or [USDA's] Rural Utility Service programs, we need to continue the helpful trend of laws and regulations that target funds where broadband isn't, including the most recent definition that funds will be targeted where 90% of an area doesn't get at least 10 Mbps downstream, 1 Mbps upstream service. That is an unserved area that should receive priority-targeted funds.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B&amp;C: Have your members all but abandoned traditional video, and do you see them cutting that cord entirely soon?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> That's a really interesting question and a shifting paradigm right now. I don't see our members themselves simply saying, 'We're not in the video business any longer.' Even companies that have been very forthright about it, like Cable One, which will be Sparklight soon, 'de-emphasize' video but are still more than happy to provide it to consumers who want it. I think it just shows the shift in consumer behavior.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B&amp;C: Is that why Washington should start regulating the edge, since that is where the video will be coming from?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> That's exactly right. We have always feared that simply because of size. We have fought consolidation on the content side for many years and have seen the ills that have happened when content companies come together and get bigger and own the programming or become vertically integrated.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B&amp;C: So, are you in the Sen. Elizabeth Warren 'break up Big Tech' camp?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> It is not necessarily a dodge to say this, but I had [Public Knowledge president] Gene Kimmelman on a podcast recently where he said that breaking up the big companies might be more trouble than it was worth. He cited Ma Bell and an effort that took years to break up, only to eventually result in re-consolidation. So, I am not necessarily convinced a breakup is the best route simply because of the time it would take and the complexity. This is why I think sensible net neutrality/open internet legislation that protects consumers and applies reasonably to ISPs and edge providers is the preferred method. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRCABL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRCABL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN9-6MN1-DY5H-11X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241806</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NewBay Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Broadcasting and Cable</publicationName><volume>Vol. CXLIX</volume><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 18, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

What it also makes clear, though, is how the competition regulatory model failed to respond in the past to the challenge of tech giants. Not so much the Australian regulatory model -- we're trivial players in global markets -- as competition regulation in the US and Europe. The Europeans, at least, have been noticeably more aggressive in regulating the tech giants, but as the ACCC report underscores, it was in the US that the basic failure of regulation occurred.  We can focus on how disruptive and innovative social media and search platforms have been, just as the internet has disrupted so many industrial sectors and will continue to do so. But there's nothing revolutionary about one of the key strategies of Google and Facebook. They have simply bought up competitors and potential rivals to entrench their own position and raise barriers to entry.  \"Google has spent substantial sums acquiring other businesses,\" the ACCC says. \"Some of these acquisitions may have enabled Google to entrench its position in search and search advertising, including through expanding into related markets which may have been a source of possible rivals...\"  Google spent $23 billion buying 145 companies in the decade to 2014. Ditto Facebook, which spent $23 billion over 12 years buying 66 companies, the ACCC says, \"to entrench its market power.\"  The ACCC refers to this as a \"killer acquisition strategy\" in which rivals are acquired and shut down, or integrated into the acquirer's platform. Warren Buffett calls it \"widening the moat\" -- entrenching your power against actual and potential competitors.  Investors love it -- the more a company can \"widen the moat\" and ensure other firms can't compete against it, the readier they'll be to buy into it. Consumers, workers and other businesses, of course, pay the price: the larger and more dominant a company is, the wider its moat, the more that company can gouge consumers and other businesses and force down the wages of its workers without competitive threat.  As the ACCC notes about \"killer acquisitions\", the idea was developed in relation to the pharmaceutical industry, but also applies to tech. In fact, it's a dominant characteristic of neoliberalism, driven by the deregulation of financial markets that liberated large amounts of capital to fund mergers and acquisitions, and a deregulatory ethos in the US in the 1980s that backed the creation of ever-vaster corporations from that M&amp;A activity.  Funny thing is, neoliberalism should look askance at giant corporations, given their tendency to monopoly behaviour and lack of innovation, but neoliberal economists like George Stigler devoted considerable intellectual effort to justifying monopolies as just another demonstration of the efficiency of the market -- and neoliberal \"regulators\" waved through acquisitions that created giant corporations. This, in turn, gave those corporations ever greater power to lobby regulators and game regulatory systems. There's not much that Google and Facebook have been doing that the giants of US capitalism didn't do in the Gilded Age.  While flirting with discussions about \"killer acquisition strategies\", however, the ACCC remains unwilling to accept the logic of what it is describing. The strongest of its recommendations is the expansion of the \"substantial lessening of competition\" test in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Competition and Consumer Act\u00a0</emphasis>to include acquisitions that \"would result in the removal from the market of a potential competitor\".  It also wants large digital platforms to provide advance notice of acquisitions. Thereafter, the recommendations slide into a hazy bureaucratic distance, with more inquiries, codes of conduct and regulatory harmonisations (which traditional media outlets will use to remove regulation and get rid of licence fees).  But as Alan Kohler correctly       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/google-and-facebook-should-be-licensed/news-story/0c3ba99c9b209addea97c9e376db7f32?from=htc_rss\">noted this morning</url>, \"Bolted horse, stable door. The only thing worth doing on the M&amp;A front is the reversal of takeovers.\"  [related-story id=\"674127\"]  The damage being inflicted in the economy and on society by the dominance of Facebook and Google can only be addressed by reversing what created it -- not their innovation or brilliance at monetising our lemming-like consumer behaviour, but their relentless acquisition of potential rivals to widen the moat.  That was the lesson from the Gilded Age, and the trust-busting power that emerged from it for US regulators to use against monopolies and duopolies. It's a lesson more and more politicians on both sides of the aisle in the US are discussing.  The ACCC -- as its role in the electricity debate, where the Coalition wanted the power to break up companies and the ACCC didn't, showed -- is reluctant to go near a break-up power. But it's an issue that's relevant not merely to energy, or big tech, but right across an economy where we're picking up the pieces in the aftermath of neoliberalism.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP3-91M1-JD6R-T4YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"875\"/><timeReceived>10:48:26 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 29, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

However, it was often not in an area broad enough to make a case under anti-competition laws.</p><p>\"What it could well be is something that's evidence of unconscionable conduct or unfair practices, but we don't have an unfair practices law in Australia,\" Mr Sims said. \"I think this is where there could be a bit of law reform coming out of this because ... small businesses fit under consumer law, and when a small business is being treated absolutely dreadfully, our laws aren't adequate to deal with it.</p><p>\"Many people see it as a competition issue, but it doesn't actually substantially lessen competition in the market, it just treats one company very badly.\"</p><p>While Facebook has kept its thoughts on the code of conduct to itself, Google has come out swinging, with local boss Melanie Silva complaining on Friday that it was not a \"forward thinking\" plan.</p><p>Google has increasingly been in the ACCC's crosshairs. The watchdog announced last month it would take Google to court over what it called \"deception by design\" in its user privacy policies.</p><p>Ms Silva said last Friday: \"The government's heavy-handed intervention threatens to impede Australia's digital economy and impacts the services we can deliver to Australians.\"</p><p>Technology industry heavyweights, including Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes, weighed in on Twitter to question the logic of tech platforms being made to pay for distributing others' content.</p><p>Mr Sims, however, said Google's reaction was the same as any incumbent, dominant service provider, drawing a parallel with the actions of the Port of Newcastle hiking prices for access to coal companies.</p><p>\"It is often the response from companies that have got a lot of market power that they don't like any regulation to try and even up that playing field,\" he said.</p><p>\"A couple of years ago [Port of Newcastle] unilaterally pushed up the port access fees by about 50 per cent without consulting any of the coal companies, and when the ACCC suggested regulating them they also insisted it should be left to commercial negotiations.</p><p>\"My reaction is that you can't have commercial negotiations when you've got a one-sided bargaining position.\"</p><p>Mr Sims has made it a mission to insert Australia into the global discussion about the future of big tech. The lengthy digital platform inquiry that led to the code of conduct achieved plenty of international attention.</p><p>He said he had been able to take a prominent stand because the ACCC was a relatively broad regulator in comparison with other regions that keep consumer, antitrust and infrastructure issues separate.</p><p>\"We're probably instituting proceedings or taking some form of enforcement action once a week, and we do that with all types of companies.</p><p>\"Now it happens that these tech issues are a big part of the economy. So I think we're going to keep devoting our time to them as they affect small businesses, consumers and important areas like the future of journalism.\"</p><p>Jason Kint, an influential US-based expert who is the CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade group representing digital publishers, said the ACCC's work on big tech was resonating loudly overseas.</p><p>Having been impressed by the detailed questioning of the tech CEOs in the Congress hearing from some senators last week, Mr Kint said US legislators were clearly paying great attention to the pioneering work being conducted internationally in Britain, the EU and Australia.</p><p>\"Frankly, beyond this analysis being multiparty, it's the global nature which is so exciting and inspiring. In particular, the ACCC's work has absolutely broken into the thinking here, particularly by making it very clear how the two companies maintain their dominance and that their traffic distribution is not a part of their benefits seeing that it's derived from monopoly power,\" he said.</p><p>\"People now laugh and look the other way when Google or Facebook suggest they drive hundreds of millions of dollars in clicks to news publishers per year. Instead they now look at the Nine chairman [Peter Costello's] statement and nod their heads, and say 'Hell yeah, our expensive journalism is collectively worth 10 per cent of Google and Facebook's revenue.\"'</p><p>In May, Nine chairman and former federal treasurer Peter Costello said the mandatory code of conduct on Facebook and Google should force the technology giants to pay about $600 million a year, or 10 per cent of the revenue they earn from Australia, into a fund distributed between local media companies. Nine owns the Financial Review.</p><p>Mr Kint said he believed that in recent years US antitrust regulators had allowed themselves to be cornered into a requirement that consumer price be central to competition analysis. This often meant that if consumers were not seeing increased prices, then all was deemed OK in terms of tech platforms' conduct.</p><p>\"Regulators and law makers are now beginning to understand the necessity of more broadly evaluating the cost of the consumer experience, particularly the customer's data, as major factors in competition analysis,\" he said.</p><p>\"When this data is used by companies' operating platforms in order to self-preference or provide distinct advantages against other companies who must also compete against them on their platforms, the market failure is fairly obvious.\"</p><p>In antitrust matters, the case of former high-flying Australian advertising tech start-up Unlockd, which fell apart after Google suddenly banned its apps from its platforms, has previously been taken up by the regulator.</p><p>Mr Sims said the ACCC was still pursuing Unlockd's case, but it had been slowed down by COVID-19 restrictions.</p><p>Unlockd's founder and former CEO Matt Berriman told the Financial Review he intended to pursue compensation for Unlockd through the courts, but that he suspected changes to the bigger global picture would be shaped by political expediency around elections, rather than competition policy.</p><p>Mr Berriman said regulatory frameworks had failed to keep pace with changes in the tech industry globally, meaning forceful separations of tech giants looked necessary.</p><p>\"Out of respect for [former Unlockd] shareholders, I'll continue to fight on their behalf as long as needed. They deserve the value Google illegally destroyed,\" Mr Berriman said.</p><p>\"Regarding the break-up of companies, I think the genie is out of the bottle in big tech's case, as regulators missed the market shift a long time ago.</p><p>\"It's actually the acquisitions where the step change has driven monopolies. How different does Facebook look without Instagram and WhatsApp? Google without Android, DoubleClick/Admob and YouTube?\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7bq3gfe6wsx1mhh2anol</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HV-5491-F0J6-J3S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1294\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The BCA has more than 100 business members including BHP, Rio Tinto, Coles, Wesfarmers, AGL, Facebook, Google, Uber, Seek, Telstra, Mirvac, Qantas and the major banks.</p><p>The BCA criticised the recommendation as a \"signalling exercise\" that, along with proposed changes to privacy, contracts and trading practices, went \"beyond the core issues in the inquiry and will have significant economy-wide impacts\".</p><p>The submission also argues that companies \"may not have even had a chance to consider and respond to the recommendations and may not even be aware of them\".</p><p>The BCA is concerned that the ACCC recommendation is not limited to the tech titans and would affect all businesses wanting to do a deal. The ACCC has not won a contested merger case in a court or tribunal in 20 years, a situation Mr Sims has previously described as a \"problem\".</p><p>Mr Sims responded to the BCA criticism by denying the merger recommendations were included to solve his court woes. He told the Herald the idea emerged from talks with international competition regulators about Facebook and Google's controversial acquisitions of YouTube, Instagram, Whatsapp and Double Click.</p><p>\"The dominant view by 99 per cent of the population and most business organisations I go to, though not the BCA, is that we don't block enough,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>The ACCC is waiting for an outcome from the Federal Court after Vodafone Hutchison Australia and TPG Telecom fought the competition regulator's decision to oppose their $15 billion merger. The regulator failed to stop rail group Aurizon selling its Queensland rail business to competitor Pacific National in the Federal Court in May. The decision has been appealed.</p><p>\"There's no right answer and it depends on a philosophical position ... I think there's a certain group who would rather no mergers were blocked and there are groups who would prefer more,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>He did not dispute that what was proposed for the big tech firms would apply to other sectors but said the law should be \"general not sector-specific\".</p><p>King &amp; Wood Mallesons head of competition Sharon Henrick said the ACCC already considered future competition when deciding whether to oppose a merger and this would merely formalise the rules. \"I believe the recommendations are part of a bigger agenda where the commission is assessing its track record in contested merger cases and considering whether that law needs to be changed,\" Ms Henrick said.</p><p>Corrs Chambers Westgarth partner Mark McGowan said it was a \"fair\" assessment that the ACCC was pushing a broader agenda of lowering the bar to challenge mergers.</p><p>\"The ACCC has repeatedly failed in challenging mergers before courts and tribunals and they clearly have a view those decision-makers are placing too much emphasis on the self-interested evidence of corporate executives and not enough on market structure,\" Mr McGowan said.</p><p>However, he said digital deals presented unique challenges.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc77itnu0sons1a0k7mjkx</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8F-K6C1-JD34-V1FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Similar thinking was on display at US Congressional hearings last month that further roped in Amazon and Apple.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Australian Consumer and Competition Commission chairman Rod Sims says that correcting the imbalance in negotiating power is the core purpose of the commission's world first mandatory code between the giant global tech platforms and the mostly-local Australian media companies.</p><p>The important policy issue is that the otherwise beneficial reduction in the costs of distributing information has undercut the value and business model of news-gathering professional journalism, polarised the nature of public debate and undermined the foundations of a well-informed and lively democracy.</p><p>Brought to a head by the COVID-19 pandemic, this has driven the Morrison government to impose a mandatory code of conduct on Google and Facebook in their dealings with Australian media companies.</p><p>Even amid record readership gains, the crisis has savaged advertising revenue for traditional media companies, leading to cessation of print publication by major publishers such as News Corp and ACM.</p><p>By not recognising the impact of their market power, the big tech companies now will be required to pay some sort or royalty for the journalism they now profit from and give media companies the right to reasonably generate more advertising revenue from it.</p><p>Room for flexibility</p><p>The ACCC's regulatory response would require the tech platform companies to pay for the journalism they distribute according to three key benchmarks: the value of the journalism to the platforms, the cost of producing the journalism and whether the payment would place an undue burden on Facebook and Google.</p><p>The first of these principles is difficult to determine. The third is unlikely to be a biting constraint given the relative global size of the tech giants and the Australian media market. That leaves Mr Sims suggesting that the second principle - the cost of the journalism - as an easier-to-determine \"anchor\" to the notion of value.</p><p>As the ACCC chair told The Australian Financial Review, the answer is unlikely to be either 1 per cent nor 100 per cent of the cost of journalism. The natural course would gravitate around 10, 20 or 30 per cent, he suggested.</p><p>If Australian media companies spend $1 billion or so a year on journalism, that could translate in payments to media companies of $200 million or so, qualified by the other principles. With $5 billion or so in revenue Facebook and Google reportedly collected from the Australian market in 2019, that might not be an undue burden.</p><p>Even with the appearance of market power, it is no small thing for a regulator to intervene in the relationship between private businesses.</p><p>For such a dynamic sector, such interventions generally should leave flexibility between the parties rather than imposing sweeping and lasting government rules or regulatory apparatus.</p><p>The ACCC code employs a negotiate-arbitrate model, similar to that which helped to finally end Australia's telecommunications monopoly and let telco competitors secure access to Telstra's copper phone network.</p><p>If media companies, negotiating individually or collectively, cannot reach a deal with the digital platforms, the process will automatically move to a binding final offer arbitration stage as used in American baseball to resolve pay fights between owners and players unions.</p><p>Final offer rules are designed to avoid ambit and easily ruled out claims, and force the parties to converge or risk the opposing side's position being accepted by the arbitrator.</p><p>Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon Brookes says that making Google and Facebook pay for news content is \"legalised theft\" or equivalent to making Netflix pay compensation for popcorn no longer consumed at movie theaters.</p><p>But Google and Facebook - which vocally declare not even to be publishers to avoid liability for defamation - are not substitutes for journalism.</p><p>Instead, they harness news content to generate digital advertising revenue in a way that has savaged the business model, revenue base and news gathering ability of traditional news-based media companies.</p><p>The Financial Review and the other former Fairfax mastheads now operating as part of Nine Entertainment have struck their own revenue deal with Google.</p><p>But the industry-wide code will be a test of whether the big tech companies and media content companies can come up with a formula that recognises the respective value of both the generation and the distribution of news and information.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520311867</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K8-WKD1-DY19-C4V9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

In important respects, they have become digital utilities similar to electricity wire or water pipe companies. Similar thinking was on display at US congressional hearings last month that also roped in Amazon and Apple. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims says correcting the imbalance in negotiating power is the core purpose of the ACCC's world-first mandatory code covering the giant global tech platforms and the mostly local media companies. Otherwise beneficial reduction in the costs of distributing information has undercut the value and business model of news-gathering professional journalism, polarised public debate and undermined the foundations of a</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">well-informed and lively democracy. Brought to a head by the pandemic, this has driven the Morrison government to impose a code of conduct on Google and Facebook in their dealings with Australian media companies. Even amid record readership gains, the crisis has savaged advertising revenue for traditional media companies, leading to cessation of print publication by major publishers such as News Corp and ACM. The big tech companies now will be required to pay some sort of royalty for the journalism they profit from.</p><p>The ACCC's regulatory response would require the tech companies to pay for the journalism they distribute according to three key benchmarks: the value of the journalism to the platforms, the cost of producing the journalism, and whether the payment would place an undue burden on Facebook and Google. The first principle is difficult to determine. The third is unlikely to be a biting constraint. That leaves Mr Sims suggesting that the second principle - the cost of the journalism - should serve as an easier-to-determine \"anchor\" to the notion of value. As he told The Australian Financial Review, the answer is unlikely to be either 1 per cent or 100 per cent of the cost, but more like 10, 20 or 30 per cent. If local media companies spend $1 billion or so a year on journalism, that could translate to payments of $200 million or so, qualified by the other principles. With the $5 billion or so in revenue Facebook and Google reportedly collected from the Australian market in 2019, that might not be an undue burden.</p><p>Even with the appearance of market power, it is no small thing for a regulator to intervene in the relationship between private businesses. For such a dynamic sector, such interventions generally should leave flexibility between the parties, rather than imposing sweeping and lasting government rules or a regulatory apparatus. The ACCC code employs a negotiate-arbitrate model, similar to that which helped to finally end Telstra's telecommunications monopoly. If media companies, negotiating individually or collectively, cannot reach a deal with the digital platforms, the process will automatically move to a binding final offer arbitration stage, as used in American baseball to resolve pay fights between owners and players' unions. Final offer rules are designed to avoid ambit and easily ruled out claims, and force the parties to converge or risk the opposing side's position being accepted by the arbitrator.</p><p>Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes says that making Google and Facebook pay for news content is \"legalised theft\" or equivalent to making Netflix pay compensation for popcorn no longer consumed at cinemas. But Google and Facebook - which claim not even to be publishers, to avoid liability for defamation - are not substitutes for journalism. They harness news content to generate digital advertising revenue in a way that has savaged the business model, revenue base and news gathering ability of traditional news-based media companies. The Financial Review, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age have struck their own revenue deal with Google. But the industry-wide code will be a test of whether the big tech companies and media content companies can come up with a formula that recognises the value of both the generation and the distribution of news and information.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7btpepkvfja1g4vymgkq</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K9-YC81-JD34-V4BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"713\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Their targets for action tend to be similar simply because the power of big tech is all pervasive in all countries with the exception of China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ACCC learned the lesson from what happened in Spain in 2014 when the government attempted to force Google to have its Google News service pay for news content. Google responded by shutting it down.</p><p>Sims says that cannot happen in Australia because the \"mandatory code of conduct to address bargaining power imbalances between Australian news media businesses and digital platforms\" covers all their activities.</p><p>If Google wants to avoid the mandatory code it will have to shut down its entire search service and its video streaming business, YouTube. That is not going to happen so it will play ball.</p><p>The tools the ACCC will use to force Google and Facebook to come to the party are tried and tested ones. They were used to put a stop to anti-competitive behaviour by Telstra when it owned the country's entire copper phone network.</p><p>Reform of telecommunications laws forced Telstra to open up its network to competitors. It had to give access to its exchanges to rival companies.</p><p>But being a monopolist it did what it could to protect its turf. When a rival company negotiated access to an exchange to install their equipment Telstra technicians would somehow lose the keys to the exchange.</p><p>This frustrated the process of encouraging competition and allowed Telstra to exploit its monopoly for longer than it should have.</p><p>Its anti-competitive behaviour resulted in the government introducing the \"negotiate/arbitrate\" model which placed strict limits on the time taken to get a deal done.</p><p>The same model will be applied to Google and Facebook as companies such as News Corp and Nine, which owns AFR Weekend, negotiate payment for the use of their content.</p><p>News content is very valuable to Google and Facebook. ACCC research has found about 8 to 14 per cent of Google searches are seeking news content.</p><p>Once a news content-producing company has notified Google or Facebook of a failure to get a deal done through negotiation then the transaction automatically moves to arbitration. \"Arbitration is the only thing that's going to drive a sensible outcome,\" Sims tells Chanticleer.</p><p>\"What happens under the arbitration is Nine puts in its bid. Each side can can see the other side's bid. That might force them back to the bargaining table.</p><p>\"But keep in mind, they can't make ambit claims. If you put in an ambit claim you are going to fail under this form of arbitration.</p><p>\"The fact that it's there could force a bargain. But at the end of the day, if the arbitrators got to choose between two bids, my view is those bids will be in a similar ballpark because you'd be mad not to.</p><p>\"Otherwise, you'll lose out. I think the arbitrator will come up with a good outcome. And by the way, the ACCC is also an adviser to the arbitrator. The arbitrator can tell us to go jump, but we're there to help as well.\"</p><p>New spin on Afterpay's success</p><p>It was only when a report on global payments company PayPal hit Chanticleer's inbox that it became clear the local market might well have overhyped the achievements of buy now, pay later darling Afterpay</p><p>The report, by Morgan Stanley analyst James E. Faucette, included a table showing 40 different payment companies operating in the United States and their percentage share of the top 477 merchants in the US, with total sales of $US454 billion ($626 billion).</p><p>Afterpay came in at No. 23, with a 5 per cent share of merchants. This can be read two ways. Those bullish on Afterpay will say this shows the enormous opportunity for growth in the US. The bears will say Afterpay's US success should not be seen in isolation from the performance of Affirm, a buy now, pay later company established in 2012 that also appears in the Morgan Stanley table. After eight years of plugging away in the US, Affirm sits at No. 12 on the table with an 11 per cent share of the top merchants.</p><p>Your rooster has plenty of admiration for the entrepreneurs building global payment businesses such as Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen at Afterpay. But that should not stand in the way of putting Afterpay's numbers in the context of the big global picture.</p><p>Grant Halverson, a payments consultant who mainly works for clients offshore, says it is not well known in Australia that the entire buy now, pay later sector in the US accounts for less than 1 basis point of total money processed through payment companies there.</p><p>He says the amount purchased on credit cards in the US in 2018 was $US3.98 trillion, and the amount purchased on debit cards was $US2.75 trillion. Compare that to Afterpay's US sales of $US2.7 billion.</p><p>Halverson says the competitive dynamic in the US is very different to Australia where people are shedding credit cards rapidly. A total of 5 million credit card accounts were closed between 2016 and 2020. In the US, 45 million new cards were issued over the past year.</p><p>Halverson says the latest figures published by Afterpay showing strong growth in new customers should be seen in the context of what has happened to other payment companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"I think the recent Afterpay results are very disappointing when you consider the massive once-in-a-lifetime free kick ecommerce has been given due to lock-downs in every market they operate in,\" Halverson says. \"Afterpay has not kept pace with the massive online explosion, and its Australian and New Zealand business is still 60 per cent of all revenue.\"</p><p>Halverson says in the six months to June, Afterpay lifted its customer base by 200,000. PayPal added 1.3 million new customers in the first three months of the year, taking its total customer base in Australia to 8.4 million.</p><p>PayPal came out of the Morgan Stanley table as a star. It is accepted by 79 per cent of the top merchants in the US and has one of the lowest churn rates of any payment option. It added 20 million new users in the three months to the end of March.</p><p>Afterpay has 3.3 million \"active\" consumers in Australia and New Zealand. Halverson says Afterpay added only 7300 merchants in the first half - its slowest growth rate ever.</p><p>He wonders if buy now, pay later has peaked in this part of the world given the combined Australian and New Zealand population is 30 million with about 12.3 million classed as Millennials and Gen Z.</p><p>\"So 3.3 million is 27 per cent of the total, which is hardly great after six years,\" he says. \"Even worse, $6.6 billion sales in Australia and New Zealand is only 38 basis points of ANZ electronic transactions.\"</p><p>Halverson says Afterpay's recent UK numbers are simply awful.</p><p>\"They launched in the UK before the USA and they have sales of $600 million from 1 million consumers with a very low $330 annual spend in a boom market,\" he says. \"Sure, they added 700,000 merchants - but the UK economy is in a very, very deep hole running at 75 per cent of pre-COVID levels.\"</p><p>Halverson says Afterpay's US sales of $US2.7 billion is 3 basis points of the old online figure as at March 30 - but 1.6 basis points of the expected new COVID-19 online market, which is running at more than $US125 billion per month.</p><p>He says Afterpay is not keeping pace with Klarna, which added 14 million customers in the first half of this year and now has 98 million global consumers.</p><p>Klarna launched in the US at a similar time to Afterpay but its consumer base is now about 50 per cent higher than Afterpay's.</p><p>Halverson says the biggest concern he has about buy now, pay later is the likely spike in bad debts because of the pandemic-induced recession. These will probably come through early next year.</p><p>TONY BOYD</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.boyd@afr.com\">tony.boyd@afr.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7bojh2paompfrofk1s8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H6-7KP1-F0J6-J2J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1341\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Their targets for action tend to be similar simply because the power of big tech is all pervasive in all countries with the exception of China.</p><p>The ACCC learnt the lesson from what happened in Spain in 2014 when the government attempted to force Google to have its Google News service pay for news content. Google responded by shutting it down.</p><p>Sims says that cannot happen in Australia because the \"mandatory code of conduct to address bargaining power imbalances between Australian news media businesses and digital platforms\" covers all their activities.</p><p>If Google wants to avoid the mandatory code, it will have to shut down its entire search service and its video streaming business, YouTube. That is not going to happen so it will play ball.</p><p>The tools the ACCC will use to force Google and Facebook to come to the party are tried and tested ones. They were used to put a stop to anti-competitive behaviour by Telstra when it owned the country's entire copper phone network.</p><p>Reform of telecommunications laws forced Telstra to open up its network to competitors. It had to give access to its exchanges to rival companies.</p><p>But being a monopolist it did what it could to protect its turf. When a rival company negotiated access to an exchange to install their equipment, Telstra technicians would somehow lose the keys to the exchange.</p><p>This frustrated the process of encouraging competition and allowed Telstra to exploit its monopoly for longer than it should have.</p><p>Its anti-competitive behaviour resulted in the government introducing the \"negotiate/arbitrate\" model which placed strict limits on the time taken to get a deal done.</p><p>The same model will be applied to Google and Facebook as companies such as News Corp and Nine, which owns AFR Weekend, negotiate payment for the use of their content.</p><p>News content is very valuable to Google and Facebook. ACCC research has found about 8 per cent to 14 per cent of Google searches are seeking news content.</p><p>Once a news content-producing company has notified Google or Facebook of a failure to get a deal done through negotiation, the transaction automatically moves to arbitration.</p><p>\"Arbitration is the only thing that's going to drive a sensible outcome,\" Sims tells Chanticleer.</p><p>\"What happens under the arbitration is Nine puts in its bid. Each side can can see the other side's bid. That might force them back to the bargaining table.</p><p>\"But keep in mind, they can't make ambit claims. If you put in an ambit claim you are going to fail under this form of arbitration.</p><p>\"The fact that it's there could force a bargain. But at the end of the day, if the arbitrator's got to choose between two bids, my view is those bids will be in a similar ballpark because you'd be mad not to.</p><p>\"Otherwise, you'll lose out. I think the arbitrator will come up with a good outcome. And by the way, the ACCC is also an adviser to the arbitrator. The arbitrator can tell us to go jump, but we're there to help as well.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520308185</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H5-5NP1-JBJ7-N011-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"560\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The OECD will continue negotiating, despite the threats.</p><p>But if Sims comes up with a code - and a payment for media content - that Google and Facebook accept, it could provide a template for the rest of the world, avoiding an internet tax and potential trade wars.</p><p>A global precedent</p><p>In simple terms, the tech giants will need to weigh up whether they deal with Australia and accept a certain annual fee, which will set a global precedent, or take the risk of an internet tax imposed on them by a group of 136 countries, or have countries go it alone and levy huge charges on them.</p><p>Frydenberg has set an end of July deadline for Sims to deliver a draft report, followed by a final report and legislation shortly after.</p><p>Frydenberg told The Australian Financial Review the introduction of a mandatory code would support a sustainable media landscape by codifying the commercial relationship between digital platforms and news media businesses.</p><p>The code would respond to key issues identified by the ACCC in its Digital Platforms Inquiry, namely market dominance of Google and Facebook in their respective advertising markets, and an increasing risk of the diminution of certain types of journalism, as the traditional news business model continues to be eroded by more media being consumed online.</p><p>\"We are determined to implement a mandatory code that better protects and informs Australian consumers and addresses bargaining power imbalances between digital platforms and media companies,\" Frydenberg said.</p><p>A key challenge is to work out how much Google and Facebook should pay for the use of media content. The next challenge is how to distribute it to the various media players.</p><p>Australian media companies are split on the amount the tech giants should pay and how to deal with them.</p><p>News Corp wants to deal directly, while Nine (the owner of the Financial Review) favours a group approach.</p><p>Threat of a shut-out</p><p>Sims is likely to accommodate both options; allow media companies to deal directly with the tech giants or bargain collectively.</p><p>But he needs to reduce the risk of the code being gamed by ensuring it captures all media companies in the event that Google is tempted to pick off one media company from the rest and do a deal. It would leave the others out in the cold, financially and not listed in its Google news search. To allow that to happen would be catastrophic for an already weakened Australian media.</p><p>Sims also needs to find a way to incorporate far stronger penalties into the code than the typical maximum penalty of $60,000 for code breaches given the size of Google and Facebook.</p><p>Relying on competition law as a fallback for breaches won't work as it takes too long. Big tech needs to face fines of up to $10 million for each breach of the code, as other companies already face under consumer and competition law.</p><p>The code must work quickly and effectively because the media industry is running out of time.</p><p>To put it into perspective, the Public Interest Journalism Initiative is tracking changes to news production and availability through its Australian Newsroom Mapping Project.</p><p>According to the map data in the past couple of months, more than 21 titles have permanently closed. Dozens of rural and regional titles are temporarily suspended due to COVID-19 or the bushfires, with a fear that some will never reopen.</p><p>Local reporting wasteland</p><p>According to PIJI chairman Professor Allan Fels, a former chairman of the ACCC, the impact of media closures and cutbacks on local communities has been profound.</p><p>\"A survey we conducted showed that one-third of local councils no longer has local media reporting on them,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's a news desert out there and it means that council corruption, unjustified spending and local information such as sports news, isn't getting reported.\"</p><p>The big media companies - Nine and News Corp - believe Google and Facebook should pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year for news content.</p><p>Nine believes it should be at least $600 million, which represents about 10 per cent of advertising revenue, while News Corp believes the figure should be closer to $1 billion.</p><p>PIJI commissioned Essential Media to conduct a survey of more than 1000 respondents in April to gauge how much the public was prepared to pay for news, including public interest journalism.</p><p>The survey found that Australians were prepared to pay an aggregate of between $380 million and $740 million a year, with a mid-point of $560 million.</p><p>Polarised viewpoints</p><p>Not surprisingly, Google sees it differently. It doesn't think the news content is worth anything and makes a paltry $10 million a year in advertising revenue from news in Australia.</p><p>It argues that its search engine drives traffic to media company websites. Facebook has a similar view.</p><p>What Google and Facebook think is irrelevant. They both have huge monopoly power to set the price terms they pay for news content, if there isn't regulation. For the big tech companies it is rough justice.</p><p>The ACCC will be looking for a figure in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>Frydenberg wrote an opinion piece in April that for every $100 spent by advertisers in Australia on online advertising, excluding classifieds, $47 goes to Google, $24 to Facebook and $29 to other participants. In Australia, this market is worth almost $9 billion a year and has grown more than eight-fold since 2005.</p><p>\"It is only fair that the search engines and social media giants pay for the original news content that they use to drive traffic to their sites,\" he said.</p><p>\"By way of example, the ACCC found that between 8 per cent and 14 per cent of Google search results included reports from news websites.\"</p><p>Frydenberg used fighting words. \"There is too is much at stake - nothing less than the future of our media landscape.\"</p><p>Given the poor track record of other countries to get the big tech companies to pay for content, Sims has his work cut out for him.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520291846</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6060-DY11-DY19-C0VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1191\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It was the day the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission released its report into digital platforms and their effect on traditional media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the ACCC was widely praised for taking a \"tough position\", the report is largely good news for Google and Facebook, because it fundamentally reaffirms and cements their existing business models.</p><p>No doubt, the ACCC needs to be commended for its diligent and comprehensive analysis of Google's and Facebook's dominance of the online advertising market and their influence on the media industry. Its 613-page report is certainly worth reading.</p><p>Along with analysis, it provides important recommendations to promote competition, support the news media impacted by digital platforms, deal with the spread of fake news, and strengthen privacy protections.</p><p>But the real concern here is not just with the need to curb the impact of these giants on the media and in the marketplace but rather with the very business models that have led to their enormous success. That is, the ways in which the digital platforms organise their income generation, through targeted advertising made possible by the sale of their users' privacy. Unfortunately, the recommendations amount to treating the symptoms by accepting the existence of the underlying condition.</p><p>In the public eye, Facebook is a social network; Google a search company. They are not advertising businesses; this is also how the companies like to portray themselves. And it is worth remembering this is how both started out, by addressing important internet challenges for their users.</p><p>But in a quest to make money, both companies increasingly came to monetise data on their users' preferences, collected initially as a by-product of their services, to offer targeted advertising at a level of detail unheard of in traditional media.</p><p>Over time this data collection came to dominate platform design, enticing users to spend more time and give up more data. As a result, the distribution of user content, and increasingly journalistic content, became a means of fuelling data collection, optimising advertising income. What drives the design of the services, and what is a by-product, reversed.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ACCC's recommendations accept those business models, rather than challenging them. They accept both tech giants are advertising businesses, both appropriate journalistic content for their own gain, they trade in user privacy, and their algorithms tend to spread misinformation. By proposing measures to monitor and curb each one of those, the ACCC tacitly accepts the existence of each, lending legitimacy to the business models that bring about those issues.</p><p>This is good news for the platforms, because they can now deal with regulation on their own terms. Indeed, it is the very reason Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly asked for Facebook to be regulated, to avoid more fundamental interference with its business model.</p><p>And yet, there are more far-reaching proposals under serious consideration overseas, such as calls by US presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren and others to break up big tech companies (which might be neither practical nor likely). There have also been demands for the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which absolves a digital platform of responsibility for content posted by its users. Such a move would fundamentally challenge the algorithmic nature of content distribution on these platforms. Importantly, such proposals ask serious questions about the business models themselves.</p><p>Despite the valuable analysis by the ACCC, there is still not much public awareness about how digital platforms operate. This is a significant problem. Because it is this very nature of their operations that brings about the problems we are trying to solve.</p><p>Without foregrounding these fundamental issues, nothing will change. The public will be appeased by what is proposed; the platforms can point to the regulator when something goes wrong and argue they are being watched. Yet their advertising dominance will keep growing, and with it the adverse effects on information sharing and privacy invasion despite better, taxpayer-funded (and likely increasingly expensive) processes for monitoring them.</p><p>Users will not abandon the platforms. Raising awareness about the symptoms, such as privacy breaches, did not make much difference in the past. Very few users change privacy settings, and only a tiny minority quit Facebook in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Two things need to happen. First, public discourse must take account of the true nature of digital platforms. More awareness will provide lawmakers with a mandate to make fundamental changes. To be fair, such changes are beyond any Australian regulator.</p><p>Second, meaningful changes need to focus on the inner workings of these platforms. Once governments realise that various digital platforms are now akin to other infrastructures essential for our society, doors might open to allow more fundamental changes.</p><p>We need to rebalance the value that derives from these platforms for all stakeholders - users, advertisers, media companies and the wider society for which these platforms provide a vital infrastructure.Dr Sandra Peter is the director of Sydney Business Insights at the University of Sydney Business School;

Current rules are less onerous as they require courts and regulators to consider only existing competitors.</p><p>The Business Council of Australia has argued in a submission to Treasury that there \"does not appear to be a strong case\" for changes to the current merger rules. The council has more than 100 business members including BHP, Rio Tinto, Coles, Wesfarmers, AGL, Facebook, Google, Uber, Seek, Telstra, Mirvac, Qantas and the major banks.</p><p>It criticised the recommendation as a \"signalling exercise\" that, along with proposed changes to privacy, contracts and trading practices, goes \"beyond the core issues in the inquiry and will have significant economy-wide impacts\". The submission also argues that companies \"may not have even had a chance to consider and respond to the recommendations and may not even be aware of them\".</p><p>The council is concerned the ACCC recommendation is not limited to the tech titans and would affect all firms wanting to do a deal. The ACCC has not won a contested merger case in a court or tribunal in 20 years, a situation Mr Sims has previously described as a problem.</p><p>Mr Sims responded to the Business Council of Australia's criticism by denying the merger recommendations were included to solve his court woes. He said the idea came out of discussions with international competition regulators about Facebook and Google's controversial acquisitions of YouTube, Instagram, Whatsapp and Double Click.</p><p>\"The dominant view by 99 per cent of the population and most business organisations I go to, though not the BCA, is that we don't block enough,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>The change would also formalise a closer analysis of the type of assets a company has, such as data, intellectual property and technology.</p><p>The ACCC is waiting for an outcome from the Federal Court after Vodafone Hutchison Australia and TPG Telecom fought the competition regulator's decision to oppose their $15 billion merger. The regulator failed to stop rail group Aurizon selling its Queensland rail business to competitor Pacific National in the Federal Court in May. The decision has since been appealed.</p><p>\"There's no right answer and it depends on a philosophical position ... I think there's a certain group who would rather no mergers were blocked and there are groups who would prefer more,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>He did not dispute that what was proposed for the big tech firms would apply to other sectors but said the law should be \"general, not sector-specific\".</p><p>King &amp; Wood Mallesons head of competition Sharon Henrick said the ACCC already considered future competition when deciding whether to oppose a merger and this would merely formalise the rules.</p><p>\"I believe the recommendations are part of a bigger agenda where the commission is assessing its track record in contested merger cases and considering whether that law needs to be changed,\" she said.</p><p>Corrs Chambers Westgarth partner Mark McGowan said it was a \"fair\" assessment that the ACCC was pushing a broader agenda of lowering the bar to challenge mergers.</p><p>\"The ACCC has repeatedly failed in challenging mergers before courts and tribunals and they clearly have a view those decision-makers are placing too much emphasis on the self-interested evidence of corporate executives and not enough on market structure,\" Mr McGowan said.</p><p>A prominent banker who declined to be named said the change was unnecessary and could create uncertainty for businesses.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc77isnbugmd516nsh2je6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8F-K6C1-JD34-V154-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

But it took a leaf out of the inquiry handbook in recommending new or strengthened \"codes\", sidestepping decisive recommendations that would have altered the legal and economic landscape.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A smidgen over 1000 pages (including a preliminary report), the final analysis left journalists struggling on Friday to write paragraphs that didn't include \"overhaul\", \"shake-up\" or \"ongoing monitoring\" - clues that not much was really happening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are no fewer than four new codes in the pipeline: a privacy code (recommendation 18), a code to \"counter disinformation\" (15), a \"take-down code\" (8), and a code of conduct to govern relationships with media companies (5) - let's call this one a \"treaty\".</p><p>Then there are a couple of codes with different names: a new \"minimum internal dispute resolution standard\" (22), a \"harmonised media regulatory frame-work\" (6), alongside a new ombudsman (23), and a recom-mendation for another inquiry (into \"adtech\") (5).</p><p>The code-writing teams at the big consulting firms will be licking their lips, but there's not much that screams tectonic shift in the media or advertising landscape.</p><p>As for raising the regulatory bar for mergers (1), and requiring the tech giants to tell the ACCC if they plan on buying anything (2), that horse is in the next paddock already. No wonder, then, that the share prices of News Corp, Seven and Nine dipped on Friday.</p><p>The government has given itself give five months to even respond to the recommendations, let alone for the code drafters to get started, by which time more journalists might have been laid off, adding to the one-fifth who've lost their jobs in just four years to 2018.</p><p>Meanwhile in New York, Facebook's and Google's share prices flat-lined and surged, respectively, on the back of a $US9.9 billion ($14.3bn) global profit in the second quarter.</p><p>A handful of the 23 recommendations do, however, have the potential to improve an economic reality that has savaged traditional media. \"Where the digital platform obtains value from content produced by news media, the digital platform will fairly negotiate with the news media businesses as to how that revenue should be shared,\" the ACCC said.</p><p>How much is shared is going to be the sticking point. \"Between 8 and 14 per cent of Google search results trigger a 'top stories' result, which typically includes reports from news media websites,\" the report found.</p><p>Ten per cent of Google's $3bn of Australia-based revenue would be nice (enough to produce both the Financial Review and The Australian at least three times over), but don't expect the tech giant to co-operate. It's more difficult to know how much benefit Facebook, the smaller of the two, which generated about $1.3bn in advertising revenue locally last year, obtains from news articles.</p><p>Facebook and Google benefit from having quality news articles on their searches and news feeds, yet the producers of such news obtain little in return.</p><p>The platforms will argue that they obtain no or negligible benefit from including news stories on their platforms.</p><p>News media can only hope they have a tough time convincing the Australian News and Communication Authority, which will have the power to impose minimum treaty terms.</p><p>The ACCC has given Google six months to give new mobile phone and computer buyers a choice of internet browser and search engine, piggy-backing on substantive recommendations made in Europe recently.</p><p>That Google pays Apple $US12bn a year to ensure it remains the default search engine for Apple's Safari browser underscores how much defaults matter.</p><p>\"Google's search engine is effectively the default search engine on over 95 per cent of Australian mobile devices,\" the report revealed.</p><p>Also, a revamped Privacy Act (16) and a new tort for serious breaches of privacy (19) could pave the way for costly class actions against the tech giants, especially Facebook, which has been able to publish material without incurring the sort of risk-return trade-off traditional media firms face every day.</p><p>The ACCC was wise to step back from recommending another regulator, which would have been ripe for capture. As they have in finance, designated regulators tend to entrench the biggest players, even coming to act in their interests. Among the nation's regulators, the ACCC has the best record of acting in the public interest.</p><p>Whatever the recommendations, the ACCC has provided the intellectual ammunition for sweeping changes in regulation of tech giants.</p><p>They clearly have immense market power in search, social media and over advertising. If there was ever a case for anti-trust action, this must be it.</p><p>Consider their ability to amass vast revenues without sharing any of it with consumers.</p><p>Is it not easy to imagine a world where Google or Facebook pay us, the users, a few dollars a month to use their platforms and provide our very valuable data?</p><p>Modern payments systems would make that easy, yet it doesn't occur. Powerful network effects - the increasing value of platforms as more use them, and zero marginal cost of production - make it all but impossible for competitors to dislodge Facebook and Google.</p><p>And if any showed signs of doing so they would be bought out. Where advertising used to sustain investigations, specialist journalism and reporting that benefited society, now it enriches US shareholders and underpins addictive social media consumption, much of which has little public benefit.</p><p>Resuscitating this virtuous circle is a public policy imperative. \u00e2\u20ac\u0192Trying to tame Google and Facebook from Australia, though, is akin to an ant biting an elephant's toe. The two firms' combined stockmarket value exceeds the entire Australian stockmarket.</p><p>In 2017, Google earned $US110bn, Facebook another $41bn. And beyond those vast cash flows and unprecedented reservoirs of information on us, they are popular with voters - a source of goodwill neither firm hasn't yet actively begun to tap.</p><p>Enforcing the new codes and frameworks will be difficult. And there's little chance the tech giants will make an oath to consider the public good.</p><p>Indeed they have every incentive to drag the chain, or even ignore regulators. The solution will need to be global, and US-led. Thankfully US President Donald Trump is far less well disposed to them (except for Twitter) than his predecessor.Chris Mitchell is on leave..</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-dffa5690b0fc11e9b2c2609644d5a3a1149b9be84f4662ba25649d67992e036a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNW-9S31-F0JP-W3JB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 29, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The hearing was looking at the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and California's Consumer Privacy Act with a view to strengthening US laws amid growing concern about privacy scandals and data breaches.</p><p>Google was also flayed for creating a privacy policy that the average person would never read.</p><p>\"You can hide a dead body in there and nobody would ever find it,\" Republican senator John Kennedy said at the hearing.</p><p>It took place after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had released new submissions to its digital platforms inquiry including one from US company Oracle, which claimed Google was creating \"shadow profiles\" on millions of Australians, potentially in breach of the law.</p><p>The groundbreaking ACCC inquiry is attracting global attention. Oracle told the ACCC that Google knew where phone users lived and worked, even if they didn't have a Google account, and that it knew where they were at any given time, even if they did have a Google account and weren't signed in.</p><p>It was able to determine locations by secretly capturing how close an Android phone was to Wi-Fi base stations and at what time.</p><p>The commission also released a submission from News Corp Australia - publisher of The Courier-Mail - which called for Google to be broken up to foster competition.

What we're interested in is what actually goes into the code,\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said.</p><p>\"We're seeking that both in writing from stakeholders, but also we will do some pretty intensive bilateral discussions where someone puts forward an idea, we test it, probe it, and see what holds up.\"</p><p>In the ACCC's digital platforms inquiry, the regulator found Facebook and Google were benefiting most from a significant imbalance in bargaining power in their commercial negotiations with news media businesses.</p><p>\"Obviously when the platforms are dealing with each individual player, they have tremendous market power, and power of the content players is much more diverse, so the platforms don't need any individual media company, which is why they have no power,\" Mr Sims said. \"But collectively, I think it is a fair argument to say that they do need media both to provide a full service and to make sure they provide quality to their users in ways that contribute to society.\"</p><p>Google and Facebook have acknowledged they benefit from having news media on their platforms, but the ACCC says their market dominance makes them \"unavoidable business partners\" for news media organisations.</p><p>This creates substantial scope for Google and Facebook to set the terms of engagement.</p><p>Hence the ACCC's mandatory bargaining code aims to ameliorate some of the issues stemming from a lack of competition and to ensure the viability of journalism in a digital world given its perceived broader societal benefits, such as holding power to account and the preservation of democracy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7an1qia493916kal95wz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YYM-C5H1-JD34-V2B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

What we're interested in is what actually goes into the code,\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said.</p><p>\"We're seeking that both in writing from stakeholders, but also we will do some pretty intensive bilateral discussions where someone puts forward an idea, we test it, probe it, and see what holds up.\"</p><p>In the ACCC's Digital Platforms Inquiry, the regulator found Facebook and Google were the digital platforms currently benefiting most from a significant imbalance in bargaining power in their commercial negotiations with Australian news media businesses.</p><p>\"Obviously when the platforms are dealing with each individual player, they have tremendous market power, and power of the content players is much diverse, so the platforms don't need any individual media company, which is why they have no power,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"But collectively, I think it is a fair argument to say that they do need media both to provide a full service and to make sure they provide quality to their users in ways that contribute to society.\"</p><p>Google and Facebook have said that they benefit from having news media across their platforms, but the ACCC has said that their market dominance online makes them \"unavoidable business partners\" for news media organisations.</p><p>The consequence of this is that it creates substantial scope for Google and Facebook to set the terms of engagement, contrary to the presumed equality of bargaining power underpinning the rationale of contract law and the spirit of market-based competition.</p><p>As such, the mandatory bargaining code, due to be finalised shortly after July, aims to ameliorate some of the issues stemming from a lack of competition and to ensure the viability of journalism in a digital world given its perceived broader societal benefits, like holding power to account and the preservation of democracy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520278313</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXX-3451-JBJ7-N0C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"483\"/><timeReceived>04:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Current rules are less onerous as they require courts and regulators to only consider existing competitors.</p><p>The Business Council of Australia (BCA) has argued in a submission to Treasury that there \"does not appear to be a strong case\" for changes to the current merger rules. The BCA has more than 100 business members including BHP, Rio Tinto, Coles, Wesfarmers, AGL, Facebook, Google, Uber, Seek, Telstra, Mirvac, Qantas and the major banks.</p><p>The BCA criticised the recommendation as a \"signalling exercise\" that, along with proposed changes to privacy, contracts and trading practices, goes \"beyond the core issues in the inquiry and will have significant economy-wide impacts\". The submission also argues that companies \"may not have even had a chance to consider and respond to the recommendations and may not even be aware of them\".</p><p>The BCA is concerned the ACCC recommendation is not limited to the tech titans and would affect all businesses wanting to do a deal. The ACCC has not won a contested merger case in a court or tribunal in 20 years, a situation Mr Sims has previously described as a \"problem\".</p><p>Mr Sims responded to the BCA criticism by denying the merger recommendations were included to solve his court woes. He told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age the idea emerged from discussions with international competition regulators about Facebook and Google's controversial acquisitions of YouTube, Instagram, Whatsapp and Double Click.</p><p>\"The dominant view by 99 per cent of the population and most business organisations I go to, though not the BCA, is that we don't block enough,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>The change would also formalise a closer analysis of the type of assets a company has, such as data, intellectual property and technology.</p><p>The ACCC is waiting for an outcome from the Federal Court after Vodafone Hutchison Australia and TPG Telecom fought the competition regulator's decision to oppose their $15 billion merger. The regulator failed to stop rail group Aurizon selling its Queensland rail business to competitor Pacific National in the Federal Court in May. The decision has since been appealed.</p><p>\"There's no right answer and it depends on a philosophical position ... I think there's a certain group who would rather no mergers were blocked and there are groups who would prefer more,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>He did not dispute that what was proposed for the big tech firms would apply to other sectors but said the law should be \"general not sector-specific\".</p><p>King &amp; Wood Mallesons head of competition Sharon Henrick said the ACCC already considered future competition when deciding whether or not to oppose a merger and this would merely formalise the rules.</p><p>\"I believe the recommendations are part of a bigger agenda where the Commission is assessing its track record in contested merger cases and considering whether that law needs to be changed,\" Ms Henrick said.</p><p>Corrs Chambers Westgarth partner Mark McGowan said it was a \"fair\" assessment that the ACCC was pushing a broader agenda of lowering the bar to challenge mergers.</p><p>\"The ACCC has repeatedly failed in challenging mergers before courts and tribunals and they clearly have a view those decision-makers are placing too much emphasis on the self-interested evidence of corporate executives and not enough on market structure,\" Mr McGowan said.</p><p>\"This issue is broader than the [digital platform inquiry] - the ACCC has never attempted to block an acquisition by Google or Facebook,\" he said.</p><p>However, he said digital deals present unique challenges and gave the regulator a \"useful opportunity to push for reform in this area\" so he did not consider it to be overstepping.</p><p>A prominent banker who declined to be named said the change was unnecessary and could create uncertainty for businesses.</p><p>\"It is muddying the waters at a time when the velocity of change, the pace of technology, is so rapid that there's little chance on an evidentiary basis that anyone can reliably predict the markets in five years time,\" the source said.</p><p>Frontier Economics Australia and Asia economist Warwick Davis said the recommendation was \"unnecessary\" as the current list of merger factors that needed to be considered was substantial.</p><p>\"It's hard to see how adding to that list will improve clarity,\" he said. Frontier Economics has been an adviser to TPG and Vodafone during their merger case.</p><p>\"I don't think that losing cases means the law is wrong,\" he said.</p><p>Despite this, he agreed Google and Facebook's actions to acquire early-stage businesses was a legitimate concern and that any changes should be applied across all industries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520191653</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X88-KKN1-DY19-C46B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><timeReceived>00:59 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Current rules are less onerous as they require courts and regulators to only consider existing competitors.</p><p>The Business Council of Australia (BCA) has argued in a submission to Treasury that there \"does not appear to be a strong case\" for changes to the current merger rules. The BCA has more than 100 business members including BHP, Rio Tinto, Coles, Wesfarmers, AGL, Facebook, Google, Uber, Seek, Telstra, Mirvac, Qantas and the major banks.</p><p>The BCA criticised the recommendation as a \"signalling exercise\" that, along with proposed changes to privacy, contracts and trading practices, goes \"beyond the core issues in the inquiry and will have significant economy-wide impacts\". The submission also argues that companies \"may not have even had a chance to consider and respond to the recommendations and may not even be aware of them\".</p><p>The BCA is concerned the ACCC recommendation is not limited to the tech titans and would affect all businesses wanting to do a deal. The ACCC has not won a contested merger case in a court or tribunal in 20 years, a situation Mr Sims has previously described as a \"problem\".</p><p>Mr Sims responded to the BCA criticism by denying the merger recommendations were included to solve his court woes. He told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age the idea emerged from discussions with international competition regulators about Facebook and Google's controversial acquisitions of YouTube, Instagram, Whatsapp and Double Click.</p><p>\"The dominant view by 99 per cent of the population and most business organisations I go to, though not the BCA, is that we don't block enough,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>The change would also formalise a closer analysis of the type of assets a company has, such as data, intellectual property and technology.</p><p>The ACCC is waiting for an outcome from the Federal Court after Vodafone Hutchison Australia and TPG Telecom fought the competition regulator's decision to oppose their $15 billion merger. The regulator failed to stop rail group Aurizon selling its Queensland rail business to competitor Pacific National in the Federal Court in May. The decision has since been appealed.</p><p>\"There's no right answer and it depends on a philosophical position ... I think there's a certain group who would rather no mergers were blocked and there are groups who would prefer more,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>He did not dispute that what was proposed for the big tech firms would apply to other sectors but said the law should be \"general not sector-specific\".</p><p>King &amp; Wood Mallesons head of competition Sharon Henrick said the ACCC already considered future competition when deciding whether or not to oppose a merger and this would merely formalise the rules.</p><p>\"I believe the recommendations are part of a bigger agenda where the Commission is assessing its track record in contested merger cases and considering whether that law needs to be changed,\" Ms Henrick said.</p><p>Corrs Chambers Westgarth partner Mark McGowan said it was a \"fair\" assessment that the ACCC was pushing a broader agenda of lowering the bar to challenge mergers.</p><p>\"The ACCC has repeatedly failed in challenging mergers before courts and tribunals and they clearly have a view those decision-makers are placing too much emphasis on the self-interested evidence of corporate executives and not enough on market structure,\" Mr McGowan said.</p><p>\"This issue is broader than the [digital platform inquiry] - the ACCC has never attempted to block an acquisition by Google or Facebook,\" he said.</p><p>However, he said digital deals present unique challenges and gave the regulator a \"useful opportunity to push for reform in this area\" so he did not consider it to be overstepping.</p><p>A prominent banker who declined to be named said the change was unnecessary and could create uncertainty for businesses.</p><p>\"It is muddying the waters at a time when the velocity of change, the pace of technology, is so rapid that there's little chance on an evidentiary basis that anyone can reliably predict the markets in five years time,\" the source said.</p><p>Frontier Economics Australia and Asia economist Warwick Davis said the recommendation was \"unnecessary\" as the current list of merger factors that needed to be considered was substantial.</p><p>\"It's hard to see how adding to that list will improve clarity,\" he said. Frontier Economics has been an adviser to TPG and Vodafone during their merger case.</p><p>\"I don't think that losing cases means the law is wrong,\" he said.</p><p>Despite this, he agreed Google and Facebook's actions to acquire early-stage businesses was a legitimate concern and that any changes should be applied across all industries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520191653</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X88-KKN1-DY19-C46N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><timeReceived>00:59 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Current rules are less onerous as they require courts and regulators to only consider existing competitors.</p><p>The Business Council of Australia (BCA) has argued in a submission to Treasury that there \"does not appear to be a strong case\" for changes to the current merger rules. The BCA has more than 100 business members including BHP, Rio Tinto, Coles, Wesfarmers, AGL, Facebook, Google, Uber, Seek, Telstra, Mirvac, Qantas and the major banks.</p><p>The BCA criticised the recommendation as a \"signalling exercise\" that, along with proposed changes to privacy, contracts and trading practices, goes \"beyond the core issues in the inquiry and will have significant economy-wide impacts\". The submission also argues that companies \"may not have even had a chance to consider and respond to the recommendations and may not even be aware of them\".</p><p>The BCA is concerned the ACCC recommendation is not limited to the tech titans and would affect all businesses wanting to do a deal. The ACCC has not won a contested merger case in a court or tribunal in 20 years, a situation Mr Sims has previously described as a \"problem\".</p><p>Mr Sims responded to the BCA criticism by denying the merger recommendations were included to solve his court woes. He told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age the idea emerged from discussions with international competition regulators about Facebook and Google's controversial acquisitions of YouTube, Instagram, Whatsapp and Double Click.</p><p>\"The dominant view by 99 per cent of the population and most business organisations I go to, though not the BCA, is that we don't block enough,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>The change would also formalise a closer analysis of the type of assets a company has, such as data, intellectual property and technology.</p><p>The ACCC is waiting for an outcome from the Federal Court after Vodafone Hutchison Australia and TPG Telecom fought the competition regulator's decision to oppose their $15 billion merger. The regulator failed to stop rail group Aurizon selling its Queensland rail business to competitor Pacific National in the Federal Court in May. The decision has since been appealed.</p><p>\"There's no right answer and it depends on a philosophical position ... I think there's a certain group who would rather no mergers were blocked and there are groups who would prefer more,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>He did not dispute that what was proposed for the big tech firms would apply to other sectors but said the law should be \"general not sector-specific\".</p><p>King &amp; Wood Mallesons head of competition Sharon Henrick said the ACCC already considered future competition when deciding whether or not to oppose a merger and this would merely formalise the rules.</p><p>\"I believe the recommendations are part of a bigger agenda where the Commission is assessing its track record in contested merger cases and considering whether that law needs to be changed,\" Ms Henrick said.</p><p>Corrs Chambers Westgarth partner Mark McGowan said it was a \"fair\" assessment that the ACCC was pushing a broader agenda of lowering the bar to challenge mergers.</p><p>\"The ACCC has repeatedly failed in challenging mergers before courts and tribunals and they clearly have a view those decision-makers are placing too much emphasis on the self-interested evidence of corporate executives and not enough on market structure,\" Mr McGowan said.</p><p>\"This issue is broader than the [digital platform inquiry] - the ACCC has never attempted to block an acquisition by Google or Facebook,\" he said.</p><p>However, he said digital deals present unique challenges and gave the regulator a \"useful opportunity to push for reform in this area\" so he did not consider it to be overstepping.</p><p>A prominent banker who declined to be named said the change was unnecessary and could create uncertainty for businesses.</p><p>\"It is muddying the waters at a time when the velocity of change, the pace of technology, is so rapid that there's little chance on an evidentiary basis that anyone can reliably predict the markets in five years time,\" the source said.</p><p>Frontier Economics Australia and Asia economist Warwick Davis said the recommendation was \"unnecessary\" as the current list of merger factors that needed to be considered was substantial.</p><p>\"It's hard to see how adding to that list will improve clarity,\" he said. Frontier Economics has been an adviser to TPG and Vodafone during their merger case.</p><p>\"I don't think that losing cases means the law is wrong,\" he said.</p><p>Despite this, he agreed Google and Facebook's actions to acquire early-stage businesses was a legitimate concern and that any changes should be applied across all industries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520191653</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X88-KKN1-DY19-C46D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><timeReceived>00:59 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

With digital platforms it's really all about the data that can be misleading to consumers in terms of what's collected and how it's collected.</p><p>\"But it can also be a competitive advantage in stopping others getting the data, which can cause a competition problem,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>He added that the number of investigations into the platforms had doubled in the six months since releasing its landmark report into the effect of digital platforms on traditional media.</p><p>\"We mentioned in our report in July that we had five active investigations; I think we have now more than doubled that. We have a lot of investigations and we are just trying to prioritise which ones matter most. But I'm very confident we'll have a number of enforcement actions this year in relation to digital platforms.\" Mr Sims also revealed he was looking to extend general laws that applied to misleading customers under Australian law to fairness provisions. General laws apply to misleading conduct, making it easier to prove than fairness laws, which require proving specific breaches by tech companies.</p><p>\"I think we can easily determine fairness, particularly where you've got the criteria of significant detriment. You can measure touch and feel that.</p><p>\"If a big company is involved, and a small business or a consumer suffers significant detriment, then how did that happen? Was it their fault? I think this is a rule that can be easily applied \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I say take the place of a lot of other rules. Much better to have a general law.</p><p>The ACCC is taking Google to court over allegedly misleading consumers about how their data was being used via location, but action by the ACCC against big tech is comparatively non-existent when compared to regulators around the world.</p><p>Mr Sims defended the Australian regulator's record in dealing with tech giants, but said mistakes had been made.</p><p>\"Regulation is difficult - you make mistakes. This is a much better way to do it. Some people want to solve the problem straightaway. I don't think you can. It's a bit of a journey. Maybe we should have started a couple of years ago, but we'll get there.\"Mr Sims highlighted the $5bn fines recently levied against Google in the US under anti-trust law, saying it was beginning to have an impact on the way the digital giants operated, adding he was dealing closely with his international counterparts in the US and Europe. \"As the cases get taken you set the boundaries in which the digital platforms operate \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I think we should deal with the cases and establish law that way.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-b3590170579d11eaa2c6840b44c28273236b2fc5541896fd2eea4ee6233a667f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y92-9XK1-F0JP-W13D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"531\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 26, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This would create lower levels of accreditation for fintechs that do not actually collect data from banks, which would allow them to still get insights from it after it was collected via an intermediary.</p><p>Big tech can play</p><p>ACCC has left the door open for big global technology players to enter the financial services sector by getting accreditation to access bank data without having to contribute their own customer data into the regime.</p><p>\"Reciprocity is not a 'quid pro quo' arrangement between data holders and accredited data recipients,\" the ACCC said. \"The CDR regime is consumer focused, and any approach to reciprocity would need to be based on a consumer directing and consenting to an accredited data recipient sharing their data.\"</p><p>The rules framework also deals with the issue of consent.

Out of 19 companies that took part in the final pitch, Mishcon, in conjunction with innovation investors L Marks, has selected US litigation management software provider Everchron; satellite imagery startup Orbital Witness; US automated timekeeping provider Ping; mobile communication privacy scaleup SaltDNA; AI contract management platform Surukam; and cloud-based contract automation provider Synergist. MDR LAB has also entered into partnership with SeedLegals, which is an automated legal platform for startups, enabling them to create legal documents and shrink funding round timeframes. </p><p>The MDR LAB selection process, which was led by Mishcon's chief strategy officer and director of MDR LAB, Nick West, saw Mishcon identify companies that range from concept stage to revenue generating with which it has synergies and there is a clear mutual benefit to working together. West said: 'The companies we've selected play in the same spaces that we're in. We're not going to talk to a company focussed on derivatives because we don't do that work.' Pitch day saw 30 different judges from across the firm split across five categories: litigation; real estate; contracts; family; and the business of law. The six companies selected, two of which are based in the UK, with the other four coming from Germany, the US and India, will each have a partner and associate assigned to them as a mentor. Each has identified a goal to achieve in 10 weeks and will present their achievements at a demo day on 12 July. What that goal is will depend on the stage the company is at in its evolution, with Mishcon having deliberately selected companies that are at a variety of stages in their evolution, including one - Orbital Witness - which is at concept stage. For early stage startups, the first step of the 10-week process will be to understand and find the best use case for its technology, followed by building a product and packaging it up for use in the legal industry. For more established companies, the next 10 weeks will be used to tailor, tweak, and trial the technology. MDR LAB startups have also been assigned an external mentor, again tailored to what they are trying to achieve. Those mentors include Chris Fowler, general counsel TSO ... commercial at BT; and Andrew Magowan, GC and company secretary at ASOS. West said: 'If it's a late stage company or you have a product you want to sell to the in-house market the mentor might be in-house counsel who can give you a leg up. Or it might be someone who is more focussed on late stage fund raising and we've tried to match those needs.' The tech incubator follows Mishcon's 10-year strategy unveiled in July 2016, as part of which it plans to become more tech enabled. West said: 'Part of the reason for doing this is to accelerate the cultural change at Mischon. If we're going to become more tech-enabled and be more tech focussed, it's not about me and [chief information officer] Simon [Kosminksy] doing it but about the business all believing that it's important. Part of the reason for doing the Lab is about having dozens of people around Mishcon involved.' He adds: 'The inspiration comes from looking at the really big tech incubators and what makes them good and I'm trying to create a microcosm in legal. I'm sure we won't get everything right and next time we might do things differently but if we get the right people and the right mentors and push them hard to achieve, by the end of this process we'll hopefully really have something to show for it.' In terms of financial incentives, Mishcon and L Marks have entered into private options with each of the startups and West said: 'We may execute on some or none and how much we would invest is a private matter.' He adds: 'You couldn't join the Lab unless you reached that agreement. Some people said we don't need or want your money and that is absolutely fine.' It is hoped that the benefits of running the Lab will be far reaching and West said: 'Having launched MDR LAB I've had a dozen conversations with people that I would not have otherwise known about.' He adds: 'We do strongly believe the world is changing and tech adoption is increasing. We want to be seen as a firm on the front foot of that change. If these startups smash it and we execute an option great but that's not the sole reason for doing it.'

I interviewed Greg Roberts,\u00a0managing director for Accenture's North American\u00a0high-tech industry practice, about the predictions for CES 2018, the big tech trade show that will take place in Las Vegas in the second week of January. (Here's Accenture's CES predictions for CES 2017[1] and CES 2016[2]). Roberts sees five major stories happening at this year's show, which starts with press events on January 7. 'The first story is around the expansion and proliferation of artificial intelligence, the second is about 5G and how that enables the next generation of technology such as the Internet of Things, and the third is blockchain as an enabling technology for things like security,' said Roberts. 'There will be a shift toward software, and a lot of attention around autonomous vehicles. </p><p>Those are the stories that will be important.'Story One:\u00a0Expanding connectivity and uses of artificial intelligenceAbove: Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO of Nvidia, delivers the opening keynote address at CES 2017. Image Credit: NvidiaAI is going to be pervasive across more things at CES as more anD more applications, devices, and networks integrate AI. AI and analytics can make products smarter and more consumer friendly, whether it's devices such as the Amazon Echo, using the Alexa personal assistant service, or services such as customer support. AI is no longer viewed as 'artificial' but more a real and routine part of business and products. Roberts said that AI is more like a Wi-Fi connection, or something that we expect to deliver what we want without hassle. It will lead to better smartphones, games, self-driving cars, and other products at the show. The show will have nine major conference sessions on AI, including 'AI and Analytics:\u00a0Creating compelling IoT services'; 'Designing AI-powered robots';\u00a0'How AI is changing the world'; and 'Turning AI into dollars.' Roberts noted that sales of digital voice assistants such as Echo doubled in the past year. This year, the assistants will have a broader range of services, and they will be integrated into cars, kitchens, home appliances, communications, and entertainment devices. 'You'll see broader adoption and deeper integration,' Roberts said. 'It's crossing the line between an interesting toy and a foundational technology.'Story Two: Chicken or the egg - 5G and the Internet of ThingsAbove: Qualcomm 5G Image Credit: QualcommThe next major transition in wireless communications is 5G, which promises multiple gigabits per second of data transfer across cellular networks. 5G will roll out across large markets around 2020, but the jockeying among technology companies has already started. Firms like Intel[3] and Qualcomm are competing to create the prototypes that demonstrate 5G service now. CES isn't usually the spot for hearing about such things. But 5G will likely be woven into the visions of various keynote speakers, as it will significantly speed up the adoption of the Internet of Things. It's a foundational technology, enabling a whole wave of innovative products that will use it. 5G speeds are expected to be 10 times faster than those currently available with 4G LTE. It could speed applications such as video streaming, VR gaming, and self-driving cars. Offering more enhanced consumer experiences, 5G is intended to\u00a0enable lower-cost device-to-device communication with shorter delays\u00a0that help extend the battery lives. We should get better fitness wearables, smart garments, and security devices.Story Three: Blockchain connects with CES 2018Above: Blockchain Image Credit: Zapp2Photo / ShutterstockBlockchain is the underlying innovation behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. While those currencies are fluctuating in value, the core technology of the decentralized ledger that transparently records payments and other records. It allows\u00a0multiple stakeholders to confidently and securely share access to\u00a0the same information. Blockchain shares data in\u00a0a manner that is transparent, safe, auditable and resistant to outages. Blockchain could help organizations become more decentralized as well\u00a0as more democratic, efficient and secure.\u00a0Over the next five to ten years blockchain will likely disrupt many\u00a0industries, Roberts said. The technology offers promise across a wide range of\u00a0business applications, including consumer electronics, payment\u00a0processing and banking, healthcare, online music, content\u00a0micropayments and private transport, to name just a few. These things aren't so visible at a trade show.\u00a0But Roberts said the technology will be a focal point in\u00a0presentations and demonstrations of advanced and emerging technologies. You may see potential use cases in which blockchain solves problems\u00a0across a range of consumer electronics products and technologies, such as smartphones, networking and the Internet of Things, as well as\u00a0private transport. 'We are more mobile and more integrated, and that drives the need for things to be more secure,' Roberts said. 'It delivers confidence and security for the things that are on the floor.' In the smartphone market, there could be demonstrations of highly\u00a0secure, open source smartphones using blockchain technology that\u00a0allow phone users to securely send and receive payments for services\u00a0and products \u2014 without having to pay fees. The phones may offer\u00a0features such as secure exchange access and encrypted communications.\u00a0In transportation, you may see blockchain used to create a decentralized\u00a0version of peer-to-peer ride applications. This would allow car owners\u00a0and users to arrange terms and conditions securely without a third-party\u00a0provider.Story Four: Products becoming more software smartAbove: CES 2017 ice sculpture Image Credit: Dean TakahashiCES has traditionally been a hardware show spotlighting the latest in\u00a0electronics gadgets. But at this year's show you are likely to notice that a\u00a0growing amount of these products consist of, and are powered by,\u00a0software. Software makes these devices and products smarter. These products\u00a0are being enhanced by smart software-based application programming\u00a0interfaces that deliver more feature-rich, intelligent, and personalized\u00a0services and capabilities. Consider the smartphones, wearable fitness\u00a0monitors, PCs and TVs typically shown at CES. They're getting smarter,\u00a0and the reason is the growing amount of software embedded within\u00a0them. So are the digital voice assistants - which are bound to be one of this year's hot products, Roberts said. Consistent with this trend, look for evidence of traditional hardware\u00a0product companies unveiling more intelligent products increasingly\u00a0powered by software. These companies will more often develop and use\u00a0software and function like software companies that leverage the power\u00a0of analytics and release new features faster. Also at the show anticipate\u00a0more software platform companies entering more hardware markets over a range of devices such as servers, digital assistants, tablets,\u00a0smartphones, drones, and autonomous cars. 'This is going to mark a a pivot from when we saw a hardware-centric show in the past to a software platform show,' Roberts said. 'Companies are highlighting their capabilities about the advantages they get from their software.'Story Five: In-Vehicle AI driving the connected car marketAbove: The Panasonic driverless concept car. Image Credit: Dean TakahashiConnected cars and their associated digital services have been among\u00a0the most intriguing products shown at the CES show in recent years. But\u00a0there remain numerous engineering, regulatory, and usability\u00a0challenges. 'We think that pulling things together like AI, 5G, blockchain, and software will result in autonomous vehicles,' Roberts said. These challenges can be overcome with breakthroughs in predictive\u00a0capabilities, self-driving features, and 'in-vehicle' AI and algorithm\u00a0solutions and intuitive user interfaces such as voice. What's needed is a\u00a0means for AI to interact with data in cars in seamless and smart ways\u00a0that enhance the driving experience. Before AI becomes widely used in\u00a0cars, some tough issues need to be addressed, such as data acquisition\u00a0and storage. Acquiring the data, such as images, audio and video, is difficult.\u00a0Archiving it takes massive storage. And annotating it to a usable state\u00a0for AI training takes a large amount of resources. Each hour of data\u00a0collected takes hundreds of human hours to annotate. Scaling data\u00a0annotation is a difficult process. The technical challenges associated with storing such high volumes of image, video and sensor data of\u00a0differing formats, sizes and characteristics can halt or delay an\u00a0autonomous vehicle project, Roberts said.

Big tech firms are circling the traditional health care delivery arena, seemingly ready to move in with patient-centric digital solutions. But Accenture's Maximilian Schmid argues that medtechs have all the tools and the industry intelligence to face down the disruptors, so long as they \"get it right.\"                                                                                                      </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The life sciences industry is changing fast, and manufacturers of health technology solutions are now rapidly facing a choice: adapt to changing demand and factor in the growing opportunity - or threat - that AI, machine learning and disruptive new entrants represent to the medtech field; or lose competitive positioning in the market.</p><p>Business services and strategic consulting group Accenture Life Sciences paints a picture of this evolving health care landscape in its recently-released flagship report, Life Sciences TechVision 2018, an annual publication that this year is entitled Unleashing The Intelligent Enterprise For Patients. It is in fact one of three new Accenture reports focusing on digital transformation and what it means to senior global medtech executives and the wider health care industry (see box:\u00a0Trio Of Accenture Reports With Digital Focus). </p><p>The essential message from Life Sciences TechVision 2018 for medtechs is that, faced with these challenges in an evolving health care delivery environment, they must \"get it right, or face disruption.\" So says Schmid, who leads Accenture's Global Medtech Practice. Speaking to In Vivo, he sketched out the current pressures and outlook for commercial stakeholders, informed by the all three of the reports' findings. He explained that the purpose of putting a separate focus on medtech, within life sciences as a whole, was to assess how the world appears, seen from the angle of players in the sector. Interviews with 55 medtech industry CEOs - from an overall interviewee pool of 931 - form a central part of the Life Sciences TechVision 2018 report, and seek to show how, from a business perspective, medtech firms can cope with changing technology, and how it will affect their business.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Five major trends were identified by the 931 executives across all industries. The three trends that have the greatest near-term influence on the health care industry were highlighted as: trust in data, how to take advantage the new models for the free-flow of business, and the growing opportunity (or threat) of artificial intelligence. \"We see tremendous potential for the application of the various technologies that don't sit in 'core medtech',\" said Schmid, who estimates 50% growth in the use of such technologies in the next few years.</p><p>Split View On Preparedness Levels For New Commercial Models</p><p>Of the 55 medtech CEOs interviewed by Accenture Life Sciences, 55% said they felt prepared for the transition away from a product-driven way of managing the business and towards a service-oriented way of driving the business. But the other half, more or less, admitted that they were not prepared for this kind of shift. A split of this magnitude is fairly typical among industry executives at present. \"They are either strong believers, or conversely, are determined to stay with their core offering,\" says Schmid.</p><p>AI and big data are the technologies/concepts that the \"digital converts\" believe will have the most impact on their businesses. Around 40% of executives say, \"If we don't get these right, someone will disrupt us.\" The next most disruptive themes are augmented and virtual reality, which 28% of executives consider as having the biggest impact on their activity. A typical response here is, \"How can we use them to make better decisions in clinical workflow or provide better services?\" Use of robotics and automation in workflows (not surgical procedures) is seen by 8% of those polled as the key change to adjust to as they conduct their business.</p><p>\"Whether they get it right or not can have a major impact on their market capitalizations: many may well see their market valuations increase by up to 50%. On the other hand, they can get into really difficult situations if they don't get it right,\" says Schmid. </p><p>Managing And Owning Data Is Now A Top Aim </p><p>But there is a growing need and determination among executives to manage and own data. Before these business models moved from the periphery to the center ground, ambitious medtech groups would tend to develop revenue streams defined by IP, or the functionality of an item of hardware on a product. The new business models say that revenue streams are more likely to be defined by how a company is able to manage data within is business ecosystems. It is what Schmid refers to as the \"last mile\" concept, whereby companies managing the data in a subset dubbed the last mile have the opportunity to generate income in that revenue stream. \"If you're on the last mile, you own the revenue.\"</p><p>                                  Life Sciences TechVision 2018 starts by flagging the notion that significant changes in the life sciences industry are being driven by socio-economic pressures, scientific advances and the consumerization of the patient. Data availability and AI, among other things, are the tools that are allowing companies to respond to and begin to exploit these changes. As such, industry is seeing the creation of the \"intelligent enterprise,\" as Accenture describes it, which it defines as a company that adapts as technology develops.</p><p>Meanwhile, the patient, rightly at the center of it all, is finding that the consumption of health care offerings is becoming easier, better targeted, personalized and quicker because of device connectedness and the use of algorithms that learn from electronic patient records. </p><p>The data derived from this digitally-enabled chain of health-care delivery is there to be exploited, and big tech companies such as Amazon and Google are already positioning themselves to be able to do just that. But \"traditional\" health care concerns are also active, as seen in the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/201400234\">GSK-Novartis Consumer JV</url>\u00a0and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/201500526\">Verily Life Sciences LLC</url>\u00a0deal to set up Galvini Bioelectronics, bringing drug discovery, miniaturization and data analytics together in a single offering to create therapies that interpret electronic signals in the body and spot and correct irregular patterns in specific disease states. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT103665//\">\"New GSKVerily JV Aims For Smart Grain Of Rice Neuromod Tech\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)</p><p> Data Veracity, Technology Partnerships And The Value Of AI </p><p>Three themes that stand out for health care and life science companies that are tracking the trends in the changing nature of health care delivery globally.</p><p>The range of data that companies will need to access - be it from wearables, genomic data or patient EPRs - is growing exponentially, but the \"truth\" of the data that is used and exchanged must be validated to ensure quality. The sense is that, right now, not enough is being done to determine or ensure \"data veracity,\" to use Accenture's term. Life Sciences TechVision 2018 notes that one-third of life science executives have high confidence in their data. But is one third high enough? Clearly not, so work to secure data sets must be a priority to ensure that trust in the system is not impaired.</p><p>\"Frictionless,\" as applied to business, might appear to be a term that has currently been hijacked by a UK government fearing that EU withdrawal will impede free trade with its erstwhile fellow EU member states. But in the evolving health care model globally, \"frictionless business\" means working across silos and embarking on technology-based partnerships via microservice architectures (including the Cloud) and Blockchain, enabling the sharing and release of data with partners on agreed terms. Accenture is working with DHL on a Blockchain-based anti-counterfeit medicines program, for instance. </p><p>The third trend is the ever-increasing advance and sophistication of AI, and how to factor it in for maximum benefit. It is fast becoming a \"co-worker\" in its ability to facilitate rapid response to the needs of patients and health care ecosystems. \"Citizen AI\" is another new term coined by Accenture, which it uses to reflect this new digital-stakeholder relationship, but can companies ensure that their AI remains healthily unbiased and transparent? With cautiousness starting to subside among industry players, companies must ensure they give AI the same oversight as its physical \"co-workers\" have traditionally enjoyed. As said, it also needs to be trustworthy. But the benefits are clear, and Accenture's report\u00a0lists several recent initiatives that are taking AI forward: BenevolentAI, iCarbonX and BenchSci being among the new platforms that promise to transform health care delivery.</p><p>Three Priorities For Transformation</p><p>Schmid acknowledges that companies must change their approach and adapt their activities to the new model. But what precisely do they need to change, in terms of internal transformation? What do medtech companies need to do that is different to what is happening in the hardware-based environment, and be involved in the way pharma companies like <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198601356\">GlaxoSmithKline PLC</url>\u00a0have begun to be?</p><p>There are fundamentally three priorities for medtech groups, says Schmid. Companies making the transition must first focus on engaging with the device user. They must identify if that user is, say, the clinician, nurse, patient, or even the lab worker. Understanding which user population is important for the company is essential, and moreover, might be very different to what it is at the present time. Connecting with a community is an important stage in the process, and companies must consider questions such as, \"Can I build a global community of... nurses?\" for instance. \u00a0Connecting and globally servicing the target community automatically gives a company the ability to sell more products, control the ecosystem and have a good view on how well its competitors are doing. This customer engagement also lets a company know what are the key drivers among the community, and over the course of the business relationship prompts customers to begin contacting the company on a voluntary basis. Those companies that are more attuned to the social elements of business generation, and those who have perhaps have learnt from the Googles of this world, are more likely to succeed with this approach, Schmid observes.</p><p>Companies must secondly start thinking across the silos, i.e. no longer look at business from a product perspective. The workforce might need to be reskilled. This potentially has a very big impact on R&amp;D departments, where staff might have seen themselves as engineers whose endeavors focus around problems such as \"how to we make a certain device another 5% better?\" But platforms now really mean software platforms, and a completely different type of innovation (as exemplified by Amazon). The new model also includes more trial-and-error and \"fail-fast\" concepts, rather than companies putting all their thinking into one functionality, which then goes through the approval process.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\"Scale it\" is the third priority. For medtech companies, the business is seen to evolve, moving away from the provision of a single service, and towards notions of \"how can I build an end-to-end service that applies to across the complete spectrum of hospital sectors?\" Here is where the enterprise's innate intelligence comes into play. The medtech company may typically be thinking, \"I have the platform, I understand health care professionals and their needs in terms of chronic disease control, I have the reimbursement, and I have the data to manage treatments in a completely different way, and for different outcomes.\" Couple that with their growing ability to digitally tackle inefficiencies, and the result is precisely that end-to-end service. But, Schmid warns, \"If you're not the biggest, you won't survive in the long run.\" </p><p>New Mind- And Skill-Sets</p><p>A different mindset and skills are needed to drive innovation in the new health care models. Over the course of\u00a0 their \"transformation,\"companies will be able to better define their markets or go into new ones where they don't necessarily have a history of activity or control. \"Defining them [markets], and engaging customers, are areas where these companies really need to work hard,\" says Schmid. </p><p>\"We found that 73% of executives believe if we don't get this transformation right, we might run into big difficulties concerning our future, especially in view of the ever-increasing pressures on health care and the ageing population,\" says Schmid. But it is also an opportunity to visualize new digital technologies that go more into prevention and personalizing care through data as the key issues to resolve. \"We will need more health care 20-30 years from now, and if we don't find solutions, somebody else will - it might not be a medtech company, but could be a technology company, which might present survival challenges for medtechs in the long-term.\"</p><p>In the general discussion over which type of individual will own and control health care delivery agendas in the future, in Accenture's experience, it will not necessarily be anyone with a commercial pedigree from one of the tech-heavy exponents of medtech. \"What will be key is how an individual has grown up within his/her company.\" </p><p>It is difficult to see an individuals who have come out of R&amp;D and are very involved in feature-heavy programs becoming top decision-makers within the future system, says Schmid. \"But visionaries who have grown up on the hospital side, who are much more attuned to solving clinical or lab work-flow problems, have a different view on future needs.\"</p><p>Seeking Visionaries </p><p>Within medtech, the \"visionary executive\" is not as common or widespread as the industry needs right now. It might even be said that CEOs that are not forward-looking in fact represent something of a threat to their company. Upskilling might be quite foreign to them, but equally, Schmid has observed a trend among executives to learn these skills. \"That is exactly what we are seeing in these new positions; all of a sudden, we have digital technology officers at board level. Or within the R&amp;D department, we see that people are being appointed to have responsibility for digital solutions or quality solutions.\"</p><p>Another trend in the medtech R&amp;D area is that specialists are increasingly being sourced from outside the industry, especially if they have broader knowledge of digital and technology platforms. Similarly, industry \"outsiders,\" with their new ways of thinking, are also becoming more prevalent at board level. They help to guide visionary thinking on the management side, and they look for big data \"lake\" patient correlations, or cross-border, Cloud-based approaches and solutions, as opposed to country-based approaches.</p><p>Winners And Losers Ahead</p><p>Looking five years ahead, there will be winner and losers as the ground continues to shift towards personalized medicine and use of smarter datasets to deliver affordable, more accessible technologies. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198601141\">Royal Philips NV</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198601368\">GE Healthcare</url>\u00a0and indeed diagnostics companies in general, already exposed to so much data, are well placed to benefit from the intelligent health care revolution. </p><p>On the other hand, \"just being able to operate a database on a Cloud platform is something that a technology company is probably most qualified to do,\" says Schmid. \"We are in very changing times. Look at the amount of money that technology companies can throw into this - the Amazons and the Googles can put a lot more investment behind it than medtechs, and that should worry the medtech companies.\" The Boston-based JP Morgan, Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon venture, designed to provide health care for its 1.2 million staff, has not yet stopped creating ripples and waves, even though its strategy has still not been unveiled. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//SC100661//\">\"Amazon And The Case For Major Health Care Disruption\" \"Scrip\"</url>) It moved forward a few steps this summer when it named Harvard surgeon and New Yorker magazine writer Dr. Atul Gawande as part-time chief executive. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT032127//\">\"Citing Incomplete Technologies Atul Gawande Calls For Increased Automation\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)</p><p>But medtech companies are eminently qualified to at least part-own their territory. As they already have the equipment and the devices, they are well placed to create the data around their offering to keep patients healthy. They can possibly even create health insurance offerings too. But the key is being able to connect end-to-end, with a combination of medical knowledge to build an intervention infrastructure which the company then owns - a clinic, for instance. \"In our view, this is the stronger value proposition,\" says Schmid. </p><p>Keep It In Perspective</p><p>It seems that entirely different skills will be needed to run medtech companies in the future. But Schmid advises: \"look after your core, use the 'digital switch' to transform, and select carefully the digital service business you are targeting.\" It should not be, \"I want to set up an Amazon cloud or compete with Google,\" for instance. A better-targeted ambition for a renal medtech company, say, it might be how the digital service is set up to treat people at home who have dialysis needs.</p><p>In short, a brief checklist from Schmid would be: \"look at your therapeutics; look at the 'digital playground;' leverage your heritage; gauge where your strengths are; and maintain your medical knowledge.\" The knowledge part is key: \"You need to get that right - it's really all about the knowledge that allows you to grow your community, and build a sustainable business model around it.\" After that, next most important is software skills. At the heart of it is a mindset that says, \"We need to deliver that fast.\" And that means it's still all about the technology too. </p><p>The Upcoming Ecosystem Needs</p><p>If that is how medtechs are advised to face the future, other players in the ecosystem also need to play their part. Regulatory bodies must buy into this in full, or \"the health care costs will kill us,\" says Schmid, calling for more help on innovation. </p><p>Common rules on, say, which Blockchain standard industry should be used, are still outstanding issues. They cannot be resolved by a single company alone. \"Someone - governments or regulators - needs to set up an infrastructure for a set common rules.\" So far, there has been no major momentum for the establishment of a health care consortium for Blockchain, which can \"revolutionize the way we share patient data.\" Similarly, the nervousness around AI is unwarranted - at least around \"small\" AI, which is evidently a tool that can take away some of the pain for companies. But here too governance is needed, and, for its part, industry needs to explain its AI, while making it secure for patients.

The impact will vary across the globe depending upon the level of government-funded stimulus programs and the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In the U.S., around 9 percent of home loans were in forbearance as of June, up 6 percentage points since March. In the U.K., payment holidays were issued on one in six mortgages and 1.5 million credit cards and personal loans.</p><p>\"Banks will play a critical role in helping absorb the economic impact of the global pandemic and stimulating a rapid recovery for consumers and small businesses,\" said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture who leads its Banking practice globally. \"As public programs wind down, the burden of holding extra capital to protect against credit defaults will fall on banks' balance sheets. To inform their credit management strategies, banks will need a clear-sighted and data-driven view of the current level of credit risk while keeping a long-term view of the customer at the forefront.\"</p><p>In 2019, U.S. banks set aside US$55 billion to cover potential loan losses; Accenture estimates that banks will need to hold an additional US$210 billion to US$265 billion to cover potential write-offs for bad loans in 2020 depending on the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In Europe, banks might write off up to US$460 billion in 2020, an increase of US$370 billion from 2019; and in China, banks might write off up to US$360 billion in 2020, a US$190 billion increase from 2019.</p><p>In the increasingly debt-driven economy, banks are faced with managing their existing loan books while also making decisions around extending new credit. The report notes that doing so could lead to record levels of public and private debt worldwide, which some analysts predict could reach as high as $200 trillion by the end of 2020. This might ultimately threaten the ability of businesses and consumers to repay their debts.</p><p>Large banks in a position of strength when the pandemic hit</p><p>Many banks entered the pandemic with the financial resilience to absorb considerable credit losses, with the world's largest banks holding capital reserves well above what regulators require, according to Accenture analysis. The report notes that the top five U.S. banks set aside US$60 billion in reserves during the first half of the year and that European banks set aside almost US$18 billion in the first quarter of 2020. These reserves will start to be drawn down as stimulus funding dries up, causing accounts to go delinquent.</p><p>\"Banks will have to maneuver carefully to strike the right balance between rescuing individual and small business customers and protecting their own profitability and solvency,\" McIntyre said. \"This will require difficult decisions around which credit extensions will help an ultimately financially viable customer versus delaying the inevitable delinquency. To make these decisions, banks can apply the firepower of data and analytics capabilities that they've built over the past decade to help inform surgical credit management strategies tailored for specific industries and geographies ?ultimately providing the type of high-end treatment typically reserved for high-net-worth and corporate customers.\"</p><p>Banks' temporary blind-spot in credit management</p><p>The report notes that in an environment where payment holidays aren't being reflected in consumers' credit scores and the underlying health of a business is masked by furlough and payroll protection schemes, banks can take a data-driven approach to manage their credit portfolio. This approach can provide a broader context of the current environment and how business and consumer behaviors have changed as a result of COVID-19.</p><p>Over the past decade, banks' credit management units have shrunk back to bare bones. Many banks will need to quickly scale up resources and collections capabilities to a magnitude beyond what they can traditionally handle to meet the expected rising levels of default. By combining the digital technologies they've built over the past decade with their people on the front lines, banks can provide personalized advice and empathetic guidance to offer creative solutions to help customers bridge the widening financial gap.</p><p>The report provides recommendations for how banks can strengthen their credit management capabilities and prepare their business and operations for the challenges to come, while managing potentially conflicting priorities. These include:</p><p>-engaging with regulators to avoid/minimize unintended consequences such as new credit drying up;</p><p>-operating with clear guidance and transparency on collections and recovery;</p><p>-ensuring fair treatment for borrowers while also having a clear view of customers' creditworthiness; and</p><p>-managing balance sheet risk while providing advice that helps businesses and consumers navigate through the financial crisis.</p><p>\"While it might be tempting for banks to pull back on extending new credit in the current environment, the demand for credit will rise and be met ? if not by banks then by non-traditional lenders,\" McIntyre said. \"Competition isn't coming just from fintechs and big tech, but increasingly from large, well-capitalized companies offering finance options for their products and services. If banks attempt to aggressively reduce offers of credit, what might start as a slow trickle of customers turning to alternate lenders could quickly become roaring rapids that can drastically change the tide of lending.\"</p><p>Report information:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/coronavirus-credit-crisis\">www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/coronavirus-credit-crisis</url></p><p>((Comments on this story may be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsdesk@closeupmedia.com\">newsdesk@closeupmedia.com</email>))</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECCLPM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECCLPM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60J6-FM41-JCRR-003S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345185</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Close-Up Media, Inc.

The impact will vary across the globe depending upon the level of government-funded stimulus programs and the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In the U.S., around 9 percent of home loans were in forbearance as of June, up 6 percentage points since March. In the U.K., payment holidays were issued on one in six mortgages and 1.5 million credit cards and personal loans.</p><p>\"Banks will play a critical role in helping absorb the economic impact of the global pandemic and stimulating a rapid recovery for consumers and small businesses,\" said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture who leads its Banking practice globally. \"As public programs wind down, the burden of holding extra capital to protect against credit defaults will fall on banks' balance sheets. To inform their credit management strategies, banks will need a clear-sighted and data-driven view of the current level of credit risk while keeping a long-term view of the customer at the forefront.\"</p><p>In 2019, U.S. banks set aside US$55 billion to cover potential loan losses; Accenture estimates that banks will need to hold an additional US$210 billion to US$265 billion to cover potential write-offs for bad loans in 2020 depending on the severity of the public health aspect of COVID-19. In Europe, banks might write off up to US$460 billion in 2020, an increase of US$370 billion from 2019; and in China, banks might write off up to US$360 billion in 2020, a US$190 billion increase from 2019.</p><p>In the increasingly debt-driven economy, banks are faced with managing their existing loan books while also making decisions around extending new credit. The report notes that doing so could lead to record levels of public and private debt worldwide, which some analysts predict could reach as high as $200 trillion by the end of 2020. This might ultimately threaten the ability of businesses and consumers to repay their debts.</p><p>Large banks in a position of strength when the pandemic hit</p><p>Many banks entered the pandemic with the financial resilience to absorb considerable credit losses, with the world's largest banks holding capital reserves well above what regulators require, according to Accenture analysis. The report notes that the top five U.S. banks set aside US$60 billion in reserves during the first half of the year and that European banks set aside almost US$18 billion in the first quarter of 2020. These reserves will start to be drawn down as stimulus funding dries up, causing accounts to go delinquent.</p><p>\"Banks will have to maneuver carefully to strike the right balance between rescuing individual and small business customers and protecting their own profitability and solvency,\" McIntyre said. \"This will require difficult decisions around which credit extensions will help an ultimately financially viable customer versus delaying the inevitable delinquency. To make these decisions, banks can apply the firepower of data and analytics capabilities that they've built over the past decade to help inform surgical credit management strategies tailored for specific industries and geographies ?ultimately providing the type of high-end treatment typically reserved for high-net-worth and corporate customers.\"</p><p>Banks' temporary blind-spot in credit management</p><p>The report notes that in an environment where payment holidays aren't being reflected in consumers' credit scores and the underlying health of a business is masked by furlough and payroll protection schemes, banks can take a data-driven approach to manage their credit portfolio. This approach can provide a broader context of the current environment and how business and consumer behaviors have changed as a result of COVID-19.</p><p>Over the past decade, banks' credit management units have shrunk back to bare bones. Many banks will need to quickly scale up resources and collections capabilities to a magnitude beyond what they can traditionally handle to meet the expected rising levels of default. By combining the digital technologies they've built over the past decade with their people on the front lines, banks can provide personalized advice and empathetic guidance to offer creative solutions to help customers bridge the widening financial gap.</p><p>The report provides recommendations for how banks can strengthen their credit management capabilities and prepare their business and operations for the challenges to come, while managing potentially conflicting priorities. These include:</p><p>-engaging with regulators to avoid/minimize unintended consequences such as new credit drying up;</p><p>-operating with clear guidance and transparency on collections and recovery;</p><p>-ensuring fair treatment for borrowers while also having a clear view of customers' creditworthiness; and</p><p>-managing balance sheet risk while providing advice that helps businesses and consumers navigate through the financial crisis.</p><p>\"While it might be tempting for banks to pull back on extending new credit in the current environment, the demand for credit will rise and be met ? if not by banks then by non-traditional lenders,\" McIntyre said. \"Competition isn't coming just from fintechs and big tech, but increasingly from large, well-capitalized companies offering finance options for their products and services. If banks attempt to aggressively reduce offers of credit, what might start as a slow trickle of customers turning to alternate lenders could quickly become roaring rapids that can drastically change the tide of lending.\"</p><p>Report information:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/coronavirus-credit-crisis\">www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/coronavirus-credit-crisis</url></p><p>((Comments on this story may be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsdesk@closeupmedia.com\">newsdesk@closeupmedia.com</email>))</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WNCLPM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WNCLPM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H4-KM01-JCRR-04PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Close-Up Media, Inc.

Targeted ads and friends\u2019 posts regularly pop up on Instagram and Facebook in the midst of our conversations about those very products and people.</p><p>Coincidence? No one has been able to conclusively prove otherwise, but we do know Alexa is recording us on our Echo Dots.</p><p>Technology is pushing the limits in how marketers not only meet, but anticipate, the growing demands for a frictionless customer experience. With the convergence of Big Tech, machine learning, enhanced targeting and personalization, we arguably stand at the precipice where either personalization or privacy will hold sway.</p><p>The pushback has already begun, with the 2020s poised to be the decade that sets some ground rules for an industry that\u2019s used to making the rules (or not) as it goes.</p><p>\u201cIf you think about healthcare, if you think about financial services, every other industry with high volumes of data collection\u2014they are already regulated, but it hasn\u2019t come to roost for those of us in the marketing and advertising space,\u201d noted Fatemeh Khatibloo, a Forrester analyst with expertise in the privacy/personalization paradox. \u201cAnd clearly what we\u2019re hearing from consumers and regulators is that it\u2019s time to put those guardrails up.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, the EU enacted the General Data Protection Regulation in 2016, giving citizens more control over their data, shutting down some businesses overnight, and now this privacy trend has reached our shores. Maine and Nevada quietly enacted their own protections earlier this year, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which allows residents not only to opt out of having their data collected, shared or used, but to sue businesses for data breaches, takes effect on Jan. 1. Similar bills are in the works for Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and Texas. In time, depending on which way the political wind blows, we may see a comprehensive law protecting data and privacy enacted by Congress.</p><p>The imminent arrival of 5G, with its blazingly fast broadband speeds and improved mobile networks, will only add to the urgency of the privacy-and-security conversation. It\u2019s obvious why 5G would appeal to consumers, but will they be as thrilled with the potential for marketers (and the government) to have even more access to their every move?</p><p>For brands, the coming decade promises extraordinary technological advances that will unleash new and exciting ways to enhance their value. But as we know all too well, technology can get away from us and into hands of bad actors.
