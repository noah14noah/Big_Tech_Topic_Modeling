The August jobs report and optimism over China trade talks fueled President Trump celebration of the U.S. economy. And true or false. Trying to tell reality from fantasy as big tech goes after deep fakes. This is Special Report.</p><p>Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. The death toll could be staggering. That from a Bahamian official just getting a sense of the magnitude of the devastation left by Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas. We're getting new information tonight on that devastation. A warning, the images and descriptions in this next report are tough to watch and hear.</p><p>The official death toll has risen to 30 with thousands of homes destroyed. But the unofficial death toll could skyrocket from there. When you actually get to see the worst hit areas like Abaco Island. Correspondent Steve Harrigan is there tonight. Steve.</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, I am standing here on Abaco Islands in the Bahamas and what was someone's house just a week ago, in what was someone's neighborhood also just a week ago. This was no ordinary storm that tore the roof off of a few houses. This was 185 mile per hour winds over and over again for 36 plus hours. The whole scene here as far as you can see to the left, to the right is like a place that's been jumbled like a snow globe. That's been shook.</p><p>Things are just crushed down to the foundation. We've seen people wander through here and try and find items of value. It's even hard for some people to locate where their house was. That's how jumbled this landscape is. But there is little of value to find.</p><p>We've heard quite a bit about the death toll. And I can tell you from standing here that death toll is going to continue to rise dramatically in the days ahead. No one knows how many dead bodies are still in the wreckage out here. This was a church where some people tried to find shelter from the storm instead it collapsed killing many. We're not going to show you but from where I'm standing, I can see at least one two dead bodies bloated and rotting in the sun.</p><p>We have seen some signs of hope though especially from Bahamians volunteering with their own boats to try and help people get off of this island.</p><p>This is an all-volunteer flotilla. You have people from different parts of the Bahamas arriving on their own private boats. They're bringing supplies, food and water and then they're taking people off of Abaco Islands, people who are desperate to leave. People have lost everything. People have been waiting around the clock here at the water's edge hoping to get their families off this island. These boats will eventually go to Nassau people leaving everything they had behind to get on these boats to save their families.</p><p>A real danger now is for people who are too frail, too poor, too weak to move. A lot of people in the makeshift hospital here are running out of medications.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's people that just look hopeless and just you know just need to find hope somewhere somehow nothing the government hasn't come through; they haven't said nothing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIGAN: There has been heroic efforts by U.S. Coast Guard pilots and cutters to rescue people from the air, from the sea and it's estimated that those efforts will be stepped up in the coming days. This is a tough place to get to, but just looking around with dead bodies still protruding from this wreckage, you really get a sense that not much is really being done now for the people of the Bahamas by anyone. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Steve Harrigan. Steve, thank you. Steve and Chris Pontius, the photographer have seen a lot of war and a lot of disaster in their time and this devastation as you heard unlike most.</p><p>Now to the U.S. East Coast, several hundred people may be trapped on one island of North Carolina's Outer Banks tonight. Correspondent Doug McKelway is on the North Carolina coast.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The flag at Frying Pan light station was still flying today frayed but defiant. It was Dorian though that got one last punch in on the Tar Heel State overnight.</p><p>As hope grew, the coastal regions would be spared the worst. Dorian made its first U.S. landfall on the Outer Banks, hardest hit Ocracoke Island, accessible only by sea and air.</p><p>Some residents were reportedly forced into their attics to escape a huge storm surge.</p><p>MIKE SPRAYBERRY, NORTH CAROLINA EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT: We have heard unofficially that there could be hundreds of people that are trapped out there, we don't have a really good number on it.</p><p>MCKELWAY: At 2:30 this afternoon, Hyde County officials sent word that air transportation units were being sent to Ocracoke to evacuate the stranded with priority for the sick and elderly. But most of the Carolinas fared better.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, it did, and it discarded us. So that's a good thing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How does everybody feel about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh wonderful. Believe me. It's a good thing.</p><p>MCKELWAY: Dorian's eye wall kept a steady path just off the coast meeting most residents felt only its weaker northerly winds west of the eye wall. Those north winds dissipated the tornado threat and also pushed potential flood waters of Wilmington's Cape Fear River southward into the open ocean sparing the city from serious flooding.</p><p>Three hurricanes in three years has given valued experience to first responders and those who restore electricity.</p><p>JEFF BROOKS, DUKE ENERGY: We've upgraded a lot of poles and wires especially near coastal regions putting in stronger poles so those tools helping our linemen.</p><p>MCKELWAY: One Duke Energy official texted Fox News today \"we're restoring power so fast, I can't keep up with our crews.\"</p><p>As the storm moved northward prompting new warnings for states up the East Coast into Canada, residents of Topsail BeachNorth Carolina were breathing a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You prepare for the worst. Pray for the best and be thankful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY: And as you look live down the beach here at Surf City at North Carolina, you'll see scores and scores of new staircases coming down the sand dunes. They're new because the old ones were washed away along with the sand dunes during Hurricane Florence. Exactly, a year ago today. Nobody wanted to see a repeat of that last night. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Doug McKelway live in Surf City. Doug, thanks. President Trump is getting some backup tonight from an unexpected source. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve who the President harshly criticized in recent weeks says he is not expecting a recession in the U.S. or globally. That reinforces what the President has been saying despite the forecasts of some economists.</p><p>The news comes on a day filled with economic headlines. Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts runs through them tonight for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The monthly jobs report came in well below expectations, 130,000 jobs created versus 158,000 projected. Still, President Trump put a positive spin on the numbers tweeting, the economy is great. The only thing adding to uncertainty is the fake news.</p><p>The report would have been worse had the federal government not hired 25,000 people to conduct next year's census. The private sector created only 96,000 jobs, the lowest number since February. The retail sector lost 11,000 jobs as did the transportation sector.</p><p>While unemployment stayed steady at 3.7 percent. Wages grew and more people joined the labor force. Democrats slammed the report in a statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying, the August jobs report offers little comfort in an economy faltering under the Trump administration's reckless agenda to undermine the health, financial security and well-being of the American people.</p><p>The President's Chief Economic Adviser described the report as solid, not spectacular, but Larry Kudlow still found a way to sew a silk purse from the numbers zeroing in on the so-called household survey which found 590,000 more people working in August than in July.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: America is working. America is getting paid well. America is spending and saving and producing. So, I think this is a dynamite report.</p><p>ROBERTS: Analysts saw the jobs report as a sign the economy is slowing. But speaking in Switzerland today, Fed Chairman Jay Powell insisted the U.S. economy is still strong.</p><p>JAY POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: The United States economy has continued to perform well and is in is in a good place. The most likely outlook for our economy remains a favorable one.</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump today kept up the heat on his Fed Chairman again urging him to cut rates in a tweet saying, where did I find this guy Jerome. Oh well you can't win them all.</p><p>The promise of more trade talks with China kept the markets marching forward today. But Powell warning the trade war is having an impact saying the Fed stands ready to add more stimulus to the economy.</p><p>POWELL: I think it is the case that uncertainty around trade policy is causing some companies to hold back now on investment and so, our obligation is to use our tools to support the economy and that's what we'll continue to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Powell also said today that despite trade uncertainties and signs that the global economy is slowing down, he does not see the U.S. economy slipping into a recession. Donald Trump still does not appear to be a fan of the Fed Chairman. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: John Roberts live in the North Lawn. John, thank you. Stocks were mixed today. The Dow gained 69. The S&amp;P 500 was up 3. The NASDAQ lost 14. For the week, the Dow was up 1.5 percentage points. The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ gained one and three quarters.</p><p>The Trump administration is going after California's authority to set its own automobile gas mileage standards. The administration wants to end the 50 year old practice of giving California its own rules and institute a nationwide standard.</p><p>As Correspondent Gillian Turner tells us tonight, California will not go down without a fight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: President Trump has his sights set on rolling back fuel emission standards set by President Obama. More than seven years ago.</p><p>Behind the scenes, the White House has been working with government regulators for weeks on new rules for automakers. They plan to roll out any day now.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We want to make it good for the consumer. In California, they have a standard where the cars are going to have to be much more expensive and won't be as good.</p><p>TURNER: Unhappy about the threat of rollbacks, the state of California recently struck a deal with several major automakers. The state says it's better for the environment and its customers.</p><p>Volkswagen, Honda, BMW and Ford have all pledged to stick to the 2012 Obama requirement to double the fuel economy of new cars and light duty trucks by 2025.</p><p>But today the EPA and Transportation Departments officially put California and the four automakers on notice. In a letter they write this framework agreement appears to be inconsistent with federal law. President Trump's acting budget director agrees saying California is trying to impose its failed policies on the rest of the country by making new cars significantly more expensive and less safe.</p><p>According to automakers the Justice Department has opened an anti-trust probe that experts warn could become a lawsuit.</p><p>MYRON EBELL, COMPETITIVE ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: The Trump administration has tried to restore the rule of law and take away the ability of California to set fuel economy standards for the entire country.</p><p>TURNER: California lawmakers say the Trump proposal guts pollution standards set by President Obama in 2012. The biggest single U.S. policy to reduce planet warming carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>Senator Feinstein saying, I expect the administration's effort like so many other bad ideas will be taken to court and overturned.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: Ford and Honda both say they'll cooperate with the Justice Department's probe. The major car companies have been lobbying President Trump since his first week in office. Now it seems at least some of them are changing their tune. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Gillian, thank you. Tonight, federal health officials are urging people to stop vaping until they figure out why some users are coming down with serious breathing illnesses. Officials say they've identified 450 possible cases in 33 states. At least three people have died so far. They said no single vaping device liquid or ingredient has been tied to all of the illnesses.</p><p>Many of the sickened, but not all were people who say they had been vaping THC, the chemical that gives marijuana it's high.</p><p>The U.S. Navy has relieved three senior leaders of the elite SEAL team seven from their positions. The action follows a decision by the military to bring home a SEAL platoon from Iraq. Fox News reports the platoon members refused to cooperate with investigation into an alleged sexual assault involving unit personnel. There are also allegations of drinking while deployed.</p><p>This is shaping up to be a crucial weekend in Hong Kong. Thousands of protesters are confronting police there as they demand pro-democracy reforms from the Chinese territory. Police are responding with force. Chief Correspondent Jonathan Hunt is in Hong Kong again tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It may be a taste of things to come this weekend. Protesters and police clashing once again Friday night outside a Hong Kong subway station with riot police heavily outnumbered at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets.</p><p>Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam tried this week to draw the sting from the summer long protests by scrapping a much despised extradition Bill. But that appears to have done little to allay the fears of many protesters that the Chinese government is seeking to take tighter control of Hong Kong and break the central promise it made when the territory was handed over by the British in 1997.</p><p>Anson Chan was Hong Kong's Chief Secretary at the time.</p><p>ANSON CHAN, FORMER HONG KONG CHIEF SECRETARY: In minds of many people in Hong Kong, one country two systems at the moment is one country, one and a half system. And if this erosion continues and very soon it will become one country, one system.</p><p>HUNT: The 14 weeks of street protests have done real damage to Hong Kong's economy with spending plummeting this summer according to the city's Retail Management Association and its tourism board.</p><p>Carrie Lam's political supporters say the time has come to stop the economic bleeding.</p><p>BERNARD CHAN, HONG KONG EXECUTIVE COUNCIL: Once we can get back to a dialogue and bring people back to some calmness though hopefully. I think people will come back. Investor will come back. Visitor will come back. So, I'm quite hopeful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: That hope that optimism seems likely to be sorely tested this weekend as protesters plan once again to draw international attention to their calls by trying to shut down Hong Kong's airport, the eighth busiest in the world. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Jonathan Hunt live in Hong Kong early Saturday morning. Jonathan, thank you. Up next, big tech under fire tonight from state governments and deep fake producers. We'll look at the very real challenges ahead.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 2 in San Francisco where a criminal case dealing with the deaths of 36 people trapped in a fire inside a San Francisco Bay Area warehouse nearly three years ago will stretch on. A jury has acquitted one defendant and deadlocked on the other.</p><p>WSVN in Miami, as an American Airlines' mechanic is accused of sabotaging a flight over stalled union contract negotiations. Court documents say Abdul Majid Alani admitted during an interview he tampered with the navigation system on the plane so that he could collect overtime work. As the pilots powered up that plane at Miami International Airport, they saw an error message for a system that tracks speed, nose direction and other critical flight information and they aborted that takeoff.</p><p>And this is a live look at rainy Denver from FOX 31. You can barely make it out. The big story there tonight the state of Colorado asked the Environmental Protection Agency to downgrade the air quality rating of the state's biggest population center. The EPA will consider whether to lower the ozone status of Denver and eight other Northern Colorado counties from moderate to serious that would force the state to work harder to reduce harmful pollution, but also bring tougher and costly regulations for businesses.</p><p>That is tonight's live look outside the Beltway from Special Report. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: The Trump administration is moving to toughen sanctions against Cuba by reducing the amount of money Cuban-Americans can send to family members on the island. The Treasury Department will limit remittances to 1000 dollars per person per quarter. The new rules also no longer allow transfers of money to non-family members.</p><p>We are going to tell you about two big challenges for Big Tech tonight. One involves a group of state attorneys general going after Google and Facebook. The other is an effort to combat a technology that can produce images of people saying and doing things they have never said or done. Chief Intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge is here tonight with details. Good evening, Catherine.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, Bret, and good evening. The deep big challenge is designed to produce technology that can be used by everyone to better detect when artificial intelligence is used to manipulate video by swapping out a face or a mouth to mislead viewers about the content.</p><p>During a recent hearing, lawmakers saw how images can be easily altered. The initiative which includes FacebookMicrosoft as well as academics from major tech institutions is part of a broad effort to combat misinformation campaigns in advance of the 2020 election. This week a senior FBI official said the Bureau learned \"hard lessons from 2016.\" He recognized the need to get ahead of disinformation campaigns as well as closing the gap between government and social media firms.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL ABBATE, FBI ASSOCIATE DEPUTY DIRECTOR: We're pushing information intelligence out to the companies to help them spot bad actors on their platforms and remove them. And they're giving information back to us to inform our efforts, so we can aggressively go out and take action against them and cut them off at the knees.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERRIDGE: The technology is moving so quickly that face swapping videos may soon be eclipsed by deep fake audio which experts say can be made from just 20 minutes of recordings. This summer a leading cybersecurity expert warned of a handful of artificial intelligence cyber-attacks that used voice swapping to impersonate chief executives. Their recordings were used to trick employees into making large wire transfers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF GREENE, SYMANTEC: Idea that someone is going to spoof the voice of your CEO or your boss or the president or whoever. It's pretty frightening and unfortunately, it's not that complicated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERRIDGE: Separately today New York's attorney general announced that eight states both Republican and Democrat as well as the District of Columbia had begun antitrust investigations of Facebook. State regulators are also expected to target Google and make that announcement next week. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Catherine, thank you.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>BAIER: Up next, the first in the nation primary state finally get some love from most of the Democratic presidential contenders.</p><p>First, beyond our borders tonight. Afghanistan's President has postponed a planned visit to Washington early next week where he was to discuss the U.S. Taliban peace talks. That's according to The Associated Press. The decision comes as the Taliban claimed responsibility for a third attack in the provincial capital in Afghanistan in less than a week.</p><p>Events were held in Brazil and abroad Thursday to show support to the Amazon rainforest experiencing an increase this year in the number of fires. In Rio de Janeiro dozens of activists met under the rain in the city center wearing T-shirts. Some of them saying fight for the Amazon. Official data says fires in Brazil are up 59 percent this year.</p><p>And former Zimbabwe leader Robert Mugabe has died in Singapore at the age of 95. The former guerrilla chief took power after independence from white minority rule in 1980, enjoyed strong support among the population and even the West. Soon after taking over as prime minister, but he was reviled in later years as the economy collapsed. And human rights violations increased exponentially. Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: America's election headquarters tonight, New Hampshire is the center of the Democrat's political universe tonight. Most of the top presidential candidates' contenders are there as they prepare for the state party's convention tomorrow. This evening Correspondent Peter Doocy shows us how the frontrunner is taking on the president and the competition.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Amid questions about why he wants to be President.</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'd like to come here and not run.</p><p>DOOCY: Joe Biden continues to make his campaign all about President Trump who he is trying to apply pressure on following a weaker than expected jobs report.</p><p>BIDEN: And we're teetering on a recession. He's becoming more erratic. He inherited a pretty good economy from Barack Obama just like he inherited everything in his life.</p><p>DOOCY: One independent candidate who could have dealt a blow to Biden's bid is bowing out. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz tells supporters \"if I went forward, there is a risk that my name would appear on ballots even if a moderate Democrat wins the nomination. And that is not a risk I am willing to take.\"</p><p>Since Biden is not a self-funding billionaire like Schultz, he's funding his campaign the old fashioned way with checks from wealthy donors. Although one of last night's fundraisers raised questions about whether or not Biden was breaking a promise not to accept money from fossil fuel executives.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Andrew Goldman, the guy who is one of the co-sponsors of the fundraiser hit a company called - he was co-founder of a company called Western LNG. He currently doesn't have day-to-day responsibilities.</p><p>BIDEN: What I was told by my staff is that he did not have any responsibility relating to the company.</p><p>DOOCY: Biden considered canceling but showed up. He insisted last night he won't take a dime from the fossil fuel industry. And he insisted today he won't take a dime of dark money either.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Please, a clear answer. What are you going to do about dark money in politics in 500 words or less?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Number one, take none of it.</p><p>DOOCY: New Hampshire Democrats seem eager to move forward, and they seem to have already moved past the Biden's campaign's early controversies.</p><p>BIDEN: I want to be clear what was said.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- to give me a hug.</p><p>BIDEN: I have permission to give her a hug. That's the greatest honor I've had today.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY: Joe Biden was one of the only people here in New Hampshire tonight on a chilly evening not wearing a jacket. You can see nobody from his staff has given him a jacket yet. And he joked a lot about how he was feeling cold before being eventually confronted by an activist about global warming. Biden went over to shook the young woman's hand. He told her to look into his eyes. And then promised to eliminate all fossil fuels in this country within the next 30 years. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: If you want to turn around and ask him a question or two, we'll hang on.</p><p>DOOCY: Do you have a question, Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Come on SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p>DOOCY: We can try for that if you want to stay here.</p><p>BAIER: We'll let you work that for a little bit. He looks like he's busy. Peter, thank you.</p><p>After a week of setbacks for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, another one today as he tries to pull the United Kingdom out of the European Union. Lawmakers are refusing to support Johnson's call for a new election until he secures a deal to delay the withdrawal. Senior foreign affairs correspondent Amy Kellogg has the latest tonight from London.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As many of that opinion will say \"content.\"</p><p>CROWD: Content.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The contrary not content. The contents have it.</p><p>AMY KELLOGG, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: The last parliamentary hurdle to legislation blocking withdrawal from the E.U. with no deal in place by the end of October. It's due to become law Monday. Prime minister Boris Johnson remains dead set against begging Brussels for more time, and Monday will call yet again for a brand-new election next month. But the opposition as of today is not budging to his demand. They worry Johnson will find a way to thwart them and they will end with a no deal Brexit.</p><p>LIZ SAVILLE ROBERTS, WELSH NATIONALIST PARTY: Boris Johnson is on the run. He's going to start behaving very soon like a rat in a trap.</p><p>KELLOGG: But Johnson, for the second day at events looking like a candidate, this time in Scotland with fishermen and farmers, has thrown this right back at the opposition.</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I think it's the most sensational paradox. Never in history has there been an opposition party that has been given the chance to have an election and has turned it down.</p><p>KELLOGG: But the electioneering hasn't gone unnoticed. The prime minister was chastised by a police chief for using officers as a, quote, \"backdrop\" for a speech yesterday that was supposed to be focused on police recruitment.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KELLOGG: Johnson and his girlfriend will be spending the night with the queen. Prime ministers traditionally pay her a September visit in her castle in Balmoral, Scotland, but this visit will no doubt be one like no other. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: We'll follow it all. Amy Kellogg live in London. Amy, thank you.</p><p>Job gains, China trade talks, and the president going after California. We'll talk about all the economic news with the panel when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: The 130,000 payrolls is a solid number. It's not a spectacular number. I'm just going to say this. America is working. America is getting paid well. America is spending and saving and producing. So I think this is a dynamite report.</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: The Fed has through the course of the year seen fit to lower the expected path of interest rates. That has supported the economy. That's one of the reasons why the outlook is still a favorable one despite these crosswinds they've been facing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Some good news from the Fed chair who has not been receiving the best tweets from the White House and from the president. Meantime, the August jobs report, you heard the descriptions, 130,000 jobs added, lower than economists had predicted. Unemployment rate unchanged in 3.7. That is remaining near a 50-year low, not in these numbers though. Unemployment for African-Americans fell sharply to 5.5 percent in August, hitting its lowest level since recordkeeping began in 1972. Some of that for not seeking jobs or out of the job market, also low unemployment rate for Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The president mentions that on the trail quite a bit.</p><p>The Dow rocky road today, but it also enjoyed for some time the uptick. And the real question, though, for the week, it is up, but what is going to happen with the Fed going forward? And that's what the market watches very closely.</p><p>Let's bring in our panel to talk about the economy, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post,\" and Jason Riley, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Jason, as you look at this jobs report, the situation right now, what do you see?</p><p>JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: It's a mixed bag. I like Larry Kudlow as much as the next guy, but it is a mixed bag. It's not all good news. The employment numbers are strong, wages are growing faster than inflation, but the unemployment rate is a lagging indicator. Something has already changed in the economy, and we know that from other trends that we see. Manufacturing is shrinking for the first time since President Trump was elected. That is a bad sign. Businesses are buying less equipment. Business investment has gone down. And you talk to CEOs, you talk to business leaders, and they cite this trade war. They say it has introduced uncertainty, and now we've got more tariffs coming along that are going to hit earbuds and flat screen televisions and shoes. I think something like 70 percent of shoes in the country are made in China. So people are worried about these global trends, and I think we need to look at this jobs report in that context.</p><p>BAIER: And as you look at the economic changes since the president took office, we put this up often and it changes from time to time, you can see the real GDP growth is ground. But unemployment also down, consumer confidence up as is the average hourly earnings.</p><p>The Fed chair, though, today, Chuck, with some kind of comforting news, even though he didn't really lay the cards out about how the rates changes are going to happen down the road, for those saying that a recession was on the way, he squelched that.</p><p>CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": And he has actually been saying consistently for some time the Fed does not see a recession coming. The report that just came out to me sort of is a stay the course report for the Fed because it wasn't super on jobs, which suggests that they are going to provide another perhaps 25 basis days rate cut, which was priced into the market, so the market was OK with this report.</p><p>I really think that in addition to all the other uncertainty Jason is talking about, another factor is -- we can laugh about them, but these tweets against the Fed that the president keeps putting out. Powell has this delicate roll as any Fed chairman does to stick the statutory mandate of price stability at maximum employment politically independent from the electoral branches of the government. And the more he is under fire from the president, the harder it is for him to maintain the appearance of impartiality.</p><p>BAIER: We've showed on the panel before that this president is not unique in going after the Fed chairman. He just does it on Twitter, that is unique, because he uses Twitter as his printing press to get out the word.</p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": He does. I don't want to go the full Kudlow here, but there are some good things in this report, and I think it's important to look at it. For example, wages are doing quite well. Workforce participation improving. I think the important thing to do is to look at this in the context of all this rather irresponsible talk we have had about a recession lately. In some media circles there was an almost unseemly anticipation of a recession being right around the corner. And it's clearly not the case, and it's not just the Fed chairman who is saying this. It would be amazing the president should say thank you. Thank you, Chairman Powell, that would just blow everybody's mind. But lots of people now are saying it's just not going to happen in this imminent future.</p><p>BAIER: Meantime, there's an effort to change emission standards. The EPA Transportation Department saying to California the framework of this agreement that you're trying to do, essentially make your own standards, appears to be inconsistent with federal law, and it goes on to say that essentially they want to come up with their own deal.</p><p>RILEY: The automakers are complaining about regulatory uncertainty, but I would take that with a grain of salt. The real uncertainty here is the mandate, the government mandates to build cars that people don't want to buy, namely electric cars. And that is causing the uncertainty, and you are getting more expensive cars that people do want to buy with their prices up because carmakers have to, because of the government mandate, make these electric cars that don't sell as well, and they make up their money with profits on cars that people do buy.</p><p>So what I think we do need to do, and what I think the administration is doing here is trying to get rid of some of these regulations so that the automakers can simply meet consumer demand.</p><p>BAIER: So California is pushing back, saying they are going to fight it.</p><p>LANE: Of course they are going to fight it. They've fought President Trump on everything else. But it was interesting because people were wondering how is President Trump going to fight back on this aggressive move by California, sort of cut its own separate deal with these automakers. And his answer was, OK, I will see you and raise you one. I'm going to strip you of this waiver, of this unique authority that you enjoy, and of course we'll see how that plays out in the courts.</p><p>I take it the administration acted because they want to try to get this done before the first term ends and while he's sure who the Supreme Court is going to be. I do think that we are reaching this point in this country where we are compiling a lot of social objectives into the price of an automobile. There is the environmental side, but there's also the president's own objectives on trade. If USMCA goes up, the ITC, the International Trade Commission predicts it will add to the cost of a car. If there were tariffs on Europe which he's threatened about, it might be nice if you'd just leave that all to the market, but that's not how we do things.</p><p>BAIER: I'm going to start with you in the Lightning Round. Next up, Lightning Round, end of sharpie-gate week, yes, Winners and Losers, plus Candidate Casino.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That was the original chart. It was going toward the Gulf. That was what was originally projected.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It looks like it was drawn with a sharpie.</p><p>TRUMP: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.</p><p>ANNE GEARAN, \"WASHINGTON POST\": One White House official told my colleagues there is no one else who could have marked it up that way. There's only one suspect.</p><p>REP. JAMIE RASKIN, (D-MD): This is \"Saturday Night Live\" style cartoonish behavior by the president of the United States.</p><p>CHRIS CHRISTIE, FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: The fight never ends. And so the president feels like he's under siege constantly, so he's never going to stop fighting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And those are the facts.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Sharpie-gate coming to an end because it's Friday. And we have \"The Washington Post\" saying it in fact was the president, citing multiple sources. You have NOAA out with a statement late today that says \"From Wednesday, August 28th, through Monday, September 2nd, the information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to President Trump and the wider public demonstrated that tropical force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama.\" It goes on to say that the Birmingham National Weather Services Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.</p><p>In the meantime, you have the Trump campaign tweeting out an offer for supporters to buy a pen, saying \"Buy the official Trump marker which is different than very other marker on the market because this one has the special ability to drive CNN and the rest of the fake news crazy. Keep Markers Great.\"</p><p>There's where we are. It's Friday. We're back with the panel. Quickly, sharpie-gate.</p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": They're already making money selling plastic straws. This is the dumbest story since the last dumb story we had. The president was right for a little while, then he was wrong to push this. The press made a huge deal of it, and now the president, he may be talking about this for weeks now. I don't know. It astonishes me that he goes day after day after day showing these things.</p><p>BAIER: Chuck?</p><p>LANE: I thought he was crazy to pursue this. I think Chris Christie has his fingers on it. It's just like the crowd at the inauguration. He raised a huge fuss about that even though it seemed wrong. On the other hand, I wouldn't be surprised in the parts of the country where he's very popular this helps him because people see him as embattled unfairly by the media.</p><p>BAIER: I talked to someone the other day who said that President Trump is the Rain Man of trolling the press. In other words, sometimes he backs into it, but then he is there and he trolls to great success.</p><p>RILEY: He's right, and we've known that for a while. We've learned nothing new here. We've learned Trump won't back down from a fight. And we've learned that there is no controversy that is too petty or stupid for the press to harp on if it paints this president in a bad light.</p><p>BAIER: We are going to take a walk down Candidate Casino. It's Friday. Candidate Casino, the Democratic primary, you have $100 in chips, you have to bet. Where is your bat?</p><p>YORK: OK, I put $35 on Elizabeth Warren. I put $30 on Kamala Harris. I am a little bit bearish on Biden, I put $25 on him. And because we are supposed to make things interesting, I put $5 on Michelle Obama, just for the heck of it. And the rest of the field, tells you how much I think they're going to win.</p><p>BAIER: A new table, a new felt, the whole thing. Go ahead, Chuck.</p><p>LANE: This is my first visit to the casino, I'm not really familiar with the house rules. But I put $40 to the frontrunner Joe Biden because I'm a conventional thinker, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and so on. I split $20 between Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg, and I'm hedging my bets with a moderate to be determined if Biden falters, $5.</p><p>RILEY: I have Biden leading and Warren and Sanders close behind. I think Biden is a real leader, but I think he's ahead because Warren and Sanders are splitting that progressive vote. And if one of them backs the other, Biden's lead could disappear very quickly.</p><p>BAIER: How lightning can we be? Winner and Losers, let's go.</p><p>YORK: Amy Klobuchar is the winner who despite have 0.9 percent of the vote in the Real Clear Politics average of polls made it into next week's debate. The loser, Bill de Blasio. We found out that he spent just seven hours at city hall during the entire month. He declared for the president. The question for New Yorkers is, is that a good thing or a bad thing?</p><p>BAIER: That was a little rolling thunder. More lightning.</p><p>LANE: It gives me no joy to declare the Taliban my winner of the week because they are about to get away with murder literally and negotiate a very favorable deal for U.S. troop withdrawal in Afghanistan.</p><p>My loser, no surprise I think, Boris Johnson. He may win this fight for Brexit and the prime ministership in the end, but he lost a series of embarrassing votes in Parliament this week, and his own brother quit his party.</p><p>ROBERTS: My winners are the millions of protestors in Hong Kong who just won't back down. My loser is the CNN town hall on climate change which was not only too long, Bret, but was really more about trying to scare people than it was about trying to enlighten them on what's really a complex issue. That was a real disservice to their viewers.</p><p>BAIER: It was not lightning. But you were, Jason, so you're my winner.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAIER: Thank you, panel. When we come back, \"Notable Quotables.\"</p><p>BAIER: Finally tonight, it is Friday. That means \"Notable Quotables.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There may be a point in time during this storm where if you call 911, they won't be able to get to you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just pray that we can come out of this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean the thousands of bodies out here, man, there's trailers with bodies.

That's going to do it for \"Hala Gorani  Tonight.\"  \"Quest Means Business\" is coming up next.  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  It's an hour until the closing  bell on Wall Street.  The last chance to make your trade.  The Dow, the  good gains of the day have evaporated.  The good news is the losses are  small.  Look at the break apart of the Dow.  You have the Nike at the top,  you have Boeing towards the bottom.  We'll explain why, because let me show  you, the market drivers of the day.  </p><p>CBS is down, Les Moonves is out, the #MeToo Movement hits the C-suite.   Alibaba and Snap lose key executives, all changed, but tech.  And Nike, I  showed you the shares near the top of the Dow, it's controversial campaign  is getting real market results.  Live from the world's financial capital on  a rainy day in New York City.  It's Monday, it's the 10th of September.   I'm Richard Quest.  I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening at a new earlier time, but the same quality program.  It's a  pivotal moment for the #MeToo Movement and for CBS.  The Chief Executive  Les Moonves is leaving the company immediately, pushed out by fresh  accusations of sexual assault.  Moonves is the first Fortune 500 CEO to be  ousted through the #MeToo era.  The controversy isn't over because the  details of Moonves' payout is still to be decided.  CBS shares have  regained some of the early losses.  They are still down for the day, that's  partly because with Moonves gone, the battle for control of CBS has come to  an end.  Our media correspondent Brian Stelter is following it all.  </p><p>BRIAN STELTER, MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Hello.  </p><p>QUEST:  You've worked in the media business throughout all your  professional career, explain.  </p><p>STELTER:  There's never been an earthquake like this.  It is as simple as  that.  We've talked about a lot of #MeToo figures, a lot of men who have  lost their jobs in the past year, but nothing like this, nothing like the  Fortune 500 CEO, who vowed to fight on and stayed in the role for six  weeks, but was eventually forced out this time yesterday.  </p><p>QUEST:  Before we talk about the CBS side of the equation.  When Weinstein  happened and all the #MeToo happened, did Moonves know that - that did you  think that he had this entire smoldering volcano waiting to erupt within  ...  </p><p>STELTER:  You just asked me the most interesting question of this story.  I  believe he did know.  I believe he did know he was vulnerable to this and  that makes me wonder something else, did he go picking a fight inside his  company on purpose?  Did he go trying to fight with his controlling  shareholder, trying to wrest away control of CBS on purpose, to create  another story line?  Because, really, we have seen the merger of two story  lines here, this tug of war, which he lost to Shari Redstone over the  future of CBS, and this #MeToo case.  </p><p>I wonder if ever the actor, ever the Hollywood star, Moonves went out and  tried to make his own story, but no matter what, it ended badly for him.  </p><p>QUEST:  Okay, let's talk about CBS.  They've put $120 million into a  guarantor trust, he would have gotten $140 million, $20 million will go to  charities or to organizations.  But I mean, how does CBS justify not  suspending him and then firing him or reinstating if the allegations are  true?  Why allow him to resign?  </p><p>STELTER:  I think the answer is that you're talking about a board of  directors that was mostly made of up of Moonves' old friends, his pals.  He  was essentially running this board.  It was mostly elderly, mostly white- man board.  That has changed as of Sunday, now there's been a shakeup of  the board, but I think a lot of this had to do with Moonves surrounded by  his friends, believing he could get through this.  </p><p>Eventually, then the law firms came in.  Eventually more women came  forward.  Eventually these negotiations of Redstone continued to progress  and it became in the words of one source, untenable for Moonves to  continue.  </p><p>[15:05:12]  </p><p>STELTER:  But even now, as you said, $120 million still possibly on the  table, incredible development.  </p><p>QUEST:  Okay, on that, let's just look at the national amusements - what's  the agreement?  What is the - have they agreed to do?  </p><p>STELTER:  Everybody agrees to put down the weapons.  Everybody has  surrendered.  </p><p>QUEST:  So what happens?  </p><p>STELTER:  So now CBS, Redstone tightens her control on the company.  This  is the Redstone family.  Sumner Redstone of course, the owner for a couple  of a decades, now her daughter - Shari - is in charge.  Now, going forward,  there's talk about a possible CBS-Viacom recombination.  </p><p>However, I think what's more likely is we're going to see better merge for  CBS and this board has reaffirmed the - the phones are open, the lines are  open, call with your offers.  I would be surprise if a year or two from  now, CBS is not in the hands of either some big tech company or some other  big buyer.  </p><p>QUEST:  Extraordinary developments.  Good to see you.  Thank you, sir.   Good to see you always.  </p><p>STELTER:  Thanks.  </p><p>QUEST:  We're going to continue talking about it.  Les Moonves may be gone,  the question shareholders and activists want the answer to is how much he  should take with him?  As I was just describing, it depends on the outcome  of the investigation into his alleged misconduct.  Now, the full payout  would be $140 million, of which $20 million would go to organizations to  support the #MeToo Movement and Equality for Women in the Workplace.  </p><p>But as we just said, $120 million is in trust.  It would only return to CBS  if  the board decides that Moonves could be fired for cause.  Ronan Farrow  who led the investigative journalism and wrote the original report and the  update just over the weekend tell CNN it was the idea that Moonves would  get  anything at all that prompted more women to come forward.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>RONAN FARROW, CONTRIBUTING WRITER, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  One of the most  important things about this story is, this is the first Fortune 500 CEO to  step down for these reasons in the #MeToo era.  This is someone who was  supposed to be immune to criticism, that many of these are women stayed  quiet about for years because they thought he had complete impunity.  </p><p>So, yes, the reluctance of this Board to act and he has a lot of these  women, that's troubling.  It shows how far we still have to go.  But also,  this is a story of how far we have come because no one thought we would be  here.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Joining me in the C-Suite is Davia Tamin, media reputation  strategist.  The C-Suite is appropriate for us to talk about these events.   Your study and your research shows the number of CEOs or the number of  people accused on what's happened to them.  </p><p>DAVIA TAMIN, MEDIA REPUTATION STRATEGIST:  As of today, it's 700, so Les  Moonves makes 700.  </p><p>QUEST:  Seven hundred people accused?  </p><p>TAMIN:  High profile people accused since Weinstein.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, and what happened to most of them?  </p><p>TAMIN:  Well, most of them have - there was no most.  So, a certain  percentage, about half have left.  About half still remain or they're  continuing to be under investigation.  So it's not clear.  I think the  amount of time that it takes between investigation and final resolution is  shortening now from what it was a year ago.  </p><p>QUEST:  The idea that Les Moonves could walk out the door with more than  $100 million, what would you say?  </p><p>TAMIN:  You know, I don't find that the worst thing in the world.  I think  that he lived a life - I'm not supporting him by any stretch of the  imagination, don't get me wrong.  But he lived according to some rules,  those rules changed somewhere about a year ago, about two years ago now.   And I am most concerned that he is caught and that he sets a precedent now  that others who do this are caught.  It's a game change and it's a culture  change.  </p><p>QUEST:  I agree, and if it was a normal job, and we're talking about  $100,000.00 which for a top executive is not a fortune, that would be fine,  but we're talking about $100 million.  We're talking about life-changing  events.  All right, he's earned similar amounts.  He's earned $20 million  to $30  million for the last 20 years, he's not short of the price of a cup  of tea.  But it's symbolic.  </p><p>TAMIN:  It's symbolic and it's probably - if they find that there is an  investigation that there's real merit to all of this, then it should be.  </p><p>QUEST:  What does it say then that he's been allowed to resign pending an  investigation where the up side is vast and the Board is probably in his  favor?  </p><p>TAMIN:  Well, he's been allowed, he's been made to resign, right?  So he  hasn't been allowed to resign.  </p><p>QUEST:  I'll resign for $100 million.  </p><p>TAMIN:  I would, too, tomorrow.  But I think that ht e point is, he has -  he has lost all the reputational equity that he ever had.  So whatever he  walks away with, he's lost it all.  </p><p>QUEST:  Let's talk on that front.  The #MeToo Movement, at some point,  there will be - when I say cut off, I don't mean a cut off in terms -  because bad behavior, appalling activities, must always - should always be  held to account.  But at some stage, people will say, \"Okay, he did this,  but he shouldn't be fired.\"  </p><p>[15:10:13]  </p><p>TAMIN:  Yes, you know what ...  </p><p>QUEST:  Are not there yet?  </p><p>TAMIN:  No, we are not there yet.  </p><p>QUEST:  And what about Moonves?  </p><p>TAMIN:  No, no.  I know.  We're not there yet for anyone.  We are way far  away from that.  We are so much at the tip of this iceberg.  There is so  much underneath the surface at this point, that there is a long way to go.   And I think Boards know that, I think corporate Boards know that.  I think  that's why they're so fixed on looking at culture now and toxic culture and  all the other stuff because they know what the viability is.  </p><p>QUEST:  What do you think - and this is a sort of a no win question ...  </p><p>TAMIN:  All right.  </p><p>QUEST:   ... for you.  What do you think the right way for a Board - I  mean, at what point is dismissal the answer for events happening 30 years  ago in a different culture?  </p><p>TAMIN:  That's a hard one.  It really is a hard one, but I think that when  they come to light that you have to work on the facts that you get and I  think dismissal is appropriate.  </p><p>QUEST:  Let's talk about Serena, let's listen to what she had to say at the  Open, after she was fined.  She lost and was fined.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SERENA WILLIAMS, PROFESIONAL TENNIS PLAYER:  I'm here fighting for women's  rights and for women's equality and for all kinds of stuff and for me to  say, thief and for him to take a game, it made me feel like it was a sexist  remark.  I mean, like, he's never took a game from a man because they said  thief.  For me, it blows my mind.  </p><p>The fact that I have to go through this is just an example for the next  person that has emotions and that want to express themselves and they want  to be a strong woman and they're going to be allowed to go that because of  today, maybe it didn't work out for me, but it's going to work out for the  next person.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Are you with her on that?  </p><p>TAMIN:  I think that rules have to be equal and I think that responses have  to be equal and I think that's more unconscious bias is what I think, but I  think that the rules haven't been and they won't be for a long time, but  you have to call out what you think is biased, and she's doing it.  </p><p>QUEST:  And it's really maybe not for us to say whether it was or wasn't.   I mean, calling the umpire thief is pretty serious stuff in a competition  of a sport or ...  </p><p>TAMIN:  Well, have others, though, called him thief before?  That is the  question, right?  It's got to be equally applied and it hasn't been for so  long, we don't even know what that looks like anymore.  </p><p>QUEST:  Exactly.  </p><p>TAMIN:  Right?  So we're finding out though because we're finding out by  testing the limits.  </p><p>QUEST:  Great that you came in to help us test them.  Please come back  again.  </p><p>TAMIN:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  A look at the markets.  The Dow is struggling to go  green, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ set to snap a four-day streak and tech shares  bouncing back from a rough week.  </p><p>Actually, you know, I do need to keep reminding myself, and new perhaps,  that we are in - I look at those numbers, and I'm so used to it being after  the closing bell. but it's not.  We are in the last hour of trade, where  the final decisions are made on how the day should end.  And to learn the  Dow may be off just a couple of tootling points today.  There will be  moments where you will truly see the reason and wisdom of why we have come  to you an hour earlier as we consider - continue tonight, no one can  shoulder the responsibilities of chairman and CEO forever, sage words from  Jack Ma.  He has built a $400 million business from his apartment, and now  he's leaving Alibaba.  </p><p>And get your phones ready.  That's mine over there, where is it?  It's over  there.  I'll be asking you to weigh in on Elon Musk's future at Tesla after  he made strange promises and ideas and then smoked a joint on radio.  </p><p>[15:15:00]  </p><p>Something completely different, absolutely new, we have never done anything  like this before and few would be quite so brave, some might say foolish,  but here on international television, you are going to have a say on what  we are doing and it all requires you to get your phone, your tablet, your  computer and whatever electronic device you've got and go to cnn.com/join.   Now, as you'll see here from my phone, this is what you see, well that  might be a little bit tricky for you to see.  So let me show you over here.  </p><p>This is the gist of it.  You're going to see the question and today's  question is Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk is showing and we'll discuss it.  We  will show you the results and the percentages of what people believe.  Now,  the question, and how we're getting to the question, so far, Les Moonves  has been pushed out - that was on top of our program.  Jack Ma is leaving  while on top, so you have two CEOs going in dignity, grace and delight or  not in the case of Moonves, Jack Ma absolutely, he's going in his own  terms.  </p><p>So, let's put it to the Board members.  And you are the Board in this  particular case, what should Elon Musk do?  What should Tesla do with Elon  Musk?  Firstly, they should stay the course with him, stay with it.  He  should resign or be forced to resign, a bit like Moonves and go off with  all of your stock options and your money, and he should be fired, out the  door, out the window because of course of what he did - smoking a joint on  national radio saying, \"I'm going to take the company private,\" and then  not finding he couldn't do it.  Thirdly, all the other weird and wonderful  eccentric, bizarre things.  What should he did?  I'll show you the results.   cnn.com/join.  </p><p>From sporty jock to tech billionaire, Jack Ma's remarkable journey as the  leader of Alibaba is coming to an end.  Next year, he will hand over the  reins to Daniel Zhang - the company's Chief Executive will take over Ma's  position as Chairman.  Investors don't want to see him go.  News of his  retirement on Wall Street put a minor dent into the shares.  </p><p>Ma's departure comes in a turbulent time for Alibaba.  Its stock has lost  around 10% of its value over the year, as China's tech industry grapples  with trade tensions and tighter regulations.  In his native China, Ma has  become a business icon.  Matt Rivers reports on his legacy from Beijing.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>JACK MA, CHAIRMAN, ALIBABA:  No banks would accept it ...  </p><p>MATT RIVERS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Jack Ma, one of China's richest men, a  giant in tech, a man who has stood side by side with presidents, loves  kung-fu novels, always has.  He has a genre called Wu-xia and he says, they  teach valuable lessons.  </p><p>MA:  Whenever you want to be a great people, a great company, you have to  work very hard.  You have to suffer a lot of terrible things -- wraths and  terrible things -- before you be a hero.  It is spiritual.  It is  spiritual.  And think out of box.  You have to think out of box to win.  </p><p>RIVERS:  And win he has.  It's been 19 years since he co-founded, Alibaba  and the company that began in a Hangzou, China apartment has grown into one  of the largest internet companies in the world.  </p><p>[15:20:01]  </p><p>RIVERS:  In 2014, Alibaba $25 billion IPO was then the largest in US  history.  Ant Financial, the company's finance subsidiary has invested  billions of dollars in companies around the globe.  Alibaba's e-commerce  sites have fundamentally changed the way hundreds of millions of people  shop in China and its mobile payment platform revolutionized how people pay  for what they buy.  </p><p>All the while, Ma has arguably become the most public face of China's tech  boom, a charismatic, often inspiring figure for ordinary people; nicknamed  Papa Ma on Chinese internet.  </p><p>Ma has faced his share of criticism of course.  Critics say, his company  nearly copied e-Bay, and thrived only because the Communist Party wanted  it, too.  China's protectionist policies, so the argument goes, ensured  that Alibaba had no real competition making its rise not only easier, but  in some ways inevitable.  </p><p>There is some truth there, but no matter your view, the facts remain.   Alibaba is a juggernaut of a company and its leader is routinely mentioned  in the same sentence as other (inaudible) of tech - think Jobs, or Musk, or  Gates, and like Gates, Ma says life is about more than a job.  </p><p>Can you imagine yourself  sitting back, relaxing?  </p><p>MA:  No.  I have so much education, environment, and going around and  meeting the entrepreneurs, I've done a lot of things.  Life is so fun and  never ever focus on one thing.  We come to this world not to  work.  We  come to this to enjoy life.  This is what I believe.  </p><p>RIVERS:  Ma has said he wants to focus more on philanthropy.  The former  English teacher has always focused on improving education in China, and as  for his company, widely considered to have a deep management pool.  He told  CNN in 2016 that whenever he does step down, it will be in good hands.  </p><p>MA:  Tomorrow is more difficult.  The day after tomorrow is beautiful, but  most people die tomorrow evening.  So we have to realize that good things  can never be achieved easily.  Life is not only about Alibaba.  I have run  my first 100 meters, I should give the base to the next generation.  </p><p>RIVERS:  Matt Rivers, CNN, Beijing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>QUEST:  So, New York University - NYU's marketing profesor, Scott Galloway  is with us.  </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY:  Good to see you, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  At this new earlier hour, Paul La Monica, too.  </p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Thanks.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thanks, too.  Jack Ma is talked of in reverential tones.  He's  leaving Alibaba, even though he hasn't handed it, isn't it the equivalent  of when Gates left Microsoft?  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  That's actually probably the right analogy.  And not only that,  he's leaving.  I mean, typically, the CEOs of large companies like this  give up power with the same (inaudible) and generosity of an African  dictator, so to have a guy say, \"I'm going back at the age of 54 to work on  education.\"  He's ringing the bell at the top of the market, taking a  victory lap.  It's a real credit to the ecosystem and the internet economy  in China because they are now creating enterprise value.  The stock hasn't  taken a hit.  </p><p>Now, this was a good day for China and Jack Ma and Alibaba.  It shows that  this ecosystem is sustainable and for real.  </p><p>QUEST:  And in doing so, Paul La Monica, it shows also that they have put  in place a worthy successor.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, you had a great succession plan here.  Daniel Zhang has  been the CEO for the past couple of years, so having him take over the  executive chairman role makes sense.  Joe Tsai also is a very public face  of the Alibaba - the Vice Chairman.  When you listen to Alibaba earnings  calls and other announcements over the past couple of years, Ma has already  taken a back seat.  </p><p>He is of course the most well known person at this company, but I think a  lot of people on Wall Street already recognize, and around the rest of the  world that there is more to Alibaba than just Jack Ma and as you pointed  out with Microsoft and Bill Gates, it's a company that is still doing quite  well now ...  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, but in the departure, it certainly faltered.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  It faltered a little bit.  </p><p>QUEST:  But there doesn't seem to be a suggestion, and you're right.  With  2%, 3% or whatever it has fallen that you saw in Alibaba is not indicative  of any great concern that the market has.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, this is a jargon item.  What's unusual is, as Americans,  we tend to be - we are narcissists.  We think that the epicenter of all  innovation is within the seven-mile bike ride of SFO International, but if  you look at the product development roadmap of Alibaba -- payments, hail a  car, buy something, incredible advertising ecosystem -- their product road  map, agility, ability to innovate quickly, makes us look tired.  It makes  us look like - I don't want to come up with a company, but he has created  something incredible.  </p><p>QUEST:  Snap - I'm sorry.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  You first.   </p><p>QUEST:  Did I say something I shouldn't have done?  </p><p>[15:25:02]  </p><p>LA MONICA:   God bless you.  It's been a very, very challenging time for  this company.  Arguably, it's one that maybe shouldn't have gone public at  least in this format.  Now, you have the last of the kind of so-called  adult supervision for Evan Spiegel with Imran Khah, a former Wall Street  analyst, now leaving the company.  I think there are a lot of legitimate  concerns about what the strategy is going to be and the fact that people  who buy Snapchat stock, buy everywhere because you get no voting rights.   None.  </p><p>QUEST:  I keep forgetting that.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  So if you think that Evan Spiegel is the next Steve Jobs, he  isn't.  Then, guess what?  By all means, buy that stock, but if you have  any skepticism whatsoever about  his ability to lead Snapchat and not just  create something that Facebook and Instagram will rip off five years later?   Stay away.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  That's true of all these guys.  They all have dual class  shareholder systems.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, but no votes is really ...  </p><p>QUEST:  Yes, Snap was particularly egregious in giving no votes.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  There's a bigger issue at play here and that is Snap is a good  company, very innovative, great product and it's going out of business.   And the reason why, is that we have in our economy let one company  aggregate four the top five apps in the world.  Eighty percent of our time  on this is in app, one company controls it all.  This isn't your phone,  Richard.  This is a delivery vehicle for company called Facebook.  </p><p>It's an invasive species putting all other companies out of business.  Snap  is a walking dead because we've let monopolies run amuck.  Snap is going  away, it's just a  matter of time.  It will be below five bucks a share  within 12 months and it will be picked up by Google or one of the other  guys.  </p><p>QUEST:  And for those viewers who are sort of crying concern, who have  followed closely because I know you've watched very closely.  My Snap  investment, you'll be pleased to know that in today's fall, my Snap shares  are down 66% since I've opened them.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  See, you've got snapped.  You purchased Snap.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>QUEST:  I bought - no, but then I don't use Facebook and a variety of other  things much either.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  But do you use Instagram?  </p><p>QUEST:  Should we move on?  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Twitter?  </p><p>QUEST:  Yes.  Well, sometimes.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Yes, go on - at our age, go on Snap.  You feel like you're going  to slip and break a hip.  It is so focused and so set up on young people  and that its power, but if you look at the user metrics, like every other  app in the world, Facebook is pulling the same move.  They have technology  that goes out, registers - any app in the world is getting traction about  those features.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  My kid - they're not ready for Snap, but they know what  Facebook is.  They have no idea what Snapchat is.  They already know what  Facebook is at nine and five.  They don't know about Snap ...  </p><p>QUEST:  So likely to talk about - don't go too far.  Go on and have a cup  of tea.  Commiserate with me on my Snap stock.  Donald Trump is starting  his economic wins on Twitter.  Unfortunately, one stat that he mentioned  was wrong . It's wrong 62 times, and now, even the White House won't defend  the President on it.  We'll have more after this.  </p><p>[15:30:00]  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:30:00] QUEST:  I'm Richard Quest, there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment.  But I'll ask the chief executive of Norwegian about the  takeover talks surrounding his airline and beyond.  He'll be answering  that.</p><p>And Donald Trump takes his economic posts a step too far on Twitter, we'll  share just how wrong he was.  Before that, this is Cnn, and on this  network, the facts, they always come first.  Hurricane Florence has  intensified and it's now category 4 hurricane as it moves toward the United  States.</p><p>North Carolina's governor is warning people could lose electricity and  utility services for several days once the storm hits.  It's expected to be  one of the strongest hurricanes in a landfall there in some two decades.   Sweden is headed for political uncertainty after both major centrist  coalitions failed to win a majority in Sunday's vote.</p><p>The ruling center-left social democrats and their coalition are leading the  center-right bloc by just a half point -- percentage point.  As for the  Sweden democrats which is a far right party with roots in the neo-Nazi  movement, they are in third place, but did receive nearly a fifth of the  vote.</p><p>Trump(ph) and the UN are warning of catastrophic consequences of a military  offensive in Syria's Idlib province.  The Syrian government says it's  carrying out surgical airstrikes, but has not started a ground assault.   The White Helmet volunteer rescue group reported dozens of the estimate  intense escalations over the weekend.</p><p>President Trump often criticizes the media for not giving him due credit  when it comes to the economy.  So today, he made a boast about his  verifiably false -- and the reason we're going into this in some detail is  because time and again you hear the talk of \"fake news\", \"fake news\".</p><p>Well, today, even the top White House economist admitted the president was  wrong.  Donald Trump -- this is the tweet.  Donald Trump tweeted that GDP  rate 4.2 percent is higher than the unemployment rate report, 9 percent for  the first time in over a 100 years.</p><p>Here's the Fed's data going back to numb too -- I know, 1948, unemployment  in red, GDP in blue.  GDP is higher than unemployment 62 times most  recently in 2006, so it was left to the Chairman of the White House Council  of Economic Advisors to put in perspectives, saying someone must have added  an extra zero by the time the facts got to Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, ECONOMIST &amp; CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS:  What is  true is that, that it's the highest too in 10 years.  And at some point,  somebody probably conveyed it to him adding a zero to that, and they  shouldn't have done that.</p><p>And I can say that at least numbers -- we speak here at the White House are  grateful for -- and when the press finds mistakes that we make, we don't  like making mistakes but we're grateful when they're pointed out because we  want to correct them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Sarah Westwood at the White House -- oh, dear, Sarah, tell me, is  there embarrassment or is this sort of just a feeling of well, that's just  Donald, that's just the president.</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Well, Richard, what we saw today  was a rare acknowledgement of error from an administration official when  Kevin Hassett; the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors came out  and said that President Trump was off by about 90 years when he cited the  time frame in which the GDP has been higher than the unemployment rate.</p><p>President Trump spent a lot of time on Twitter this morning touting  economic growth as part of his struggle to change the conversation away  from the controversy facing his White House.  But as you mentioned, he sort  of created a dust-up of his own when he is getting the numbers so wrong  when it comes to economic growth.</p><p>[15:35:00]  And all of his focus on the economy is coming, we should note  just days after former President Obama claimed that it was him who deserved  credit for this boom that we've seen in the GDP for the drop in the  unemployment rate. </p><p>Kevin Hassett said a large part of his presentation to reporters today just  moments ago at the White House was disproving that claim from Obama,  although Kevin Hassett said that he was not dispatched specifically because  of Obama's comments.</p><p>QUEST:  Sarah Westwood at the White House, thank you.  And the President  Trump's blue-collar workers -- the number of jobs are growing in their best  rate in 130 years according to analysis from the \"Washington Post\".  Now,  this is about goods-producing jobs like mining and construction,  apparently, they are up more than 3 percent in the last year.</p><p>And employment in rural areas and small towns where the great -- recession  from the great recovery has been slow is now getting better.  They're  growing at an annual rate of around 5 percent in the Trump era.  Each day  this week, we'll be taking a look at economic issues facing American voters  as they head to the pivotal midterms, a balance of power in Washington is  at stake.</p><p>Clare Sebastian asked of a strong economy will be enough to deal  Republicans and Donald Trump a victory in November.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We've accomplished an  economic turnaround of historic proportions.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN (voice-over):  If Americans vote with their wallets  this election season, the president has some reason to feel confident.   Economic growth is at a four-year high. </p><p>TRUMP:  These numbers are very sustainable.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Unemployment at half century lows -- </p><p>TRUMP:  We've created 3.7 million jobs since election. </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  And stock market is hitting record.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Donald Trump has created an environment that the  markets really like.  With regulatory reform, again with the tax cuts, so  he does get some credit.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Tax cuts is this administration's signature policy, refueling  strong corporate profits including a record-setting courses for America's  banks.  And yet experts question whether the President's campaign promise  of a tax cut for all has materialized. </p><p>TRUMP:  And we will massively cut taxes for the middle class -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What we saw is we have a non-traditional investment  cycle.  Companies taking that additional cash and reducing debt, buying  back stock, increasing dividends.  The best majority of consumers reported  they did not notice a meaningful change in their after-tax take-home pay  post-tax reform.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Despite the low unemployment, those consumers are also facing  stagnant wage growth and signs of rising prices due to tariffs.  The  president has not only asked voters to trust him on trade. </p><p>TRUMP:  First, and we're going to have to tariff your cars.  They said when  can we show up? When can we be there? Oh, would tomorrow be OK? Oh, folks  stick with us, stick with us.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  He has also provided pockets of short-term relief aimed at the  mostly Republican agricultural states. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The president has promised substantial aid, many  billions of dollars to farmers who are rightly concerned about the story  being tariffs and other action by the Chinese that could hurt the U.S.  middle America.  Whether that's enough is unclear.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  What is clear for the scandal-plagued administration, the  strong U.S. economy sends a powerful political message.</p><p>TRUMP:  Once again, we are the economic envy of the entire world.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  When the president and his party will continue to trumpet.   Clare Sebastian, Cnn, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>QUEST:  The power of this is quite extraordinary.  We're handing some of  that power to you with our question and -- Tesla's chief executive, CEO  Elon Musk should stay the course, resign or be fired? Cnn.com-slash-join,  and we will get your final results in just a moment all for you.</p><p>What should Musk do? What should the board do? When we come back.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  We have about 19 minutes left on the trading day, and the Dow --  just now, the Dow has looked, the Dow -- oh, as you can see, the gains,  though really look nice impressive gains, though we're here at the  beginning, the gain and portended well for the holiday.</p><p>They sort of evaporated and instead we've just bumped along the bottom  throughout the session, and it was the uncertainty over global trade, we  have Donald Trump threatening more tariffs.  </p><p>And so for instance, you heard obviously the comments about Ford and the  Ford car that's not going to be built in the U.S. even though the tariffs  have been -- Apple was hurt and Apple is down one and a third percent, one  of the biggest losers on the Dow so far.</p><p>But Nike is at the top of the Dow, and that's interesting.  Online sales  jumped 30 percent after the ad campaign with Colin Kaepernick.  Scott  Galloway and Paul La Monica are with me.  This is fascinating because Nike  renews the contract with Kaepernick, he can -- and he continues to be a  spokesman, not only that, they make a great big deal about it.</p><p>If you believe what you want, you'll risk everything.</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY STERN  SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  What does it tell us?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Worst business move of 2018, was Google match showing with the  Senate Intelligence Committee hearings, the best business move of 2018 was  Nike choosing Colin Kaepernick as their 30th anniversary spokesperson -- </p><p>QUEST:  Why? </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Because Richard, they just did the math.  Let's break it down,  Nike does 35 billion revenues, 15 billion domestically, 20 billion  internationally, if you're buying $115 pair of flying Air Blazers in the  U.S., I mean through young, an urban dweller, it means you lean  progressive.</p><p>They put $1 to $3 billion at risk domestically, of that $20 billion abroad,  you're a Brit, how many people abroad feel that the U.S. is doing things  really well? That they've got a handle on race relations here.</p><p>They put at risk, $1 to $3 billion of their business to strengthen their  relationship with $32 billion of their business, this was the genius move  of 2018.</p><p>QUEST:  Even though you end up with an edifying sight of people burning  sneakers, Nike sneakers.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT:  Social media is such an  enigma right now.  How much of that was legitimate with people really  taking their $100-plus sneakers and burning them.</p><p>How much of it was fake news if you will? And to your point, China, Chinese  consumers are not going to get all up in arms about Colin Kaepernick taking  a knee during the national anthem.  And China is now after the U.S., pretty  much the most important market for Nike.</p><p>I think it made sense when they did the math both demographically and  geographically, it wasn't a bad marketing move -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right, so let's do -- I'm not being rude when I open my phone.  I  assure you, it's the Tesla question -- </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  The Tesla question in which we are asking.  Should -- what should  the board, what should Elon Musk do? Should he be fired? And he has various  motive, but should they ask him -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  OK -- </p><p>QUEST:  Should they ask him to please go away? Should he resign or should  he just carry on? You're already shaking your head -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, because there's a fourth choice that's not there that I  would vote -- </p><p>QUEST:  Hey! </p><p>LA MONICA:  For, sorry, he shouldn't stay the course, he's got to start  acting like an adult, and he's got to hire a COO -- </p><p>[15:45:00]  QUEST:  That's a given -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  To help him out, just like he has at SpaceX, that doesn't mean  he should be fired or quit, but he shouldn't stay the course either.  He  can't keep doing what he's doing.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  We're the mother of all enablers here, I feel like the tech  innovators collectively -- those of us who are fathers, we have a memo to - - Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Larry Page put down the blond, put on a tie,  show up.  There's -- </p><p>QUEST:  That's not -- that's a recipe for corporate successes. </p><p>GALLOWAY:  But on a tactical corporate -- on a tactical level of some  ministers and corporate boards, there should be a committee of the board  that sits down with them and says if this aberrant reckless behavior  continues, we're going to kick you up with chairman and bring in another  CEO.</p><p>They have -- boards have a responsibility to be the adults in the room,  there's no adult in the room, the board consists of people, he built out a  solar city -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  Right -- </p><p>GALLOWAY:  His brother -- this is really -- this is a failure on corporate  governance.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Is this a problem though that they don't have a CEO? Think of  the worst case scenario.  Mark Zuckerberg starts putting on a hoodie again  and acts like the jerk that they portray him in the social network as,  Sheryl Sandberg could be the new CEO of Facebook, no problem, everything is  fine.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  There's no one at Tesla that can take over on a moment's  notice, they have no bench.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  But that's what the problem is.  Everyone is so afraid to lose  Elon Musk, if I were a board member, I'd say where does Elon Musk go if he  loses Tesla? Is he going to go and be the CEO of Fiat-Chrysler, they need  to have a serious conversation with him.</p><p>QUEST:  Good night to you two for coming here today, good to see you -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  And you -- </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Thank you sir -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much.  The final score on what should Tesla's CEO  do? Seventy three percent of you -- </p><p>(BELL RINGING) </p><p>Stay the course, sorry, Paul La Monica.  After the break, Norwegian takes  aim at Argentina and Asia in a full throttle drive for growth.  The chief  exec says it's time to harvest the results.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Part of being in a recession, the pace starts falling and prices  are rising.  And you might argue it's the worst time in the world for an  airline to introduce new routes in Argentina.  Not so says Norwegian Air  shuttle which is selling cheap and cheerful domestic flights in the country  and that it intends to disrupt the local market.</p><p>The low cost carrier Norwegian is also venturing into Asia, and the  earnings seems to speak for themselves, passenger numbers are growing, the  number of routes and destinations are growing.  The fleet is one of the  youngest in the business.  Now, the company is not making any money, not at  least at the moment.</p><p>[15:50:00]  And certainly the level of debt that it's taken on board is  very high, dangerously so.  Norwegians caught the eye of Carsten Spohr of  Lufthansa and Willie Walsh of IAG.  The chief executive told me, all this  attention is flattering.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BJORN KJOS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NORWEGIAN AIRLINES:  Really, he's by  the way, he's a very smart guy, and ideally it's a very good airline, so  they do a lot of things there.  And I can't -- I can't actually here think  about it.  I would have done the same if I had these issues of emotions,  I'd be angry at them.</p><p>No, he's exactly the guy, and we are on the stock exchange, everybody can  buy somebody at the stock exchange.  So -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right, but as soon as Willie said he was going to with IAG, Carsten  of Lufthansa said I'm in it, I'm in as well.  Are you having talks with  anybody?</p><p>KJOS:  No, we haven't announced anything for sale.  They are coming to us,  but the thing to think about it is, it's better to be pretty shaky than  most.</p><p>QUEST:  It is, but just we're clear, Carsten Spohr of Lufthansa group is  also interested in you, are you interested in doing something with  Lufthansa?</p><p>KJOS:  I cannot say anything about that.  As you know, it's because it's --  what I have to say maybe recorded on the stock exchange.  I can -- my  opinions, about that, both of these airlines are very good airlines.</p><p>QUEST:  The Asia expansion has gone well, the U.S., you've won all the  battles in most of them anyway in terms of recognition.  And you've now got  attention.  What is it you want to do?</p><p>KJOS:  I want to -- I want to give the Argentineans the possibility to fly  on these and fast, and have a good flight and learn maybe to fly longer  maybe with us to Europe.</p><p>QUEST:  But what do you want to do with Norwegian? What do you see as its - - because everywhere you look now, you're being nipped after the heels, the  legacy, the level has come along, Euro wings is now going long, you're  smiling again.  Euro wings is going longer, France is coming along with you  and all the others.</p><p>KJOS:  There will always be others.</p><p>QUEST:  There will always be others.  But they're attacking you on all  sides.</p><p>KJOS:  Not actually, they are -- some routes, but all this have  competitors, it's just about two that you have.  At the end, we got up to  scale and we certainly served so many citizens in U.S. and we have a huge  network in Europe.</p><p>So we are at the level now, we should definitely release our harvesting  now. </p><p>QUEST:  And what will it take though to become profitable?</p><p>KJOS:  Well, we ramped up the long haul this year tremendously, no, they  are -- they're all on the peak now, we can -- no, we can start harvesting.   So we should -- our future as I see it will be bright.</p><p>QUEST:  But it is important for you, I mean you're arguably -- Jeff Bezos  of Amazon has spent the entire history of the company until now taking  losses to build for market share and to build the corner stone that we've  got.  At some point, you're going to have to make money while your  investors and shareholders are going to say, this is not worth -- just in  the low.  </p><p>KJOS:  But then again, out of 17 years we have made money for 15 years, and  I wouldn't have gone into this I didn't think I would -- it would be  profitable.</p><p>QUEST:  Brexit, finally on Brexit.  Now, you're going to tell me that  you'll be fine because of your different subsidiaries.  You're going to  tell me that you've got the U.K. subsidiary which will handle all the U.K.  stuff, and the Irish subsidiary will handle -- and anyway, Norway is part  of the European common area for aviation.</p><p>But you must still be worried.</p><p>KJOS:  Well, actually, we are fit(ph) to the task(ph), the only thing I  don't understand is what are they going to do with all the bilateral  agreements that you used to have, they have to refix(ph) it.  So it's a  huge amount of work they have to go through, but they can do it, I mean,  it's -- </p><p>QUEST:  No, let's take for example your U.K. routes to the U.S.  London  Gatwick is crucial to you -- </p><p>KJOS:  Yes, it is -- </p><p>QUEST:  It's your largest base -- </p><p>KJOS:  Yes, that's right -- </p><p>QUEST:  London Gatwick is crucial to you, the U.S., U.K. flights will have  to be renegotiated.  I'm confident that, yes, that the British and the  Americans will fix it because they need open sky, everybody needs opened  sky, everybody needs the passengers and the two-ways(ph) to really take the  world, that is the most -- well, actually, today, 20 percent of all jobs,  job creation comes from this industry.</p><p>[15:55:00]  You would -- nobody would want to stop that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Five minutes before the close of trade in New York, the -- this is  the scenario, this is the way things look.  In Europe, the markets were all  higher, even the FTSE managed to eat out a very small gain.  The  encouragement came from the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier who claims  the Brexit deal could happen by November.</p><p>The -- no, got 2.3 percent.  The reason for that very simply, the  government now seemingly will respect the EU budget rules or at least it  seems less, and the scenario being it's less likely that there will be a  full blown showdown between the new populist government in Rome and the --  and with Brussels.</p><p>But it's still early days, that's just one day, and that is just Monday.   As to the New York market, a good start to the morning and then it drifted  off and then it completely evaporated into the afternoon, and this is  really -- this is your trade talks, this is your worries, this is your  earnings and all eyes on the things on what is likely to be for the future.</p><p>Very small losses though considering the sort of day, trading is just about  finished, we'll have a profitable moment after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, \"Cbs\", the board of directors  effectively put their fingers on the thumb on the scale when they decided  to let Les Moonves resign, put the money, 120 million into a guarantor's  trust and only after the investigation decide whether he should get that  money or not, will be fired without a penny.</p><p>By doing it that way, they have effectively already tilted the decision  towards him getting something.  Perhaps arguably a far better way would  have been to have suspended him, pending the investigation with no money  put in any form of trust, and then decide whether he goes with the full  amount minus whatever or whether he's allowed to resign because the  allegations don't stand up or he gets fired without a penny.</p><p>At the moment, it would be very difficult for them to do that.  But the  board needs to remember, the world is watching what happens at \"Cbs\".  And  that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York.   Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. </p><p>The closing bell on Wall Street -- </p><p>(BELL RINGING) </p><p>Trading is over.   </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

That's going to do it for \"Hala Gorani  Tonight.\"  \"Quest Means Business\" is coming up next.  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  It's an hour until the closing  bell on Wall Street.  The last chance to make your trade.  The Dow, the  good gains of the day have evaporated.  The good news is the losses are  small.  Look at the break apart of the Dow.  You have the Nike at the top,  you have Boeing towards the bottom.  We'll explain why, because let me show  you, the market drivers of the day.  </p><p>CBS is down, Les Moonves is out, the #MeToo Movement hits the C-suite.   Alibaba and Snap lose key executives, all changed, but tech.  And Nike, I  showed you the shares near the top of the Dow, it's controversial campaign  is getting real market results.  Live from the world's financial capital on  a rainy day in New York City.  It's Monday, it's the 10th of September.   I'm Richard Quest.  I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening at a new earlier time, but the same quality program.  It's a  pivotal moment for the #MeToo Movement and for CBS.  The Chief Executive  Les Moonves is leaving the company immediately, pushed out by fresh  accusations of sexual assault.  Moonves is the first Fortune 500 CEO to be  ousted through the #MeToo era.  The controversy isn't over because the  details of Moonves' payout is still to be decided.  CBS shares have  regained some of the early losses.  They are still down for the day, that's  partly because with Moonves gone, the battle for control of CBS has come to  an end.  Our media correspondent Brian Stelter is following it all.  </p><p>BRIAN STELTER, MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Hello.  </p><p>QUEST:  You've worked in the media business throughout all your  professional career, explain.  </p><p>STELTER:  There's never been an earthquake like this.  It is as simple as  that.  We've talked about a lot of #MeToo figures, a lot of men who have  lost their jobs in the past year, but nothing like this, nothing like the  Fortune 500 CEO, who vowed to fight on and stayed in the role for six  weeks, but was eventually forced out this time yesterday.  </p><p>QUEST:  Before we talk about the CBS side of the equation.  When Weinstein  happened and all the #MeToo happened, did Moonves know that - that did you  think that he had this entire smoldering volcano waiting to erupt within  ...  </p><p>STELTER:  You just asked me the most interesting question of this story.  I  believe he did know.  I believe he did know he was vulnerable to this and  that makes me wonder something else, did he go picking a fight inside his  company on purpose?  Did he go trying to fight with his controlling  shareholder, trying to wrest away control of CBS on purpose, to create  another story line?  Because, really, we have seen the merger of two story  lines here, this tug of war, which he lost to Shari Redstone over the  future of CBS, and this #MeToo case.  </p><p>I wonder if ever the actor, ever the Hollywood star, Moonves went out and  tried to make his own story, but no matter what, it ended badly for him.  </p><p>QUEST:  Okay, let's talk about CBS.  They've put $120 million into a  guarantor trust, he would have gotten $140 million, $20 million will go to  charities or to organizations.  But I mean, how does CBS justify not  suspending him and then firing him or reinstating if the allegations are  true?  Why allow him to resign?  </p><p>STELTER:  I think the answer is that you're talking about a board of  directors that was mostly made of up of Moonves' old friends, his pals.  He  was essentially running this board.  It was mostly elderly, mostly white- man board.  That has changed as of Sunday, now there's been a shakeup of  the board, but I think a lot of this had to do with Moonves surrounded by  his friends, believing he could get through this.  </p><p>Eventually, then the law firms came in.  Eventually more women came  forward.  Eventually these negotiations of Redstone continued to progress  and it became in the words of one source, untenable for Moonves to  continue.  </p><p>[15:05:12]  </p><p>STELTER:  But even now, as you said, $120 million still possibly on the  table, incredible development.  </p><p>QUEST:  Okay, on that, let's just look at the national amusements - what's  the agreement?  What is the - have they agreed to do?  </p><p>STELTER:  Everybody agrees to put down the weapons.  Everybody has  surrendered.  </p><p>QUEST:  So what happens?  </p><p>STELTER:  So now CBS, Redstone tightens her control on the company.  This  is the Redstone family.  Sumner Redstone of course, the owner for a couple  of a decades, now her daughter - Shari - is in charge.  Now, going forward,  there's talk about a possible CBS-Viacom recombination.  </p><p>However, I think what's more likely is we're going to see better merge for  CBS and this board has reaffirmed the - the phones are open, the lines are  open, call with your offers.  I would be surprise if a year or two from  now, CBS is not in the hands of either some big tech company or some other  big buyer.  </p><p>QUEST:  Extraordinary developments.  Good to see you.  Thank you, sir.   Good to see you always.  </p><p>STELTER:  Thanks.  </p><p>QUEST:  We're going to continue talking about it.  Les Moonves may be gone,  the question shareholders and activists want the answer to is how much he  should take with him?  As I was just describing, it depends on the outcome  of the investigation into his alleged misconduct.  Now, the full payout  would be $140 million, of which $20 million would go to organizations to  support the #MeToo Movement and Equality for Women in the Workplace.  </p><p>But as we just said, $120 million is in trust.  It would only return to CBS  if  the board decides that Moonves could be fired for cause.  Ronan Farrow  who led the investigative journalism and wrote the original report and the  update just over the weekend tell CNN it was the idea that Moonves would  get  anything at all that prompted more women to come forward.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>RONAN FARROW, CONTRIBUTING WRITER, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  One of the most  important things about this story is, this is the first Fortune 500 CEO to  step down for these reasons in the #MeToo era.  This is someone who was  supposed to be immune to criticism, that many of these are women stayed  quiet about for years because they thought he had complete impunity.  </p><p>So, yes, the reluctance of this Board to act and he has a lot of these  women, that's troubling.  It shows how far we still have to go.  But also,  this is a story of how far we have come because no one thought we would be  here.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Joining me in the C-Suite is Davia Tamin, media reputation  strategist.  The C-Suite is appropriate for us to talk about these events.   Your study and your research shows the number of CEOs or the number of  people accused on what's happened to them.  </p><p>DAVIA TAMIN, MEDIA REPUTATION STRATEGIST:  As of today, it's 700, so Les  Moonves makes 700.  </p><p>QUEST:  Seven hundred people accused?  </p><p>TAMIN:  High profile people accused since Weinstein.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, and what happened to most of them?  </p><p>TAMIN:  Well, most of them have - there was no most.  So, a certain  percentage, about half have left.  About half still remain or they're  continuing to be under investigation.  So it's not clear.  I think the  amount of time that it takes between investigation and final resolution is  shortening now from what it was a year ago.  </p><p>QUEST:  The idea that Les Moonves could walk out the door with more than  $100 million, what would you say?  </p><p>TAMIN:  You know, I don't find that the worst thing in the world.  I think  that he lived a life - I'm not supporting him by any stretch of the  imagination, don't get me wrong.  But he lived according to some rules,  those rules changed somewhere about a year ago, about two years ago now.   And I am most concerned that he is caught and that he sets a precedent now  that others who do this are caught.  It's a game change and it's a culture  change.  </p><p>QUEST:  I agree, and if it was a normal job, and we're talking about  $100,000.00 which for a top executive is not a fortune, that would be fine,  but we're talking about $100 million.  We're talking about life-changing  events.  All right, he's earned similar amounts.  He's earned $20 million  to $30  million for the last 20 years, he's not short of the price of a cup  of tea.  But it's symbolic.  </p><p>TAMIN:  It's symbolic and it's probably - if they find that there is an  investigation that there's real merit to all of this, then it should be.  </p><p>QUEST:  What does it say then that he's been allowed to resign pending an  investigation where the up side is vast and the Board is probably in his  favor?  </p><p>TAMIN:  Well, he's been allowed, he's been made to resign, right?  So he  hasn't been allowed to resign.  </p><p>QUEST:  I'll resign for $100 million.  </p><p>TAMIN:  I would, too, tomorrow.  But I think that ht e point is, he has -  he has lost all the reputational equity that he ever had.  So whatever he  walks away with, he's lost it all.  </p><p>QUEST:  Let's talk on that front.  The #MeToo Movement, at some point,  there will be - when I say cut off, I don't mean a cut off in terms -  because bad behavior, appalling activities, must always - should always be  held to account.  But at some stage, people will say, \"Okay, he did this,  but he shouldn't be fired.\"  </p><p>[15:10:13]  </p><p>TAMIN:  Yes, you know what ...  </p><p>QUEST:  Are not there yet?  </p><p>TAMIN:  No, we are not there yet.  </p><p>QUEST:  And what about Moonves?  </p><p>TAMIN:  No, no.  I know.  We're not there yet for anyone.  We are way far  away from that.  We are so much at the tip of this iceberg.  There is so  much underneath the surface at this point, that there is a long way to go.   And I think Boards know that, I think corporate Boards know that.  I think  that's why they're so fixed on looking at culture now and toxic culture and  all the other stuff because they know what the viability is.  </p><p>QUEST:  What do you think - and this is a sort of a no win question ...  </p><p>TAMIN:  All right.  </p><p>QUEST:   ... for you.  What do you think the right way for a Board - I  mean, at what point is dismissal the answer for events happening 30 years  ago in a different culture?  </p><p>TAMIN:  That's a hard one.  It really is a hard one, but I think that when  they come to light that you have to work on the facts that you get and I  think dismissal is appropriate.  </p><p>QUEST:  Let's talk about Serena, let's listen to what she had to say at the  Open, after she was fined.  She lost and was fined.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SERENA WILLIAMS, PROFESIONAL TENNIS PLAYER:  I'm here fighting for women's  rights and for women's equality and for all kinds of stuff and for me to  say, thief and for him to take a game, it made me feel like it was a sexist  remark.  I mean, like, he's never took a game from a man because they said  thief.  For me, it blows my mind.  </p><p>The fact that I have to go through this is just an example for the next  person that has emotions and that want to express themselves and they want  to be a strong woman and they're going to be allowed to go that because of  today, maybe it didn't work out for me, but it's going to work out for the  next person.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Are you with her on that?  </p><p>TAMIN:  I think that rules have to be equal and I think that responses have  to be equal and I think that's more unconscious bias is what I think, but I  think that the rules haven't been and they won't be for a long time, but  you have to call out what you think is biased, and she's doing it.  </p><p>QUEST:  And it's really maybe not for us to say whether it was or wasn't.   I mean, calling the umpire thief is pretty serious stuff in a competition  of a sport or ...  </p><p>TAMIN:  Well, have others, though, called him thief before?  That is the  question, right?  It's got to be equally applied and it hasn't been for so  long, we don't even know what that looks like anymore.  </p><p>QUEST:  Exactly.  </p><p>TAMIN:  Right?  So we're finding out though because we're finding out by  testing the limits.  </p><p>QUEST:  Great that you came in to help us test them.  Please come back  again.  </p><p>TAMIN:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  A look at the markets.  The Dow is struggling to go  green, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ set to snap a four-day streak and tech shares  bouncing back from a rough week.  </p><p>Actually, you know, I do need to keep reminding myself, and new perhaps,  that we are in - I look at those numbers, and I'm so used to it being after  the closing bell. but it's not.  We are in the last hour of trade, where  the final decisions are made on how the day should end.  And to learn the  Dow may be off just a couple of tootling points today.  There will be  moments where you will truly see the reason and wisdom of why we have come  to you an hour earlier as we consider - continue tonight, no one can  shoulder the responsibilities of chairman and CEO forever, sage words from  Jack Ma.  He has built a $400 million business from his apartment, and now  he's leaving Alibaba.  </p><p>And get your phones ready.  That's mine over there, where is it?  It's over  there.  I'll be asking you to weigh in on Elon Musk's future at Tesla after  he made strange promises and ideas and then smoked a joint on radio.  </p><p>[15:15:00]  </p><p>Something completely different, absolutely new, we have never done anything  like this before and few would be quite so brave, some might say foolish,  but here on international television, you are going to have a say on what  we are doing and it all requires you to get your phone, your tablet, your  computer and whatever electronic device you've got and go to cnn.com/join.   Now, as you'll see here from my phone, this is what you see, well that  might be a little bit tricky for you to see.  So let me show you over here.  </p><p>This is the gist of it.  You're going to see the question and today's  question is Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk is showing and we'll discuss it.  We  will show you the results and the percentages of what people believe.  Now,  the question, and how we're getting to the question, so far, Les Moonves  has been pushed out - that was on top of our program.  Jack Ma is leaving  while on top, so you have two CEOs going in dignity, grace and delight or  not in the case of Moonves, Jack Ma absolutely, he's going in his own  terms.  </p><p>So, let's put it to the Board members.  And you are the Board in this  particular case, what should Elon Musk do?  What should Tesla do with Elon  Musk?  Firstly, they should stay the course with him, stay with it.  He  should resign or be forced to resign, a bit like Moonves and go off with  all of your stock options and your money, and he should be fired, out the  door, out the window because of course of what he did - smoking a joint on  national radio saying, \"I'm going to take the company private,\" and then  not finding he couldn't do it.  Thirdly, all the other weird and wonderful  eccentric, bizarre things.  What should he did?  I'll show you the results.   cnn.com/join.  </p><p>From sporty jock to tech billionaire, Jack Ma's remarkable journey as the  leader of Alibaba is coming to an end.  Next year, he will hand over the  reins to Daniel Zhang - the company's Chief Executive will take over Ma's  position as Chairman.  Investors don't want to see him go.  News of his  retirement on Wall Street put a minor dent into the shares.  </p><p>Ma's departure comes in a turbulent time for Alibaba.  Its stock has lost  around 10% of its value over the year, as China's tech industry grapples  with trade tensions and tighter regulations.  In his native China, Ma has  become a business icon.  Matt Rivers reports on his legacy from Beijing.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>JACK MA, CHAIRMAN, ALIBABA:  No banks would accept it ...  </p><p>MATT RIVERS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Jack Ma, one of China's richest men, a  giant in tech, a man who has stood side by side with presidents, loves  kung-fu novels, always has.  He has a genre called Wu-xia and he says, they  teach valuable lessons.  </p><p>MA:  Whenever you want to be a great people, a great company, you have to  work very hard.  You have to suffer a lot of terrible things -- wraths and  terrible things -- before you be a hero.  It is spiritual.  It is  spiritual.  And think out of box.  You have to think out of box to win.  </p><p>RIVERS:  And win he has.  It's been 19 years since he co-founded, Alibaba  and the company that began in a Hangzou, China apartment has grown into one  of the largest internet companies in the world.  </p><p>[15:20:01]  </p><p>RIVERS:  In 2014, Alibaba $25 billion IPO was then the largest in US  history.  Ant Financial, the company's finance subsidiary has invested  billions of dollars in companies around the globe.  Alibaba's e-commerce  sites have fundamentally changed the way hundreds of millions of people  shop in China and its mobile payment platform revolutionized how people pay  for what they buy.  </p><p>All the while, Ma has arguably become the most public face of China's tech  boom, a charismatic, often inspiring figure for ordinary people; nicknamed  Papa Ma on Chinese internet.  </p><p>Ma has faced his share of criticism of course.  Critics say, his company  nearly copied e-Bay, and thrived only because the Communist Party wanted  it, too.  China's protectionist policies, so the argument goes, ensured  that Alibaba had no real competition making its rise not only easier, but  in some ways inevitable.  </p><p>There is some truth there, but no matter your view, the facts remain.   Alibaba is a juggernaut of a company and its leader is routinely mentioned  in the same sentence as other (inaudible) of tech - think Jobs, or Musk, or  Gates, and like Gates, Ma says life is about more than a job.  </p><p>Can you imagine yourself  sitting back, relaxing?  </p><p>MA:  No.  I have so much education, environment, and going around and  meeting the entrepreneurs, I've done a lot of things.  Life is so fun and  never ever focus on one thing.  We come to this world not to  work.  We  come to this to enjoy life.  This is what I believe.  </p><p>RIVERS:  Ma has said he wants to focus more on philanthropy.  The former  English teacher has always focused on improving education in China, and as  for his company, widely considered to have a deep management pool.  He told  CNN in 2016 that whenever he does step down, it will be in good hands.  </p><p>MA:  Tomorrow is more difficult.  The day after tomorrow is beautiful, but  most people die tomorrow evening.  So we have to realize that good things  can never be achieved easily.  Life is not only about Alibaba.  I have run  my first 100 meters, I should give the base to the next generation.  </p><p>RIVERS:  Matt Rivers, CNN, Beijing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>QUEST:  So, New York University - NYU's marketing profesor, Scott Galloway  is with us.  </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY:  Good to see you, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  At this new earlier hour, Paul La Monica, too.  </p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Thanks.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thanks, too.  Jack Ma is talked of in reverential tones.  He's  leaving Alibaba, even though he hasn't handed it, isn't it the equivalent  of when Gates left Microsoft?  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  That's actually probably the right analogy.  And not only that,  he's leaving.  I mean, typically, the CEOs of large companies like this  give up power with the same (inaudible) and generosity of an African  dictator, so to have a guy say, \"I'm going back at the age of 54 to work on  education.\"  He's ringing the bell at the top of the market, taking a  victory lap.  It's a real credit to the ecosystem and the internet economy  in China because they are now creating enterprise value.  The stock hasn't  taken a hit.  </p><p>Now, this was a good day for China and Jack Ma and Alibaba.  It shows that  this ecosystem is sustainable and for real.  </p><p>QUEST:  And in doing so, Paul La Monica, it shows also that they have put  in place a worthy successor.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, you had a great succession plan here.  Daniel Zhang has  been the CEO for the past couple of years, so having him take over the  executive chairman role makes sense.  Joe Tsai also is a very public face  of the Alibaba - the Vice Chairman.  When you listen to Alibaba earnings  calls and other announcements over the past couple of years, Ma has already  taken a back seat.  </p><p>He is of course the most well known person at this company, but I think a  lot of people on Wall Street already recognize, and around the rest of the  world that there is more to Alibaba than just Jack Ma and as you pointed  out with Microsoft and Bill Gates, it's a company that is still doing quite  well now ...  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, but in the departure, it certainly faltered.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  It faltered a little bit.  </p><p>QUEST:  But there doesn't seem to be a suggestion, and you're right.  With  2%, 3% or whatever it has fallen that you saw in Alibaba is not indicative  of any great concern that the market has.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, this is a jargon item.  What's unusual is, as Americans,  we tend to be - we are narcissists.  We think that the epicenter of all  innovation is within the seven-mile bike ride of SFO International, but if  you look at the product development roadmap of Alibaba -- payments, hail a  car, buy something, incredible advertising ecosystem -- their product road  map, agility, ability to innovate quickly, makes us look tired.  It makes  us look like - I don't want to come up with a company, but he has created  something incredible.  </p><p>QUEST:  Snap - I'm sorry.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  You first.   </p><p>QUEST:  Did I say something I shouldn't have done?  </p><p>[15:25:02]  </p><p>LA MONICA:   God bless you.  It's been a very, very challenging time for  this company.  Arguably, it's one that maybe shouldn't have gone public at  least in this format.  Now, you have the last of the kind of so-called  adult supervision for Evan Spiegel with Imran Khah, a former Wall Street  analyst, now leaving the company.  I think there are a lot of legitimate  concerns about what the strategy is going to be and the fact that people  who buy Snapchat stock, buy everywhere because you get no voting rights.   None.  </p><p>QUEST:  I keep forgetting that.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  So if you think that Evan Spiegel is the next Steve Jobs, he  isn't.  Then, guess what?  By all means, buy that stock, but if you have  any skepticism whatsoever about  his ability to lead Snapchat and not just  create something that Facebook and Instagram will rip off five years later?   Stay away.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  That's true of all these guys.  They all have dual class  shareholder systems.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, but no votes is really ...  </p><p>QUEST:  Yes, Snap was particularly egregious in giving no votes.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  There's a bigger issue at play here and that is Snap is a good  company, very innovative, great product and it's going out of business.   And the reason why, is that we have in our economy let one company  aggregate four the top five apps in the world.  Eighty percent of our time  on this is in app, one company controls it all.  This isn't your phone,  Richard.  This is a delivery vehicle for company called Facebook.  </p><p>It's an invasive species putting all other companies out of business.  Snap  is a walking dead because we've let monopolies run amuck.  Snap is going  away, it's just a  matter of time.  It will be below five bucks a share  within 12 months and it will be picked up by Google or one of the other  guys.  </p><p>QUEST:  And for those viewers who are sort of crying concern, who have  followed closely because I know you've watched very closely.  My Snap  investment, you'll be pleased to know that in today's fall, my Snap shares  are down 66% since I've opened them.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  See, you've got snapped.  You purchased Snap.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>QUEST:  I bought - no, but then I don't use Facebook and a variety of other  things much either.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  But do you use Instagram?  </p><p>QUEST:  Should we move on?  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Twitter?  </p><p>QUEST:  Yes.  Well, sometimes.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Yes, go on - at our age, go on Snap.  You feel like you're going  to slip and break a hip.  It is so focused and so set up on young people  and that its power, but if you look at the user metrics, like every other  app in the world, Facebook is pulling the same move.  They have technology  that goes out, registers - any app in the world is getting traction about  those features.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  My kid - they're not ready for Snap, but they know what  Facebook is.  They have no idea what Snapchat is.  They already know what  Facebook is at nine and five.  They don't know about Snap ...  </p><p>QUEST:  So likely to talk about - don't go too far.  Go on and have a cup  of tea.  Commiserate with me on my Snap stock.  Donald Trump is starting  his economic wins on Twitter.  Unfortunately, one stat that he mentioned  was wrong . It's wrong 62 times, and now, even the White House won't defend  the President on it.  We'll have more after this.  </p><p>[15:30:00]  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:30:00] QUEST:  I'm Richard Quest, there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment.  But I'll ask the chief executive of Norwegian about the  takeover talks surrounding his airline and beyond.  He'll be answering  that.</p><p>And Donald Trump takes his economic posts a step too far on Twitter, we'll  share just how wrong he was.  Before that, this is Cnn, and on this  network, the facts, they always come first.  Hurricane Florence has  intensified and it's now category 4 hurricane as it moves toward the United  States.</p><p>North Carolina's governor is warning people could lose electricity and  utility services for several days once the storm hits.  It's expected to be  one of the strongest hurricanes in a landfall there in some two decades.   Sweden is headed for political uncertainty after both major centrist  coalitions failed to win a majority in Sunday's vote.</p><p>The ruling center-left social democrats and their coalition are leading the  center-right bloc by just a half point -- percentage point.  As for the  Sweden democrats which is a far right party with roots in the neo-Nazi  movement, they are in third place, but did receive nearly a fifth of the  vote.</p><p>Trump(ph) and the UN are warning of catastrophic consequences of a military  offensive in Syria's Idlib province.  The Syrian government says it's  carrying out surgical airstrikes, but has not started a ground assault.   The White Helmet volunteer rescue group reported dozens of the estimate  intense escalations over the weekend.</p><p>President Trump often criticizes the media for not giving him due credit  when it comes to the economy.  So today, he made a boast about his  verifiably false -- and the reason we're going into this in some detail is  because time and again you hear the talk of \"fake news\", \"fake news\".</p><p>Well, today, even the top White House economist admitted the president was  wrong.  Donald Trump -- this is the tweet.  Donald Trump tweeted that GDP  rate 4.2 percent is higher than the unemployment rate report, 9 percent for  the first time in over a 100 years.</p><p>Here's the Fed's data going back to numb too -- I know, 1948, unemployment  in red, GDP in blue.  GDP is higher than unemployment 62 times most  recently in 2006, so it was left to the Chairman of the White House Council  of Economic Advisors to put in perspectives, saying someone must have added  an extra zero by the time the facts got to Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, ECONOMIST &amp; CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS:  What is  true is that, that it's the highest too in 10 years.  And at some point,  somebody probably conveyed it to him adding a zero to that, and they  shouldn't have done that.</p><p>And I can say that at least numbers -- we speak here at the White House are  grateful for -- and when the press finds mistakes that we make, we don't  like making mistakes but we're grateful when they're pointed out because we  want to correct them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Sarah Westwood at the White House -- oh, dear, Sarah, tell me, is  there embarrassment or is this sort of just a feeling of well, that's just  Donald, that's just the president.</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Well, Richard, what we saw today  was a rare acknowledgement of error from an administration official when  Kevin Hassett; the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors came out  and said that President Trump was off by about 90 years when he cited the  time frame in which the GDP has been higher than the unemployment rate.</p><p>President Trump spent a lot of time on Twitter this morning touting  economic growth as part of his struggle to change the conversation away  from the controversy facing his White House.  But as you mentioned, he sort  of created a dust-up of his own when he is getting the numbers so wrong  when it comes to economic growth.</p><p>[15:35:00]  And all of his focus on the economy is coming, we should note  just days after former President Obama claimed that it was him who deserved  credit for this boom that we've seen in the GDP for the drop in the  unemployment rate. </p><p>Kevin Hassett said a large part of his presentation to reporters today just  moments ago at the White House was disproving that claim from Obama,  although Kevin Hassett said that he was not dispatched specifically because  of Obama's comments.</p><p>QUEST:  Sarah Westwood at the White House, thank you.  And the President  Trump's blue-collar workers -- the number of jobs are growing in their best  rate in 130 years according to analysis from the \"Washington Post\".  Now,  this is about goods-producing jobs like mining and construction,  apparently, they are up more than 3 percent in the last year.</p><p>And employment in rural areas and small towns where the great -- recession  from the great recovery has been slow is now getting better.  They're  growing at an annual rate of around 5 percent in the Trump era.  Each day  this week, we'll be taking a look at economic issues facing American voters  as they head to the pivotal midterms, a balance of power in Washington is  at stake.</p><p>Clare Sebastian asked of a strong economy will be enough to deal  Republicans and Donald Trump a victory in November.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We've accomplished an  economic turnaround of historic proportions.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN (voice-over):  If Americans vote with their wallets  this election season, the president has some reason to feel confident.   Economic growth is at a four-year high. </p><p>TRUMP:  These numbers are very sustainable.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Unemployment at half century lows -- </p><p>TRUMP:  We've created 3.7 million jobs since election. </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  And stock market is hitting record.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Donald Trump has created an environment that the  markets really like.  With regulatory reform, again with the tax cuts, so  he does get some credit.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Tax cuts is this administration's signature policy, refueling  strong corporate profits including a record-setting courses for America's  banks.  And yet experts question whether the President's campaign promise  of a tax cut for all has materialized. </p><p>TRUMP:  And we will massively cut taxes for the middle class -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What we saw is we have a non-traditional investment  cycle.  Companies taking that additional cash and reducing debt, buying  back stock, increasing dividends.  The best majority of consumers reported  they did not notice a meaningful change in their after-tax take-home pay  post-tax reform.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Despite the low unemployment, those consumers are also facing  stagnant wage growth and signs of rising prices due to tariffs.  The  president has not only asked voters to trust him on trade. </p><p>TRUMP:  First, and we're going to have to tariff your cars.  They said when  can we show up? When can we be there? Oh, would tomorrow be OK? Oh, folks  stick with us, stick with us.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  He has also provided pockets of short-term relief aimed at the  mostly Republican agricultural states. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The president has promised substantial aid, many  billions of dollars to farmers who are rightly concerned about the story  being tariffs and other action by the Chinese that could hurt the U.S.  middle America.  Whether that's enough is unclear.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  What is clear for the scandal-plagued administration, the  strong U.S. economy sends a powerful political message.</p><p>TRUMP:  Once again, we are the economic envy of the entire world.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  When the president and his party will continue to trumpet.   Clare Sebastian, Cnn, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>QUEST:  The power of this is quite extraordinary.  We're handing some of  that power to you with our question and -- Tesla's chief executive, CEO  Elon Musk should stay the course, resign or be fired? Cnn.com-slash-join,  and we will get your final results in just a moment all for you.</p><p>What should Musk do? What should the board do? When we come back.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  We have about 19 minutes left on the trading day, and the Dow --  just now, the Dow has looked, the Dow -- oh, as you can see, the gains,  though really look nice impressive gains, though we're here at the  beginning, the gain and portended well for the holiday.</p><p>They sort of evaporated and instead we've just bumped along the bottom  throughout the session, and it was the uncertainty over global trade, we  have Donald Trump threatening more tariffs.  </p><p>And so for instance, you heard obviously the comments about Ford and the  Ford car that's not going to be built in the U.S. even though the tariffs  have been -- Apple was hurt and Apple is down one and a third percent, one  of the biggest losers on the Dow so far.</p><p>But Nike is at the top of the Dow, and that's interesting.  Online sales  jumped 30 percent after the ad campaign with Colin Kaepernick.  Scott  Galloway and Paul La Monica are with me.  This is fascinating because Nike  renews the contract with Kaepernick, he can -- and he continues to be a  spokesman, not only that, they make a great big deal about it.</p><p>If you believe what you want, you'll risk everything.</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY STERN  SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  What does it tell us?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Worst business move of 2018, was Google match showing with the  Senate Intelligence Committee hearings, the best business move of 2018 was  Nike choosing Colin Kaepernick as their 30th anniversary spokesperson -- </p><p>QUEST:  Why? </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Because Richard, they just did the math.  Let's break it down,  Nike does 35 billion revenues, 15 billion domestically, 20 billion  internationally, if you're buying $115 pair of flying Air Blazers in the  U.S., I mean through young, an urban dweller, it means you lean  progressive.</p><p>They put $1 to $3 billion at risk domestically, of that $20 billion abroad,  you're a Brit, how many people abroad feel that the U.S. is doing things  really well? That they've got a handle on race relations here.</p><p>They put at risk, $1 to $3 billion of their business to strengthen their  relationship with $32 billion of their business, this was the genius move  of 2018.</p><p>QUEST:  Even though you end up with an edifying sight of people burning  sneakers, Nike sneakers.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT:  Social media is such an  enigma right now.  How much of that was legitimate with people really  taking their $100-plus sneakers and burning them.</p><p>How much of it was fake news if you will? And to your point, China, Chinese  consumers are not going to get all up in arms about Colin Kaepernick taking  a knee during the national anthem.  And China is now after the U.S., pretty  much the most important market for Nike.</p><p>I think it made sense when they did the math both demographically and  geographically, it wasn't a bad marketing move -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right, so let's do -- I'm not being rude when I open my phone.  I  assure you, it's the Tesla question -- </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  The Tesla question in which we are asking.  Should -- what should  the board, what should Elon Musk do? Should he be fired? And he has various  motive, but should they ask him -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  OK -- </p><p>QUEST:  Should they ask him to please go away? Should he resign or should  he just carry on? You're already shaking your head -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, because there's a fourth choice that's not there that I  would vote -- </p><p>QUEST:  Hey! </p><p>LA MONICA:  For, sorry, he shouldn't stay the course, he's got to start  acting like an adult, and he's got to hire a COO -- </p><p>[15:45:00]  QUEST:  That's a given -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  To help him out, just like he has at SpaceX, that doesn't mean  he should be fired or quit, but he shouldn't stay the course either.  He  can't keep doing what he's doing.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  We're the mother of all enablers here, I feel like the tech  innovators collectively -- those of us who are fathers, we have a memo to - - Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Larry Page put down the blond, put on a tie,  show up.  There's -- </p><p>QUEST:  That's not -- that's a recipe for corporate successes. </p><p>GALLOWAY:  But on a tactical corporate -- on a tactical level of some  ministers and corporate boards, there should be a committee of the board  that sits down with them and says if this aberrant reckless behavior  continues, we're going to kick you up with chairman and bring in another  CEO.</p><p>They have -- boards have a responsibility to be the adults in the room,  there's no adult in the room, the board consists of people, he built out a  solar city -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  Right -- </p><p>GALLOWAY:  His brother -- this is really -- this is a failure on corporate  governance.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Is this a problem though that they don't have a CEO? Think of  the worst case scenario.  Mark Zuckerberg starts putting on a hoodie again  and acts like the jerk that they portray him in the social network as,  Sheryl Sandberg could be the new CEO of Facebook, no problem, everything is  fine.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  There's no one at Tesla that can take over on a moment's  notice, they have no bench.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  But that's what the problem is.  Everyone is so afraid to lose  Elon Musk, if I were a board member, I'd say where does Elon Musk go if he  loses Tesla? Is he going to go and be the CEO of Fiat-Chrysler, they need  to have a serious conversation with him.</p><p>QUEST:  Good night to you two for coming here today, good to see you -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  And you -- </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Thank you sir -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much.  The final score on what should Tesla's CEO  do? Seventy three percent of you -- </p><p>(BELL RINGING) </p><p>Stay the course, sorry, Paul La Monica.  After the break, Norwegian takes  aim at Argentina and Asia in a full throttle drive for growth.  The chief  exec says it's time to harvest the results.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Part of being in a recession, the pace starts falling and prices  are rising.  And you might argue it's the worst time in the world for an  airline to introduce new routes in Argentina.  Not so says Norwegian Air  shuttle which is selling cheap and cheerful domestic flights in the country  and that it intends to disrupt the local market.</p><p>The low cost carrier Norwegian is also venturing into Asia, and the  earnings seems to speak for themselves, passenger numbers are growing, the  number of routes and destinations are growing.  The fleet is one of the  youngest in the business.  Now, the company is not making any money, not at  least at the moment.</p><p>[15:50:00]  And certainly the level of debt that it's taken on board is  very high, dangerously so.  Norwegians caught the eye of Carsten Spohr of  Lufthansa and Willie Walsh of IAG.  The chief executive told me, all this  attention is flattering.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BJORN KJOS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NORWEGIAN AIRLINES:  Really, he's by  the way, he's a very smart guy, and ideally it's a very good airline, so  they do a lot of things there.  And I can't -- I can't actually here think  about it.  I would have done the same if I had these issues of emotions,  I'd be angry at them.</p><p>No, he's exactly the guy, and we are on the stock exchange, everybody can  buy somebody at the stock exchange.  So -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right, but as soon as Willie said he was going to with IAG, Carsten  of Lufthansa said I'm in it, I'm in as well.  Are you having talks with  anybody?</p><p>KJOS:  No, we haven't announced anything for sale.  They are coming to us,  but the thing to think about it is, it's better to be pretty shaky than  most.</p><p>QUEST:  It is, but just we're clear, Carsten Spohr of Lufthansa group is  also interested in you, are you interested in doing something with  Lufthansa?</p><p>KJOS:  I cannot say anything about that.  As you know, it's because it's --  what I have to say maybe recorded on the stock exchange.  I can -- my  opinions, about that, both of these airlines are very good airlines.</p><p>QUEST:  The Asia expansion has gone well, the U.S., you've won all the  battles in most of them anyway in terms of recognition.  And you've now got  attention.  What is it you want to do?</p><p>KJOS:  I want to -- I want to give the Argentineans the possibility to fly  on these and fast, and have a good flight and learn maybe to fly longer  maybe with us to Europe.</p><p>QUEST:  But what do you want to do with Norwegian? What do you see as its - - because everywhere you look now, you're being nipped after the heels, the  legacy, the level has come along, Euro wings is now going long, you're  smiling again.  Euro wings is going longer, France is coming along with you  and all the others.</p><p>KJOS:  There will always be others.</p><p>QUEST:  There will always be others.  But they're attacking you on all  sides.</p><p>KJOS:  Not actually, they are -- some routes, but all this have  competitors, it's just about two that you have.  At the end, we got up to  scale and we certainly served so many citizens in U.S. and we have a huge  network in Europe.</p><p>So we are at the level now, we should definitely release our harvesting  now. </p><p>QUEST:  And what will it take though to become profitable?</p><p>KJOS:  Well, we ramped up the long haul this year tremendously, no, they  are -- they're all on the peak now, we can -- no, we can start harvesting.   So we should -- our future as I see it will be bright.</p><p>QUEST:  But it is important for you, I mean you're arguably -- Jeff Bezos  of Amazon has spent the entire history of the company until now taking  losses to build for market share and to build the corner stone that we've  got.  At some point, you're going to have to make money while your  investors and shareholders are going to say, this is not worth -- just in  the low.  </p><p>KJOS:  But then again, out of 17 years we have made money for 15 years, and  I wouldn't have gone into this I didn't think I would -- it would be  profitable.</p><p>QUEST:  Brexit, finally on Brexit.  Now, you're going to tell me that  you'll be fine because of your different subsidiaries.  You're going to  tell me that you've got the U.K. subsidiary which will handle all the U.K.  stuff, and the Irish subsidiary will handle -- and anyway, Norway is part  of the European common area for aviation.</p><p>But you must still be worried.</p><p>KJOS:  Well, actually, we are fit(ph) to the task(ph), the only thing I  don't understand is what are they going to do with all the bilateral  agreements that you used to have, they have to refix(ph) it.  So it's a  huge amount of work they have to go through, but they can do it, I mean,  it's -- </p><p>QUEST:  No, let's take for example your U.K. routes to the U.S.  London  Gatwick is crucial to you -- </p><p>KJOS:  Yes, it is -- </p><p>QUEST:  It's your largest base -- </p><p>KJOS:  Yes, that's right -- </p><p>QUEST:  London Gatwick is crucial to you, the U.S., U.K. flights will have  to be renegotiated.  I'm confident that, yes, that the British and the  Americans will fix it because they need open sky, everybody needs opened  sky, everybody needs the passengers and the two-ways(ph) to really take the  world, that is the most -- well, actually, today, 20 percent of all jobs,  job creation comes from this industry.</p><p>[15:55:00]  You would -- nobody would want to stop that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Five minutes before the close of trade in New York, the -- this is  the scenario, this is the way things look.  In Europe, the markets were all  higher, even the FTSE managed to eat out a very small gain.  The  encouragement came from the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier who claims  the Brexit deal could happen by November.</p><p>The -- no, got 2.3 percent.  The reason for that very simply, the  government now seemingly will respect the EU budget rules or at least it  seems less, and the scenario being it's less likely that there will be a  full blown showdown between the new populist government in Rome and the --  and with Brussels.</p><p>But it's still early days, that's just one day, and that is just Monday.   As to the New York market, a good start to the morning and then it drifted  off and then it completely evaporated into the afternoon, and this is  really -- this is your trade talks, this is your worries, this is your  earnings and all eyes on the things on what is likely to be for the future.</p><p>Very small losses though considering the sort of day, trading is just about  finished, we'll have a profitable moment after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, \"Cbs\", the board of directors  effectively put their fingers on the thumb on the scale when they decided  to let Les Moonves resign, put the money, 120 million into a guarantor's  trust and only after the investigation decide whether he should get that  money or not, will be fired without a penny.</p><p>By doing it that way, they have effectively already tilted the decision  towards him getting something.  Perhaps arguably a far better way would  have been to have suspended him, pending the investigation with no money  put in any form of trust, and then decide whether he goes with the full  amount minus whatever or whether he's allowed to resign because the  allegations don't stand up or he gets fired without a penny.</p><p>At the moment, it would be very difficult for them to do that.  But the  board needs to remember, the world is watching what happens at \"Cbs\".  And  that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York.   Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. </p><p>The closing bell on Wall Street -- </p><p>(BELL RINGING) </p><p>Trading is over.   </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

That's going to do it for \"Hala Gorani  Tonight.\"  \"Quest Means Business\" is coming up next.  </p><p> RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  It's an hour until the closing  bell on Wall Street.  The last chance to make your trade.  The Dow, the  good gains of the day have evaporated.  The good news is the losses are  small.  Look at the break apart of the Dow.  You have the Nike at the top,  you have Boeing towards the bottom.  We'll explain why, because let me show  you, the market drivers of the day.  </p><p> CBS is down, Les Moonves is out, the #MeToo Movement hits the C-suite.   Alibaba and Snap lose key executives, all changed, but tech.  And Nike, I  showed you the shares near the top of the Dow, it's controversial campaign  is getting real market results.  Live from the world's financial capital on  a rainy day in New York City.  It's Monday, it's the 10th of September.   I'm Richard Quest.  I mean business.  </p><p> Good evening at a new earlier time, but the same quality program.  It's a  pivotal moment for the #MeToo Movement and for CBS.  The Chief Executive  Les Moonves is leaving the company immediately, pushed out by fresh  accusations of sexual assault.  Moonves is the first Fortune 500 CEO to be  ousted through the #MeToo era.  The controversy isn't over because the  details of Moonves' payout is still to be decided.  CBS shares have  regained some of the early losses.  They are still down for the day, that's  partly because with Moonves gone, the battle for control of CBS has come to  an end.  Our media correspondent Brian Stelter is following it all.  </p><p> BRIAN STELTER, MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Hello.  </p><p> QUEST:  You've worked in the media business throughout all your  professional career, explain.  </p><p> STELTER:  There's never been an earthquake like this.  It is as simple as  that.  We've talked about a lot of #MeToo figures, a lot of men who have  lost their jobs in the past year, but nothing like this, nothing like the  Fortune 500 CEO, who vowed to fight on and stayed in the role for six  weeks, but was eventually forced out this time yesterday.  </p><p> QUEST:  Before we talk about the CBS side of the equation.  When Weinstein  happened and all the #MeToo happened, did Moonves know that - that did you  think that he had this entire smoldering volcano waiting to erupt within  ...  </p><p> STELTER:  You just asked me the most interesting question of this story.  I  believe he did know.  I believe he did know he was vulnerable to this and  that makes me wonder something else, did he go picking a fight inside his  company on purpose?  Did he go trying to fight with his controlling  shareholder, trying to wrest away control of CBS on purpose, to create  another story line?  Because, really, we have seen the merger of two story  lines here, this tug of war, which he lost to Shari Redstone over the  future of CBS, and this #MeToo case.  </p><p> I wonder if ever the actor, ever the Hollywood star, Moonves went out and  tried to make his own story, but no matter what, it ended badly for him.  </p><p> QUEST:  Okay, let's talk about CBS.  They've put $120 million into a  guarantor trust, he would have gotten $140 million, $20 million will go to  charities or to organizations.  But I mean, how does CBS justify not  suspending him and then firing him or reinstating if the allegations are  true?  Why allow him to resign?  </p><p> STELTER:  I think the answer is that you're talking about a board of  directors that was mostly made of up of Moonves' old friends, his pals.  He  was essentially running this board.  It was mostly elderly, mostly white- man board.  That has changed as of Sunday, now there's been a shakeup of  the board, but I think a lot of this had to do with Moonves surrounded by  his friends, believing he could get through this.  </p><p> Eventually, then the law firms came in.  Eventually more women came  forward.  Eventually these negotiations of Redstone continued to progress  and it became in the words of one source, untenable for Moonves to  continue.  </p><p> [15:05:12]  </p><p> STELTER:  But even now, as you said, $120 million still possibly on the  table, incredible development.  </p><p> QUEST:  Okay, on that, let's just look at the national amusements - what's  the agreement?  What is the - have they agreed to do?  </p><p> STELTER:  Everybody agrees to put down the weapons.  Everybody has  surrendered.  </p><p> QUEST:  So what happens?  </p><p> STELTER:  So now CBS, Redstone tightens her control on the company.  This  is the Redstone family.  Sumner Redstone of course, the owner for a couple  of a decades, now her daughter - Shari - is in charge.  Now, going forward,  there's talk about a possible CBS-Viacom recombination.  </p><p> However, I think what's more likely is we're going to see better merge for  CBS and this board has reaffirmed the - the phones are open, the lines are  open, call with your offers.  I would be surprise if a year or two from  now, CBS is not in the hands of either some big tech company or some other  big buyer.  </p><p> QUEST:  Extraordinary developments.  Good to see you.  Thank you, sir.   Good to see you always.  </p><p> STELTER:  Thanks.  </p><p> QUEST:  We're going to continue talking about it.  Les Moonves may be gone,  the question shareholders and activists want the answer to is how much he  should take with him?  As I was just describing, it depends on the outcome  of the investigation into his alleged misconduct.  Now, the full payout  would be $140 million, of which $20 million would go to organizations to  support the #MeToo Movement and Equality for Women in the Workplace.  </p><p> But as we just said, $120 million is in trust.  It would only return to CBS  if  the board decides that Moonves could be fired for cause.  Ronan Farrow  who led the investigative journalism and wrote the original report and the  update just over the weekend tell CNN it was the idea that Moonves would  get  anything at all that prompted more women to come forward.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> RONAN FARROW, CONTRIBUTING WRITER, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  One of the most  important things about this story is, this is the first Fortune 500 CEO to  step down for these reasons in the #MeToo era.  This is someone who was  supposed to be immune to criticism, that many of these are women stayed  quiet about for years because they thought he had complete impunity.  </p><p> So, yes, the reluctance of this Board to act and he has a lot of these  women, that's troubling.  It shows how far we still have to go.  But also,  this is a story of how far we have come because no one thought we would be  here.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Joining me in the C-Suite is Davia Tamin, media reputation  strategist.  The C-Suite is appropriate for us to talk about these events.   Your study and your research shows the number of CEOs or the number of  people accused on what's happened to them.  </p><p> DAVIA TAMIN, MEDIA REPUTATION STRATEGIST:  As of today, it's 700, so Les  Moonves makes 700.  </p><p> QUEST:  Seven hundred people accused?  </p><p> TAMIN:  High profile people accused since Weinstein.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, and what happened to most of them?  </p><p> TAMIN:  Well, most of them have - there was no most.  So, a certain  percentage, about half have left.  About half still remain or they're  continuing to be under investigation.  So it's not clear.  I think the  amount of time that it takes between investigation and final resolution is  shortening now from what it was a year ago.  </p><p> QUEST:  The idea that Les Moonves could walk out the door with more than  $100 million, what would you say?  </p><p> TAMIN:  You know, I don't find that the worst thing in the world.  I think  that he lived a life - I'm not supporting him by any stretch of the  imagination, don't get me wrong.  But he lived according to some rules,  those rules changed somewhere about a year ago, about two years ago now.   And I am most concerned that he is caught and that he sets a precedent now  that others who do this are caught.  It's a game change and it's a culture  change.  </p><p> QUEST:  I agree, and if it was a normal job, and we're talking about  $100,000.00 which for a top executive is not a fortune, that would be fine,  but we're talking about $100 million.  We're talking about life-changing  events.  All right, he's earned similar amounts.  He's earned $20 million  to $30  million for the last 20 years, he's not short of the price of a cup  of tea.  But it's symbolic.  </p><p> TAMIN:  It's symbolic and it's probably - if they find that there is an  investigation that there's real merit to all of this, then it should be.  </p><p> QUEST:  What does it say then that he's been allowed to resign pending an  investigation where the up side is vast and the Board is probably in his  favor?  </p><p> TAMIN:  Well, he's been allowed, he's been made to resign, right?  So he  hasn't been allowed to resign.  </p><p> QUEST:  I'll resign for $100 million.  </p><p> TAMIN:  I would, too, tomorrow.  But I think that ht e point is, he has -  he has lost all the reputational equity that he ever had.  So whatever he  walks away with, he's lost it all.  </p><p> QUEST:  Let's talk on that front.  The #MeToo Movement, at some point,  there will be - when I say cut off, I don't mean a cut off in terms -  because bad behavior, appalling activities, must always - should always be  held to account.  But at some stage, people will say, \"Okay, he did this,  but he shouldn't be fired.\"  </p><p> [15:10:13]  </p><p> TAMIN:  Yes, you know what ...  </p><p> QUEST:  Are not there yet?  </p><p> TAMIN:  No, we are not there yet.  </p><p> QUEST:  And what about Moonves?  </p><p> TAMIN:  No, no.  I know.  We're not there yet for anyone.  We are way far  away from that.  We are so much at the tip of this iceberg.  There is so  much underneath the surface at this point, that there is a long way to go.   And I think Boards know that, I think corporate Boards know that.  I think  that's why they're so fixed on looking at culture now and toxic culture and  all the other stuff because they know what the viability is.  </p><p> QUEST:  What do you think - and this is a sort of a no win question ...  </p><p> TAMIN:  All right.  </p><p> QUEST:   ... for you.  What do you think the right way for a Board - I  mean, at what point is dismissal the answer for events happening 30 years  ago in a different culture?  </p><p> TAMIN:  That's a hard one.  It really is a hard one, but I think that when  they come to light that you have to work on the facts that you get and I  think dismissal is appropriate.  </p><p> QUEST:  Let's talk about Serena, let's listen to what she had to say at the  Open, after she was fined.  She lost and was fined.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SERENA WILLIAMS, PROFESIONAL TENNIS PLAYER:  I'm here fighting for women's  rights and for women's equality and for all kinds of stuff and for me to  say, thief and for him to take a game, it made me feel like it was a sexist  remark.  I mean, like, he's never took a game from a man because they said  thief.  For me, it blows my mind.  </p><p> The fact that I have to go through this is just an example for the next  person that has emotions and that want to express themselves and they want  to be a strong woman and they're going to be allowed to go that because of  today, maybe it didn't work out for me, but it's going to work out for the  next person.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Are you with her on that?  </p><p> TAMIN:  I think that rules have to be equal and I think that responses have  to be equal and I think that's more unconscious bias is what I think, but I  think that the rules haven't been and they won't be for a long time, but  you have to call out what you think is biased, and she's doing it.  </p><p> QUEST:  And it's really maybe not for us to say whether it was or wasn't.   I mean, calling the umpire thief is pretty serious stuff in a competition  of a sport or ...  </p><p> TAMIN:  Well, have others, though, called him thief before?  That is the  question, right?  It's got to be equally applied and it hasn't been for so  long, we don't even know what that looks like anymore.  </p><p> QUEST:  Exactly.  </p><p> TAMIN:  Right?  So we're finding out though because we're finding out by  testing the limits.  </p><p> QUEST:  Great that you came in to help us test them.  Please come back  again.  </p><p> TAMIN:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you.  A look at the markets.  The Dow is struggling to go  green, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ set to snap a four-day streak and tech shares  bouncing back from a rough week.  </p><p> Actually, you know, I do need to keep reminding myself, and new perhaps,  that we are in - I look at those numbers, and I'm so used to it being after  the closing bell. but it's not.  We are in the last hour of trade, where  the final decisions are made on how the day should end.  And to learn the  Dow may be off just a couple of tootling points today.  There will be  moments where you will truly see the reason and wisdom of why we have come  to you an hour earlier as we consider - continue tonight, no one can  shoulder the responsibilities of chairman and CEO forever, sage words from  Jack Ma.  He has built a $400 million business from his apartment, and now  he's leaving Alibaba.  </p><p> And get your phones ready.  That's mine over there, where is it?  It's over  there.  I'll be asking you to weigh in on Elon Musk's future at Tesla after  he made strange promises and ideas and then smoked a joint on radio.  </p><p> [15:15:00]  </p><p> Something completely different, absolutely new, we have never done anything  like this before and few would be quite so brave, some might say foolish,  but here on international television, you are going to have a say on what  we are doing and it all requires you to get your phone, your tablet, your  computer and whatever electronic device you've got and go to cnn.com/join.   Now, as you'll see here from my phone, this is what you see, well that  might be a little bit tricky for you to see.  So let me show you over here.  </p><p> This is the gist of it.  You're going to see the question and today's  question is Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk is showing and we'll discuss it.  We  will show you the results and the percentages of what people believe.  Now,  the question, and how we're getting to the question, so far, Les Moonves  has been pushed out - that was on top of our program.  Jack Ma is leaving  while on top, so you have two CEOs going in dignity, grace and delight or  not in the case of Moonves, Jack Ma absolutely, he's going in his own  terms.  </p><p> So, let's put it to the Board members.  And you are the Board in this  particular case, what should Elon Musk do?  What should Tesla do with Elon  Musk?  Firstly, they should stay the course with him, stay with it.  He  should resign or be forced to resign, a bit like Moonves and go off with  all of your stock options and your money, and he should be fired, out the  door, out the window because of course of what he did - smoking a joint on  national radio saying, \"I'm going to take the company private,\" and then  not finding he couldn't do it.  Thirdly, all the other weird and wonderful  eccentric, bizarre things.  What should he did?  I'll show you the results.   cnn.com/join.  </p><p> From sporty jock to tech billionaire, Jack Ma's remarkable journey as the  leader of Alibaba is coming to an end.  Next year, he will hand over the  reins to Daniel Zhang - the company's Chief Executive will take over Ma's  position as Chairman.  Investors don't want to see him go.  News of his  retirement on Wall Street put a minor dent into the shares.  </p><p> Ma's departure comes in a turbulent time for Alibaba.  Its stock has lost  around 10% of its value over the year, as China's tech industry grapples  with trade tensions and tighter regulations.  In his native China, Ma has  become a business icon.  Matt Rivers reports on his legacy from Beijing.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> JACK MA, CHAIRMAN, ALIBABA:  No banks would accept it ...  </p><p> MATT RIVERS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Jack Ma, one of China's richest men, a  giant in tech, a man who has stood side by side with presidents, loves  kung-fu novels, always has.  He has a genre called Wu-xia and he says, they  teach valuable lessons.  </p><p> MA:  Whenever you want to be a great people, a great company, you have to  work very hard.  You have to suffer a lot of terrible things -- wraths and  terrible things -- before you be a hero.  It is spiritual.  It is  spiritual.  And think out of box.  You have to think out of box to win.  </p><p> RIVERS:  And win he has.  It's been 19 years since he co-founded, Alibaba  and the company that began in a Hangzou, China apartment has grown into one  of the largest internet companies in the world.  </p><p> [15:20:01]  </p><p> RIVERS:  In 2014, Alibaba $25 billion IPO was then the largest in US  history.  Ant Financial, the company's finance subsidiary has invested  billions of dollars in companies around the globe.  Alibaba's e-commerce  sites have fundamentally changed the way hundreds of millions of people  shop in China and its mobile payment platform revolutionized how people pay  for what they buy.  </p><p> All the while, Ma has arguably become the most public face of China's tech  boom, a charismatic, often inspiring figure for ordinary people; nicknamed  Papa Ma on Chinese internet.  </p><p> Ma has faced his share of criticism of course.  Critics say, his company  nearly copied e-Bay, and thrived only because the Communist Party wanted  it, too.  China's protectionist policies, so the argument goes, ensured  that Alibaba had no real competition making its rise not only easier, but  in some ways inevitable.  </p><p> There is some truth there, but no matter your view, the facts remain.   Alibaba is a juggernaut of a company and its leader is routinely mentioned  in the same sentence as other (inaudible) of tech - think Jobs, or Musk, or  Gates, and like Gates, Ma says life is about more than a job.  </p><p> Can you imagine yourself  sitting back, relaxing?  </p><p> MA:  No.  I have so much education, environment, and going around and  meeting the entrepreneurs, I've done a lot of things.  Life is so fun and  never ever focus on one thing.  We come to this world not to  work.  We  come to this to enjoy life.  This is what I believe.  </p><p> RIVERS:  Ma has said he wants to focus more on philanthropy.  The former  English teacher has always focused on improving education in China, and as  for his company, widely considered to have a deep management pool.  He told  CNN in 2016 that whenever he does step down, it will be in good hands.  </p><p> MA:  Tomorrow is more difficult.  The day after tomorrow is beautiful, but  most people die tomorrow evening.  So we have to realize that good things  can never be achieved easily.  Life is not only about Alibaba.  I have run  my first 100 meters, I should give the base to the next generation.  </p><p> RIVERS:  Matt Rivers, CNN, Beijing.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> QUEST:  So, New York University - NYU's marketing profesor, Scott Galloway  is with us.  </p><p> SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY:  Good to see you, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  At this new earlier hour, Paul La Monica, too.  </p><p> PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Thanks.  </p><p> QUEST:  Thanks, too.  Jack Ma is talked of in reverential tones.  He's  leaving Alibaba, even though he hasn't handed it, isn't it the equivalent  of when Gates left Microsoft?  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  That's actually probably the right analogy.  And not only that,  he's leaving.  I mean, typically, the CEOs of large companies like this  give up power with the same (inaudible) and generosity of an African  dictator, so to have a guy say, \"I'm going back at the age of 54 to work on  education.\"  He's ringing the bell at the top of the market, taking a  victory lap.  It's a real credit to the ecosystem and the internet economy  in China because they are now creating enterprise value.  The stock hasn't  taken a hit.  </p><p> Now, this was a good day for China and Jack Ma and Alibaba.  It shows that  this ecosystem is sustainable and for real.  </p><p> QUEST:  And in doing so, Paul La Monica, it shows also that they have put  in place a worthy successor.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, you had a great succession plan here.  Daniel Zhang has  been the CEO for the past couple of years, so having him take over the  executive chairman role makes sense.  Joe Tsai also is a very public face  of the Alibaba - the Vice Chairman.  When you listen to Alibaba earnings  calls and other announcements over the past couple of years, Ma has already  taken a back seat.  </p><p> He is of course the most well known person at this company, but I think a  lot of people on Wall Street already recognize, and around the rest of the  world that there is more to Alibaba than just Jack Ma and as you pointed  out with Microsoft and Bill Gates, it's a company that is still doing quite  well now ...  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but in the departure, it certainly faltered.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  It faltered a little bit.  </p><p> QUEST:  But there doesn't seem to be a suggestion, and you're right.  With  2%, 3% or whatever it has fallen that you saw in Alibaba is not indicative  of any great concern that the market has.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, this is a jargon item.  What's unusual is, as Americans,  we tend to be - we are narcissists.  We think that the epicenter of all  innovation is within the seven-mile bike ride of SFO International, but if  you look at the product development roadmap of Alibaba -- payments, hail a  car, buy something, incredible advertising ecosystem -- their product road  map, agility, ability to innovate quickly, makes us look tired.  It makes  us look like - I don't want to come up with a company, but he has created  something incredible.  </p><p> QUEST:  Snap - I'm sorry.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  You first.   </p><p> QUEST:  Did I say something I shouldn't have done?  </p><p> [15:25:02]  </p><p> LA MONICA:   God bless you.  It's been a very, very challenging time for  this company.  Arguably, it's one that maybe shouldn't have gone public at  least in this format.  Now, you have the last of the kind of so-called  adult supervision for Evan Spiegel with Imran Khah, a former Wall Street  analyst, now leaving the company.  I think there are a lot of legitimate  concerns about what the strategy is going to be and the fact that people  who buy Snapchat stock, buy everywhere because you get no voting rights.   None.  </p><p> QUEST:  I keep forgetting that.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  So if you think that Evan Spiegel is the next Steve Jobs, he  isn't.  Then, guess what?  By all means, buy that stock, but if you have  any skepticism whatsoever about  his ability to lead Snapchat and not just  create something that Facebook and Instagram will rip off five years later?   Stay away.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  That's true of all these guys.  They all have dual class  shareholder systems.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, but no votes is really ...  </p><p> QUEST:  Yes, Snap was particularly egregious in giving no votes.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  There's a bigger issue at play here and that is Snap is a good  company, very innovative, great product and it's going out of business.   And the reason why, is that we have in our economy let one company  aggregate four the top five apps in the world.  Eighty percent of our time  on this is in app, one company controls it all.  This isn't your phone,  Richard.  This is a delivery vehicle for company called Facebook.  </p><p> It's an invasive species putting all other companies out of business.  Snap  is a walking dead because we've let monopolies run amuck.  Snap is going  away, it's just a  matter of time.  It will be below five bucks a share  within 12 months and it will be picked up by Google or one of the other  guys.  </p><p> QUEST:  And for those viewers who are sort of crying concern, who have  followed closely because I know you've watched very closely.  My Snap  investment, you'll be pleased to know that in today's fall, my Snap shares  are down 66% since I've opened them.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  See, you've got snapped.  You purchased Snap.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> QUEST:  I bought - no, but then I don't use Facebook and a variety of other  things much either.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  But do you use Instagram?  </p><p> QUEST:  Should we move on?  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Twitter?  </p><p> QUEST:  Yes.  Well, sometimes.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Yes, go on - at our age, go on Snap.  You feel like you're going  to slip and break a hip.  It is so focused and so set up on young people  and that its power, but if you look at the user metrics, like every other  app in the world, Facebook is pulling the same move.  They have technology  that goes out, registers - any app in the world is getting traction about  those features.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  My kid - they're not ready for Snap, but they know what  Facebook is.  They have no idea what Snapchat is.  They already know what  Facebook is at nine and five.  They don't know about Snap ...  </p><p> QUEST:  So likely to talk about - don't go too far.  Go on and have a cup  of tea.  Commiserate with me on my Snap stock.  Donald Trump is starting  his economic wins on Twitter.  Unfortunately, one stat that he mentioned  was wrong . It's wrong 62 times, and now, even the White House won't defend  the President on it.  We'll have more after this.  </p><p> [15:30:00]  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [15:30:00] QUEST:  I'm Richard Quest, there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment.  But I'll ask the chief executive of Norwegian about the  takeover talks surrounding his airline and beyond.  He'll be answering  that.</p><p> And Donald Trump takes his economic posts a step too far on Twitter, we'll  share just how wrong he was.  Before that, this is Cnn, and on this  network, the facts, they always come first.  Hurricane Florence has  intensified and it's now category 4 hurricane as it moves toward the United  States.</p><p>North Carolina's governor is warning people could lose electricity and  utility services for several days once the storm hits.  It's expected to be  one of the strongest hurricanes in a landfall there in some two decades.   Sweden is headed for political uncertainty after both major centrist  coalitions failed to win a majority in Sunday's vote.</p><p> The ruling center-left social democrats and their coalition are leading the  center-right bloc by just a half point -- percentage point.  As for the  Sweden democrats which is a far right party with roots in the neo-Nazi  movement, they are in third place, but did receive nearly a fifth of the  vote.</p><p> Trump(ph) and the UN are warning of catastrophic consequences of a military  offensive in Syria's Idlib province.  The Syrian government says it's  carrying out surgical airstrikes, but has not started a ground assault.   The White Helmet volunteer rescue group reported dozens of the estimate  intense escalations over the weekend.</p><p> President Trump often criticizes the media for not giving him due credit  when it comes to the economy.  So today, he made a boast about his  verifiably false -- and the reason we're going into this in some detail is  because time and again you hear the talk of \"fake news\", \"fake news\".</p><p> Well, today, even the top White House economist admitted the president was  wrong.  Donald Trump -- this is the tweet.  Donald Trump tweeted that GDP  rate 4.2 percent is higher than the unemployment rate report, 9 percent for  the first time in over a 100 years.</p><p> Here's the Fed's data going back to numb too -- I know, 1948, unemployment  in red, GDP in blue.  GDP is higher than unemployment 62 times most  recently in 2006, so it was left to the Chairman of the White House Council  of Economic Advisors to put in perspectives, saying someone must have added  an extra zero by the time the facts got to Trump.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KEVIN HASSETT, ECONOMIST &amp; CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS:  What is  true is that, that it's the highest too in 10 years.  And at some point,  somebody probably conveyed it to him adding a zero to that, and they  shouldn't have done that.</p><p> And I can say that at least numbers -- we speak here at the White House are  grateful for -- and when the press finds mistakes that we make, we don't  like making mistakes but we're grateful when they're pointed out because we  want to correct them.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Sarah Westwood at the White House -- oh, dear, Sarah, tell me, is  there embarrassment or is this sort of just a feeling of well, that's just  Donald, that's just the president.</p><p> SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Well, Richard, what we saw today  was a rare acknowledgement of error from an administration official when  Kevin Hassett; the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors came out  and said that President Trump was off by about 90 years when he cited the  time frame in which the GDP has been higher than the unemployment rate.</p><p> President Trump spent a lot of time on Twitter this morning touting  economic growth as part of his struggle to change the conversation away  from the controversy facing his White House.  But as you mentioned, he sort  of created a dust-up of his own when he is getting the numbers so wrong  when it comes to economic growth.</p><p> [15:35:00]  And all of his focus on the economy is coming, we should note  just days after former President Obama claimed that it was him who deserved  credit for this boom that we've seen in the GDP for the drop in the  unemployment rate. </p><p> Kevin Hassett said a large part of his presentation to reporters today just  moments ago at the White House was disproving that claim from Obama,  although Kevin Hassett said that he was not dispatched specifically because  of Obama's comments.</p><p> QUEST:  Sarah Westwood at the White House, thank you.  And the President  Trump's blue-collar workers -- the number of jobs are growing in their best  rate in 130 years according to analysis from the \"Washington Post\".  Now,  this is about goods-producing jobs like mining and construction,  apparently, they are up more than 3 percent in the last year.</p><p> And employment in rural areas and small towns where the great -- recession  from the great recovery has been slow is now getting better.  They're  growing at an annual rate of around 5 percent in the Trump era.  Each day  this week, we'll be taking a look at economic issues facing American voters  as they head to the pivotal midterms, a balance of power in Washington is  at stake.</p><p> Clare Sebastian asked of a strong economy will be enough to deal  Republicans and Donald Trump a victory in November.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We've accomplished an  economic turnaround of historic proportions.</p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN (voice-over):  If Americans vote with their wallets  this election season, the president has some reason to feel confident.   Economic growth is at a four-year high. </p><p> TRUMP:  These numbers are very sustainable.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Unemployment at half century lows -- </p><p> TRUMP:  We've created 3.7 million jobs since election. </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  And stock market is hitting record.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Donald Trump has created an environment that the  markets really like.  With regulatory reform, again with the tax cuts, so  he does get some credit.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Tax cuts is this administration's signature policy, refueling  strong corporate profits including a record-setting courses for America's  banks.  And yet experts question whether the President's campaign promise  of a tax cut for all has materialized. </p><p> TRUMP:  And we will massively cut taxes for the middle class -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What we saw is we have a non-traditional investment  cycle.  Companies taking that additional cash and reducing debt, buying  back stock, increasing dividends.  The best majority of consumers reported  they did not notice a meaningful change in their after-tax take-home pay  post-tax reform.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Despite the low unemployment, those consumers are also facing  stagnant wage growth and signs of rising prices due to tariffs.  The  president has not only asked voters to trust him on trade. </p><p> TRUMP:  First, and we're going to have to tariff your cars.  They said when  can we show up? When can we be there? Oh, would tomorrow be OK? Oh, folks  stick with us, stick with us.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  He has also provided pockets of short-term relief aimed at the  mostly Republican agricultural states. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The president has promised substantial aid, many  billions of dollars to farmers who are rightly concerned about the story  being tariffs and other action by the Chinese that could hurt the U.S.  middle America.  Whether that's enough is unclear.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  What is clear for the scandal-plagued administration, the  strong U.S. economy sends a powerful political message.</p><p> TRUMP:  Once again, we are the economic envy of the entire world.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  When the president and his party will continue to trumpet.   Clare Sebastian, Cnn, New York.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> QUEST:  The power of this is quite extraordinary.  We're handing some of  that power to you with our question and -- Tesla's chief executive, CEO  Elon Musk should stay the course, resign or be fired? Cnn.com-slash-join,  and we will get your final results in just a moment all for you.</p><p> What should Musk do? What should the board do? When we come back.</p><p> [15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  We have about 19 minutes left on the trading day, and the Dow --  just now, the Dow has looked, the Dow -- oh, as you can see, the gains,  though really look nice impressive gains, though we're here at the  beginning, the gain and portended well for the holiday.</p><p> They sort of evaporated and instead we've just bumped along the bottom  throughout the session, and it was the uncertainty over global trade, we  have Donald Trump threatening more tariffs.  </p><p> And so for instance, you heard obviously the comments about Ford and the  Ford car that's not going to be built in the U.S. even though the tariffs  have been -- Apple was hurt and Apple is down one and a third percent, one  of the biggest losers on the Dow so far.</p><p> But Nike is at the top of the Dow, and that's interesting.  Online sales  jumped 30 percent after the ad campaign with Colin Kaepernick.  Scott  Galloway and Paul La Monica are with me.  This is fascinating because Nike  renews the contract with Kaepernick, he can -- and he continues to be a  spokesman, not only that, they make a great big deal about it.</p><p> If you believe what you want, you'll risk everything.</p><p> SCOTT GALLOWAY, CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY STERN  SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  What does it tell us?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Worst business move of 2018, was Google match showing with the  Senate Intelligence Committee hearings, the best business move of 2018 was  Nike choosing Colin Kaepernick as their 30th anniversary spokesperson -- </p><p> QUEST:  Why? </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Because Richard, they just did the math.  Let's break it down,  Nike does 35 billion revenues, 15 billion domestically, 20 billion  internationally, if you're buying $115 pair of flying Air Blazers in the  U.S., I mean through young, an urban dweller, it means you lean  progressive.</p><p> They put $1 to $3 billion at risk domestically, of that $20 billion abroad,  you're a Brit, how many people abroad feel that the U.S. is doing things  really well? That they've got a handle on race relations here.</p><p> They put at risk, $1 to $3 billion of their business to strengthen their  relationship with $32 billion of their business, this was the genius move  of 2018.</p><p> QUEST:  Even though you end up with an edifying sight of people burning  sneakers, Nike sneakers.</p><p> PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT:  Social media is such an  enigma right now.  How much of that was legitimate with people really  taking their $100-plus sneakers and burning them.</p><p> How much of it was fake news if you will? And to your point, China, Chinese  consumers are not going to get all up in arms about Colin Kaepernick taking  a knee during the national anthem.  And China is now after the U.S., pretty  much the most important market for Nike.</p><p> I think it made sense when they did the math both demographically and  geographically, it wasn't a bad marketing move -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right, so let's do -- I'm not being rude when I open my phone.  I  assure you, it's the Tesla question -- </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  The Tesla question in which we are asking.  Should -- what should  the board, what should Elon Musk do? Should he be fired? And he has various  motive, but should they ask him -- </p><p> LA MONICA:  OK -- </p><p> QUEST:  Should they ask him to please go away? Should he resign or should  he just carry on? You're already shaking your head -- </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, because there's a fourth choice that's not there that I  would vote -- </p><p> QUEST:  Hey! </p><p> LA MONICA:  For, sorry, he shouldn't stay the course, he's got to start  acting like an adult, and he's got to hire a COO -- </p><p> [15:45:00]  QUEST:  That's a given -- </p><p> LA MONICA:  To help him out, just like he has at SpaceX, that doesn't mean  he should be fired or quit, but he shouldn't stay the course either.  He  can't keep doing what he's doing.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  We're the mother of all enablers here, I feel like the tech  innovators collectively -- those of us who are fathers, we have a memo to - - Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Larry Page put down the blond, put on a tie,  show up.  There's -- </p><p> QUEST:  That's not -- that's a recipe for corporate successes. </p><p> GALLOWAY:  But on a tactical corporate -- on a tactical level of some  ministers and corporate boards, there should be a committee of the board  that sits down with them and says if this aberrant reckless behavior  continues, we're going to kick you up with chairman and bring in another  CEO.</p><p> They have -- boards have a responsibility to be the adults in the room,  there's no adult in the room, the board consists of people, he built out a  solar city -- </p><p> LA MONICA:  Right -- </p><p> GALLOWAY:  His brother -- this is really -- this is a failure on corporate  governance.</p><p> LA MONICA:  Is this a problem though that they don't have a CEO? Think of  the worst case scenario.  Mark Zuckerberg starts putting on a hoodie again  and acts like the jerk that they portray him in the social network as,  Sheryl Sandberg could be the new CEO of Facebook, no problem, everything is  fine.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well -- </p><p> LA MONICA:  There's no one at Tesla that can take over on a moment's  notice, they have no bench.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  But that's what the problem is.  Everyone is so afraid to lose  Elon Musk, if I were a board member, I'd say where does Elon Musk go if he  loses Tesla? Is he going to go and be the CEO of Fiat-Chrysler, they need  to have a serious conversation with him.</p><p> QUEST:  Good night to you two for coming here today, good to see you -- </p><p> LA MONICA:  And you -- </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Thank you sir -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you very much.  The final score on what should Tesla's CEO  do? Seventy three percent of you -- </p><p> (BELL RINGING) </p><p> Stay the course, sorry, Paul La Monica.  After the break, Norwegian takes  aim at Argentina and Asia in a full throttle drive for growth.  The chief  exec says it's time to harvest the results.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Part of being in a recession, the pace starts falling and prices  are rising.  And you might argue it's the worst time in the world for an  airline to introduce new routes in Argentina.  Not so says Norwegian Air  shuttle which is selling cheap and cheerful domestic flights in the country  and that it intends to disrupt the local market.</p><p>The low cost carrier Norwegian is also venturing into Asia, and the  earnings seems to speak for themselves, passenger numbers are growing, the  number of routes and destinations are growing.  The fleet is one of the  youngest in the business.  Now, the company is not making any money, not at  least at the moment.</p><p> [15:50:00]  And certainly the level of debt that it's taken on board is  very high, dangerously so.  Norwegians caught the eye of Carsten Spohr of  Lufthansa and Willie Walsh of IAG.  The chief executive told me, all this  attention is flattering.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BJORN KJOS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NORWEGIAN AIRLINES:  Really, he's by  the way, he's a very smart guy, and ideally it's a very good airline, so  they do a lot of things there.  And I can't -- I can't actually here think  about it.  I would have done the same if I had these issues of emotions,  I'd be angry at them.</p><p> No, he's exactly the guy, and we are on the stock exchange, everybody can  buy somebody at the stock exchange.  So -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but as soon as Willie said he was going to with IAG, Carsten  of Lufthansa said I'm in it, I'm in as well.  Are you having talks with  anybody?</p><p> KJOS:  No, we haven't announced anything for sale.  They are coming to us,  but the thing to think about it is, it's better to be pretty shaky than  most.</p><p> QUEST:  It is, but just we're clear, Carsten Spohr of Lufthansa group is  also interested in you, are you interested in doing something with  Lufthansa?</p><p> KJOS:  I cannot say anything about that.  As you know, it's because it's --  what I have to say maybe recorded on the stock exchange.  I can -- my  opinions, about that, both of these airlines are very good airlines.</p><p> QUEST:  The Asia expansion has gone well, the U.S., you've won all the  battles in most of them anyway in terms of recognition.  And you've now got  attention.  What is it you want to do?</p><p> KJOS:  I want to -- I want to give the Argentineans the possibility to fly  on these and fast, and have a good flight and learn maybe to fly longer  maybe with us to Europe.</p><p> QUEST:  But what do you want to do with Norwegian? What do you see as its - - because everywhere you look now, you're being nipped after the heels, the  legacy, the level has come along, Euro wings is now going long, you're  smiling again.  Euro wings is going longer, France is coming along with you  and all the others.</p><p> KJOS:  There will always be others.</p><p> QUEST:  There will always be others.  But they're attacking you on all  sides.</p><p> KJOS:  Not actually, they are -- some routes, but all this have  competitors, it's just about two that you have.  At the end, we got up to  scale and we certainly served so many citizens in U.S. and we have a huge  network in Europe.</p><p> So we are at the level now, we should definitely release our harvesting  now. </p><p> QUEST:  And what will it take though to become profitable?</p><p> KJOS:  Well, we ramped up the long haul this year tremendously, no, they  are -- they're all on the peak now, we can -- no, we can start harvesting.   So we should -- our future as I see it will be bright.</p><p> QUEST:  But it is important for you, I mean you're arguably -- Jeff Bezos  of Amazon has spent the entire history of the company until now taking  losses to build for market share and to build the corner stone that we've  got.  At some point, you're going to have to make money while your  investors and shareholders are going to say, this is not worth -- just in  the low.  </p><p> KJOS:  But then again, out of 17 years we have made money for 15 years, and  I wouldn't have gone into this I didn't think I would -- it would be  profitable.</p><p> QUEST:  Brexit, finally on Brexit.  Now, you're going to tell me that  you'll be fine because of your different subsidiaries.  You're going to  tell me that you've got the U.K. subsidiary which will handle all the U.K.  stuff, and the Irish subsidiary will handle -- and anyway, Norway is part  of the European common area for aviation.</p><p> But you must still be worried.</p><p> KJOS:  Well, actually, we are fit(ph) to the task(ph), the only thing I  don't understand is what are they going to do with all the bilateral  agreements that you used to have, they have to refix(ph) it.  So it's a  huge amount of work they have to go through, but they can do it, I mean,  it's -- </p><p> QUEST:  No, let's take for example your U.K. routes to the U.S.  London  Gatwick is crucial to you -- </p><p> KJOS:  Yes, it is -- </p><p> QUEST:  It's your largest base -- </p><p> KJOS:  Yes, that's right -- </p><p> QUEST:  London Gatwick is crucial to you, the U.S., U.K. flights will have  to be renegotiated.  I'm confident that, yes, that the British and the  Americans will fix it because they need open sky, everybody needs opened  sky, everybody needs the passengers and the two-ways(ph) to really take the  world, that is the most -- well, actually, today, 20 percent of all jobs,  job creation comes from this industry.</p><p> [15:55:00]  You would -- nobody would want to stop that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Five minutes before the close of trade in New York, the -- this is  the scenario, this is the way things look.  In Europe, the markets were all  higher, even the FTSE managed to eat out a very small gain.  The  encouragement came from the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier who claims  the Brexit deal could happen by November.</p><p> The -- no, got 2.3 percent.  The reason for that very simply, the  government now seemingly will respect the EU budget rules or at least it  seems less, and the scenario being it's less likely that there will be a  full blown showdown between the new populist government in Rome and the --  and with Brussels.</p><p> But it's still early days, that's just one day, and that is just Monday.   As to the New York market, a good start to the morning and then it drifted  off and then it completely evaporated into the afternoon, and this is  really -- this is your trade talks, this is your worries, this is your  earnings and all eyes on the things on what is likely to be for the future.</p><p> Very small losses though considering the sort of day, trading is just about  finished, we'll have a profitable moment after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, \"Cbs\", the board of directors  effectively put their fingers on the thumb on the scale when they decided  to let Les Moonves resign, put the money, 120 million into a guarantor's  trust and only after the investigation decide whether he should get that  money or not, will be fired without a penny.</p><p> By doing it that way, they have effectively already tilted the decision  towards him getting something.  Perhaps arguably a far better way would  have been to have suspended him, pending the investigation with no money  put in any form of trust, and then decide whether he goes with the full  amount minus whatever or whether he's allowed to resign because the  allegations don't stand up or he gets fired without a penny.</p><p> At the moment, it would be very difficult for them to do that.  But the  board needs to remember, the world is watching what happens at \"Cbs\".  And  that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York.   Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. </p><p> The closing bell on Wall Street -- </p><p> (BELL RINGING) </p><p> Trading is over.   </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

That's going to do it for \"Hala Gorani Tonight.\" \"Quest Means Business\" is coming up next.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: It's an hour until the closing bell on Wall Street. The last chance to make your trade. The Dow, the good gains of the day have evaporated. The good news is the losses are small. Look at the break apart of the Dow. You have the Nike at the top, you have Boeing towards the bottom. We'll explain why, because let me show you, the market drivers of the day.</p><p>CBS is down, Les Moonves is out, the #MeToo Movement hits the C-suite. Alibaba and Snap lose key executives, all changed, but tech. And Nike, I showed you the shares near the top of the Dow, it's controversial campaign is getting real market results. Live from the world's financial capital on a rainy day in New York City. It's Monday, it's the 10th of September. I'm Richard Quest. I mean business.</p><p>Good evening at a new earlier time, but the same quality program. It's a pivotal moment for the #MeToo Movement and for CBS. The Chief Executive Les Moonves is leaving the company immediately, pushed out by fresh accusations of sexual assault. Moonves is the first Fortune 500 CEO to be ousted through the #MeToo era. The controversy isn't over because the details of Moonves' payout is still to be decided. CBS shares have regained some of the early losses. They are still down for the day, that's partly because with Moonves gone, the battle for control of CBS has come to an end. Our media correspondent Brian Stelter is following it all.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Hello.</p><p>QUEST: You've worked in the media business throughout all your professional career, explain.</p><p>STELTER: There's never been an earthquake like this. It is as simple as that. We've talked about a lot of #MeToo figures, a lot of men who have lost their jobs in the past year, but nothing like this, nothing like the Fortune 500 CEO, who vowed to fight on and stayed in the role for six weeks, but was eventually forced out this time yesterday.</p><p>QUEST: Before we talk about the CBS side of the equation. When Weinstein happened and all the #MeToo happened, did Moonves know that - that did you think that he had this entire smoldering volcano waiting to erupt within ...</p><p>STELTER: You just asked me the most interesting question of this story. I believe he did know. I believe he did know he was vulnerable to this and that makes me wonder something else, did he go picking a fight inside his company on purpose? Did he go trying to fight with his controlling shareholder, trying to wrest away control of CBS on purpose, to create another story line? Because, really, we have seen the merger of two story lines here, this tug of war, which he lost to Shari Redstone over the future of CBS, and this #MeToo case.</p><p>I wonder if ever the actor, ever the Hollywood star, Moonves went out and tried to make his own story, but no matter what, it ended badly for him.</p><p>QUEST: Okay, let's talk about CBS. They've put $120 million into a guarantor trust, he would have gotten $140 million, $20 million will go to charities or to organizations. But I mean, how does CBS justify not suspending him and then firing him or reinstating if the allegations are true? Why allow him to resign?</p><p>STELTER: I think the answer is that you're talking about a board of directors that was mostly made of up of Moonves' old friends, his pals. He was essentially running this board. It was mostly elderly, mostly white- man board. That has changed as of Sunday, now there's been a shakeup of the board, but I think a lot of this had to do with Moonves surrounded by his friends, believing he could get through this.</p><p>Eventually, then the law firms came in. Eventually more women came forward. Eventually these negotiations of Redstone continued to progress and it became in the words of one source, untenable for Moonves to continue.</p><p>[15:05:12]</p><p>STELTER: But even now, as you said, $120 million still possibly on the table, incredible development.</p><p>QUEST: Okay, on that, let's just look at the national amusements - what's the agreement? What is the - have they agreed to do?</p><p>STELTER: Everybody agrees to put down the weapons. Everybody has surrendered.</p><p>QUEST: So what happens?</p><p>STELTER: So now CBS, Redstone tightens her control on the company. This is the Redstone family. Sumner Redstone of course, the owner for a couple of a decades, now her daughter - Shari - is in charge. Now, going forward, there's talk about a possible CBS-Viacom recombination.</p><p>However, I think what's more likely is we're going to see better merge for CBS and this board has reaffirmed the - the phones are open, the lines are open, call with your offers. I would be surprise if a year or two from now, CBS is not in the hands of either some big tech company or some other big buyer.</p><p>QUEST: Extraordinary developments. Good to see you. Thank you, sir. Good to see you always.</p><p>STELTER: Thanks.</p><p>QUEST: We're going to continue talking about it. Les Moonves may be gone, the question shareholders and activists want the answer to is how much he should take with him? As I was just describing, it depends on the outcome of the investigation into his alleged misconduct. Now, the full payout would be $140 million, of which $20 million would go to organizations to support the #MeToo Movement and Equality for Women in the Workplace.</p><p>But as we just said, $120 million is in trust. It would only return to CBS if the board decides that Moonves could be fired for cause. Ronan Farrow who led the investigative journalism and wrote the original report and the update just over the weekend tell CNN it was the idea that Moonves would get anything at all that prompted more women to come forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RONAN FARROW, CONTRIBUTING WRITER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: One of the most important things about this story is, this is the first Fortune 500 CEO to step down for these reasons in the #MeToo era. This is someone who was supposed to be immune to criticism, that many of these are women stayed quiet about for years because they thought he had complete impunity.</p><p>So, yes, the reluctance of this Board to act and he has a lot of these women, that's troubling. It shows how far we still have to go. But also, this is a story of how far we have come because no one thought we would be here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Joining me in the C-Suite is Davia Temin, media reputation strategist. The C-Suite is appropriate for us to talk about these events. Your study and your research shows the number of CEOs or the number of people accused on what's happened to them.</p><p>DAVIA TEMIN, MEDIA REPUTATION STRATEGIST: As of today, it's 700, so Les Moonves makes 700.</p><p>QUEST: Seven hundred people accused?</p><p>TEMIN: High profile people accused since Weinstein.</p><p>QUEST: Right, and what happened to most of them?</p><p>TEMIN: Well, most of them have - there was no most. So, a certain percentage, about half have left. About half still remain or they're continuing to be under investigation. So it's not clear. I think the amount of time that it takes between investigation and final resolution is shortening now from what it was a year ago.</p><p>QUEST: The idea that Les Moonves could walk out the door with more than $100 million, what would you say?</p><p>TEMIN: You know, I don't find that the worst thing in the world. I think that he lived a life - I'm not supporting him by any stretch of the imagination, don't get me wrong. But he lived according to some rules, those rules changed somewhere about a year ago, about two years ago now. And I am most concerned that he is caught and that he sets a precedent now that others who do this are caught. It's a game change and it's a culture change.</p><p>QUEST: I agree, and if it was a normal job, and we're talking about $100,000.00 which for a top executive is not a fortune, that would be fine, but we're talking about $100 million. We're talking about life-changing events. All right, he's earned similar amounts. He's earned $20 million to $30 million for the last 20 years, he's not short of the price of a cup of tea. But it's symbolic.</p><p>TEMIN: It's symbolic and it's probably - if they find that there is an investigation that there's real merit to all of this, then it should be.</p><p>QUEST: What does it say then that he's been allowed to resign pending an investigation where the up side is vast and the Board is probably in his favor?</p><p>TEMIN: Well, he's been allowed, he's been made to resign, right? So he hasn't been allowed to resign.</p><p>QUEST: I'll resign for $100 million.</p><p>TEMIN: I would, too, tomorrow. But I think that ht e point is, he has - he has lost all the reputational equity that he ever had. So whatever he walks away with, he's lost it all.</p><p>QUEST: Let's talk on that front. The #MeToo Movement, at some point, there will be - when I say cut off, I don't mean a cut off in terms - because bad behavior, appalling activities, must always - should always be held to account. But at some stage, people will say, \"Okay, he did this, but he shouldn't be fired.\"</p><p>[15:10:13]</p><p>TEMIN: Yes, you know what ...</p><p>QUEST: Are not there yet?</p><p>TEMIN: No, we are not there yet.</p><p>QUEST: And what about Moonves?</p><p>TEMIN: No, no. I know. We're not there yet for anyone. We are way far away from that. We are so much at the tip of this iceberg. There is so much underneath the surface at this point, that there is a long way to go. And I think Boards know that, I think corporate Boards know that. I think that's why they're so fixed on looking at culture now and toxic culture and all the other stuff because they know what the viability is.</p><p>QUEST: What do you think - and this is a sort of a no win question ...</p><p>TEMIN: All right.</p><p>QUEST: ... for you. What do you think the right way for a Board - I mean, at what point is dismissal the answer for events happening 30 years ago in a different culture?</p><p>TEMIN: That's a hard one. It really is a hard one, but I think that when they come to light that you have to work on the facts that you get and I think dismissal is appropriate.</p><p>QUEST: Let's talk about Serena, let's listen to what she had to say at the Open, after she was fined. She lost and was fined.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERENA WILLIAMS, PROFESIONAL TENNIS PLAYER: I'm here fighting for women's rights and for women's equality and for all kinds of stuff and for me to say, thief and for him to take a game, it made me feel like it was a sexist remark. I mean, like, he's never took a game from a man because they said thief. For me, it blows my mind.</p><p>The fact that I have to go through this is just an example for the next person that has emotions and that want to express themselves and they want to be a strong woman and they're going to be allowed to go that because of today, maybe it didn't work out for me, but it's going to work out for the next person.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Are you with her on that?</p><p>TEMIN: I think that rules have to be equal and I think that responses have to be equal and I think that's more unconscious bias is what I think, but I think that the rules haven't been and they won't be for a long time, but you have to call out what you think is biased, and she's doing it.</p><p>QUEST: And it's really maybe not for us to say whether it was or wasn't. I mean, calling the umpire thief is pretty serious stuff in a competition of a sport or ...</p><p>TEMIN: Well, have others, though, called him thief before? That is the question, right? It's got to be equally applied and it hasn't been for so long, we don't even know what that looks like anymore.</p><p>QUEST: Exactly.</p><p>TEMIN: Right? So we're finding out though because we're finding out by testing the limits.</p><p>QUEST: Great that you came in to help us test them. Please come back again.</p><p>TEMIN: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you. A look at the markets. The Dow is struggling to go green, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ set to snap a four-day streak and tech shares bouncing back from a rough week.</p><p>Actually, you know, I do need to keep reminding myself, and new perhaps, that we are in - I look at those numbers, and I'm so used to it being after the closing bell. but it's not. We are in the last hour of trade, where the final decisions are made on how the day should end. And to learn the Dow may be off just a couple of tootling points today. There will be moments where you will truly see the reason and wisdom of why we have come to you an hour earlier as we consider - continue tonight, no one can shoulder the responsibilities of chairman and CEO forever, sage words from Jack Ma. He has built a $400 million business from his apartment, and now he's leaving Alibaba.</p><p>And get your phones ready. That's mine over there, where is it? It's over there. I'll be asking you to weigh in on Elon Musk's future at Tesla after he made strange promises and ideas and then smoked a joint on radio.</p><p>[15:15:00]</p><p>Something completely different, absolutely new, we have never done anything like this before and few would be quite so brave, some might say foolish, but here on international television, you are going to have a say on what we are doing and it all requires you to get your phone, your tablet, your computer and whatever electronic device you've got and go to cnn.com/join. Now, as you'll see here from my phone, this is what you see, well that might be a little bit tricky for you to see. So let me show you over here.</p><p>This is the gist of it. You're going to see the question and today's question is Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk is showing and we'll discuss it. We will show you the results and the percentages of what people believe. Now, the question, and how we're getting to the question, so far, Les Moonves has been pushed out - that was on top of our program. Jack Ma is leaving while on top, so you have two CEOs going in dignity, grace and delight or not in the case of Moonves, Jack Ma absolutely, he's going in his own terms.</p><p>So, let's put it to the Board members. And you are the Board in this particular case, what should Elon Musk do? What should Tesla do with Elon Musk? Firstly, they should stay the course with him, stay with it. He should resign or be forced to resign, a bit like Moonves and go off with all of your stock options and your money, and he should be fired, out the door, out the window because of course of what he did - smoking a joint on national radio saying, \"I'm going to take the company private,\" and then not finding he couldn't do it. Thirdly, all the other weird and wonderful eccentric, bizarre things. What should he did? I'll show you the results. cnn.com/join.</p><p>From sporty jock to tech billionaire, Jack Ma's remarkable journey as the leader of Alibaba is coming to an end. Next year, he will hand over the reins to Daniel Zhang - the company's Chief Executive will take over Ma's position as Chairman. Investors don't want to see him go. News of his retirement on Wall Street put a minor dent into the shares.</p><p>Ma's departure comes in a turbulent time for Alibaba. Its stock has lost around 10% of its value over the year, as China's tech industry grapples with trade tensions and tighter regulations. In his native China, Ma has become a business icon. Matt Rivers reports on his legacy from Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>JACK MA, CHAIRMAN, ALIBABA: No banks would accept it ...</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Jack Ma, one of China's richest men, a giant in tech, a man who has stood side by side with presidents, loves kung-fu novels, always has. He has a genre called Wu-xia and he says, they teach valuable lessons.</p><p>MA: Whenever you want to be a great people, a great company, you have to work very hard. You have to suffer a lot of terrible things -- wraths and terrible things -- before you be a hero. It is spiritual. It is spiritual. And think out of box. You have to think out of box to win.</p><p>RIVERS: And win he has. It's been 19 years since he co-founded, Alibaba and the company that began in a Hangzou, China apartment has grown into one of the largest internet companies in the world.</p><p>[15:20:01]</p><p>RIVERS: In 2014, Alibaba $25 billion IPO was then the largest in US history. Ant Financial, the company's finance subsidiary has invested billions of dollars in companies around the globe. Alibaba's e-commerce sites have fundamentally changed the way hundreds of millions of people shop in China and its mobile payment platform revolutionized how people pay for what they buy.</p><p>All the while, Ma has arguably become the most public face of China's tech boom, a charismatic, often inspiring figure for ordinary people; nicknamed Papa Ma on Chinese internet.</p><p>Ma has faced his share of criticism of course. Critics say, his company nearly copied e-Bay, and thrived only because the Communist Party wanted it, too. China's protectionist policies, so the argument goes, ensured that Alibaba had no real competition making its rise not only easier, but in some ways inevitable.</p><p>There is some truth there, but no matter your view, the facts remain. Alibaba is a juggernaut of a company and its leader is routinely mentioned in the same sentence as other (inaudible) of tech - think Jobs, or Musk, or Gates, and like Gates, Ma says life is about more than a job.</p><p>Can you imagine yourself sitting back, relaxing?</p><p>MA: No. I have so much education, environment, and going around and meeting the entrepreneurs, I've done a lot of things. Life is so fun and never ever focus on one thing. We come to this world not to work. We come to this to enjoy life. This is what I believe.</p><p>RIVERS: Ma has said he wants to focus more on philanthropy. The former English teacher has always focused on improving education in China, and as for his company, widely considered to have a deep management pool. He told CNN in 2016 that whenever he does step down, it will be in good hands.</p><p>MA: Tomorrow is more difficult. The day after tomorrow is beautiful, but most people die tomorrow evening. So we have to realize that good things can never be achieved easily. Life is not only about Alibaba. I have run my first 100 meters, I should give the base to the next generation.</p><p>RIVERS: Matt Rivers, CNN, Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST: So, New York University - NYU's marketing profesor, Scott Galloway is with us.</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY: Good to see you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: At this new earlier hour, Paul La Monica, too.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Thanks.</p><p>QUEST: Thanks, too. Jack Ma is talked of in reverential tones. He's leaving Alibaba, even though he hasn't handed it, isn't it the equivalent of when Gates left Microsoft?</p><p>GALLOWAY: That's actually probably the right analogy. And not only that, he's leaving. I mean, typically, the CEOs of large companies like this give up power with the same (inaudible) and generosity of an African dictator, so to have a guy say, \"I'm going back at the age of 54 to work on education.\" He's ringing the bell at the top of the market, taking a victory lap. It's a real credit to the ecosystem and the internet economy in China because they are now creating enterprise value. The stock hasn't taken a hit.</p><p>Now, this was a good day for China and Jack Ma and Alibaba. It shows that this ecosystem is sustainable and for real.</p><p>QUEST: And in doing so, Paul La Monica, it shows also that they have put in place a worthy successor.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, you had a great succession plan here. Daniel Zhang has been the CEO for the past couple of years, so having him take over the executive chairman role makes sense. Joe Tsai also is a very public face of the Alibaba - the Vice Chairman. When you listen to Alibaba earnings calls and other announcements over the past couple of years, Ma has already taken a back seat.</p><p>He is of course the most well known person at this company, but I think a lot of people on Wall Street already recognize, and around the rest of the world that there is more to Alibaba than just Jack Ma and as you pointed out with Microsoft and Bill Gates, it's a company that is still doing quite well now ...</p><p>QUEST: Right, but in the departure, it certainly faltered.</p><p>LA MONICA: It faltered a little bit.</p><p>QUEST: But there doesn't seem to be a suggestion, and you're right. With 2%, 3% or whatever it has fallen that you saw in Alibaba is not indicative of any great concern that the market has.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, this is a jargon item. What's unusual is, as Americans, we tend to be - we are narcissists. We think that the epicenter of all innovation is within the seven-mile bike ride of SFO International, but if you look at the product development roadmap of Alibaba -- payments, hail a car, buy something, incredible advertising ecosystem -- their product road map, agility, ability to innovate quickly, makes us look tired. It makes us look like - I don't want to come up with a company, but he has created something incredible.</p><p>QUEST: Snap - I'm sorry.</p><p>LA MONICA: You first.</p><p>QUEST: Did I say something I shouldn't have done?</p><p>[15:25:02]</p><p>LA MONICA: God bless you. It's been a very, very challenging time for this company. Arguably, it's one that maybe shouldn't have gone public at least in this format. Now, you have the last of the kind of so-called adult supervision for Evan Spiegel with Imran Khah, a former Wall Street analyst, now leaving the company. I think there are a lot of legitimate concerns about what the strategy is going to be and the fact that people who buy Snapchat stock, buy everywhere because you get no voting rights. None.</p><p>QUEST: I keep forgetting that.</p><p>LA MONICA: So if you think that Evan Spiegel is the next Steve Jobs, he isn't. Then, guess what? By all means, buy that stock, but if you have any skepticism whatsoever about his ability to lead Snapchat and not just create something that Facebook and Instagram will rip off five years later? Stay away.</p><p>GALLOWAY: That's true of all these guys. They all have dual class shareholder systems.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, but no votes is really ...</p><p>QUEST: Yes, Snap was particularly egregious in giving no votes.</p><p>GALLOWAY: There's a bigger issue at play here and that is Snap is a good company, very innovative, great product and it's going out of business. And the reason why, is that we have in our economy let one company aggregate four the top five apps in the world. Eighty percent of our time on this is in app, one company controls it all. This isn't your phone, Richard. This is a delivery vehicle for company called Facebook.</p><p>It's an invasive species putting all other companies out of business. Snap is a walking dead because we've let monopolies run amuck. Snap is going away, it's just a matter of time. It will be below five bucks a share within 12 months and it will be picked up by Google or one of the other guys.</p><p>QUEST: And for those viewers who are sort of crying concern, who have followed closely because I know you've watched very closely. My Snap investment, you'll be pleased to know that in today's fall, my Snap shares are down 66% since I've opened them.</p><p>GALLOWAY: See, you've got snapped. You purchased Snap.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: I bought - no, but then I don't use Facebook and a variety of other things much either.</p><p>GALLOWAY: But do you use Instagram?</p><p>QUEST: Should we move on?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Twitter?</p><p>QUEST: Yes. Well, sometimes.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, go on - at our age, go on Snap. You feel like you're going to slip and break a hip. It is so focused and so set up on young people and that its power, but if you look at the user metrics, like every other app in the world, Facebook is pulling the same move. They have technology that goes out, registers - any app in the world is getting traction about those features.</p><p>LA MONICA: My kid - they're not ready for Snap, but they know what Facebook is. They have no idea what Snapchat is. They already know what Facebook is at nine and five. They don't know about Snap ...</p><p>QUEST: So likely to talk about - don't go too far. Go on and have a cup of tea. Commiserate with me on my Snap stock. Donald Trump is starting his economic wins on Twitter. Unfortunately, one stat that he mentioned was wrong . It's wrong 62 times, and now, even the White House won't defend the President on it. We'll have more after this.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>[15:30:00] QUEST: I'm Richard Quest, there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. But I'll ask the chief executive of Norwegian about the takeover talks surrounding his airline and beyond. He'll be answering that.</p><p>And Donald Trump takes his economic posts a step too far on Twitter, we'll share just how wrong he was. Before that, this is Cnn, and on this network, the facts, they always come first. Hurricane Florence has intensified and it's now category 4 hurricane as it moves toward the United States.</p><p>North Carolina's governor is warning people could lose electricity and utility services for several days once the storm hits. It's expected to be one of the strongest hurricanes in a landfall there in some two decades. Sweden is headed for political uncertainty after both major centrist coalitions failed to win a majority in Sunday's vote.</p><p>The ruling center-left social democrats and their coalition are leading the center-right bloc by just a half point -- percentage point. As for the Sweden democrats which is a far right party with roots in the neo-Nazi movement, they are in third place, but did receive nearly a fifth of the vote.</p><p>Trump(ph) and the UN are warning of catastrophic consequences of a military offensive in Syria's Idlib province. The Syrian government says it's carrying out surgical airstrikes, but has not started a ground assault. The White Helmet volunteer rescue group reported dozens of the estimate intense escalations over the weekend.</p><p>President Trump often criticizes the media for not giving him due credit when it comes to the economy. So today, he made a boast about his verifiably false -- and the reason we're going into this in some detail is because time and again you hear the talk of \"fake news\", \"fake news\".</p><p>Well, today, even the top White House economist admitted the president was wrong. Donald Trump -- this is the tweet. Donald Trump tweeted that GDP rate 4.2 percent is higher than the unemployment rate report, 9 percent for the first time in over a 100 years.</p><p>Here's the Fed's data going back to numb too -- I know, 1948, unemployment in red, GDP in blue. GDP is higher than unemployment 62 times most recently in 2006, so it was left to the Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors to put in perspectives, saying someone must have added an extra zero by the time the facts got to Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, ECONOMIST &amp; CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: What is true is that, that it's the highest too in 10 years. And at some point, somebody probably conveyed it to him adding a zero to that, and they shouldn't have done that.</p><p>And I can say that at least numbers -- we speak here at the White House are grateful for -- and when the press finds mistakes that we make, we don't like making mistakes but we're grateful when they're pointed out because we want to correct them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Sarah Westwood at the White House -- oh, dear, Sarah, tell me, is there embarrassment or is this sort of just a feeling of well, that's just Donald, that's just the president.</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, Richard, what we saw today was a rare acknowledgement of error from an administration official when Kevin Hassett; the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors came out and said that President Trump was off by about 90 years when he cited the time frame in which the GDP has been higher than the unemployment rate.</p><p>President Trump spent a lot of time on Twitter this morning touting economic growth as part of his struggle to change the conversation away from the controversy facing his White House. But as you mentioned, he sort of created a dust-up of his own when he is getting the numbers so wrong when it comes to economic growth.</p><p>[15:35:00] And all of his focus on the economy is coming, we should note just days after former President Obama claimed that it was him who deserved credit for this boom that we've seen in the GDP for the drop in the unemployment rate.</p><p>Kevin Hassett said a large part of his presentation to reporters today just moments ago at the White House was disproving that claim from Obama, although Kevin Hassett said that he was not dispatched specifically because of Obama's comments.</p><p>QUEST: Sarah Westwood at the White House, thank you. And the President Trump's blue-collar workers -- the number of jobs are growing in their best rate in 130 years according to analysis from the \"Washington Post\". Now, this is about goods-producing jobs like mining and construction, apparently, they are up more than 3 percent in the last year.</p><p>And employment in rural areas and small towns where the great -- recession from the great recovery has been slow is now getting better. They're growing at an annual rate of around 5 percent in the Trump era. Each day this week, we'll be taking a look at economic issues facing American voters as they head to the pivotal midterms, a balance of power in Washington is at stake.</p><p>Clare Sebastian asked of a strong economy will be enough to deal Republicans and Donald Trump a victory in November.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN (voice-over): If Americans vote with their wallets this election season, the president has some reason to feel confident. Economic growth is at a four-year high.</p><p>TRUMP: These numbers are very sustainable.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Unemployment at half century lows --</p><p>TRUMP: We've created 3.7 million jobs since election.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: And stock market is hitting record.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump has created an environment that the markets really like. With regulatory reform, again with the tax cuts, so he does get some credit.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Tax cuts is this administration's signature policy, refueling strong corporate profits including a record-setting courses for America's banks. And yet experts question whether the President's campaign promise of a tax cut for all has materialized.</p><p>TRUMP: And we will massively cut taxes for the middle class --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What we saw is we have a non-traditional investment cycle. Companies taking that additional cash and reducing debt, buying back stock, increasing dividends. The best majority of consumers reported they did not notice a meaningful change in their after-tax take-home pay post-tax reform.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Despite the low unemployment, those consumers are also facing stagnant wage growth and signs of rising prices due to tariffs. The president has not only asked voters to trust him on trade.</p><p>TRUMP: First, and we're going to have to tariff your cars. They said when can we show up? When can we be there? Oh, would tomorrow be OK? Oh, folks stick with us, stick with us.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: He has also provided pockets of short-term relief aimed at the mostly Republican agricultural states.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president has promised substantial aid, many billions of dollars to farmers who are rightly concerned about the story being tariffs and other action by the Chinese that could hurt the U.S. middle America. Whether that's enough is unclear.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: What is clear for the scandal-plagued administration, the strong U.S. economy sends a powerful political message.</p><p>TRUMP: Once again, we are the economic envy of the entire world.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: When the president and his party will continue to trumpet. Clare Sebastian, Cnn, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: The power of this is quite extraordinary. We're handing some of that power to you with our question and -- Tesla's chief executive, CEO Elon Musk should stay the course, resign or be fired? Cnn.com-slash-join, and we will get your final results in just a moment all for you.</p><p>What should Musk do? What should the board do? When we come back.</p><p>[15:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: We have about 19 minutes left on the trading day, and the Dow -- just now, the Dow has looked, the Dow -- oh, as you can see, the gains, though really look nice impressive gains, though we're here at the beginning, the gain and portended well for the holiday.</p><p>They sort of evaporated and instead we've just bumped along the bottom throughout the session, and it was the uncertainty over global trade, we have Donald Trump threatening more tariffs.</p><p>And so for instance, you heard obviously the comments about Ford and the Ford car that's not going to be built in the U.S. even though the tariffs have been -- Apple was hurt and Apple is down one and a third percent, one of the biggest losers on the Dow so far.</p><p>But Nike is at the top of the Dow, and that's interesting. Online sales jumped 30 percent after the ad campaign with Colin Kaepernick. Scott Galloway and Paul La Monica are with me. This is fascinating because Nike renews the contract with Kaepernick, he can -- and he continues to be a spokesman, not only that, they make a great big deal about it.</p><p>If you believe what you want, you'll risk everything.</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: What does it tell us?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Worst business move of 2018, was Google match showing with the Senate Intelligence Committee hearings, the best business move of 2018 was Nike choosing Colin Kaepernick as their 30th anniversary spokesperson --</p><p>QUEST: Why?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Because Richard, they just did the math. Let's break it down, Nike does 35 billion revenues, 15 billion domestically, 20 billion internationally, if you're buying $115 pair of flying Air Blazers in the U.S., I mean through young, an urban dweller, it means you lean progressive.</p><p>They put $1 to $3 billion at risk domestically, of that $20 billion abroad, you're a Brit, how many people abroad feel that the U.S. is doing things really well? That they've got a handle on race relations here.</p><p>They put at risk, $1 to $3 billion of their business to strengthen their relationship with $32 billion of their business, this was the genius move of 2018.</p><p>QUEST: Even though you end up with an edifying sight of people burning sneakers, Nike sneakers.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: Social media is such an enigma right now. How much of that was legitimate with people really taking their $100-plus sneakers and burning them.</p><p>How much of it was fake news if you will? And to your point, China, Chinese consumers are not going to get all up in arms about Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem. And China is now after the U.S., pretty much the most important market for Nike.</p><p>I think it made sense when they did the math both demographically and geographically, it wasn't a bad marketing move --</p><p>QUEST: Right, so let's do -- I'm not being rude when I open my phone. I assure you, it's the Tesla question --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: The Tesla question in which we are asking. Should -- what should the board, what should Elon Musk do? Should he be fired? And he has various motive, but should they ask him --</p><p>LA MONICA: OK --</p><p>QUEST: Should they ask him to please go away? Should he resign or should he just carry on? You're already shaking your head --</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, because there's a fourth choice that's not there that I would vote --</p><p>QUEST: Hey!</p><p>LA MONICA: For, sorry, he shouldn't stay the course, he's got to start acting like an adult, and he's got to hire a COO --</p><p>[15:45:00] QUEST: That's a given --</p><p>LA MONICA: To help him out, just like he has at SpaceX, that doesn't mean he should be fired or quit, but he shouldn't stay the course either. He can't keep doing what he's doing.</p><p>GALLOWAY: We're the mother of all enablers here, I feel like the tech innovators collectively -- those of us who are fathers, we have a memo to - - Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Larry Page put down the blond, put on a tie, show up. There's --</p><p>QUEST: That's not -- that's a recipe for corporate successes.</p><p>GALLOWAY: But on a tactical corporate -- on a tactical level of some ministers and corporate boards, there should be a committee of the board that sits down with them and says if this aberrant reckless behavior continues, we're going to kick you up with chairman and bring in another CEO.</p><p>They have -- boards have a responsibility to be the adults in the room, there's no adult in the room, the board consists of people, he built out a solar city --</p><p>LA MONICA: Right --</p><p>GALLOWAY: His brother -- this is really -- this is a failure on corporate governance.</p><p>LA MONICA: Is this a problem though that they don't have a CEO? Think of the worst case scenario. Mark Zuckerberg starts putting on a hoodie again and acts like the jerk that they portray him in the social network as, Sheryl Sandberg could be the new CEO of Facebook, no problem, everything is fine.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well --</p><p>LA MONICA: There's no one at Tesla that can take over on a moment's notice, they have no bench.</p><p>GALLOWAY: But that's what the problem is. Everyone is so afraid to lose Elon Musk, if I were a board member, I'd say where does Elon Musk go if he loses Tesla? Is he going to go and be the CEO of Fiat-Chrysler, they need to have a serious conversation with him.</p><p>QUEST: Good night to you two for coming here today, good to see you --</p><p>LA MONICA: And you --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Thank you sir --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much. The final score on what should Tesla's CEO do? Seventy three percent of you --</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>Stay the course, sorry, Paul La Monica. After the break, Norwegian takes aim at Argentina and Asia in a full throttle drive for growth. The chief exec says it's time to harvest the results.</p><p>QUEST: Part of being in a recession, the pace starts falling and prices are rising. And you might argue it's the worst time in the world for an airline to introduce new routes in Argentina. Not so says Norwegian Air shuttle which is selling cheap and cheerful domestic flights in the country and that it intends to disrupt the local market.</p><p>The low cost carrier Norwegian is also venturing into Asia, and the earnings seems to speak for themselves, passenger numbers are growing, the number of routes and destinations are growing. The fleet is one of the youngest in the business. Now, the company is not making any money, not at least at the moment.</p><p>[15:50:00] And certainly the level of debt that it's taken on board is very high, dangerously so. Norwegians caught the eye of Carsten Spohr of Lufthansa and Willie Walsh of IAG. The chief executive told me, all this attention is flattering.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BJORN KJOS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NORWEGIAN AIRLINES: Really, he's by the way, he's a very smart guy, and ideally it's a very good airline, so they do a lot of things there. And I can't -- I can't actually here think about it. I would have done the same if I had these issues of emotions, I'd be angry at them.</p><p>No, he's exactly the guy, and we are on the stock exchange, everybody can buy somebody at the stock exchange. So --</p><p>QUEST: Right, but as soon as Willie said he was going to with IAG, Carsten of Lufthansa said I'm in it, I'm in as well. Are you having talks with anybody?</p><p>KJOS: No, we haven't announced anything for sale. They are coming to us, but the thing to think about it is, it's better to be pretty shaky than most.</p><p>QUEST: It is, but just we're clear, Carsten Spohr of Lufthansa group is also interested in you, are you interested in doing something with Lufthansa?</p><p>KJOS: I cannot say anything about that. As you know, it's because it's -- what I have to say maybe recorded on the stock exchange. I can -- my opinions, about that, both of these airlines are very good airlines.</p><p>QUEST: The Asia expansion has gone well, the U.S., you've won all the battles in most of them anyway in terms of recognition. And you've now got attention. What is it you want to do?</p><p>KJOS: I want to -- I want to give the Argentineans the possibility to fly on these and fast, and have a good flight and learn maybe to fly longer maybe with us to Europe.</p><p>QUEST: But what do you want to do with Norwegian? What do you see as its - - because everywhere you look now, you're being nipped after the heels, the legacy, the level has come along, Euro wings is now going long, you're smiling again. Euro wings is going longer, France is coming along with you and all the others.</p><p>KJOS: There will always be others.</p><p>QUEST: There will always be others. But they're attacking you on all sides.</p><p>KJOS: Not actually, they are -- some routes, but all this have competitors, it's just about two that you have. At the end, we got up to scale and we certainly served so many citizens in U.S. and we have a huge network in Europe.</p><p>So we are at the level now, we should definitely release our harvesting now.</p><p>QUEST: And what will it take though to become profitable?</p><p>KJOS: Well, we ramped up the long haul this year tremendously, no, they are -- they're all on the peak now, we can -- no, we can start harvesting. So we should -- our future as I see it will be bright.</p><p>QUEST: But it is important for you, I mean you're arguably -- Jeff Bezos of Amazon has spent the entire history of the company until now taking losses to build for market share and to build the corner stone that we've got. At some point, you're going to have to make money while your investors and shareholders are going to say, this is not worth -- just in the low.</p><p>KJOS: But then again, out of 17 years we have made money for 15 years, and I wouldn't have gone into this I didn't think I would -- it would be profitable.</p><p>QUEST: Brexit, finally on Brexit. Now, you're going to tell me that you'll be fine because of your different subsidiaries. You're going to tell me that you've got the U.K. subsidiary which will handle all the U.K. stuff, and the Irish subsidiary will handle -- and anyway, Norway is part of the European common area for aviation.</p><p>But you must still be worried.</p><p>KJOS: Well, actually, we are fit(ph) to the task(ph), the only thing I don't understand is what are they going to do with all the bilateral agreements that you used to have, they have to refix(ph) it. So it's a huge amount of work they have to go through, but they can do it, I mean, it's --</p><p>QUEST: No, let's take for example your U.K. routes to the U.S. London Gatwick is crucial to you --</p><p>KJOS: Yes, it is --</p><p>QUEST: It's your largest base --</p><p>KJOS: Yes, that's right --</p><p>QUEST: London Gatwick is crucial to you, the U.S., U.K. flights will have to be renegotiated. I'm confident that, yes, that the British and the Americans will fix it because they need open sky, everybody needs opened sky, everybody needs the passengers and the two-ways(ph) to really take the world, that is the most -- well, actually, today, 20 percent of all jobs, job creation comes from this industry.</p><p>[15:55:00] You would -- nobody would want to stop that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Five minutes before the close of trade in New York, the -- this is the scenario, this is the way things look. In Europe, the markets were all higher, even the FTSE managed to eat out a very small gain. The encouragement came from the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier who claims the Brexit deal could happen by November.</p><p>The -- no, got 2.3 percent. The reason for that very simply, the government now seemingly will respect the EU budget rules or at least it seems less, and the scenario being it's less likely that there will be a full blown showdown between the new populist government in Rome and the -- and with Brussels.</p><p>But it's still early days, that's just one day, and that is just Monday. As to the New York market, a good start to the morning and then it drifted off and then it completely evaporated into the afternoon, and this is really -- this is your trade talks, this is your worries, this is your earnings and all eyes on the things on what is likely to be for the future.</p><p>Very small losses though considering the sort of day, trading is just about finished, we'll have a profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, \"Cbs\", the board of directors effectively put their fingers on the thumb on the scale when they decided to let Les Moonves resign, put the money, 120 million into a guarantor's trust and only after the investigation decide whether he should get that money or not, will be fired without a penny.</p><p>By doing it that way, they have effectively already tilted the decision towards him getting something. Perhaps arguably a far better way would have been to have suspended him, pending the investigation with no money put in any form of trust, and then decide whether he goes with the full amount minus whatever or whether he's allowed to resign because the allegations don't stand up or he gets fired without a penny.</p><p>At the moment, it would be very difficult for them to do that. But the board needs to remember, the world is watching what happens at \"Cbs\". And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.</p><p>The closing bell on Wall Street --</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>Trading is over.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

That's going to do it for \"Hala Gorani  Tonight.\"  \"Quest Means Business\" is coming up next.  </p><p> RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  It's an hour until the closing  bell on Wall Street.  The last chance to make your trade.  The Dow, the  good gains of the day have evaporated.  The good news is the losses are  small.  Look at the break apart of the Dow.  You have the Nike at the top,  you have Boeing towards the bottom.  We'll explain why, because let me show  you, the market drivers of the day.  </p><p>CBS is down, Les Moonves is out, the #MeToo Movement hits the C-suite.   Alibaba and Snap lose key executives, all changed, but tech.  And Nike, I  showed you the shares near the top of the Dow, it's controversial campaign  is getting real market results.  Live from the world's financial capital on  a rainy day in New York City.  It's Monday, it's the 10th of September.   I'm Richard Quest.  I mean business.  </p><p> Good evening at a new earlier time, but the same quality program.  It's a  pivotal moment for the #MeToo Movement and for CBS.  The Chief Executive  Les Moonves is leaving the company immediately, pushed out by fresh  accusations of sexual assault.  Moonves is the first Fortune 500 CEO to be  ousted through the #MeToo era.  The controversy isn't over because the  details of Moonves' payout is still to be decided.  CBS shares have  regained some of the early losses.  They are still down for the day, that's  partly because with Moonves gone, the battle for control of CBS has come to  an end.  Our media correspondent Brian Stelter is following it all.  </p><p> BRIAN STELTER, MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Hello.  </p><p> QUEST:  You've worked in the media business throughout all your  professional career, explain.  </p><p> STELTER:  There's never been an earthquake like this.  It is as simple as  that.  We've talked about a lot of #MeToo figures, a lot of men who have  lost their jobs in the past year, but nothing like this, nothing like the  Fortune 500 CEO, who vowed to fight on and stayed in the role for six  weeks, but was eventually forced out this time yesterday.  </p><p> QUEST:  Before we talk about the CBS side of the equation.  When Weinstein  happened and all the #MeToo happened, did Moonves know that - that did you  think that he had this entire smoldering volcano waiting to erupt within  ...  </p><p> STELTER:  You just asked me the most interesting question of this story.  I  believe he did know.  I believe he did know he was vulnerable to this and  that makes me wonder something else, did he go picking a fight inside his  company on purpose?  Did he go trying to fight with his controlling  shareholder, trying to wrest away control of CBS on purpose, to create  another story line?  Because, really, we have seen the merger of two story  lines here, this tug of war, which he lost to Shari Redstone over the  future of CBS, and this #MeToo case.  </p><p> I wonder if ever the actor, ever the Hollywood star, Moonves went out and  tried to make his own story, but no matter what, it ended badly for him.  </p><p> QUEST:  Okay, let's talk about CBS.  They've put $120 million into a  guarantor trust, he would have gotten $140 million, $20 million will go to  charities or to organizations.  But I mean, how does CBS justify not  suspending him and then firing him or reinstating if the allegations are  true?  Why allow him to resign?  </p><p> STELTER:  I think the answer is that you're talking about a board of  directors that was mostly made of up of Moonves' old friends, his pals.  He  was essentially running this board.  It was mostly elderly, mostly white- man board.  That has changed as of Sunday, now there's been a shakeup of  the board, but I think a lot of this had to do with Moonves surrounded by  his friends, believing he could get through this.  </p><p> Eventually, then the law firms came in.  Eventually more women came  forward.  Eventually these negotiations of Redstone continued to progress  and it became in the words of one source, untenable for Moonves to  continue.  </p><p> [15:05:12]  </p><p> STELTER:  But even now, as you said, $120 million still possibly on the  table, incredible development.  </p><p> QUEST:  Okay, on that, let's just look at the national amusements - what's  the agreement?  What is the - have they agreed to do?  </p><p> STELTER:  Everybody agrees to put down the weapons.  Everybody has  surrendered.  </p><p> QUEST:  So what happens?  </p><p> STELTER:  So now CBS, Redstone tightens her control on the company.  This  is the Redstone family.  Sumner Redstone of course, the owner for a couple  of a decades, now her daughter - Shari - is in charge.  Now, going forward,  there's talk about a possible CBS-Viacom recombination.  </p><p> However, I think what's more likely is we're going to see better merge for  CBS and this board has reaffirmed the - the phones are open, the lines are  open, call with your offers.  I would be surprise if a year or two from  now, CBS is not in the hands of either some big tech company or some other  big buyer.  </p><p> QUEST:  Extraordinary developments.  Good to see you.  Thank you, sir.   Good to see you always.  </p><p> STELTER:  Thanks.  </p><p> QUEST:  We're going to continue talking about it.  Les Moonves may be gone,  the question shareholders and activists want the answer to is how much he  should take with him?  As I was just describing, it depends on the outcome  of the investigation into his alleged misconduct.  Now, the full payout  would be $140 million, of which $20 million would go to organizations to  support the #MeToo Movement and Equality for Women in the Workplace.  </p><p> But as we just said, $120 million is in trust.  It would only return to CBS  if  the board decides that Moonves could be fired for cause.  Ronan Farrow  who led the investigative journalism and wrote the original report and the  update just over the weekend tell CNN it was the idea that Moonves would  get  anything at all that prompted more women to come forward.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> RONAN FARROW, CONTRIBUTING WRITER, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  One of the most  important things about this story is, this is the first Fortune 500 CEO to  step down for these reasons in the #MeToo era.  This is someone who was  supposed to be immune to criticism, that many of these are women stayed  quiet about for years because they thought he had complete impunity.  </p><p> So, yes, the reluctance of this Board to act and he has a lot of these  women, that's troubling.  It shows how far we still have to go.  But also,  this is a story of how far we have come because no one thought we would be  here.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Joining me in the C-Suite is Davia Tamin, media reputation  strategist.  The C-Suite is appropriate for us to talk about these events.   Your study and your research shows the number of CEOs or the number of  people accused on what's happened to them.  </p><p> DAVIA TAMIN, MEDIA REPUTATION STRATEGIST:  As of today, it's 700, so Les  Moonves makes 700.  </p><p> QUEST:  Seven hundred people accused?  </p><p> TAMIN:  High profile people accused since Weinstein.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, and what happened to most of them?  </p><p> TAMIN:  Well, most of them have - there was no most.  So, a certain  percentage, about half have left.  About half still remain or they're  continuing to be under investigation.  So it's not clear.  I think the  amount of time that it takes between investigation and final resolution is  shortening now from what it was a year ago.  </p><p> QUEST:  The idea that Les Moonves could walk out the door with more than  $100 million, what would you say?  </p><p> TAMIN:  You know, I don't find that the worst thing in the world.  I think  that he lived a life - I'm not supporting him by any stretch of the  imagination, don't get me wrong.  But he lived according to some rules,  those rules changed somewhere about a year ago, about two years ago now.   And I am most concerned that he is caught and that he sets a precedent now  that others who do this are caught.  It's a game change and it's a culture  change.  </p><p> QUEST:  I agree, and if it was a normal job, and we're talking about  $100,000.00 which for a top executive is not a fortune, that would be fine,  but we're talking about $100 million.  We're talking about life-changing  events.  All right, he's earned similar amounts.  He's earned $20 million  to $30  million for the last 20 years, he's not short of the price of a cup  of tea.  But it's symbolic.  </p><p> TAMIN:  It's symbolic and it's probably - if they find that there is an  investigation that there's real merit to all of this, then it should be.  </p><p> QUEST:  What does it say then that he's been allowed to resign pending an  investigation where the up side is vast and the Board is probably in his  favor?  </p><p> TAMIN:  Well, he's been allowed, he's been made to resign, right?  So he  hasn't been allowed to resign.  </p><p> QUEST:  I'll resign for $100 million.  </p><p> TAMIN:  I would, too, tomorrow.  But I think that ht e point is, he has -  he has lost all the reputational equity that he ever had.  So whatever he  walks away with, he's lost it all.  </p><p> QUEST:  Let's talk on that front.  The #MeToo Movement, at some point,  there will be - when I say cut off, I don't mean a cut off in terms -  because bad behavior, appalling activities, must always - should always be  held to account.  But at some stage, people will say, \"Okay, he did this,  but he shouldn't be fired.\"  </p><p> [15:10:13]  </p><p> TAMIN:  Yes, you know what ...  </p><p> QUEST:  Are not there yet?  </p><p> TAMIN:  No, we are not there yet.  </p><p> QUEST:  And what about Moonves?  </p><p> TAMIN:  No, no.  I know.  We're not there yet for anyone.  We are way far  away from that.  We are so much at the tip of this iceberg.  There is so  much underneath the surface at this point, that there is a long way to go.   And I think Boards know that, I think corporate Boards know that.  I think  that's why they're so fixed on looking at culture now and toxic culture and  all the other stuff because they know what the viability is.  </p><p> QUEST:  What do you think - and this is a sort of a no win question ...  </p><p> TAMIN:  All right.  </p><p> QUEST:   ... for you.  What do you think the right way for a Board - I  mean, at what point is dismissal the answer for events happening 30 years  ago in a different culture?  </p><p> TAMIN:  That's a hard one.  It really is a hard one, but I think that when  they come to light that you have to work on the facts that you get and I  think dismissal is appropriate.  </p><p> QUEST:  Let's talk about Serena, let's listen to what she had to say at the  Open, after she was fined.  She lost and was fined.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SERENA WILLIAMS, PROFESIONAL TENNIS PLAYER:  I'm here fighting for women's  rights and for women's equality and for all kinds of stuff and for me to  say, thief and for him to take a game, it made me feel like it was a sexist  remark.  I mean, like, he's never took a game from a man because they said  thief.  For me, it blows my mind.  </p><p> The fact that I have to go through this is just an example for the next  person that has emotions and that want to express themselves and they want  to be a strong woman and they're going to be allowed to go that because of  today, maybe it didn't work out for me, but it's going to work out for the  next person.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Are you with her on that?  </p><p> TAMIN:  I think that rules have to be equal and I think that responses have  to be equal and I think that's more unconscious bias is what I think, but I  think that the rules haven't been and they won't be for a long time, but  you have to call out what you think is biased, and she's doing it.  </p><p> QUEST:  And it's really maybe not for us to say whether it was or wasn't.   I mean, calling the umpire thief is pretty serious stuff in a competition  of a sport or ...  </p><p> TAMIN:  Well, have others, though, called him thief before?  That is the  question, right?  It's got to be equally applied and it hasn't been for so  long, we don't even know what that looks like anymore.  </p><p> QUEST:  Exactly.  </p><p> TAMIN:  Right?  So we're finding out though because we're finding out by  testing the limits.  </p><p> QUEST:  Great that you came in to help us test them.  Please come back  again.  </p><p> TAMIN:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you.  A look at the markets.  The Dow is struggling to go  green, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ set to snap a four-day streak and tech shares  bouncing back from a rough week.  </p><p> Actually, you know, I do need to keep reminding myself, and new perhaps,  that we are in - I look at those numbers, and I'm so used to it being after  the closing bell. but it's not.  We are in the last hour of trade, where  the final decisions are made on how the day should end.  And to learn the  Dow may be off just a couple of tootling points today.  There will be  moments where you will truly see the reason and wisdom of why we have come  to you an hour earlier as we consider - continue tonight, no one can  shoulder the responsibilities of chairman and CEO forever, sage words from  Jack Ma.  He has built a $400 million business from his apartment, and now  he's leaving Alibaba.  </p><p> And get your phones ready.  That's mine over there, where is it?  It's over  there.  I'll be asking you to weigh in on Elon Musk's future at Tesla after  he made strange promises and ideas and then smoked a joint on radio.  </p><p> [15:15:00]  </p><p> Something completely different, absolutely new, we have never done anything  like this before and few would be quite so brave, some might say foolish,  but here on international television, you are going to have a say on what  we are doing and it all requires you to get your phone, your tablet, your  computer and whatever electronic device you've got and go to cnn.com/join.   Now, as you'll see here from my phone, this is what you see, well that  might be a little bit tricky for you to see.  So let me show you over here.  </p><p> This is the gist of it.  You're going to see the question and today's  question is Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk is showing and we'll discuss it.  We  will show you the results and the percentages of what people believe.  Now,  the question, and how we're getting to the question, so far, Les Moonves  has been pushed out - that was on top of our program.  Jack Ma is leaving  while on top, so you have two CEOs going in dignity, grace and delight or  not in the case of Moonves, Jack Ma absolutely, he's going in his own  terms.  </p><p> So, let's put it to the Board members.  And you are the Board in this  particular case, what should Elon Musk do?  What should Tesla do with Elon  Musk?  Firstly, they should stay the course with him, stay with it.  He  should resign or be forced to resign, a bit like Moonves and go off with  all of your stock options and your money, and he should be fired, out the  door, out the window because of course of what he did - smoking a joint on  national radio saying, \"I'm going to take the company private,\" and then  not finding he couldn't do it.  Thirdly, all the other weird and wonderful  eccentric, bizarre things.  What should he did?  I'll show you the results.   cnn.com/join.  </p><p> From sporty jock to tech billionaire, Jack Ma's remarkable journey as the  leader of Alibaba is coming to an end.  Next year, he will hand over the  reins to Daniel Zhang - the company's Chief Executive will take over Ma's  position as Chairman.  Investors don't want to see him go.  News of his  retirement on Wall Street put a minor dent into the shares.  </p><p>Ma's departure comes in a turbulent time for Alibaba.  Its stock has lost  around 10% of its value over the year, as China's tech industry grapples  with trade tensions and tighter regulations.  In his native China, Ma has  become a business icon.  Matt Rivers reports on his legacy from Beijing.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> JACK MA, CHAIRMAN, ALIBABA:  No banks would accept it ...  </p><p> MATT RIVERS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Jack Ma, one of China's richest men, a  giant in tech, a man who has stood side by side with presidents, loves  kung-fu novels, always has.  He has a genre called Wu-xia and he says, they  teach valuable lessons.  </p><p>MA:  Whenever you want to be a great people, a great company, you have to  work very hard.  You have to suffer a lot of terrible things -- wraths and  terrible things -- before you be a hero.  It is spiritual.  It is  spiritual.  And think out of box.  You have to think out of box to win.  </p><p> RIVERS:  And win he has.  It's been 19 years since he co-founded, Alibaba  and the company that began in a Hangzou, China apartment has grown into one  of the largest internet companies in the world.  </p><p> [15:20:01]  </p><p> RIVERS:  In 2014, Alibaba $25 billion IPO was then the largest in US  history.  Ant Financial, the company's finance subsidiary has invested  billions of dollars in companies around the globe.  Alibaba's e-commerce  sites have fundamentally changed the way hundreds of millions of people  shop in China and its mobile payment platform revolutionized how people pay  for what they buy.  </p><p> All the while, Ma has arguably become the most public face of China's tech  boom, a charismatic, often inspiring figure for ordinary people; nicknamed  Papa Ma on Chinese internet.  </p><p>Ma has faced his share of criticism of course.  Critics say, his company  nearly copied e-Bay, and thrived only because the Communist Party wanted  it, too.  China's protectionist policies, so the argument goes, ensured  that Alibaba had no real competition making its rise not only easier, but  in some ways inevitable.  </p><p> There is some truth there, but no matter your view, the facts remain.   Alibaba is a juggernaut of a company and its leader is routinely mentioned  in the same sentence as other (inaudible) of tech - think Jobs, or Musk, or  Gates, and like Gates, Ma says life is about more than a job.  </p><p> Can you imagine yourself  sitting back, relaxing?  </p><p>MA:  No.  I have so much education, environment, and going around and  meeting the entrepreneurs, I've done a lot of things.  Life is so fun and  never ever focus on one thing.  We come to this world not to  work.  We  come to this to enjoy life.  This is what I believe.  </p><p> RIVERS:  Ma has said he wants to focus more on philanthropy.  The former  English teacher has always focused on improving education in China, and as  for his company, widely considered to have a deep management pool.  He told  CNN in 2016 that whenever he does step down, it will be in good hands.  </p><p>MA:  Tomorrow is more difficult.  The day after tomorrow is beautiful, but  most people die tomorrow evening.  So we have to realize that good things  can never be achieved easily.  Life is not only about Alibaba.  I have run  my first 100 meters, I should give the base to the next generation.  </p><p> RIVERS:  Matt Rivers, CNN, Beijing.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> QUEST:  So, New York University - NYU's marketing profesor, Scott Galloway  is with us.  </p><p> SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY:  Good to see you, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  At this new earlier hour, Paul La Monica, too.  </p><p> PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Thanks.  </p><p> QUEST:  Thanks, too.  Jack Ma is talked of in reverential tones.  He's  leaving Alibaba, even though he hasn't handed it, isn't it the equivalent  of when Gates left Microsoft?  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  That's actually probably the right analogy.  And not only that,  he's leaving.  I mean, typically, the CEOs of large companies like this  give up power with the same (inaudible) and generosity of an African  dictator, so to have a guy say, \"I'm going back at the age of 54 to work on  education.\"  He's ringing the bell at the top of the market, taking a  victory lap.  It's a real credit to the ecosystem and the internet economy  in China because they are now creating enterprise value.  The stock hasn't  taken a hit.  </p><p> Now, this was a good day for China and Jack Ma and Alibaba.  It shows that  this ecosystem is sustainable and for real.  </p><p> QUEST:  And in doing so, Paul La Monica, it shows also that they have put  in place a worthy successor.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, you had a great succession plan here.  Daniel Zhang has  been the CEO for the past couple of years, so having him take over the  executive chairman role makes sense.  Joe Tsai also is a very public face  of the Alibaba - the Vice Chairman.  When you listen to Alibaba earnings  calls and other announcements over the past couple of years, Ma has already  taken a back seat.  </p><p> He is of course the most well known person at this company, but I think a  lot of people on Wall Street already recognize, and around the rest of the  world that there is more to Alibaba than just Jack Ma and as you pointed  out with Microsoft and Bill Gates, it's a company that is still doing quite  well now ...  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but in the departure, it certainly faltered.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  It faltered a little bit.  </p><p> QUEST:  But there doesn't seem to be a suggestion, and you're right.  With  2%, 3% or whatever it has fallen that you saw in Alibaba is not indicative  of any great concern that the market has.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, this is a jargon item.  What's unusual is, as Americans,  we tend to be - we are narcissists.  We think that the epicenter of all  innovation is within the seven-mile bike ride of SFO International, but if  you look at the product development roadmap of Alibaba -- payments, hail a  car, buy something, incredible advertising ecosystem -- their product road  map, agility, ability to innovate quickly, makes us look tired.  It makes  us look like - I don't want to come up with a company, but he has created  something incredible.  </p><p> QUEST:  Snap - I'm sorry.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  You first.   </p><p> QUEST:  Did I say something I shouldn't have done?  </p><p> [15:25:02]  </p><p> LA MONICA:   God bless you.  It's been a very, very challenging time for  this company.  Arguably, it's one that maybe shouldn't have gone public at  least in this format.  Now, you have the last of the kind of so-called  adult supervision for Evan Spiegel with Imran Khah, a former Wall Street  analyst, now leaving the company.  I think there are a lot of legitimate  concerns about what the strategy is going to be and the fact that people  who buy Snapchat stock, buy everywhere because you get no voting rights.   None.  </p><p> QUEST:  I keep forgetting that.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  So if you think that Evan Spiegel is the next Steve Jobs, he  isn't.  Then, guess what?  By all means, buy that stock, but if you have  any skepticism whatsoever about  his ability to lead Snapchat and not just  create something that Facebook and Instagram will rip off five years later?   Stay away.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  That's true of all these guys.  They all have dual class  shareholder systems.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, but no votes is really ...  </p><p> QUEST:  Yes, Snap was particularly egregious in giving no votes.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  There's a bigger issue at play here and that is Snap is a good  company, very innovative, great product and it's going out of business.   And the reason why, is that we have in our economy let one company  aggregate four the top five apps in the world.  Eighty percent of our time  on this is in app, one company controls it all.  This isn't your phone,  Richard.  This is a delivery vehicle for company called Facebook.  </p><p> It's an invasive species putting all other companies out of business.  Snap  is a walking dead because we've let monopolies run amuck.  Snap is going  away, it's just a  matter of time.  It will be below five bucks a share  within 12 months and it will be picked up by Google or one of the other  guys.  </p><p> QUEST:  And for those viewers who are sort of crying concern, who have  followed closely because I know you've watched very closely.  My Snap  investment, you'll be pleased to know that in today's fall, my Snap shares  are down 66% since I've opened them.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  See, you've got snapped.  You purchased Snap.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> QUEST:  I bought - no, but then I don't use Facebook and a variety of other  things much either.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  But do you use Instagram?  </p><p> QUEST:  Should we move on?  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Twitter?  </p><p> QUEST:  Yes.  Well, sometimes.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Yes, go on - at our age, go on Snap.  You feel like you're going  to slip and break a hip.  It is so focused and so set up on young people  and that its power, but if you look at the user metrics, like every other  app in the world, Facebook is pulling the same move.  They have technology  that goes out, registers - any app in the world is getting traction about  those features.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  My kid - they're not ready for Snap, but they know what  Facebook is.  They have no idea what Snapchat is.  They already know what  Facebook is at nine and five.  They don't know about Snap ...  </p><p> QUEST:  So likely to talk about - don't go too far.  Go on and have a cup  of tea.  Commiserate with me on my Snap stock.  Donald Trump is starting  his economic wins on Twitter.  Unfortunately, one stat that he mentioned  was wrong . It's wrong 62 times, and now, even the White House won't defend  the President on it.  We'll have more after this.  </p><p> [15:30:00]  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [15:30:00] QUEST:  I'm Richard Quest, there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment.  But I'll ask the chief executive of Norwegian about the  takeover talks surrounding his airline and beyond.  He'll be answering  that.</p><p> And Donald Trump takes his economic posts a step too far on Twitter, we'll  share just how wrong he was.  Before that, this is Cnn, and on this  network, the facts, they always come first.  Hurricane Florence has  intensified and it's now category 4 hurricane as it moves toward the United  States.</p><p>North Carolina's governor is warning people could lose electricity and  utility services for several days once the storm hits.  It's expected to be  one of the strongest hurricanes in a landfall there in some two decades.   Sweden is headed for political uncertainty after both major centrist  coalitions failed to win a majority in Sunday's vote.</p><p> The ruling center-left social democrats and their coalition are leading the  center-right bloc by just a half point -- percentage point.  As for the  Sweden democrats which is a far right party with roots in the neo-Nazi  movement, they are in third place, but did receive nearly a fifth of the  vote.</p><p> Trump(ph) and the UN are warning of catastrophic consequences of a military  offensive in Syria's Idlib province.  The Syrian government says it's  carrying out surgical airstrikes, but has not started a ground assault.   The White Helmet volunteer rescue group reported dozens of the estimate  intense escalations over the weekend.</p><p> President Trump often criticizes the media for not giving him due credit  when it comes to the economy.  So today, he made a boast about his  verifiably false -- and the reason we're going into this in some detail is  because time and again you hear the talk of \"fake news\", \"fake news\".</p><p> Well, today, even the top White House economist admitted the president was  wrong.  Donald Trump -- this is the tweet.  Donald Trump tweeted that GDP  rate 4.2 percent is higher than the unemployment rate report, 9 percent for  the first time in over a 100 years.</p><p> Here's the Fed's data going back to numb too -- I know, 1948, unemployment  in red, GDP in blue.  GDP is higher than unemployment 62 times most  recently in 2006, so it was left to the Chairman of the White House Council  of Economic Advisors to put in perspectives, saying someone must have added  an extra zero by the time the facts got to Trump.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KEVIN HASSETT, ECONOMIST &amp; CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS:  What is  true is that, that it's the highest too in 10 years.  And at some point,  somebody probably conveyed it to him adding a zero to that, and they  shouldn't have done that.</p><p> And I can say that at least numbers -- we speak here at the White House are  grateful for -- and when the press finds mistakes that we make, we don't  like making mistakes but we're grateful when they're pointed out because we  want to correct them.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Sarah Westwood at the White House -- oh, dear, Sarah, tell me, is  there embarrassment or is this sort of just a feeling of well, that's just  Donald, that's just the president.</p><p> SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Well, Richard, what we saw today  was a rare acknowledgement of error from an administration official when  Kevin Hassett; the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors came out  and said that President Trump was off by about 90 years when he cited the  time frame in which the GDP has been higher than the unemployment rate.</p><p> President Trump spent a lot of time on Twitter this morning touting  economic growth as part of his struggle to change the conversation away  from the controversy facing his White House.  But as you mentioned, he sort  of created a dust-up of his own when he is getting the numbers so wrong  when it comes to economic growth.</p><p> [15:35:00]  And all of his focus on the economy is coming, we should note  just days after former President Obama claimed that it was him who deserved  credit for this boom that we've seen in the GDP for the drop in the  unemployment rate. </p><p> Kevin Hassett said a large part of his presentation to reporters today just  moments ago at the White House was disproving that claim from Obama,  although Kevin Hassett said that he was not dispatched specifically because  of Obama's comments.</p><p> QUEST:  Sarah Westwood at the White House, thank you.  And the President  Trump's blue-collar workers -- the number of jobs are growing in their best  rate in 130 years according to analysis from the \"Washington Post\".  Now,  this is about goods-producing jobs like mining and construction,  apparently, they are up more than 3 percent in the last year.</p><p> And employment in rural areas and small towns where the great -- recession  from the great recovery has been slow is now getting better.  They're  growing at an annual rate of around 5 percent in the Trump era.  Each day  this week, we'll be taking a look at economic issues facing American voters  as they head to the pivotal midterms, a balance of power in Washington is  at stake.</p><p> Clare Sebastian asked of a strong economy will be enough to deal  Republicans and Donald Trump a victory in November.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We've accomplished an  economic turnaround of historic proportions.</p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN (voice-over):  If Americans vote with their wallets  this election season, the president has some reason to feel confident.   Economic growth is at a four-year high. </p><p> TRUMP:  These numbers are very sustainable.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Unemployment at half century lows -- </p><p> TRUMP:  We've created 3.7 million jobs since election. </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  And stock market is hitting record.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Donald Trump has created an environment that the  markets really like.  With regulatory reform, again with the tax cuts, so  he does get some credit.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Tax cuts is this administration's signature policy, refueling  strong corporate profits including a record-setting courses for America's  banks.  And yet experts question whether the President's campaign promise  of a tax cut for all has materialized. </p><p> TRUMP:  And we will massively cut taxes for the middle class -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What we saw is we have a non-traditional investment  cycle.  Companies taking that additional cash and reducing debt, buying  back stock, increasing dividends.  The best majority of consumers reported  they did not notice a meaningful change in their after-tax take-home pay  post-tax reform.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Despite the low unemployment, those consumers are also facing  stagnant wage growth and signs of rising prices due to tariffs.  The  president has not only asked voters to trust him on trade. </p><p> TRUMP:  First, and we're going to have to tariff your cars.  They said when  can we show up? When can we be there? Oh, would tomorrow be OK? Oh, folks  stick with us, stick with us.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  He has also provided pockets of short-term relief aimed at the  mostly Republican agricultural states. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The president has promised substantial aid, many  billions of dollars to farmers who are rightly concerned about the story  being tariffs and other action by the Chinese that could hurt the U.S.  middle America.  Whether that's enough is unclear.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  What is clear for the scandal-plagued administration, the  strong U.S. economy sends a powerful political message.</p><p> TRUMP:  Once again, we are the economic envy of the entire world.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  When the president and his party will continue to trumpet.   Clare Sebastian, Cnn, New York.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> QUEST:  The power of this is quite extraordinary.  We're handing some of  that power to you with our question and -- Tesla's chief executive, CEO  Elon Musk should stay the course, resign or be fired? Cnn.com-slash-join,  and we will get your final results in just a moment all for you.</p><p> What should Musk do? What should the board do? When we come back.</p><p> [15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  We have about 19 minutes left on the trading day, and the Dow --  just now, the Dow has looked, the Dow -- oh, as you can see, the gains,  though really look nice impressive gains, though we're here at the  beginning, the gain and portended well for the holiday.</p><p> They sort of evaporated and instead we've just bumped along the bottom  throughout the session, and it was the uncertainty over global trade, we  have Donald Trump threatening more tariffs.  </p><p> And so for instance, you heard obviously the comments about Ford and the  Ford car that's not going to be built in the U.S. even though the tariffs  have been -- Apple was hurt and Apple is down one and a third percent, one  of the biggest losers on the Dow so far.</p><p> But Nike is at the top of the Dow, and that's interesting.  Online sales  jumped 30 percent after the ad campaign with Colin Kaepernick.  Scott  Galloway and Paul La Monica are with me.  This is fascinating because Nike  renews the contract with Kaepernick, he can -- and he continues to be a  spokesman, not only that, they make a great big deal about it.</p><p> If you believe what you want, you'll risk everything.</p><p> SCOTT GALLOWAY, CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY STERN  SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  What does it tell us?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Worst business move of 2018, was Google match showing with the  Senate Intelligence Committee hearings, the best business move of 2018 was  Nike choosing Colin Kaepernick as their 30th anniversary spokesperson -- </p><p> QUEST:  Why? </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Because Richard, they just did the math.  Let's break it down,  Nike does 35 billion revenues, 15 billion domestically, 20 billion  internationally, if you're buying $115 pair of flying Air Blazers in the  U.S., I mean through young, an urban dweller, it means you lean  progressive.</p><p> They put $1 to $3 billion at risk domestically, of that $20 billion abroad,  you're a Brit, how many people abroad feel that the U.S. is doing things  really well? That they've got a handle on race relations here.</p><p> They put at risk, $1 to $3 billion of their business to strengthen their  relationship with $32 billion of their business, this was the genius move  of 2018.</p><p> QUEST:  Even though you end up with an edifying sight of people burning  sneakers, Nike sneakers.</p><p> PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT:  Social media is such an  enigma right now.  How much of that was legitimate with people really  taking their $100-plus sneakers and burning them.</p><p> How much of it was fake news if you will? And to your point, China, Chinese  consumers are not going to get all up in arms about Colin Kaepernick taking  a knee during the national anthem.  And China is now after the U.S., pretty  much the most important market for Nike.</p><p> I think it made sense when they did the math both demographically and  geographically, it wasn't a bad marketing move -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right, so let's do -- I'm not being rude when I open my phone.  I  assure you, it's the Tesla question -- </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  The Tesla question in which we are asking.  Should -- what should  the board, what should Elon Musk do? Should he be fired? And he has various  motive, but should they ask him -- </p><p> LA MONICA:  OK -- </p><p> QUEST:  Should they ask him to please go away? Should he resign or should  he just carry on? You're already shaking your head -- </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, because there's a fourth choice that's not there that I  would vote -- </p><p> QUEST:  Hey! </p><p> LA MONICA:  For, sorry, he shouldn't stay the course, he's got to start  acting like an adult, and he's got to hire a COO -- </p><p> [15:45:00]  QUEST:  That's a given -- </p><p> LA MONICA:  To help him out, just like he has at SpaceX, that doesn't mean  he should be fired or quit, but he shouldn't stay the course either.  He  can't keep doing what he's doing.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  We're the mother of all enablers here, I feel like the tech  innovators collectively -- those of us who are fathers, we have a memo to - - Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Larry Page put down the blond, put on a tie,  show up.  There's -- </p><p> QUEST:  That's not -- that's a recipe for corporate successes. </p><p> GALLOWAY:  But on a tactical corporate -- on a tactical level of some  ministers and corporate boards, there should be a committee of the board  that sits down with them and says if this aberrant reckless behavior  continues, we're going to kick you up with chairman and bring in another  CEO.</p><p> They have -- boards have a responsibility to be the adults in the room,  there's no adult in the room, the board consists of people, he built out a  solar city -- </p><p> LA MONICA:  Right -- </p><p> GALLOWAY:  His brother -- this is really -- this is a failure on corporate  governance.</p><p> LA MONICA:  Is this a problem though that they don't have a CEO? Think of  the worst case scenario.  Mark Zuckerberg starts putting on a hoodie again  and acts like the jerk that they portray him in the social network as,  Sheryl Sandberg could be the new CEO of Facebook, no problem, everything is  fine.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well -- </p><p> LA MONICA:  There's no one at Tesla that can take over on a moment's  notice, they have no bench.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  But that's what the problem is.  Everyone is so afraid to lose  Elon Musk, if I were a board member, I'd say where does Elon Musk go if he  loses Tesla? Is he going to go and be the CEO of Fiat-Chrysler, they need  to have a serious conversation with him.</p><p> QUEST:  Good night to you two for coming here today, good to see you -- </p><p> LA MONICA:  And you -- </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Thank you sir -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you very much.  The final score on what should Tesla's CEO  do? Seventy three percent of you -- </p><p> (BELL RINGING) </p><p> Stay the course, sorry, Paul La Monica.  After the break, Norwegian takes  aim at Argentina and Asia in a full throttle drive for growth.  The chief  exec says it's time to harvest the results.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Part of being in a recession, the pace starts falling and prices  are rising.  And you might argue it's the worst time in the world for an  airline to introduce new routes in Argentina.  Not so says Norwegian Air  shuttle which is selling cheap and cheerful domestic flights in the country  and that it intends to disrupt the local market.</p><p> The low cost carrier Norwegian is also venturing into Asia, and the  earnings seems to speak for themselves, passenger numbers are growing, the  number of routes and destinations are growing.  The fleet is one of the  youngest in the business.  Now, the company is not making any money, not at  least at the moment.</p><p> [15:50:00]  And certainly the level of debt that it's taken on board is  very high, dangerously so.  Norwegians caught the eye of Carsten Spohr of  Lufthansa and Willie Walsh of IAG.  The chief executive told me, all this  attention is flattering.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BJORN KJOS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NORWEGIAN AIRLINES:  Really, he's by  the way, he's a very smart guy, and ideally it's a very good airline, so  they do a lot of things there.  And I can't -- I can't actually here think  about it.  I would have done the same if I had these issues of emotions,  I'd be angry at them.</p><p> No, he's exactly the guy, and we are on the stock exchange, everybody can  buy somebody at the stock exchange.  So -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but as soon as Willie said he was going to with IAG, Carsten  of Lufthansa said I'm in it, I'm in as well.  Are you having talks with  anybody?</p><p> KJOS:  No, we haven't announced anything for sale.  They are coming to us,  but the thing to think about it is, it's better to be pretty shaky than  most.</p><p> QUEST:  It is, but just we're clear, Carsten Spohr of Lufthansa group is  also interested in you, are you interested in doing something with  Lufthansa?</p><p> KJOS:  I cannot say anything about that.  As you know, it's because it's --  what I have to say maybe recorded on the stock exchange.  I can -- my  opinions, about that, both of these airlines are very good airlines.</p><p> QUEST:  The Asia expansion has gone well, the U.S., you've won all the  battles in most of them anyway in terms of recognition.  And you've now got  attention.  What is it you want to do?</p><p> KJOS:  I want to -- I want to give the Argentineans the possibility to fly  on these and fast, and have a good flight and learn maybe to fly longer  maybe with us to Europe.</p><p> QUEST:  But what do you want to do with Norwegian? What do you see as its - - because everywhere you look now, you're being nipped after the heels, the  legacy, the level has come along, Euro wings is now going long, you're  smiling again.  Euro wings is going longer, France is coming along with you  and all the others.</p><p> KJOS:  There will always be others.</p><p> QUEST:  There will always be others.  But they're attacking you on all  sides.</p><p> KJOS:  Not actually, they are -- some routes, but all this have  competitors, it's just about two that you have.  At the end, we got up to  scale and we certainly served so many citizens in U.S. and we have a huge  network in Europe.</p><p> So we are at the level now, we should definitely release our harvesting  now. </p><p> QUEST:  And what will it take though to become profitable?</p><p> KJOS:  Well, we ramped up the long haul this year tremendously, no, they  are -- they're all on the peak now, we can -- no, we can start harvesting.   So we should -- our future as I see it will be bright.</p><p> QUEST:  But it is important for you, I mean you're arguably -- Jeff Bezos  of Amazon has spent the entire history of the company until now taking  losses to build for market share and to build the corner stone that we've  got.  At some point, you're going to have to make money while your  investors and shareholders are going to say, this is not worth -- just in  the low.  </p><p> KJOS:  But then again, out of 17 years we have made money for 15 years, and  I wouldn't have gone into this I didn't think I would -- it would be  profitable.</p><p> QUEST:  Brexit, finally on Brexit.  Now, you're going to tell me that  you'll be fine because of your different subsidiaries.  You're going to  tell me that you've got the U.K. subsidiary which will handle all the U.K.  stuff, and the Irish subsidiary will handle -- and anyway, Norway is part  of the European common area for aviation.</p><p> But you must still be worried.</p><p> KJOS:  Well, actually, we are fit(ph) to the task(ph), the only thing I  don't understand is what are they going to do with all the bilateral  agreements that you used to have, they have to refix(ph) it.  So it's a  huge amount of work they have to go through, but they can do it, I mean,  it's -- </p><p> QUEST:  No, let's take for example your U.K. routes to the U.S.  London  Gatwick is crucial to you -- </p><p> KJOS:  Yes, it is -- </p><p> QUEST:  It's your largest base -- </p><p> KJOS:  Yes, that's right -- </p><p> QUEST:  London Gatwick is crucial to you, the U.S., U.K. flights will have  to be renegotiated.  I'm confident that, yes, that the British and the  Americans will fix it because they need open sky, everybody needs opened  sky, everybody needs the passengers and the two-ways(ph) to really take the  world, that is the most -- well, actually, today, 20 percent of all jobs,  job creation comes from this industry.</p><p> [15:55:00]  You would -- nobody would want to stop that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Five minutes before the close of trade in New York, the -- this is  the scenario, this is the way things look.  In Europe, the markets were all  higher, even the FTSE managed to eat out a very small gain.  The  encouragement came from the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier who claims  the Brexit deal could happen by November.</p><p> The -- no, got 2.3 percent.  The reason for that very simply, the  government now seemingly will respect the EU budget rules or at least it  seems less, and the scenario being it's less likely that there will be a  full blown showdown between the new populist government in Rome and the --  and with Brussels.</p><p> But it's still early days, that's just one day, and that is just Monday.   As to the New York market, a good start to the morning and then it drifted  off and then it completely evaporated into the afternoon, and this is  really -- this is your trade talks, this is your worries, this is your  earnings and all eyes on the things on what is likely to be for the future.</p><p> Very small losses though considering the sort of day, trading is just about  finished, we'll have a profitable moment after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, \"Cbs\", the board of directors  effectively put their fingers on the thumb on the scale when they decided  to let Les Moonves resign, put the money, 120 million into a guarantor's  trust and only after the investigation decide whether he should get that  money or not, will be fired without a penny.</p><p> By doing it that way, they have effectively already tilted the decision  towards him getting something.  Perhaps arguably a far better way would  have been to have suspended him, pending the investigation with no money  put in any form of trust, and then decide whether he goes with the full  amount minus whatever or whether he's allowed to resign because the  allegations don't stand up or he gets fired without a penny.</p><p> At the moment, it would be very difficult for them to do that.  But the  board needs to remember, the world is watching what happens at \"Cbs\".  And  that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York.   Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. </p><p> The closing bell on Wall Street -- </p><p> (BELL RINGING) </p><p> Trading is over.   </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

I don't speak for the four\u2014well, I certainly speak for myself, but not for the other three. I would hope that, as we often contemplate what impact we might have made in public policy through the course of our participation in this great place, at some point someone could say that the thing that the member for Chifley did, if you don't mind me speaking in the third person, is keep banging on about the value of technology to the country. I've been hoping and praying that business gets on to this sooner rather than later\u2014that is, that they actually realise technology is of benefit, rather than something they shirk away from. So many of our public policy debates, particularly some of the most bedevilling ones that we've faced, have been unable to recognise the value that technology brings in terms of public policy improving the way that business works and improving the way that communities operate, and seeing things done in a much easier way. Technology is about not only doing things faster but doing them smarter and, in many cases, doing them much more efficiently.</p><p>That very long preamble that I've provided is basically to give a sense of what I'm thinking when it comes to this issue of media reform and where we're at. We have very big companies in the technology space and in the media space that are going head-to-head over, understandably, their futures. It has been largely a case that business failed to understand the direction of technology when it came to publishing and they didn't get onto this quick enough. Now we're getting to the point where we're trying to shove the genie back in the bottle, and it isn't pretty to watch. What we're seeing is a lot of media players that have staked a reputation on being antiregulation embracing a regulator to see a business outcome that works in their way. And I get it, because tech's market power in this country, particularly big tech like Google and Facebook\u2014two of the biggest firms on the planet\u2014cannot be ignored. But it also cannot be ignored that we have a media market that has been one of the most concentrated on the planet for quite some time. We need to be able to ensure publishers get paid but do it in a way that's much better. And the government have got to find a way to get through what they have, in terms of media reform, because it's looking like a slow-moving car crash.</p><p>We cannot have a situation where negotiations on this get prematurely concluded 10 days before they were supposed to. There's no indication that the ACCC had any problem with the way that Google or Facebook were going, and then suddenly the government terminated the negotiations and are bringing in this code where there are serious concerns about the way it may or may not work. I think what we should see is an outcome where the publishers do get negotiated agreements with those big tech firms but not in a way that a lot on the other side, the party of free enterprise, in any other circumstance wouldn't abide. We do need to ensure that there is fairness and we do need to ensure a moderated, negotiated outcome, but we cannot afford to see what I'm genuinely concerned about, which is a system where we may have some of the biggest tech players on the planet decide not to play ball with us because we couldn't get a deal that worked for everyone.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3708685</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RY-7FX1-F0YC-N2JB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"645\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp; TRADE LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><className>Antitrust &amp; Trade Law</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N510000CC</classCode><className>MEDIA &amp; TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000376</classCode><className>CONSUMER ELECTRONICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX013</classCode><className>CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The HVACR industry has always been versatile with ever-evolving practices, upgrades, disruptive products and technologies. Though shifts may often seem slow progressing to the general population, the industry is currently primed to utilize and contribute to big tech trends and, more importandy, is gearing up to be on the center stage of global change.</p><p>In fact, HVACR has the potential to play a large role in the future of every person on the planet--a notion that is gaining greater realization by industry professionals. Despite this outlook, the challenge ahead remains--crafting an environment for humans to thrive and maximize their potential while keeping negative environmental impacts to a minimum.</p><p>To achieve these goals, cross-role communication among industry personnel is essential. In an effort to support the open flow of communication and stimulate ideation, the AHR Expo has gathered a council of industry experts aimed at discussing some of the biggest trends, issues and opportunities that lie ahead for HVACR.</p><p>Recently the Council convened to discuss and develop consensus views on five areas that are poised to be hot topics for the industry and at the upcoming 2020 AHR Expo in Orlando. Our goal is to spark conversation and knowledge sharing among industry peers through articles, papers, online networks and on social channels. We encourage you to participate in the conversation, seek out others in the industry and discuss the role of HVACR in these issues and more, as well as how professionals across all job functions might work together to achieve greater success.</p><p>Global climate change is not a new discussion topic, however, the inclusion of HVACR systems and their potential to support the lowest emission output possible is becoming more mainstream. Moving beyond the political landscape, long-term sustainability goals and embodied carbon are heavily considered in the design, integration, and installation of whole building systems.</p><p>Engineers are challenged with designing systems that meet or exceed performance expectations while staying on course with changing regulation. Contractors are faced with new regulations and must adapt to methods for installation and maintenance. On the global scale, net-zero initiatives are driving design and furthering the consideration of the entire HVACR system and its importance to the building function, as well as the necessary energy to support it.</p><p>New recommendations for climate change limits suggest a global temperature lower than 1.5C according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a finding that has been referenced in climate change policies and initiatives across the globe.</p><p>\"Minimizing climate change to the 1.5C limit by 2050 will require swift and unprecedented changes in the HVACR industry. There are great challenges and opportunities to be taken seriously if we want to arrive at net zero emissions in operating, embodied, and transportation carbon, yet maintain the superb wellbeing of building occupants,\" says Luke Leung, director of sustainable energy at Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill LLP</p><p>This idea of implementing new protocols to lessen emissions is not a task to be viewed lightly, particularly in societies where buildings and HVACR systems are already established. Cities around the world are taking serious measures to meet net zero goals. As reported by Forbes earlier this year as part of the Climate Mobilization Act, buildings totaling 25,000 square feet or more will face requirements to upgrade boilers. Additionally, starting in the year 2024, New York City building owners who do not comply with energy efficiency requirements will face fines made up of the difference in emissions limits for the year and a buildings actual emissions, multiplied by $268.</p><p>Some areas of consideration for HVACR professionals include:</p><p>* Embodied Carbon Considerations</p><p>* Government regulations are a driving force for designers and builders to consider the full cycle of embodied carbon and a building's carbon footprint. California's government adopted the Buy Clean Act in October of 2017 and amended it in June of 2018. According to USGBC's Los Angeles chapter, the legislation promotes the spending of taxpayer money in ways that help to reduce pollution contributors to climate change. Additionally, manufacturers and plants are held to tougher pollution standards and the emissions performance of suppliers and contractors is considered prior to project sign-on.</p><p>* Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) are becoming commonplace in many countries around the world, with the expectation of further growth in the coming years. Currently, EPDs use the common methodology outlined in ISO 14024 to define and compare products. There are several supporting organizations in North America, including NSF International, the Sustainability Consortium, Carbon Leadership Forum, SGS Global Services, among others. LEED Version 4 also began to address EPD of products.</p><p>* Low GWP Refrigerants</p><p>* While low GWP refrigerants are already in use across the industry, some options introduce safety hazards through fire and combustion risks and may require significant modifications to vapor compression equipment. According to a 2016 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study, an estimated 700 million air conditioning systems will be in use by 2030. Not surprisingly, the quest to develop the next generation of refrigerants is already underway and is a buzzing topic of conversation among industry professionals. There is also debate as to which refrigerants will provide the most viable solution to the global climate challenge. The use of low GWP refrigerants remains heavily considered within the industry as a way to lower overall emissions.</p><p>* Electrification</p><p>* The push to connect everything to the electrical grid in the future is a political hot button that is discussed across nearly every market. HVACR systems have been given a front seat in this debate for their potential to greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., buildings still primarily rely on natural gas, coal, or fuel oil as an energy source. The electrification discussion stakes claim that HVACR systems can be quickly decarbonized by removing old systems and upgrading to clean energy systems with electric heat or heat pumps. While the interaction between the electrical grid and buildings is changing, the idea of total transition has obstacles given the millions of homes and businesses currendy relying on fuels for operation.</p><p>\"Heat pumps, specifically ccA2WHP cold climate air to water heat pumps, are gaining attention from customers looking to cut ties with both gas and oil. Support of this method stems from the ability to integrate with PV generated at the building location to lessen grid loss, as well as the ability to generate heating, cooling and domestic hot water (DHW) from a single unit,\" said Bob Rohr, a training manager with Caleffi North America. \"Looking into systems like this and others that reduce negative climate impact is an added benefit for HVACR professionals because it introduces an increased role of hydronics and other technology avenues to the HVAC industry.\"</p><p>While many technologies are being considered, the overall goal to move beyond reliance on products and applications that have a negative impact on the environment is shared. In the coming years, we can expect to see much progress in this area driven by government regulation, consumer demand and industry innovation.</p><p>Indoor growth facilities are seeing an increase in interest for a few reasons. The first is the practicality behind their use in supporting rapid population growth. With progress made in HVACR and systems capable of cooling and heating extreme external environments, we are now living in areas of the world previously thought uninhabitable. This has pushed the boundaries of human living areas and expanded the built environment with fewer limitations.</p><p>Additionally, as the human population rises, so does the need for sustainable food options. Perhaps one of the biggest barriers to food production in relation to population growth is the loss of land space to nurture crops large in number and size. The process of indoor farming is already in practice in some areas around the world. For example, in 2014, Japans Mirai Co. partnered with GE Japan to convert a former Sony factory into an indoor growth facility to house garden beds in what they've deemed a \"plant factory.\" The concept gained attention as it solves many of the controversial issues associated with traditional farming--the use of pesticides to control pests and bacteria and to ensure the health of the crop, and devastating crop loss caused by harsh weather, pollution, and other factors.</p><p>New markets are also taking on the challenge of investing in indoor growth facilities. The hemp and cannabis industry is a huge flagship for indoor growth and is becoming more commonplace across the U.S. Producers are looking for input and expertise to build an entire industry from the ground up.</p><p>\"With more and more U.S. states allowing for the decriminalized use of marijuana and the widespread use of CBD products, there is a sudden increased demand for production. As a result, indoor grow facilities for cannabis is one of the fastest-growing verticals we've ever seen,\" says Pam Duffy, Spark One Solutions, LLC and RE. licensed engineer serving the HVACR industry for more than 10 years. \"Many building owners are taking big capital risks to build these facilities, and producing high-quality products requires a precise approach to climate and lighting control. Currently, there's a limited number of organizations in our industry that specialize or even have experience in this area. The prediction is that those who are willing to dive head-first into this market will be rewarded for many years to come.\"</p><p>Indoor climates require precise control of a built environment, something the HVACR industry masters more than any. The opportunity to lead the design and production of an indoor growth environment, as well as the new jobs technicians, builders, contractors, manufacturers, suppliers and all those touching the industry will take on, makes this a viable opportunity for the industry as a whole.</p><p>The area of Building Automation &amp; Control (BAC) is quick paced and always changing. It maintains a prominent presence at the AHR Expo, and each year showcases new technologies and products that push boundaries. Where technology will take us is yet to be seen, and therefore makes this a buzzworthy topic for the foreseeable future. What's more, the BAC discussion is expanding to include the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence (AI) and security.</p><p>The HVACR industry isn't unique in tapping the IoT for deepened communication and information sharing. However, it provides unique and exciting opportunities because it allows for the open flow of communication between humans and the built environment. The IoT not only gives a closer connection between the occupant and the systems control but also enhances the service response time due to faster diagnostics and technician reporting. Already the IoT is streamlining the customer relationship--but where else can it lead HVACR?</p><p>Artificial intelligence in the HVACR industry has piqued interest in the idea of self-diagnosing buildings, where a broken system pinpoints a specific area of issue and auto-orders replacement equipment. This idea is provoking as it raises the question of the reliance on building system diagnostic accuracy, as well as the role of HVACR professionals in the future.</p><p>There are, however, concerns associated with increased connection and network sharing. Cybersecurity is an area of potential threat introduced with BAC and multiple building systems. This is new territory for most in the HVACR industry. As seen in areas using cloud-based and multiple networked systems technologies sharing communication, the opportunity for hackers is real and needs to be considered by all. This means building design and construction teams need to communicate potential risks and best practices associated with network use, and building owners need to be diligent in protecting their networks and secure information.</p><p>\"The key is to make the building aware of what it needs to be aware of while maintaining local control. The security risks involved in taking data out of buildings completely, sending it all over the world, is far too great. What we see more of is a higher focus on security issues with the underlying idea of having control at the edge, closer to the data source.\" says Nicolas Waern, The Building Whisperer.</p><p>Consumer demand speaks to all the above-mentioned topics as the driving force behind innovation and change. The recognition that the largest population of building occupants is the incoming millennial generation, and that this cohort will also be the next generation of building owners brings to light a number of considerations that may not have mattered in the same way to previous generations.</p><p>Millennials perhaps more than any generation prior are active in the quest for sustainable options. They've been dubbed \"generation green,\" with 66% even stating they are willing to pay more for products and services that come from companies with commitments to positive environmental impacts, according to a Nielsen global survey.</p><p>Now more than ever, consumers are demanding control of environments in which they occupy. Dwellers are aware of and seeking control of their health in relation to outdoor and indoor environmental exposure. This includes the demand for clean air, the ability to closely control and monitor the indoor environment, and the opportunity to live within smart buildings that conserve energy based on many variables including occupancy and usage patterns.</p><p>Smart home control systems have skyrocketed in recent years, adding an attractive real estate feature to homes with updated HVACR and lighting systems. Consumers are also conscientious to the fact that we spend nearly 90% of our time indoors, as indicated in an EPA sponsored survey of national human activity, and the indoor environment and its potential exposures can influence personal health.</p><p>This shift of attention toward interior environments quality means the HVACR design and system selection has the potential to be influenced by different priorities than those currently in use today. Occupant desire for greater control coupled with their purchasing of buildings and leasing of spaces reflect this priority and indicate it will change the manner HVACR is done.</p><p>Business owners will likely also demand better indoor environments as it has been shown to impact employee productivity and wellbeing. It can also be anticipated that there will be increased legal exposure to building owners to provide safe and clean air as occupants become more knowledgeable, technologies capable of measuring and monitoring space quality become less expensive, and data becomes more readily available. Restaurants, merchants, theaters, etc. may also take advantage of this new focus through marketing clean air to distinguish themselves from the competition--much like the food grade systems we see in place in cities across the world.</p><p>Overall, a more health-conscious group of individuals is aging into building ownership with funding to spend on improving the interior space they occupy. HVACR professionals can benefit from the opportunities to cater to this new audience and their set of priorities. Manufacturers are also keen to this shift and are responding with products and technologies that excel in innovation to meet the charge.</p><p>The trend that perhaps stands to be the greatest obstacle for the HVACR industry in the immediate future is the need to replenish an aging job force. Due to a reduced interest in skilled trades as a career path and the economic recession in the early 2000s that contributed to stagnation in hiring, the industry faces a lag of incoming professionals to meet the replacement demands of those aging out of the industry. What's more, even if rising students are interested in pursuing engineering or a skilled trade, they may not choose the HVACR industry over others requiring similar applied skills. The industry needs to take notice of these challenges and work together to recruit a new generation of HVACR professionals. This is an industry where long-term careers can be built as the role of HVACR is and always will be vital to all areas of the world, in every building and in every home.</p><p>The workforce will also need to consider a broader demographic than represented today to fill the void in the workforce. Women, as well as ethnic minorities, should be considered as part of this solution. While there has been an indication of growth here, it is still possible in the year 2019 to be the first minority graduating from a trade school, as evidenced by Ryli Jetton, who recently became the first female graduate with an Associate's degree in Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning from State Technical College of Missouri. The HVACR industry needs to do a better job of championing the many opportunities that exist in the HVACR business to attract individuals from all backgrounds. This will not only help fill the shortage of professionals but will also introduce a broader set of ideas and talents to the conversation, ultimately making the industry stronger.</p><p>\"The way we promote the greatness of the HVACR industry to younger generations is through in-person interactions and open communication. We need to invite them into engineering firms, let them shadow mechanical contractors, visit job sites, attend events like the AHR Expo, ASHRAE events, and other industry association events. The opportunity to have real-life experiences in the field will make all the difference,\" says Karine Leblanc, an engineer at US Air Conditioning Distributors. \"Having been exposed to the industry at a younger age myself, I remember the experience of visiting an engineering office and having a project manager explain to me why the thermostat should not be at its location. I was only 15 at the time, but this one interaction shaped what has become my engineering career.\"</p><p>These topics and more will be discussed at the 2020 AHR Expo, to be held in Orlando, Florida, Feb. 3-5.

The app is available for free on Google Play Store for Android based devices and on the Apple Store for iOS based devices.</p><p>Hwindi follows similar operations as of the GrabTaxi (Singapore), Uber (International) and G-Taxi (Zimbabwe) mainly, but with extra features that incorporates the social economic culture of the Zimbabwean and Southern African commuters.</p><p>With commuters encountering high levels of robberies from unscrupulous taxi drivers, Hwindi provides safety as all taxi operators subscribing to this latest innovation are registered with local authorities hence minimising risk levels.</p><p>Passengers can give their rating of the driver which plays a big part in improving the driver's profile on the application.</p><p>Hwindi App has features that show the customer the nearest driver's profile from their point of location and the billing rate of 50 cents per kilometer and a base fee of US$1 which then approximates total cost for the ride in relation to distance intended to be covered using GPS and the same is to be applied for towing services. There are also statutory fees which are also charged resulting in a distance of 10 kilometers costing an average of US$ 8.00 against a minimum of US$ 10.00 normally charged by taxi operators.</p><p>The pricing model is to be agreed between the taxi operators prior to registration in order to bring uniformity.</p><p>Analysts have hailed this innovation saying it will be crucial in promoting formalisation in the highly unregulated taxi industry as the more people subscribe to such platforms unregistered operators will soon find business hard to come by given the high risk perception associated with unknown taxi operators.</p><p>With just 2 months since its operation, Hwindi mobile application has managed to garner over 2 000 subscribers who are formally registered transport operators.</p><p>'I came up with the idea after travelling across the world and seeing how other countries are doing,' Hwindi Pvt Ltd founder and business development executive Patrick Manyangadze told Business Post in an interview.</p><p>'We are introducing (STAERA) safety, technology, affordability, efficiency, reliability and accountability into the taxi industry. We hope to spread our services across Africa and to become the best taxi service application,' he added.</p><p>He said the market response has been overwhelming in the first 3 months since their inception and there is room for expansion as the company hopes to offer new innovative products that relates to the everyday challenges of urban life.</p><p>He however factored out high costs of internet and unreliable data connection as the major challenge affecting players in the IT sector.</p><p>'The challenges we are having are data and network issues.

Une observation plus fine des acteurs qui ont su tirer leur parti de la \u00ab r\u00e9volution num\u00e9rique \u00bb nous prouve pourtant qu'aujourd'hui, la transformation requise est avant tout celle des business models. Et pour la mener \u00e0 bien, une comp\u00e9tence s'impose : celle de la traduction. Je m'explique.</p><h>Pour commencer, le num\u00e9rique n'est pas un secteur</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Au coeur de la tourmente, les g\u00e9ants am\u00e9ricains de la tech ont r\u00e9ussi, en quelques ann\u00e9es, l'exploit de faire de la r\u00e9gulation un argument politique de premier plan. Mais avec la \u00ab Big Tech \u00bb dans le viseur, les d\u00e9cideurs politiques ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 nourrir l'opinion publique d'une vision erron\u00e9e des logiques \u00e0 l'oeuvre. \u00c0 \u00e9couter le discours ambiant, on pourrait donc croire qu'il existe r\u00e9ellement un \u00ab secteur du num\u00e9rique \u00bb, monolithique et surpuissant, n'attendant plus que de se consolider pour enfin \u00ab d\u00e9vorer le monde \u00bb. Je n'en crois rien.</p><p>Pour ma part, j'y vois m\u00eame le signe d'un profond malentendu sur ce que repr\u00e9sente le num\u00e9rique aujourd'hui et sur le r\u00f4le des acteurs qui s'en r\u00e9pondent. Il n'existe pas, ou plus, de coh\u00e9rence industrielle, \u00e9conomique ou technologique des acteurs de la dite \u00ab tech \u00bb. Tout au plus une coh\u00e9rence id\u00e9ologique, et encore. De fait, les GAFAM n'ont plus grand chose en commun que l'acronyme par lequel on a vite fait de les d\u00e9signer. D'ailleurs, les r\u00e9duire \u00e0 des \u00ab entreprises du num\u00e9rique \u00bb ou \u00ab technologiques \u00bb devient de plus en plus difficile, \u00e0 mesure que leurs activit\u00e9s se diversifient et viennent impacter des champs aussi divers que la sant\u00e9, l'\u00e9ducation... ou la d\u00e9mocratie.</p><p>Arr\u00eatons un peu les raccourcis et retrouvons les mots pour d\u00e9crire r\u00e9ellement ce qu'elles font. Facebook est \u00e0 la fois un r\u00e9seau social, un \u00e9diteur de contenus, un laboratoire d'intelligence artificielle et de r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle, un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me applicatif, un interm\u00e9diaire bancaire... Amazon, une plate-forme de distribution, un gestionnaire d'actifs, un fournisseur de services de stockage et de services financiers, un producteur audiovisuel, un fabricant d'objets connect\u00e9s... Vous voyez o\u00f9 je veux en venir.</p><p>Ces d\u00e9finitions \u00e0 multiples entr\u00e9es sont la preuve m\u00eame du succ\u00e8s du mod\u00e8le de plate-forme de ces entreprises, puisqu'elles t\u00e9moignent de leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 hybrider leurs mod\u00e8les. Le point commun de ces entreprises n'est donc pas tant leur composante num\u00e9rique ou technologique que l'hybridation des mod\u00e8les qu'elles adoptent pour s'adapter en continu \u00e0 un monde devenu incertain par d\u00e9faut .</p><p>En cela, concentrer ses efforts de transformation sur la brique technologique plut\u00f4t que sur celles des business \u00e0 venir, c'est regarder le doigt plut\u00f4t que la Lune.</p><h>D'une logique de production \u00e0 une logique d'hybridation ?</h><p>Face \u00e0 ces entreprises qui pr\u00f4nent et exp\u00e9rimentent le mod\u00e8le de l'hybridation, les grandes entreprises fran\u00e7aises et europ\u00e9ennes ont tout int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 jour leur logiciel.</p><p>Le num\u00e9rique n'est pas l'apanage de quelques-unes, mais concerne d\u00e9sormais toutes les entreprises. Mieux, il est la condition d'une hybridation rapide. Plut\u00f4t que de s'\u00e9vertuer \u00e0 b\u00e2tir seule ses nouveaux business, l'entreprise hybride se dote avec le num\u00e9rique d'une capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 identifier et \u00e0 assembler des briques existantes \u00e0 son \u00e9difice en construction, qu'il s'agissent de talents, d'outils ou de comp\u00e9tences. Car loin d'uniformiser les mod\u00e8les \u00e9conomiques ou les transformations op\u00e9rationnelles, le num\u00e9rique les d\u00e9cuple. Et c'est de cette complexit\u00e9 que les plates-formes tirent leur force, comme l'a fait Stripe en b\u00e2tissant un produit API unique pour permettre aux entreprises de naviguer parmi plus de 135 monnaies et des dizaines de m\u00e9thodes de paiement.</p><p>En y regardant de plus pr\u00e8s, ce que propose la logique d'hybridation adopt\u00e9e par les entreprises nativement num\u00e9riques, c'est un basculement du mod\u00e8le classique, fond\u00e9 sur la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un besoin identifi\u00e9 par l'augmentation constante des capacit\u00e9s de production ; vers un mod\u00e8le qui consiste, pour l'entreprise, \u00e0 identifier une grande diversit\u00e9 de besoins, et \u00e0 s'organiser au mieux pour y r\u00e9pondre.</p><p>Ainsi, l'hybridation permet de faire coexister des business models anciens et nouveaux ainsi que de nouveaux talents avec les m\u00e9tiers traditionnels, mais aussi de faire \u00e9merger des relais de croissance \u00e0 partir d'actifs d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s, et de distribuer la valeur nouvellement cr\u00e9\u00e9e au sein d'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes.</p><p>Elle permet d'envisager la transformation comme une adaptation en continu, une mise \u00e0 jour perp\u00e9tuelle au monde num\u00e9rique plut\u00f4t qu'une r\u00e9volution brutale et programm\u00e9e.</p><h>Quand hybrider, c'est traduire</h><p>Que le num\u00e9rique acc\u00e9l\u00e8re toute transformation, vous le savez. Vous l'avez entendu dans la bouche de ceux qui disent que le num\u00e9rique est un nouveau langage universel (d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment, que n'est-il pas ?) et qu'il serait bon de mettre tout le monde \u00e0 la page.</p><p>L\u00e0 encore, l'image est trompeuse. Que le num\u00e9rique soit l'affaire de toutes les entreprises est une chose, qu'il en devienne l'esp\u00e9ranto tant r\u00eav\u00e9 en est une autre.</p><p>Car oui, une grande entreprise peut ressembler, \u00e0 maints \u00e9gards, \u00e0 une tour de Babel o\u00f9 chaque m\u00e9tier parle et d\u00e9fend son langage propre. Dans ce contexte, une bonne approche de la transformation est celle qui mise sur la diversit\u00e9 des exp\u00e9riences, le dialogue fructueux entre strat\u00e9gie et ex\u00e9cution, entre business et tech. Et quand le dialogue est difficile, le r\u00f4le du leadership n'est pas d'imposer une langue unique mais plut\u00f4t de se faire le traducteur capable de conjuguer ensemble des visions du monde diff\u00e9rentes.</p><p>Il appartient aux grandes entreprises en transformation et \u00e0 leurs dirigeants de mettre en oeuvre cette capacit\u00e9 nouvelle de \u00ab traduction \u00bb. Par l\u00e0, j'entends aussi bien de traduire un actif technologique en opportunit\u00e9 business, qu'une expertise inexploit\u00e9e en vivier de talents, ou encore une ressource dormante en nouveau march\u00e9.</p><p>Traduire, c'est embrasser la complexit\u00e9 d'une culture diff\u00e9rente de la sienne. C'est rechercher et appr\u00e9cier les nuances plut\u00f4t qu'imposer une seule voie. C'est, enfin, l'attitude n\u00e9cessaire pour mener une v\u00e9ritable dynamique d'hybridation, celle-l\u00e0 seule capable de transformer vos atouts en business \u00e0 venir.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pauline Pham</emphasis>est Partner, VP strat\u00e9gie et croissance chez Five by Five</p><p>Contributor: </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LESECB-329432</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LESECB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5P-9HH1-JCR4-X44X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">425681</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1060\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Groupe Les Echos tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Les Echos Executives</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"46673\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>jeudi 23 mai 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FXZ</classCode><className>INFORMATIQUE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>M\u00c9DIAS SOCIAUX</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813400CC</classCode><className>ORGANISATIONS CIVIQUES &amp; SOCIALES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJLY</classCode><className>R\u00c9SEAUTAGE SOCIAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008X0V</classCode><className>PRODUCTION DU SECTEUR DES SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>INTELLIGENCE ARTIFICIELLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FXZ</classCode><className>INFORMATIQUE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>M\u00c9DIAS SOCIAUX</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><className>PAYSAGE FINANCIER &amp; BANCAIRE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>INTELLIGENCE ARTIFICIELLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The company has raised $160 million in several rounds to build the transportation systems that seem like something out of science fiction. Despite a lawsuit[2] from former high-ranking employees, the company has moved swiftly to add new executives and expand its search for sites where it can build its lightning-fast transportation networks in cities around the world. (The company denied the allegations and countersued the former employees). Hyperloop One continues to build out its 100,000-square-foot Metalworks fabrication facility and 137-acre Apex test\u00a0and safety site in North Las Vegas, Nevada. </p><p>Construction of the company's full-system development\u00a0loop is underway as Hyperloop One prepares for its 'Kitty Hawk moment' in the first quarter of 2017. Last week, during CES 2017, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas. I met with Rob Lloyd, CEO of Hyperloop One. We talked about the company's global challenge contest to find the world's best Hyperloop routes. The list is now down to 35 possible projects around the world, and some cities such as Dubai are actively pursuing approvals. More than 2,600 proposals were registered in five months, and the semifinalist come from 17 countries. A handful of finalists will be named by May. Lloyd and I talked about that process, as well as what Hyperloop transportation will mean for society in the future. Here's an edited transcript of our interview. Above: Rob Lloyd, CEO of Hyperloop One, at CES 2017. Image Credit: Dean TakhashiRob Lloyd: I'd say, if you go back about six months when we announced the global competition, our idea was to say to the market, say to the world, and all of those we thought were interested in something new emerging in transportation, 'Give us your ideas.' We saw a constant increase in momentum around participating. A lot of people said, 'I'd like to sign up. I'd like to be part of this.' We were very impressed. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the submissions. Our team coached many of those entries and helped them go through a template, a format, to come up with those ideas. We had almost 70 very serious submissions. The top 35, 36, whatever the final number was, really were very interesting to us. VB: I saw a lot of government money supporting these. Lloyd: A lot of government support, yes. I think 25 of the 35 ended up with letters of support from local or national governments. We saw a broad community come together to put some of these ideas together. One company sponsored an internal competition, an engineering firm, and made multiple submissions. We saw universities, private enterprises, government institutions. As we get ready for these workshops that'll occur over the next few months in the regions\u2014we'll have one in India for the Middle East in Asia, one in D.C. for Canada and the United States, and one in London for the U.K. and Northern Europe. We're expecting that a number of those, we'll be able to take them through a deeper analysis, similar to the other studies underway right now around the world. Above: The finalists in Hyperloop One's contest to build Hyperloop transportation systems. Image Credit: Hyperloop OneVB: I was sad that the bay area didn't seem to be on the list. I'd expect a very built-out area like that- Lloyd: All tunneled. I'd intuitively say it'd be all tunneled. It must have been a pretty good year in 2016. Nobody had the time to put that idea together. They might have thought we're already doing it. VB: Is there a feeling for what's more ideal based on all these submissions? Lloyd: First of all, a route that makes a lot of sense economically. We worked with each of the submissions to analyze their revenue potential. What is the reality, if it's a passenger route? Can we imagine revenues that would make sense? Is it an economically viable route? Some of them were interesting, but we didn't think they had the potential to be an economically viable project. Second, was there a realistic environment in which governments would be supportive, or would this take forever? To be part of this next phase, we're looking for those that have government backers, that will try to move more quickly. The study we're doing in Dubai with the transit authority, that's a regulator working with us now, rather than trying to stop it down the road. They're being very collaborative. Finally, where could we imagine projects could be financed? This is all very interesting, but if you can't create an economic model that would then be a project that could be financed, it's not that interesting. Those three characteristics were part of everything. The entire company came together, including all of our employees from Nevada, and we analyzed these projects. We had engineers working with finance people and everyone else. We were very impressed by the quality of the submissions.

Lloyd: I told this to our team. I think in supporting and promoting the idea, we've probably spent less than $100,000. The viable pipeline of opportunities that have been submitted is in the tens of billions of dollars. That's a pretty good ROI. That's the value of the projects in aggregate. The value to Hyperloop would be a portion of that, as we continue to work on how our business would monetize the different projects moving forward. VB: What's the status of Las Vegas itself? Lloyd: It's great. We just had our co-founder and president, Josh Giegel, there this morning. He left at five. It's very cold, by the way, in the desert that early. Great progress. We'll be bringing together and doing a full-scale test within the next couple of months. Everything's on track. The tube is there. You can see it from the highway. It's pretty exciting. We have full facilities out there, pumps installed, generator power in. We're getting ready for our Kitty Hawk. The world is getting increasingly convinced that our company is set up to make this a reality. As we go from CES last year to this CES, it's becoming more evident that this is going to be possible. VB: How do you get past the initial reaction people have, that this is just science fiction? Lloyd: You can show a picture or talk about it, but we think the only way to get past the reaction that this is science fiction is just to build it. That's why our company has been so focused for two years on a single deliverable, a milestone that matters. Let's demonstrate a full-scale Hyperloop. When people say, 'It sounds phenomenal, but it's too far off,' let's show them Hyperloop. In the early part of this year we'll show that the Hyperloop is real and we're the company building it. VB: What are some more steps on that road map, how a project is going to get built? Lloyd: With some of the ones we're going through right now, you do an engineering study. You do a revenue analysis. You do an engineering and construction feasibility. You determine whether there's a right-of-way you can obtain, or whether you have to create a new one. As a template, the project we're doing with the road and transit authority in Dubai, the regulator, we're going through that entire process with outside advisors and specialists to help them determine what would be the most impactful route in Dubai. We're halfway through. Probably in a February time frame, we'll come to a conclusion as to whether it makes sense. If it does make sense, the next step is a deeper level of specific engineering designs, so you can then ask people for a price to build it. Above: Hyperloop One tubes in Las Vegas. Image Credit: Hyperloop OneVB: How many people do you guys have now? Lloyd: 225. 50 of them are in Nevada, which is pretty exciting for the state of Nevada. We're growing very quickly. I'd expect that we'll end up doubling this year to 500. We're growing more facilities. You're aware of the 100,000-square-foot manufacturing facility we have here in Vegas, and the test and safety site. We're making very rapid progress. We have employees starting to be out there around the world. We've hired people looking after our customer engagement, based in London and spending a lot of time in the Middle East and northern Europe. You saw the news on Brent Callinicos, our chief financial advisor, joining us in October. He's very much part of the team that's focused on our series C financing, which we expect in the first half of this year. We'll be in the market raising a couple hundred million dollars. VB: Do you have any lingering fallout from the lawsuit? Lloyd: It's funny you mentioned that. It's the first time I've been asked about it today. But to me, that's good. Our objective was to keep focused on progress, and I think where we are today - sitting one CES later from when we first showed up here and talked about Hyperloop - the progress has been amazing. We're pleased that the company stayed focused and continued to deliver on our commitments to make Hyperloop real.1 2[3] View All[4] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.hyperloop-one.com\">http://www.hyperloop-one.com</url>/ [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-hyperloop-one-dismissal-20160930-snap-story.html\">http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-hyperloop-one-dismissal-20160930-snap-story.html</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/2017/01/10/hyperloop-one-has-a-short-list-of-cities-for-its-760-mile-per-hour-trains/2/\">http://venturebeat.com/2017/01/10/hyperloop-one-has-a-short-list-of-cities-for-its-760-mile-per-hour-trains/2/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/2017/01/10/hyperloop-one-has-a-short-list-of-cities-for-its-760-mile-per-hour-trains/view-all/\">http://venturebeat.com/2017/01/10/hyperloop-one-has-a-short-list-of-cities-for-its-760-mile-per-hour-trains/view-all/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-VNTR107988148406976185025176100075</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VNTR-6695</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MKS-53G1-F03R-N31X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1610\"/><timeReceived>5:36 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>VentureBeat</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>January 10, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Rob Lloyd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>hyperloop-one</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CES 2017</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Josh Giegel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Brent Callinicos</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

There are probably not all that many big ones left,\u201d Mr Baratoff said.</p><p>It is positioning itself to become a company that sells not just cars but also related infrastructure and technology such as the \u201cbrains\u201d that will guide cars without drivers. The goal is to monetise all sorts of consumer data and potentially move into driverless taxis and deliveries.</p><p>Hyundai is facing head-on two big decisions confronting the world\u2019s carmakers in an industry in transition: whether to develop self-driving technology or buy it from a supplier, and whether to try to run transport services themselves or simply provide the hardware.</p><p>The decisions to take ownership of its autonomous driving systems and to expand into services, say analysts, will define Hyundai\u2019s place in an industry facing one of its biggest-ever disruptions. </p><p>Google looms as biggest rival to carmakers</p><p>Hyundai\u2019s $35bn war chest now places it \u201camong the top companies in the automotive industry such as Volkswagen and Toyota in terms of investments in future technologies\u201d, said Animesh Kumar, head of automotive at data group GlobalData.</p><p>But the looming arrival of driverless vehicles has spawned a welter of start-ups and fuelled investments by global tech giants and governments \u2014 a transformation that threatens to dislodge carmakers from the top of the consumer food chain and relegate them to hardware providers for ride-hailing fleets operated by others.</p><p>\u201cSince [traditional carmakers] don\u2019t have good expertise in software and related technologies, they have a fundamental fear that they will lose ground and competitiveness quickly and get overtaken by someone else,\u201d said Seunghyuk Choi, a Seoul-based partner at McKinsey, the consultancy.</p><p>Hyundai executives are acutely aware of the need to have a stake in the development of the technologies and services driving the industry\u2019s transition to driverless cars.</p><p>In an internal newsletter seen by the Financial Times, Jeonghee Kim, head of Hyundai\u2019s newly formed artificial intelligence research lab, warned that Google, not another carmaker, loomed as the company\u2019s biggest future rival.</p><p>\u201cOnce Google takes [the] lead in the mobility market, even the most powerful automotive OEM [original equipment manufacturer] will have to fight a tough battle. You have to start something first,\u201d Mr Kim said.</p><p>In response to this challenge, Hyundai has over the past two years invested in at least 20 companies with stakes in autonomous driving, according to Dealogic data. These deals, made mostly as part of consortiums, have a combined value of about $1.5bn and range from funding rounds for Uber rivals Grab and Ola to investments in Chinese AI groups Deep Glint and Wuhan Jimu Intelligent Technology. </p><p>But none gave Hyundai access to its own self-driving software platform technology, something the Aptiv deal offers.</p><p>Affordability and regulations remain hurdles</p><p>According to the latest rankings by Navigant Research, an advisory company, the companies on top of the podium among those developing automated driving systems are Waymo, a unit of Google parent Alphabet; Cruise, the self-driving division of General Motors; and Ford Autonomous Vehicles. Hyundai\u2019s new partner Aptiv sits in fourth.</p><p>Mr Baratoff acknowledged that Waymo\u2019s technology might be \u201cfurther ahead\u201d but he argued that Hyundai \u2014 which has a strong record for low-cost, mass market manufacturing \u2014 is focused on delivering cars that are affordable, and in high volumes.</p><p>\u201cI think that aspect is sometimes missing in the Silicon Valley-based start-ups; they are very much focused on who is the best [now]. Hyundai has a very realistic and pragmatic view on what it takes,\u201d he said.</p><p>Analysts agree that the question of commercial viability is often overlooked. But many foresee bigger hurdles in the form of government-controlled infrastructure, regulations and standards.</p><p>Several national and local governments, from US states including Florida and Arizona to the UK and Singapore, are working on laws to enable driverless cars on the roads. Chinese carmakers and companies developing related software and services could end up in pole position thanks to the country\u2019s centralised planning and vast scale.</p><p>\u201cThe most important element is the legislative environment; all the liabilities, social costs, insurance, policies and laws,\u201d said Raymond Tsang, a Shanghai-based automotive technology expert at consultancy Bain &amp; Company. \u201cChina may have the advantage that [the legislative changes] can probably mostly be done at a high level nationally.\u201d</p><p>Who is winning the race?</p><p>Before tying up with Aptiv, Hyundai already had a partnership with Aurora, a US start-up that also works with Volkswagen, Byton and FiatChrysler to build autonomous vehicles.</p><p>But the South Korean carmaker also wanted to build up its own in-house self-driving tech. This desire has sparked a series of similar deals across the industry, including GM\u2019s decision to invest in Cruise and Ford\u2019s move to invest in Argo AI.</p><p>Industry insiders caution that it is difficult to judge the progress of rival self-driving companies, though, with widely touted pilot schemes often designed to flatter a vehicle\u2019s performance.</p><p>The standard industry measure \u2014 how many miles an autonomous car drives before a human has to intervene \u2014 is also problematic, as it uses data from California, thereby excluding companies such as Ford that do not test in the state.</p><p>Differing test methods further complicate matters. For instance, Waymo tests in quieter suburbs while Cruise is trialling its cars in more congested downtown areas.</p><p>No carmaker has yet launched self-driving cars commercially, with early initial launch dates pushed back or abandoned.</p><p>Cruise, which is also backed by Honda, planned to launch this year but has delayed its rollout.

Make no mistake, robo-advisors are a disruptive force. Just because they won't take away your business doesn't mean they won't change it.</p><p>Click through the following slides to hear from the IA 25 honorees who shared their thoughts on these new competitors, a topic that, as Editor-in-Chief Jamie Green said, \"came up unbidden so often that I began to bring it up on purpose.\"</p><p/><p>Bernie Clark</p><p>Executive Vice President, Schwab Advisor Services</p><p>Clark feels robo-advisors will exist as a \"complement\" to traditional advisors. \"We've done a lot of work that shows most individuals still want a relationship\" with a human advisor, he told Editor-in-Chief Jamie Green.</p><p>Clark suggested the solution may be for advisors to use some of the robo-advisors' modeling tools \"in their practices,\" especially for \"clients below their minimums or children of clients.\"</p><p>If that doesn't assuage advisors' concerns about the competitive threat robo-advisors pose, he pointed out that online advice hasn't had to perform in difficult markets. \"If we have five years of the markets heading straight up,\" robo-advisors \"will do well; if we have three years up and two years down,\" investors \"will want to talk to somebody.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(Photo: Tom McKenzie)</emphasis></p><p/><p>Dan Skiles</p><p>President, Shareholders Service Group</p><p>Robo-advisors may be able to provide simple advice cheaply, but Skiles reminded Editor-in-Chief Jamie Green that your clients have complex lives. \"Life is not consistent; questions come up throughout the year that you never anticipated.\" Robo-advisors provide a consistent investing experience, but human advisors \"are there for those questions.\"</p><p>For example, Skiles ticked off some issues that advisors help solve for their clients: staying knowledgeable about cost-basis legislation, how to pay for health care, whether the timing is right to do a Roth IRA rollover. He asked, \"Can a robo-advisor answer those?\"</p><p>Yes, if an advisor's practice is \"all about investments, maybe you should be concerned.\" If you do more for your clients, though, but have had to turn some away because they don't meet your minimums, maybe this is an opportunity. \"I'd encourage advisors who've been raising their minimums year after year to think about a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2013/08/26/strategies-for-serving-clients-online\"> different offering that allows them to serve people with less money</url>,\" Skiles said.</p><p/><p>Joel Bruckenstein and David Drucker</p><p>Founders, Technology Tools for Todoay (T3)</p><p>If an advisor isn't providing much more than asset allocation services, \"yeah, I think you're in trouble,\" Bruckenstein told Executive Managing Editor Danielle Andrus, \"because robo-advisors are offering those kinds of services, if not for free, for next to nothing.\" However, \"most good advisors provide many, many services that go beyond just asset allocation.\"</p><p>Drucker was magnanimous about robo-advisors. He said, \"There's room in the industry for all different sizes of players and all different types of players. We were told about 10 or 15 years ago that by now the industry would be all large shops, and smaller practitioners wouldn't be able to survive. I think that's been disproved.\"</p><p/><p>Skip Schweiss</p><p>President, TD Ameritrade Trust Company; Managing Director, Advisor Advocacy &amp; Industry Affairs, TD Ameritrade Institutional</p><p>Schweiss said even more than regulation, advisors should maybe be more concerned about what \"the rise of the online advice providers.\"</p><p>\"I've been in this industry serving advisors since 1989, and for as long as I have been doing this, advisors have told me 'We can't serve middle America,'\" Schweiss told Editor-in-Chief Jamie Green.</p><p>Instead, those lower-net-worth people are \"served by the IBD rep or by the insurance broker or a mutual fund company. Now we're getting an answer to that need\" with robo-advisors. \"</p><p>If advisors don't think robo-advisors can compete with the gentle touch of a trusted advisor, Schweiss reminded us, \"At what point did Barnes &amp; Noble not see Amazon as a threat?\"</p><p>However, just because it happened to them doesn't mean it will happen to you-after all, \"Turbo Tax didn't eliminate accountants, and WebMD didn't kill doctors\"-but that doesn't mean you can ignore robo-advisors as a competitor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IABNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IABNWS2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C7G-WJF1-DXWN-Y2XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">363905</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The National Underwriter Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ThinkAdvisor</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"05\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>May 2014</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>marketing</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX000902</classCode><className>INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUYwQUZDNkI3OThENEIyREI0MjJFNUFDNTgxMDJGNkY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDY3MDM3NEM5QTdCNDFDNUJCMDg4OTU1OTQ5MTNCNEQ</classCode><className>Individual Retirement Accounts</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001313</classCode><className>PERSONAL FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX000902</classCode><className>INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUYwQUZDNkI3OThENEIyREI0MjJFNUFDNTgxMDJGNkY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDY3MDM3NEM5QTdCNDFDNUJCMDg4OTU1OTQ5MTNCNEQ</classCode><className>Individual Retirement Accounts</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

No one has yet. Which is why they were there.</p><p>At the head of the table sat two fathers of students who died in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 14, 2018. At one corner next to them sat two staunch defenders of the Second Amendment who were worried about having to relinquish their firearms.</p><p>Understandably, the two parties clashed. Tensions sizzled and tempers briefly blew. In the end, they committed to continuing the urgent conversation.</p><p>\u201cIf you, as businesspeople, don\u2019t think as we go forward that you won\u2019t find yourself having personal connections to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">gun violence</url>, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d said Fred Guttenberg, the father of 14-year-old <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">Jaime Guttenberg</url>, who died in Parkland.</p><p>\u201cI am desperate for leadership from somewhere, whether it be government or business, and I\u2019m counting on it more from business,\u201d he said at the end. \u201cThe cost of not doing so will only get worse.\u201d</p><p>Momentum to help find a solution has been growing in the corporate world since 17 people were killed in Parkland. Companies like Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods stopped selling assault rifles, while Walmart also tightened their buying policies.</p><p>Prompted by the mass shootings this summer in El Paso and in Dayton, Ohio, 145 chief executives, including those from Levi Strauss, Twitter and Uber, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">wrote to the Senate</url> urging stricter background checks and laws to prevent people who pose a threat from buying guns. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">The number of signatures continues to grow</url>.</p><p>\u201cWe are a people business, and our people wanted us to take a stand,\u201d said Richard Fain, the chief executive of Royal Caribbean Cruises, based in Miami. He told the participants around the table <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">why he signed the letter</url>. \u201cWe don\u2019t think this is controversial. The vast majority of Americans want something to happen. Frankly, I\u2019m being responsive to what our people want.\u201d</p><p>A number of his employees, he said, had children at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.</p><p>But what of Citigroup, which does not underwrite gun manufacturers like other global banks do, and which has no obvious connection to the gun violence epidemic? The banking company, according to Edward Skyler, the vice president of global public affairs, has employees in Florida and in Las Vegas<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">who were affected by mass shootings</url> there. They asked Citigroup to take a stand.</p><p>A little more than a month after the shooting in Parkland, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">Citigroup said</url> it would require retail clients not to sell firearms to customers who had not passed a background check or who were under 21. It also barred the sale of bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a question of trying to keep guns away from legal owners; this isn\u2019t a challenge to the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Skyler told the group. \u201cThis is about trying to put in place best practices about trying to reduce risk.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not at all how the defenders of gun owners\u2019 rights in the room saw it. Dianna Muller, a former police officer from Tulsa, Okla., now runs <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">the DC Project</url>, which appeals to state legislators to protect the rights of legal gun owners.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about background checks, this isn\u2019t about red flag laws, this isn\u2019t going to stop until we disarm America,\u201d Ms. Muller said, adding that she did not trust the government to allow law-abiding owners to keep their guns. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we are fearful of.\u201d</p><p>These entrenched positions amount to a \u201czero-sum game,\u201d said David Gelles, a reporter from The New York Times who was moderating the discussion.</p><p>\u201cToo often this debate seems to me any little inch of ground the other side gets is somehow seen as a loss for the other side, and that\u2019s not going to be constructive,\u201d Mr. Gelles told the participants. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to save lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a Knicks game,\u201d said Erica Ford, a Queens native, lightening the mood. Ms. Ford founded <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">LIFE Camp</url> in Jamaica, Queens, a community organization focusing on gun violence prevention and intervention.</p><p>As the only black woman in the group, she pleaded for the corporations not to ignore communities of color.</p><p>\u201cBecause black kids have been killed forever,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd carrying a gun didn\u2019t make anyone safer. The moral compass of men and women in America should be about saving lives.\u201d</p><p>The Rev. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">Jeffrey L. Brown</url> founded a national faith and community-based organization in Boston, Rebuilding Every Community Around Peace, that works to reduce gang violence.</p><p>He said company leaders needed first to understand the systemic problems in the inner city \u2014 poverty, housing and failures of education \u2014 that have led to gun violence. And they need to \u201cembrace\u201d just how emotional an issue this is.</p><p>According to Kathryn Yontef, the director of corporate initiatives for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">Everytown for Gun Safety</url>, the issue is personal: 58 percent of people in the United States say they or somebody they love <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">has been affected by gun violence</url>. Every day, 100 people in this country are killed by guns.</p><p>She said corporations needed to take a stand, in the least by offering employee assistance.</p><p>But <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">Chris Cheng</url>, a former Google employee who won the 2011 \u201cTop Shot\u201d competition for the History Channel, said that it was not appropriate for businesses to set gun policy. He said he did not think that individual businesses should declare open-carry, conceal-carry or gun-free zones because it would be a confusing \u201cpatchwork\u201d for gun owners. He also did not want companies imposing morality on his consumer habits.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just very tired of having to run a gay rights or gun rights filter through my purchasing decisions,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cI love Levi\u2019s, but I don\u2019t want to feel guilty when I just want to buy a great pair of jeans.\u201d</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">Manuel Oliver</url>, who lost his teenage son, Joaquin, in the Parkland school shooting, interrupted him sharply. \u201cThat\u2019s a minor problem, you know that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very minor problem. I mean, I can help you to solve that, and I wish you could help me to solve mine.\u201d</p><p>The tension escalated. Mr. Cheng, who is gay, said he wanted to be able to defend himself as a member of a group often targeted by hate. He referenced the 2016 shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., where 49 people were killed.</p><p>Mr. Guttenberg told Mr. Cheng that he had talked to Pulse survivors who told him that more guns in an already chaotic situation \u2014 heavy smoke and panicked club-goers \u2014 would have led to more deaths.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Ms. Muller, the gun rights activist, said in a challenge to Mr. Guttenberg.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, the same way you don\u2019t know that having a gun would have saved lives,\u201d Mr. Guttenberg responded tersely.</p><p>Ms. Muller and Mr. Cheng dismissed the initiatives proposed by activists as an \u201canti-gun thing.\u201d</p><p>Anna Walker, the vice president of public affairs for Levi Strauss, disagreed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not anti-gun organizations, it\u2019s organizations working in communities on safety and reducing violence,\u201d she said. In 2018, Levi Strauss<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">committed $1 million</url> to support such organizations.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t companies do more?\u201d Mr. Fain said. \u201cThe discussion here is an example of why corporations don\u2019t. The emotion that you see here is what you\u2019re seeing played out across the country.\u201d</p><p>He added, \u201cThe fundamental distrust is scary.\u201d</p><p>More than halfway through the session, Tim Armstrong \u2014 a former chief executive of AOL and the founder and chief executive of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">the dtx company</url>, directly connecting consumers and companies \u2014 brought the conversation to a consensus.</p><p>All parties agreed with him that more data on gun violence and ownership was necessary.</p><p>But then Mr. Armstrong explained the reason for the lack of government data: a little-known bill in 1996 \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/Davell-Gardner-brooklyn-shooting.html\">the Dickey Amendment</url>. Jay Dickey, a Republican congressman from Arkansas, had effectively blocked $2.6 million toward the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence as a public health threat. Then Congress added a provision in the bill that prevented any funds for the C.D.C. that would promote or advocate gun control.</p><p>\u201cFrom a corporate leader\u2019s perspective, I don\u2019t want to sign any more letters,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to take over for what the government is not doing, let\u2019s use our company\u2019s resources and data.\u201d</p><p>His new company recently ran a survey as a pilot program that drew from 2,000 respondents in Jacksonville, Fla., and San Francisco, asking people on billboards, Reddit and other online platforms to answer three questions. The results: 48 percent said they wanted to increase gun regulations; 30 percent wanted to protect gun owners\u2019 rights; 22 percent wanted to ban guns altogether.</p><p>The issue of gun control is growing only more pervasive because one activist group has been relentless.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened in Parkland is that a young generation reacted and that\u2019s the difference,\u201d Mr. Oliver told the task force. \u201cThis white privileged community in Florida that brought in other communities. Are you going to tell them that corporations are not going to get involved?\u201d</p><p>The momentum, he said, belongs to the youth. \u201cThe future of this country is exactly that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to this table.\u201d</p><p>Task force moderator: David Gelles.

He's furious over the anonymous New York Times op-ed still mad to reportedly written by a senior <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>official. But what does that mean? He is demanding the paper reveal their source. His allies are now doing the same. But will the old gray lady blink as you know the Times yesterday published the op-ed and the author claim the president is unfit for office and that a number of staffers are doing everything they can to protect the nation from the president.</p><p>As we speak, the hunt is on for the so-called mole and now the list of senior officials denying it's them continues to grow. Everyone from the vice president to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, even <person><nameText>Ben Carson, </nameText></person>no. I thought it was <person><nameText>Ben Carson. </nameText></person>In a scathing statement, White Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said, \"For those of you asking for the identity of the anonymous coward, the media is wild obsession with, the identity of the unanimous coward is recklessly tarnishing the reputation of thousands of great Americans who proudly serve our country and work for <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>Stop. If you want to know who this gutless loser is, call the opinion desk of the failing NYT and ask them. Sanders continued, they're the only one complicit in this deceitful act. We stand united together and fully support our President <person><nameText>Donald J. Trump.</nameText></person>\"</p><p>The op-ed also claims some senior officials have mulled the idea of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. And now, oh, Massachusetts Democratic <person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>has jumped on that bandwagon telling CNN, \"If senior administration officials think the President of the United States is not able to do his job, then they should invoke the 25th Amendment.\" The president has also been a master at beating back crisis after crisis.</p><p>Will he prevail once again? Joining me now <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Chief National Correspondent, Ed Henry.</p><p>ED HENRY, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Spoiler alert, yes. The -- no. He'll prevail again.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, he will prevail.</p><p>HENRY: We -- a crisis -- there's a crisis. Every day there's a crisis.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Every day there's a crisis. This, you know, I'm going to be a little bit cynical here. I talked to with Corey Lewandowski last night about this and floated the idea that maybe this whole thing is a ruse and - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HENRY: By someone inside the White house?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: By someone inside the White House at the direction of the president in order to get the Woodward --</p><p>HENRY: I don't believe that. But it's an interesting theory simply because what this is doing is rallying the president's base and saying, there is a deep state. You put together the Woodward book, you put together this anonymous op-ed, you mentioned the great lady. This almost never happen an idea of an anonymous op-ed. Put your name to it. If this is really happening now --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And have some journalistic standards if you're going to publish something like that and demand that this person comes forward.</p><p>HENRY: My favorite part of the op-ed was when the anonymous author referred to an anonymous official inside the White House who was outraged that at a recent meeting the president at the last minute reversed himself on basically an anonymous policy. It didn't even say it was education bill, the healthcare bill. They said he reverse -- so you had an anonymous person about an anonymous person about an anonymous policy.</p><p>My point just being if this is really going on behind the scene then people should put their name to it and let's hash it out.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: You know what, this is like -- it's like being in Vincent van Gogh's art studio and complaining that his paint strokes are too chunky. Like we know what the process is. We know what the outcome is and we don't --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HENRY: -- is a very serious thing. It would be at least more than half. So a majority of the senior officers I think the constitution says that the amendment to the constitution says would have to go to the president pro tem of the Senate and say the president cannot perform his duties, basically the cabinet. More than half the cabinet. And while there has been these little rumors about it, there's really been no serious effort by the cabinet to do this.</p><p>And that's why I think you're seeing, you know, many cabinet people like <person><nameText>James Mattis </nameText></person>who has respect of leaders in both parties saying this is not true.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes. And I think that there are enough people who want to just see the end of this president's term. And I mean it's exhausting work and It doesn't matter who the president is like half of this people are bound to quit in 2020.</p><p>HENRY: If there's the other thing, if <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>were to get her way and the 25th Amendment is invoke and the president is gone, Vice President Pence becomes the president and that's someone that Democrats don't want --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: -- critical point. That's the one person on earth she doesn't want to be president. But I really think there is so much delusion here that people think that <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>is going to be president. That somehow there was a bad call in the U.S. Open and the umpire has been overthrown and, you know, Roger Federer somehow --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HENRY: -- we have this, you know, instant replay mentality perhaps. You're right. And it was Robert Reich, the Labor Secretary of the Clinton administrator recently called it he wants an annulment that basically it never happened the election of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and so you would not just by his estimation remove him. This is serious. He said --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Like a Catholic marriage? Come on.</p><p>HENRY: And you would remove him from office, but you also wipe out the executive orders, the tax cuts, that basically never happened. Come on.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I mean but that is in and of itself a symptom of severe psychological condition. Someone who really thinks that you can just wave your magic wand because you don't like the outcome with an election. There are things that the president does that I don't like. You know, I think there are a lot of things that he does that are very, very distracting. And, you know, there are some things in this op-ed that are true that if you just look at the president's record and took his temperament out of it, yes, he would be more popular.</p><p>But he's also historically not that unpopular.</p><p>HENRY: And when you go back to your theory about could someone in the White House have sort of leaked this op-ed or done this op-ed to distract or anything? I think what else is going on. Well, again, I don't believe that theory. It's interesting because another story got overshadow this week that Bob Mueller according to the New York Times has privately said to the president's legal team, never mind about an interview over Russian collusion.</p><p>You can basically do it in writing. That means he has nothing probably on Russian collusion. That is a big deal. It makes it less and less likely he'll be impeached --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Or a perjury trap also isn't a critical element because that means that the Mueller team has internalize that you can't indict a sitting president and they don't have enough to --</p><p>HENRY: Correct. And, oh, by the way, while we're talking about all this other stuff, <person><nameText>Brett Kavanaugh </nameText></person>is about to be confirmed to the Supreme Court.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: No. The president <person><nameText>Cory Booker </nameText></person>has his way.</p><p>HENRY: So that would be two Supreme Court justices in a year and a half. And so my point being while many of the media folks and it was chaos and crisis as you said at the top. The president is getting the stuff done.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And that's a perfect transition. Ed Henry, thank you so much.</p><p>HENRY: Good to see you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Great to see you in New York. Now, meantime, another shocking day in that very Kavanaugh confirmation hearing. Here's a live look inside, yes. It's still going on. But today with New Jersey Democratic Senator <person><nameText>Cory Booker's </nameText></person>grandstanding that absolutely stole the show. Core Bear, where are you?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>CORY BOOKER </nameText></person>(D), NEW JERSEY: I'm going to release the e-mail about racial profiling and I understand that penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate. And if Senator Cornyn believes that I violated Senate rules, I openly invite and accept the consequences.</p><p>SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX), SENATE MAJORITY WHIP: Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate. No senator deserves to sit on this committee or serve in the senate in my view if they decide to be a law under themselves and willingly flout the rules of the senate and the determination of confidentiality.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: The left is screaming go Cory. Give it to the GOP with your liberal sib. But here's the thing, that entire dramatic rant was nothing but a bunch of baloney. Cory's so-called confidential documents were cleared for release last night. So the whole thing was only for the cameras. He even called it his Spartacus moment. It was a farticus moment. Will this overshadow the actual hearing? Joining me now from \"<person><nameText>FOX NEWS @ </nameText></person>NIGHT\", it's host, Shannon Bream in D.C. live with the latest.</p><p>Shannon, welcome back. It's so nice to see you.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CHANNEL HOST: Always great to be with you, Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: So, <person><nameText>Cory booker </nameText></person>did not violate the rules of the Senate but he pretended he did.</p><p>BREAM: There's so much to unpack here. So I will tell you when we first saw him having this interchange with Senator Cornyn. I must call him Justice Cornyn. But he was a Supreme Court justice in Texas, not here in D.C. But those two were really going back and forth. But what we later learned and even after that Senator Booker left the room. One of our producers caught up with him and got him on camera because Cornyn said, you know, you're violating the rules and <person><nameText>Cory Booker </nameText></person>then made a multiple statements about bring it on.</p><p>Come after me. I can't wait to see if you actually do it. Then we learned not long after that, he knew all along according to the chairman of the senate committee, senator --sorry. There's another protester back there. But that's become the norm here. Senator Chuck Grassley though said, listen, it was around 4:00 in the morning that they notified them these documents were free for public release. So hours before he had this little showdown with Senator Cornyn, he apparently knew that those documents were completely cleared, so while he's talked about it, I'm willing to risk exposing for the senate.</p><p>Back at it, I asked his staff multiple times when he knew they would not give me a time. But they said, listen, he's going to continue to do this. And so for the rest of the day -- for the rest of the day, he has released this committee confidential documents that are not cleared. So now he is in violation.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: All right. It's too gimmicky. I mean obviously he wants to be president so badly he's willing to pull out all the stops. But the nice thing is people are so over the histrionics that they really see right through it and people also realized how critical it is these Supreme Court appointments because, you know, these are lifetime appointments. These are not, you know, senators that are hoping to play out the next few years, so they can then run for the highest office.</p><p>This really means something. And unfortunately, because of <person><nameText>Cory Booker's </nameText></person>little side show, we're distracted from asking, you know, some more pressing critical questions of this nominee.</p><p>BREAM: I mean there's been a lot of that. And even tonight as we've seen questioning by him and by others including Senator Kamala Harris and a lot of people are saying those two are both kind of running against each other. They sit beside each other on the desk here in the hearing room both with allegedly 2020 ambitions. (INAUDIBLE) ask him a number of questions and press them again and again, and many times as Judge Kavanaugh tried to answer if she wasn't getting what she wanted or thought that he wasn't going to answer with just a yes or no, and these are complex critical legal questions, she would immediately cut him off and say, OK, onto the next thing.</p><p>So finally, when she ended her questioning, the Chairman Senator Grassley said to the nominee, listen, you don't need to answer a lot of these questions. We actually like to give your answers to these questions, so we're all aware that, you know, across the dais back there behind me, there's a lot of posturing going on. I mean we got several fundraising e- mails from a number of the Democrat Senators during the hearing in the less 24 hours are still. I know you're surprised by that.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, man. I just can't believe that there are so many blowhards in one room. I mean you can always leave it to Congress to fail to deliver in a critical moment and it doesn't matter if they're questioning <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>or a Supreme Court nominee. It always goes back to the grandstanding and it's very exhausting. How would you rate Judge Kavanaugh's performance on this third day?</p><p>BREAM: You know what, I talked to a lot of the GOP senators and others who worked on murder boarding with him where they're putting to this grilling process. They talked about making it really personal going after his family, doing all kinds of things that would be a repulsive probably the most of us. They said they wanted it to be so much worse than anything he would actually face here, so he'll be prepared.</p><p>So they think that he's been calm, cool, and collected that he hasn't conceded anything that would be fatal in any way to his nomination that he has maybe taken some nicks and things here and there and had to answer about some documents from his years in the Bush White House some but nothing that really landed a real blow on him. So they feel like barring any last minute surprise. He's on a life pass to the seat. Now, of course, you know, we talked about Senator Collins and Murkowski, they're GOP Senators but pro-choice.</p><p>They're going to be critical when it comes down to that full senate vote clearly.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: All right. Well, we shall see. Still much remains unbelievable it's still going. Shannon Bream, we'll see you tonight at 11:00 p.m. on the <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Channel.</p><p>BREAM: See you then.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Thank you. Democrats, they didn't go easy pressing Kavanaugh and everything from indicting a president to Roe v. Wade, and even the Russia investigation. Now, let's jiggle a little beeper in all of this with my party panel. Joining me tonight, Freethink Media where he's a partner and Fifth Column Podcast Host, Kmele Foster is here, along with Right Turn Strategies President and LGBT for Trump Founder, Chris Barron, and <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Contributor and Tom Shillue Show Radio Host, it is Tom Shillue. Welcome, everyone.</p><p>TOM SHILLUE, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CONTRIBUTOR: Howdy. Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes. So I feel like they're focusing pretty narrowly here and the constitution has much more to it as does Supreme Court in various cases, what should some of the senators be asking Judge Kavanaugh?</p><p>KMELE FOSTER, HOST, THE FIFTH COLUMN PODCAST: Well, I think you're actually getting some decent questions out of folks like Mr. Sasse. And generally, what he tries to do in these kinds of context is actually have a conversation about how government works perhaps for the benefit of viewers at home who might not be familiar with that. The thing is what really sells in these circumstances is the circuits. It is the sensational things that are happening.</p><p>And right now, I don't know that there's anyone who is getting more out of the moment with all of their or sanctimony and pretention than <person><nameText>Cory Booker </nameText></person>unfortunately. So it's going about as well as it can go relative to the way these things usually progress. I mean Kavanaugh, I can't be certain about what kind of jurist he'll actually be. But he certainly seems to be collected. He certainly seems to be competent and a very good legal mind.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes. And there are people who say or, you know, in spite of some of the questionable 4th Amendment opinions that he has written, he could be a constitutionalist.</p><p>FOSTER: He could be.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Will <person><nameText>Cory Booker's </nameText></person>stunt work?</p><p>CHRIS BARRON, PRESIDENT, RIGHT TURN STRATEGIES: I mean it may work in the Democratic primary. I mean it depends on how well histrionics is playing with Democratic primary. Apparently, he and Kamala Harris, and everyone else thinks that's it's going to be very effective. I think this is a great moment for Republicans. This is a two for we're having here. We're going to get a conservative confirmed to the Supreme Court.</p><p>And we're letting potential Democratic wannabes for 2020 humiliate themselves on T.V., so this is great. By the way, I've heard <person><nameText>Cory Booker </nameText></person>is going to show up in the Handmaid's Tale outfit tomorrow and really stick it to him --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: That would be a great Halloween costume, not only Handmaid's Tale because that's already play. But <person><nameText>Cory Booker </nameText></person>as one of the handmaid's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARRON: I feel like every time <person><nameText>Cory Booker </nameText></person>like he's trying to like how can I be more dramatic and it's like you're at the point where it's like I think you've gone as far as you can go now --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: You're at the point where it feel like it's a skit. And, you know, and what more can they do but also and I've said this the last few nights. You think this is bad, the next one is going to be insane. I mean if this president has another appointment to the Supreme Court, it -- I cannot imagine, A, who he will pick and, B, what the reaction will be from Democrats.</p><p>SHILLUE: Well, this here it's still going to be going on when that comes to pass. But the -- even the movie, Spartacus, first of all, Senator Booker, you cannot announce you're having a Spartacus moment. You have to have other people do it.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: People have to say, I'm Spartacus --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: -- <person><nameText>Cory Booker.</nameText></person></p><p>SHILLUE: Yes. And they -- and the Democrats would have to say, no, no, kick me out of the Senate too. But they were just like, no, he's the only Spartacus.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes. And it's dumb because he already have the stuff. They released all the stuff. There was nothing secret or confidential of the, oh, I'm going to release more --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARRON: Yes.</p><p>SHILLUE: But this -- none of this prepares -- it's kind of like being president -- you're running for president, doesn't prepare for being president at all. This process it bears no resemblance to the work he's going to be doing on the Supreme Court, so the fact that he can get through this and, you know, appear to be calm, it doesn't make, you know, who cares.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: It's almost like -- did you ever watch those Navy SEALs shows on Discovery Channel?</p><p>SHILLUE: Oh, yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: You know, it's like the bud's camp, bud's training, and it's almost like that like they're not really going to be sitting in their underwear at 5:00 in the morning on a beach, probably not. But, you know, if they can get through, they get to be Navy SEALs.</p><p>BARRON: Yes (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And that's not even a lifetime appointment.</p><p>SHILLUE: Right.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Although, once a SEAL, always a SEAL.</p><p>SHILLUE: I guess that's true.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Unless of course you're an orca. The panel returns a little bit later. First up, lawmakers grandstanding on Capitol Hill books and op- eds about chaos in the White House. My next guest, there's event in Washington this week prove the elite have lost their minds and their grasp to what's really going on and the rest of America has failed. Steve Hilton joins me after the break.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Hello. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>was sent to Washington to drain the swamp, but he's causing it to have a meltdown instead. It's a little clogged. He has -- my next guest who writes that the establishment obsession with the palace intrigue of Bob Woodward's book and The New York Times who've done a piece has caused them to lose all connection to the real life struggles of working men and women in this country.</p><p>The emphasis on style over substance played right into the president's tiny hand in 2016. And joining me now to explain how it can happen once again in 2020, the author of a fantastic new book, Positive Populism: Revolutionary Ideas to Rebuild Economic Security, Family, and Community in America. He's also the host of \"THE NEXT REVOLUTION\" with Steve Hilton on the <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Channel, Steve Hilton is back. Welcome back.</p><p>STEVE HILTON, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CHANNEL HOST: So great to be here. That was a long list of things you had to read for the introduction. I apologize.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Not at all. No. It's -- your book is great and you're absolutely spot-on when you talk about people in this country being out of touch. And they're also so impressed with themselves and there's something very insular about Washington, D.C. And they're impressed with Ivy League schools, and education, and protecting the bubbles where they dwell, and not really focusing on people who are having a hard time still finding the work they would love to do in places like --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILTON: And the real world, you know, situation of the people that they're supposed to represent. I think that one of the causes of that is that they are doing so well. They -- broadly, the people at the top who basically driven an agenda that I described in my book as elitism whether the Republicans or Democrats, it doesn't matter who's been elected, it feels like the same people are in power and they've driven forward an agenda that's been great for them.</p><p>It's great for people who worked in the knowledge economy as it's called and people have in global jobs, and all that. It's fantastic. They have had an amazing time the last few decades. And they're the ones who run Washington. And they're so clearly infuriated by the fact that someone was put there in the form of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>by the rest of the country that has been left out of all of that to try and change things and they can't stand it.</p><p>And that's why all they can focus on is <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>isn't doing things the way that they would like it to be done.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Or the way they've always been done and that's the other thing. It's like, you know, there's this protocol, unspoken, and, you know, evidence, and they don't like that someone is violating that where for a lot of people they think it's pretty entertaining because they'll never be part of that. And, you know, there's a line in that New York Times op-ed piece which I found very condescending and it's like they are adults in the room.</p><p>HILTON: Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: So and that's not only thing that the president is childish which he certainly can be, but anyone who voted for him knew that going in. It's also saying, you know, paternalistically, voters are children and you don't know well enough to take care of yourself. Therefore, we have to make better decisions for you.</p><p>HILTON: Yes. And what's really stunning about the whole thing, although, I don't suppose that appreciate the irony is that, you know, for the last, what is it? You know, nearly two years, we've been lectured by them about how Trump is subverting democracy. He's undermining democratic norms. You know, one thing after another. There's an endless list. Now, Russia, everybody is subverting democracy. What could be more subverting democracy than to directly as this person, right, directly contradict and try and undermine the things and it's not just the -- his behavior that they don't like.</p><p>It's specific policies that he ran on like ending the bad trade deals. Now, you may not agree that the trade deals are bad. But he said that very clearly in the campaign. He was voted into do that and you got Gary Cohn from the Goldman Sachs guy where they're running around taking things off his desk to stop him doing -- stop him delivering his promises. The whole reason everyone is so fed up with politics as for years policies invade promises and then deliver them.</p><p>He is someone who's trying to do it in a permanent ruling, plus, literally trying to block him from doing what he was elected to do.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Now, we've only -- we've only got about 20 more seconds. But how does the president move forward and what does he internalize from this episode?</p><p>HILTON: I think he has got to focus on those promises he has already made and on delivering for the working people that put him there, and I think he shouldn't get distracted by all this rubbish. Of course, it's tempting to weigh in --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And I think that's why he has the kind of rallies that he's having tonight. And, you know, you will see part of that here on the Fox Business Network. You know, it's interesting because this is what he promised. This is what he's delivering --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILTON: But there's more to it, Kennedy. The thing I really want to say just quickly is that my book is actually a list of ideas for him to really deliver some of those promises because, OK, on some of the areas, he has --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: But see that's the difference. A lot of people talk about the problems but they don't offer solutions and that's what Positive Populism does.</p><p>HILTON: There you go. And more like just particularly point to with is drain the swamp, right? Brilliant slogan, not much has happened.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: We've got buckets. We'll do it during the break. Steve Hilton, thank you so much for being here. So good to see you in New York.</p><p>HILTON: Great to see you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: In the flesh. Coming up, a group of House Republicans frustrated with the DOJ urging the president to release FISA surveillance documents on former campaign adviser, Carter Page. I will explain why the president should listen to them, please. My monologue is next.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: The president has had a very frustrating few days between the anonymous op-ed, the Bob Woodward book, and the very contentious Kavanaugh resistance, what a stable genius to do? Well, bark up a different tree and while the noise may drown out the negative cacophony, the long-term ramifications could be enormously positive. Today, the president tweeted the deep state, and the left, and their vehicle, the fake news media are going crazy and they don't know what to do. The economy is booming like never before, jobs are at historic highs, and two -- coming two Supreme Court justices and maybe -- get this, it's the important part: declassification to find the digital corruption. He's being encouraged to declassify by a dozen lawmakers who want him to let loose more of the Carter Page FISA warrant application.</p><p>They say it was dubiously based on the malign Christopher Steele dossier, and they want not only the warrant but also a dozen 302s, those are FBI memos for Bruce Ohr and his dealings with and about Christopher Steele. If the president releases this info, it is a wonderful precedent, hopefully all future commanders in chief will have to follow because opacity is the deep state's greatest shield. We are neither too dumb or too tender to peep these pages. And let us judge for ourselves what it means (INAUDIBLE) harm, and whether or not it burns our precious eyeballs. Release the kraken, Mr. President. It is time, and that's the memo.</p><p>House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, today urging the president to show those memos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC), HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS: Mr. President, we're calling on you today to encourage those around you to go ahead and release those documents, and release those documents within the next week.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes, seven days. So, is there any down side to more transparency? In one word: hell no! The panel is here to discuss: From Free Think Media, Kmele Foster; Right Turn Strategies President, it's Chris Barron; Host of the \"Tom Shillue\" show, Tom Shillue. So, Chris, I will start with you. I would love for the president to release all of this stuff. I think it would be great to see what Bruce Ohr was saying to Christopher Steele and about Christopher Steele. And there are all sorts of memos, and it seems as though people from the Freedom Caucus already have a pretty good idea of what's in them. Why can't we see them?</p><p>BARRON: I so hope we see them. I so hope we see them because look, Democrats have created this fantasy, you know, the Russia collusion thing that is completely and totally based on faulty original intel, and they have hitched their wagon to it. And I would love nothing more for them to be embarrassed by having it revealed exactly what happened here.</p><p>And by the way, you're right, this is a great precedent. I can't believe that we've gotten to the point in this country now where the liberals are telling us that at the end of the day, we should be trusting the FBI and the CIA, and then I say, without any question whatsoever. They're always the good guys. We only have decades and decades of experience that says that's not the case.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes, and you know, I know people say that people who talk about the deep state are just crazy, nutty coocoo weirdoes. But it seems as though whenever you have the Department of Justice and the FBI withholding kind of critical information it just, sort of, lends credence to some of those theory.</p><p>FOSTER: Sure, I think transparency is wonderful and valuable -- we should see more of it, certainly, with respect to the FISA courts in particular. I want to know more about how this process works. What is bizarre about all of this, however, it's not just that the folks in the Freedom Caucus know what's in these documents or at least have some idea. The president almost certainly knows. And the president could have declassified these things a very long time ago.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Why hasn't he?</p><p>FOSTER: My suspicion is that while I do believe that most of the Russian collusion narrative is almost certainly nonsense that I don't know that there's anything in that's particularly exculpatory. And for them, it is almost certainly better to be able to elude to the possibility that there is this great massive scandal. Instead, what I suspect is what we have always known about the FISA courts. That it is pretty much rubber stamped. Lots of applications that come there, most of them, the overall majority get approved. And that this situation is probably not much different than that, not that there is a vast massive scandal that the deep state has been working to undermine the president.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes, I want to bring -- I want to bring Tom in here. Bring it home, Shillue.</p><p>SHILLUE: The deep state, they're writing editorials for the New York Times now, Kennedy. They exist. I mean, it's all out there in the open. And the only reason I think that --</p><p>MONTGOMERY: It's not all out there in open. That's the thing that's so unfortunate.</p><p>SHILLUE: Well, yes. I mean, it's in the open now because anything we -- I don't need any more convincing, that's the thing. The only reason this would be underwhelming, the unredacted FISA documents is that it would -- you know, we already know, we already know that there were people working against the president.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And we know that there is something weird going on and there are a bunch of people who know about the weirdness who are protecting something, and we don't know what that is. Hopefully, we will know. Tom, Chris and Kmele, thank you so much.</p><p>The <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>getting serious about cracking down on social media. Come on, man! And it all has to do with claims of bias against conservatives. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions will reportedly meeting state attorneys general later this month to discuss concerns to tech companies \"maybe hurting competition\" and intentionally stifling the free exchange about these on their platforms. Just yesterday, senators on both sides of the aisle proposed regulating social media directly to the faces of Twitter CEO <person><nameText>Jack Dorsey </nameText></person>-- nice beard -- and Facebook COO <person><nameText>Sheryl Sandberg. </nameText></person>So, is the federal government right to step in or should they cool their regulatory guns? Reason.com Managing Editor Peter Suderman joins me now. This all sounds like a really dumb idea because tech companies will always be 12 steps ahead of the government.</p><p>PETER SUDERMAN, MANAGING EDITOR, REASON.COM: It is a dumb idea. And the problem here is that absolutely everyone kind of agrees with this dumb idea. And by everyone, I mean Republicans, I mean Democrats and I mean even big tech companies. So, you've got the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>saying, well, we need to look into this. You know, Jeff sessions talking with attorneys general. You've got Democrats who basically think that Facebook is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Vladimir Putin and threw the election against <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton.</nameText></person></p><p>And there hadn't been a bunch of weird Jesus and Satan memes on Facebook, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>would have won. And you also got the tech companies saying that they're in favor of regulation at this point. I think the stand-up moment for me. The most of telling moment from these hearings which when <person><nameText>Sheryl Sandberg </nameText></person>said something to the effect of, well, look, we're not against regulation as long as it's the right kind of regulation, right?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes, and you know what that is? That's her winking to lawmakers going, we'll give you a bunch of money, come to Northern California. Because they want to help write these laws. That's what unions have done for decade -- millennia.</p><p>SUDERMAN: Of course, they want to be involved in the process. The want to write laws that are favorable to them, that don't really hurt them, that are toothless, but even more important that hurt their competitors more. This is about a big incumbent wanting to maintain its position in the marketplace. And I think it's really dangerous to be in this situation where everybody agrees -- well, let's regulate. Let's treat Facebook, Twitter, social media like a public utility. These are private companies. The speech that is on them is private. And there's really a -- I think a very problematic idea that we see in both parties, that we see even in Silicon Valley right now, that basically, social media is kind of a public utility and should be regulated like a public utility, and that is an anti- speak view.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Consumers don't want that. Do you think there's any correlation between those hearings yesterday and the scolding Dorsey and Sandberg got from lawmakers? And Alex Jones and Info Wars being banned from Twitter permanently today?</p><p>SUDERMAN: I think there's probably some vague connection. I don't know if there's a sort of direct line. Look, all of these things are happening at the same time for a reason. And it's because social media platforms represent a new way of thinking about speech, and that makes people anxious. And of course, when people get anxious, the government wants to step in and regulate it. In this case, it's speech. We don't regulate speech that is a, sort of -- paramount part of the American idea is that speech is a private, personal, individual kind of expression and what we see so much with -- what we see with all of these hearings, what we see coming even from these tech companies is that they think that speech is a public good and should be regulated.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: It's private. Up here, Suderman, that's my free speech. Just kidding! I think you are great.</p><p>SUDERMAN: I like your Sessions impression. You do a pretty good Alabama.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Well, thank you. Peter Suderman-computerman, thanks again, my friend.</p><p>SUDERMAN: Thank you for having me.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: All right. Coming up, he's lived hard and played hard but and survived to tell about it -- just barely. Actor Gary Busey, he joins me in moments with some wilds thoughts on the president at addiction. And of course, Patrick (INAUDIBLE), that's next.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: My next guest says he's not just a Hollywood survivor, and he survived everything Hollywood be damned. Actor Gary Busey has endured a full yet tough life, and through it all, he's got a very positive outlook. He's faced his share of disasters, a divorce, addiction, bankruptcy, a motorcycle that nearly killed him and a terrifying battle with cancer. And he finally released a memoir to explain how a person can make it past all that and still find the silver lining in just about everything. With me now: Actor, and Author, and Musican; his brand new book, \"Busey\" as in Gary Busey's, \"Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\", the Busey bible. The one and only, he is here. Welcome, Gary.</p><p>GARY BUSEY, ACTOR AND AUTHOR: Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: It's so nice to talk to you. I've been a fan of yours for such a long time.</p><p>BUSEY: I am a fan of yours. I watch you on T.V. and wondered who is that girl, and I'd like to have a talk with her one day, and the wish came true, and here we are.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Fantastic. And you wrote a book.</p><p>BUSEY: Yes. By the way, \"Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\" spells bible.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: That's right. And you are a man, you had found god in your travails and, you know, through the insane cocaine addictions and writing bounced checks, how did that happen?</p><p>BUSEY: It happened because that's where I was at that time mentally. And when you grow, you go through a process of choices making learning -- learning the scales of living, and that's what I do now. I love to give with love. Loving and giving are two things. When you're 74-years-old, which I am, you get to a place, a plateau in your life where you learn that other people's feelings are more important than yours. And it's a great thing to give that to people because they know you love them without saying it.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Who are you closer to on \"Point Break,\" Keanu Reeves or Patrick Swasey.</p><p>BUSEY: God bless Patrick Swasey in spiritual realm.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Amen. Do you ever have dreams about him?</p><p>BUSEY: No, but one time I was sitting on a bench and I felt an energy coming up from my left, I looked up, and it was the face of Patrick Swasey with a spiritual trail behind him. And while behind him was the face of my father. So, they came down to tell me they love me.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Was that a difficult moment for you?</p><p>BUSEY: No, no. You know, when you pass on, I've been to the other side twice -- it's in the book, and it's a beautiful place. You have love, protection, and trust like you never felt. You can't feel it like it is over there on Earth, but that's the way it is. Earth is the boot camp toward afterlife, and you got to make the right choices to get there. But even if you make it wrong choices, you can adjust it by saying, oh, boy, and make the right choice.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Now, you were on \"The Apprentice\" twice, and you said you knew when the president, now, when he was going to run that he was going to win. And others people who have met him have said the exactly same thing about him. What is it about him that gives you and others that kind of certainty?</p><p>BUSEY: It's not a certainty. It's a feeling you have. And what I do, I don't talk about politics. I don't want to be in. I'm not in it. The parties are parties, but they don't have fun. Everything is in the book.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: That's right. It's a great book.</p><p>BUSEY: Everybody, get the book.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And the amazing thing about it is you cannot believe how many movies you have been in.</p><p>BUSEY: In the movies, when they say cut, you get to get up and wipe off the blood and change your clothes and go home, and then eat.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Well, oddly enough, when you got killed as Gary Busey, you come back to life for a third time.</p><p>BUSEY: Oh, you can, you can come back to life all the time because that's what life is. There's coming back. The word death, D-E-A-T-H, stands for: don't expect a tragedy here, because you don't die. You go to a different place, and it's a lot of fun. It's great.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Why do you come back if it's so fun.</p><p>BUSEY: Why did I come back? I was told by the angels who spoke to me (INAUDIBLE), that what I was doing was good. But my responsibility to mankind, I had to look for help in the spiritual realm. And the voice said, you may come with us now or return to your body and continue your destiny. So, without thinking, oh, I said, it's your choice, and without thinking -- you don't think or feel, but I was back in life.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: The book is loaded with those experiences -- and acronyms.</p><p>BUSEY: The book has all these stories -- and acronyms. They're Busey-ism.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: They're Busey-ism, says exactly what they are.</p><p>BUSEY: While I take the letters of a word.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Like hope.</p><p>BUSEY: Hope, H-O-P-E, stands for: heavenly offerings prevail eternally.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Halleluiah. Gary Busey, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>BUSEY: Oh, I got to give you one more.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p>BUSEY: Nuts, N-U-T-S: never understand estimate the spirit.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, that's beautiful.</p><p>BUSEY: You got to go and get on of these now.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Look at those.</p><p>BUSEY: Close up. Extreme close-up. Extreme close-up.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Give me two.</p><p>BUSEY: Give me two, two. Oh, that's great.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: OK. \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: A New Jersey man was arrested today after threatening to blow up Disney world. Prosecutors say, this would be -- the would-be bomber is facing 20 years in prison or 10 if he gets a fast pass. Get in the line because this the \"TOPICAL STORM.\"</p><p>Topic number one. We begin tonight on Capitol Hill where they've had so many protesters they're now auctioning off spots.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>They tried to interrupt the testimony of Twitter CEO <person><nameText>Jack Dorsey, </nameText></person>but she got shut down faster than an Info Wars account. Missouri Congressman Billy Long tapped into his past life as an auctioneer. And drowned her out to the delight of the crowd. The demonstrator was escorted out of the hearing, and she'll now go where all the other protesters go nowadays, to a Nike ad. Well done, sister!</p><p>Topic number two. She still has a better throwing arm than Kaepernick, you heck! You wrecked the Niners. Lake Tahoe, California is one of the nicest places you'll ever see. But their tourism has hit a bit of a bear market. A man came home to find this fellow go on full rock band trashing his house. Not only did he destroy the carpet, he also tore apart the wall and smashed a table, because YOLO -- You Only Led (INAUDIBLE) Once. The cops were called, but by the time they showed up, the bear had ran over the hills and far away and the homeowner was dazed and confused, and petting black dog like a fool in the rain. OK, I'll quit the Zeppelin puns now, but I could ramble on all day.</p><p>Topic number three. KFC has good news for expectant moms with student loan debt. The company is giving away $11,000 in free tuition this Sunday to the first mom who names her baby, Harland -- after Colonel Harland Sanders. Now, sure, your kid is going to get beat up in school for the rest of his life, but at least you won't be paying off your student loans for the rest of yours. The promotion is on September 9th, in honor what would have been the colonel's 128th birthday. The $11,000 giveaway is a nod to his secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices. I would say its finger looking good, but you can't that no more on a family show. Of course, if you're naming your kid Harland, that's a bridge too far, there's other ways for new parents to save money like buying baby items at auction in D.C.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Thank you for yielding back. She didn't put in a bid but she's about to do a bid. Well, nice to see someone grand standing in the chamber besides Kamala Harris. That's her new last name.</p><p>Topic number four, very mature. We don't usually get too serious in the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" But today, we lost a legend. Hollywood mega star and all-around badass, Burt Reynolds is dead at 82. He was perhaps best-known for smoky and the bandit, but he also starred in such classic as \"Cannibal Run Deliberant\" and \"Boogie Nights\" among many others. He can have a spare share of bombs, but he was still the highest grossing actor from 1978 to 1982. And get this, he was such a renegade, he actually turned down the roles of Han Solo and James Bond. Legend has it, he stared in more stunts than anyone except <person><nameText>Cory Booker. </nameText></person>So, raise a glass and write a mustache for Burt. They don't make them like that anymore, buddy, cheers and rest in peace.</p><p>Topic number five. In a week that's been highlighted by hooligan hecklers on Capitol Hill. It's only right that we hear from our peanut gallery for something we call viewer mail. Joyful Hope brings the hate with: \"Will you stop calling the president kind of weird? Look into the mirror snot nose. Just can't watch your sorry ass. Try to get after Lou Dobbs. You're an arrogant sad sack libertarian.\" Tristansez writes: \"I have to drink any time I have to listen to you.\" Yes, get the line at the bar, it's pretty crowded.

Uber on Monday confirmed Business Insider's reporting that it plans to lay off 3,000 more workers in addition to its previous round of 3,700 job cuts earlier in May.[3]Together, the layoffs represent about a quarter of the company's entire global workforce, which stood at 28,600 at the end of March.In an email to staff obtained by Business Insider, Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said he consulted with leaders at other companies to see if there was a better option.Ultimately, however, he said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 which has sent ride requests on Uber's app plunging as much as 80% across the board \u2014 required direct action to cut costs. He also outlined the severance packages the company will provide to affected employees, and detailed new restructuring efforts designed to further save money.Investors cheered the announcement, which Uber said would save more than $1 billion in planned spending. </p><p>Uber's stock price gained 6% in trading Monday compared to Friday's close. Here's Khosrowshahi's full email to staff: Subject: A very difficult day, and what's nextTeam Uber:These have been unprecedented and challenging times for everyone\u2014our societies, our governments, our families, our economies, all around the world. They've also been challenging for Uber, and many of you, as you've waited for us to define the road ahead. I've said clearly that we had to take tough action to resize our company to the new reality of our business, and that I would come back to you this week with the specifics.Today I have the specifics: we have made the incredibly difficult decision to reduce our workforce by around 3,000 people, and to reduce investments in several non-core projects. As a leadership team we had to take the time to make the right decisions, to ensure that we are treating our people well, and to make certain that we could walk you through our decision making in the sort of detailed and transparent manner you deserve.Where we started and hard choicesWe began 2020 on an accelerated path to total company profitability. Then the coronavirus hit us with a once-in-a-generation public health and economic crisis. People are rightfully staying home, and our Rides business, our main profit generator, is down around 80%. We're seeing some signs of a recovery, but it comes off of a deep hole, with limited visibility as to its speed and shape.You've heard me say it before: hope is not a strategy. While that's easy to say, the truth is that this is a decision I struggled with. Our balance sheet is strong, Eats is doing great, Rides looks a little better, maybe we can wait this damn virus out...I wanted there to be a different answer. Let me talk to a few more CEOs...maybe one of them will tell me some good news, but there simply was no good news to hear. Ultimately, I realized that hoping the world would return to normal within any predictable timeframe, so we could pick up where we left off on our path to profitability, was not a viable option.I knew that I had to make a hard decision, not because we are a public company, or to protect our stock price, or to please our Board or investors. I had to make this decision because our very future as an essential service for the cities of the world\u2014our being there for millions of people and businesses who rely on us\u2014demands it. We must establish ourselves as a self-sustaining enterprise that no longer relies on new capital or investors to keep growing, expanding, and innovating.We have to take these hard actions to stand strong on our own two feet, to secure our future, and to continue on our mission.I know that none of this will make it any easier for our friends and colleagues affected by the actions we are taking today. To those of you personally impacted, I am truly sorry. I know this will cause pain for you and your families, especially now. Many of you will be affected not because of the quality of your work, but because of strategic decisions we made to discontinue certain areas of activity, or projects that are no longer necessary, or simply because of the stark reality we face. You have been a huge part of this company and every day forward we will build on the foundations that you established, brick by brick.Our decisions and the road forwardWe have decided to re-focus our efforts on our core. If there is one silver lining regarding this crisis, it's that Eats has become an even more important resource for people at home and for restaurants; and delivery, whether of groceries or other local goods, is not only an increasing part of everyday life, it is here to stay. We no longer need to look far for the next enormous growth opportunity: we are sitting right on top of one. I will caution that while Eats growth is accelerating, the business today doesn't come close to covering our expenses. I have every belief that the moves we are making will get Eats to profitability, just as we did with Rides, but it's not going to happen overnight.So we need to fundamentally change the way we operate. We need to make some really hard decisions about what we will and won't do going forward, based on a few principles: We are organizing around our core: helping people move, and delivering things.We are building a cost-efficient structure that avoids layers and duplication and can scale, at speed.We are being intentional with our location strategy focused on key markets/hubs. Mac will now lead a unified Mobility team, which will include Rides and, as of today, Transit. Mac will continue to manage our cross-cutting functions like Safety &amp;#38; Insurance, CommOps, U4B, and Business Development, the latter of which will be centralized across Rides, Eats, andGiven the necessary cost cuts and the increased focus on core, we have decided to wind down the Incubator and AI Labs and pursue strategic alternatives for Uber Works. Due to these decisions, Zhenya has decided it makes sense to move on from Uber. Zhenya is customer-centric to core, and I am deeply grateful for all of her hard work.We are also looking at our geographic footprint. While it served us well for many years to cast a wide physical net, it's time to be more intentional about where we have employees on the ground. We are closing or consolidating around 45 office locations globally, including winding down Pier 70 in San Francisco and moving some of those colleagues to our new HQ in SF. And over the next 12 months we will begin the process of winding down our Singapore office and moving to a new APAC hub in a market where we operate our services.Having learned my own personal lesson about the unpredictability of the world from the punch-in-the-gut called COVID-19, I will not make any claims with absolute certainty regarding our future. I will tell you, however, that we are making really, really hard choices now, so that we can say our goodbyes, have as much clarity as we can, move forward, and start to build again with confidence.How we are helping departing employeesAs we previewed last week, we have taken a lot of feedback and worked to provide strong severance benefits and other support for those leaving Uber, like healthcare coverage and an alumni talent directory. We're also taking care to support people in special situations a bit differently, like those on US visas or parental leaves. While the details will differ slightly by country, you can see a summary here. Every departing employee will have a 1:1 to receive the details of their individual package.Given the global nature of these changes, and the local rules and regulations involved, the individual experience today will vary by country:If you are one of the many affected Uber teammates, I'll acknowledge right here that any package we offer, regardless of how thoughtful or generous, will never replace the opportunity to belong, to make a difference, to establish the kinds of bonds you establish with any important company or cause. We wouldn't be here without you. We will finish what you started, and we will be excited to see the great things that you will build next.I am incredibly thankful to *everyone* reading this email, because the resilience and grit you've shown has made Uber the company it is and will continue to be. I've never had a harder day professionally than today, but Uber has consistently surprised me with the challenges it has thrown my way.

Investor's Business Daily built models of the most successful stocks and investors of the last half-century. We analyzed all their common characteristics, what variables occurred before the best stocks had huge advances and how these variables changed when the stocks topped. So these rules and principles represent how the market actually works. If you ignore them and rely instead on personal opinions, feelings or emotions, you are potentially arguing with how the market has functioned for 50 years and you will likely make more costly mistakes.  1. Consider buying stocks with each of the last three years' earnings up 25%+, return on equity of 17%+ and recent earnings and sales accelerating.  2. Recent quarterly earnings and sales should be up 25% or more.  3. Avoid cheap stocks. Buy stocks selling at $ 15 a share and higher.  4. Learn how to use charts to spot sound bases and exact buy points. Confine buys to these points as stocks break out on big volume increases.  5. Cut every loss when it's 8% below your cost. Make no exceptions so you can always avoid huge, damaging losses. Never average down in price.  6. Have selling rules on when to sell and take profit on the way up. Review \"When to Sell and Take a Profit\" in \"How to Make Money in Stocks.\" 7.</p><p>Buy when market indexes are in an uptrend. Reduce investments and raise cash when general market indexes show five or more days of volume distribution.  8. Read IBD's Investor's Corner and Big Picture columns to learn how to recognize important tops and bottoms in market indexes.  9. Buy stocks with a Relative Price Strength Rating of 85 or higher in the IBD SmartSelect Corporate Ratings.  10. Pick companies with management ownership of stock.  11. Buy mostly in the top six broad industry sectors in IBD's New Highs List.  12. Select stocks with increasing institutional sponsorship in recent quarters.  13. Current quarterly after-tax profit margins should be improving and near their peak.  14. Don't buy because of dividends or P-E ratios. Buy the No. 1 company in an industry in earnings and sales growth, R.O.E., profit margins and product quality.  15. Pick companies with a new product or service.  16. Select mainly New America entrepreneurial companies (those that had an IPO within the last eight years).  17. Check into companies buying back 5% to 10% of their stock and those with new management (what is management's background?).  18. Don't try to bottom guess or buy on the way down. Never argue with the market. Forget your pride and ego.  19. Find out if the market currently favors big-cap or small-cap stocks.  20. Do a post-analysis of all your buys and sells. Post on charts where you bought and sold. Evaluate and develop rules to correct your major mistakes.  3 Are you tempted to buy Nortel Networks, Lucent Technologies or other cheap former highfliers at rock-bottom prices? Be careful. You might get what you pay for.  When it comes to investing, it's quality you should be concerned with, not quantity. A $ 2 stock is cheap for a reason. The company usually lacks sales and earnings growth, or has serious financial problems. These companies trade more on promises than performance.  The two-year bear market has dragged down prices of past winners. Many big tech and biotech stocks have shed more than 90% of their value to a few dollars, or even pennies. Why? It's usually because the company's fundamentals have slipped.  Competition, regulations on the industry and news of SEC probes and accounting scandals can also severely damage these low-priced issues.  Instead, most big winners start out at prices between 25 and 50 a share. Companies should have annual earnings and sales growth of 25% or more, new products and be in a leading industry. These qualities are what draw in big institutional support. It's their buying power that moves stocks to new highs.  There are more than 3,700 stocks trading under 10 a share in the market today. But finding a diamond among the rubble can be a fruitless task. You're better off buying a few shares of companies that have proven themselves than big blocks of tiny, thinly traded stocks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4690-YHF0-003M-X272-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>July 15, 2002, Monday</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000340</classCode><className>COMPANY EARNINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000718</classCode><className>FINANCIAL RESULTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001410</classCode><className>COMPANY PROFITS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A2I9</classCode><className>AFTER TAX PROFIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000518</classCode><className>DIVIDENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096T0</classCode><className>SALES FIGURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008XJY</classCode><className>SALES &amp; SELLING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000944</classCode><className>INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N523110GM</classCode><className>SECURITIES TRADING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000919</classCode><className>INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

It was the biggest one-month tally since Challenger started tracking eight years ago. Telecom, computer and electronics companies accounted for almost half of July's figure. But experts note a layoff announcement isn't a layoff. It could be part of a months-long plan that could change with the economy.  California High Court Finds No Liability For Gun Firms 2Victims cannot sue gun makers when criminals use their products illegally, California's top court ruled. It rejected a suit stemming from the 1993 massacre of eight people in a skyscraper. The 5-1 decision was in step with other courts. Every state high court and federal appellate court in the nation to consider such suits has ruled that makers of legal, non-defective guns cannot be sued for their criminal misuse. A lower state appeals court had OK'd such suits.  Market In A Deep Snooze, Falls On Comatose Trade 3Traders deserted Wall Street, cutting volume to its lowest full-session level of the year on Nasdaq and one of the year's lowest on the NYSE. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 each sank 1.1%, and the Nasdaq lost 1.6%. Consumer electronics retailers finished as the day's third-worst group after RadioShack reported a 6% drop in July same-store sales. The news whacked Best Buy and others.</p><p>Funeral services and office supply stores closed strong as defensive issues hung on to most of the market's top spots. More on A18 Chip Price War Casualties: Intel Goals, Pentium Prices 4Salomon analyst Jon Joseph cut the No. 1 chipmaker's 2001 profit view to 47 cents a share from 54 cents, with consensus views of 51 cents. Lehman analyst Dan Niles lowered forecasts for Intel's average selling price and unit shipments, citing a price war among chipmakers. Joseph slashed 2002 guidance by a nickel to 70 cents. Niles said Intel will cut prices for its high-end Pentium 4 chip by 50% on Aug. 26 and another 10% to 25% on Oct. 28 if demand doesn't pick up. Intel fell 1.40, or 4%, to 30.28.More on A9 EPA Mulls Cut In Number Of Required Gas Blends 5The head of the Environmental Protection Agency is considering reducing the number of gasoline blends used around the country to help promote clean air. In a USA Today interview, EPA administrator Christie Whitman said limiting the number of \"boutique blends\" to three or four formulas could increase fuel supplies and help prevent large spikes in the prices drivers see at the pump. But, she added, \"It is very much a states' rights issue.\" Cisco 4th-Qtr Report Due, But Outlook Seen Crucial 6Cisco Systems' fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, due out after Tuesday's close is one of the last big tech earnings reports this summer. But Wall Street will focus on Cisco's guidance for its next fiscal year. Analysts hope for signs of improved demand, but many doubt Cisco will report any pickup. Rival makers haven't seen demand improve much, and may be undercutting Cisco on price. Its router business got a boost due to a new release, but overall demand remains weak. Most analysts expect the company to have \"limited visibility\" into 2002.More on A6 EchoStar Bids For Hughes, Threatening Murdoch Deal 7EchoStar Communications' $ 32 billion stock offer comes just weeks after Hughes' parent General Motors rejected a prior offer from EchoStar. GM spurned the original offer, in part due to antitrust concerns. GM said last month it was moving forward in talks with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. to sell Hughes. Hughes' DirecTV is the No. 1 U.S. satellite TV broadcaster, with 10 million customers vs. EchoStar's 6.1 million.  IRA's New Arms Proposal Is Hailed As Breakthrough 8The plan wasn't immediately disclosed. Nor did the commission overseeing peace talks say when the outlawed group would start disarming. Protestant politicians who had demanded an actual start expressed doubts the Irish Republican Army had offered enough. \"Based on our discussions with the IRA representative, we believe that this proposal initiates a process that will put IRA arms completely and verifiably beyond use,\" said the panel led by Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain.  US Air Rejects Buyout Bid, Saying It Lacks Credibility 9Global Airlines, a holding firm with no flight operations, offered to buy US Airways for $ 1.8 billion, or $ 27 a share. US Airways quickly said it wanted no part of the deal. Analysts gave it little credence as well. Global Airlines, owned entirely by investor Emil Bernard, unsuccessfully tried several times to buy Trans World Airlines before it was sold to American Airlines earlier this year. US Airways and UAL's United Airlines ended a proposed $ 4.3 billion merger pact in July after U.S. regulators challenged the deal.  General Dynamics To Buy Motorola Unit For $ 825 Mil 10General Dynamics said Motorola's Integrated Information Systems Group will boost its product offerings for its military and government customers. The unit provides defense customers technologies, products and systems for secure communication systems. The defense contractor expects the unit to generate 2002 sales of $ 830 million. Earnings should get an immediate boost. The deal, which awaits regulatory OK, should close in two months. The business will become a part of General Dynamics' Information Systems &amp; Technology group.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:43P3-HJF0-003M-X4T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"911\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>August 7, 2001</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>INTEL CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0CHALLENGER GRAY &amp;

The Nasdaq took a 1.3% pounding, while the S&amp;P 500 and NYSE composite lost 0.8%. The Dow fell a moderate 0.4%. The small-cap S&amp;P 600 tumbled 1.9%. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 7 basis points to 4.63% on weak economic data. More on this page, B2</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Retail Gasoline Prices Top $3</p><p>2 The nationwide average price at the pump shot up 10 cents last week to $3.02 a gallon, the most since mid-Aug. Gasoline prices have soared as refinery woes limit already tight supply and demand ramps up for the summer driving season. Gas futures rose 3.4% -- 18.6% in April -- to $2.4405. June gas closed nearly flat Mon. at $2.2594. June crude fell 75 cents to $65.71 a barrel.</p><p>Spending Weak, Inflation Cools</p><p>3 Personal incomes rose 0.7% in March, the same as in Feb. But consumer spending grew just 0.3%, the weakest since Oct. Inflation-adjusted spending fell 0.2%, the weakest since Sept. '05. But the core PCE deflator, closely watched by the Fed, was essentially flat in March. Core inflation fell to 2.1% from Feb.'s 2.4%. That's just above the Fed's 1%-2% comfort zone.

The deal will merge ISE with derivatives exchange Eurex, a venture of Deutsche Boerse and the Swiss Exchange. The deal is still subject to board and regulatory approval.</p><p>High Court Limits Patent Rights</p><p>5 The Supreme Court made it easier to toss suits over patents that do not create a genuine innovation. Big tech firms cheered the 9-0 ruling; GE and drug firms opposed it. Also, justices limited suits over software exports, saying Microsoft doesn't owe damages to AT&amp;T for overseas Windows sales. That could help Microsoft appeals of $2 bil in damages in 2 recent patent cases. More on A5</p><p>Building, Factory Activity Weak</p><p>6 Construction spending rose 0.2% in March after Feb.'s 1.5% gain, as commercial building offset housing's slump. But overall spending fell 2% vs. a year earlier. Meantime, the NAPM-Chicago regional factory index fell to 52.9 in April after spiking to 61.7 in March, though still above the neutral 50. The national ISM manufacturing index is due out on Tue.

At least 102 Iraqis were killed or found dead Mon., including 32 in a suicide bombing at a Shiite funeral. About a dozen blasts were heard late Mon. in Baghdad, apparently from rockets fired toward the Green Zone, AP reported. An Iranian envoy met with Iraq's foreign minister, voicing support for its gov't.</p><p>War Panel: Israel PM \"A Failure'</p><p>8 Israel's Lebanon war commission released a scathing report vs. Ehud Olmert that cast doubt on his political future, but didn't call on him to resign. The gov't-appointed panel accused him of rushing to war with Hezbollah last July. Olmert, who heads the centrist Kadima party, said he wouldn't resign.</p><p>5 Get Life For London Bomb Plot</p><p>9 A judge sentenced the British citizens to life in prison for plotting to attack targets in London, including a popular nightclub, power plants and shopping mall, with bombs made from a half-ton stockpile of fertilizer. The trial exposed ties between the defendants and the deadly 2005 al-Qaida-linked attack on the city's transit system.</p><p>Verizon Beats, Revenue Rises</p><p>10 The phone company raised Q1 profit 17.4% to 54 cents a share ex items, beating views by a penny. Revenue grew 6.4% to $22.58 bil. Consumer revenue fell 3.5% to $4.2 bil as Verizon continued to lose residential phone customers to cable TV companies. Meanwhile, the number of its FiOS TV subscribers grew by 141,000 homes to 348,000.

Euro</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1 The euro surged to a record high vs. the greenback, fueled by the U.S.' decision to impose new quotas on Chinese textiles, raising fears of increased protectionism.

The board of directors will handle regulatory issues. A board of executives, made up of NYSE trading firms, will handle market operations. Some critics wanted a complete split. The SEC must OK the changes.</p><p>Key Retailers Cleaned Up In Q3</p><p>7 Home Depot earned 50 cents a share, up 25% vs. Q3 '02 and beating views by 4 cents as store improvements paid off.

Costco Wholesale's Jan. same-store sales fell 2% as shoppers avoided nonessentials like jewelry. Falling gas prices also hurt. Costco shares sank 7% to a 3-year low.

The report makes three distinct sets of recommendations: revising measures within financial regulation, strengthening the policy response on themes that cut across industries, and extending finance-specific regulations to other industries where inconsistencies in regulation and enforcement have emerged.     Hannah Gurga, Managing Director, Digital Technology &amp; Cyber, UK Finance, said:    Technology is transforming many aspects of our lives, including the way we choose to bank and manage our finances. Across the banking and finance sector, firms are investing in new technologies and partnering with fintech operators to develop products and services that better meet the needs of their customers. The entry of big tech into financial services creates new opportunities, but it also brings new risks. As we embark on this next market evolution, consideration is now needed as to how best to maintain the stability, resilience, and consumer protections that are so integral to the banking system.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42665117806</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DT-NN91-JCSC-J4Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"269\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>UK Finance</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The public platform, IBM's first industry-specific cloud, is designed to meet the high regulatory, security and resiliency standards required of the financial services industry. \"By setting a standard that addresses the concern of hosting highly confidential information, we aim to drive the public cloud to a safety level that is unmatched,\" said Cathy Bessant, chief operations and technology officer of Bank of America. </p><p>Bank of America has focused on its internal cloud computing capabilities. Over the past several years the second largest U.S. bank has gotten down to about 70,000 servers from over 200,000 and trimmed its data centers to 23 from 67. Streamlining those operations has saved US$2 billion annually, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on an earnings call last month. However, the bank still relies on cloud services from external vendors since third parties can usually offer the service 23per cent-30per cent cheaper, he said. \"We don't need to own the hardware,\" he said. \"We just need to find out who can provide it the right way.\" Investing in cloud computing is key for banks as more transactions become digital. It is critical that the platform can transfer information quickly, keep data private, and prevent service outages. Bank of America customers reported trouble accessing online banking and card services late last month, according to Downdetector.com. Cloud services used by banks have come under scrutiny in Washington after a massive data breach at Capital One Financial Corp raised questions over the risks posed by banks' reliance on third-party cloud providers. U.S. lawmakers have asked regulators to consider direct oversight of the cloud services big tech companies provide to banks - like Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp's Microsoft Azure and Alphabet Inc's Google Cloud - saying they have become a critical component of the global financial system. IBM was not one of the cloud providers mentioned in the letter.

If we want the public to trust us and not be seen as 'big tobacco' we must be transparent.</p><p>\"What goes into the algorithm must be made clear and we have to ensure that there's no bias in the recommendations,\" he said. With the technology sector by and large failing the test on ethical collection and use of personal user data, Mr La Rose said companies would need to do better with AI.</p><p>\"It's up to governments to regulate but we don't think that's necessarily helpful. Engaging in open dialogue with a set of principles could be more useful in this space. Regulation can't deliver the solution to every problem.</p><p>\"Ethics is a new area for us but it needs to be addressed now and the conversation needs to take into account factors like available technical skills. Australia is certainly well behind on that front from where we should be,\" he added.</p><p>With no dedicated AI strategy in place in Australia, the latest research from professional services firm Deloitte shows the country is behind China, Germany and the US on effectively leveraging AI technologies. The skills gap is a major concern in Australia, with 72 per cent of organisations citing it as a key deficiency.</p><p>The 2018-19 federal budget has allocated $29.9 million over four years to boost Australia's AI capabilities, including development of a technology road map to build standards and ethics. However, it's a fraction of the billions of dollars being invested in China, US and France.</p><p>Mr La Rose said that building the right frameworks would require more than just money.</p><p>\"This is not a technology talent, it's a human challenge and it's up to us, the industry, to take the front foot,\" he said.</p><p>IBM's position is at odds with Amazon, which doesn't have concrete ethical guiding principles in place and instead lets its customers decide how they use its AI tools.</p><p>\"Organisations like Amazon are entitled to their point of view but we are interested in finding like-minded organisations to have the dialogue with,\" Mr La Rose said.</p><p>\"Some organisations are misinterpreting certain elements of AI and it's up to us to go and educate them. We need to change the way we approach the whole topic of ethics and that can't be done without consultation.</p><p>\"While some technology companies feel they are not ready for this confirmation, we are,\" he added.</p><p>A consultative process and guidelines would be important pillars in building the future framework for how AI technology affected the public, but ethics needed to be more than just another box to tick for organisations, Mr La Rose said.</p><p>\"Ethics needs to be embedded in everything, from research and development to how we engage with our customers and educate the public on the use of the technology.</p><p>\"The outcomes need to be clear and we need to base our conversation on the ethical guidelines that are being put in place,\" he said.\"This is not a future problem. It's something we need to do now.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-a6723faa79f211e9b1cc7ca7013876526d52ff18d34377c24d9e50919e9ae115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W4X-MGR1-JD3N-52TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"681\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 20, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0003EMK</classCode><className>IBM AUSTRALIA LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00080KU</classCode><className>AI SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But tech companies worry that opponents will react to these developments by kiboshing thetechnology completely.The big picture: IBM's proposal joins calls for federal facial recognition regulations from Microsoft[2], Amazon[3] and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce[4]. Big Tech is threatened by a yearlong groundswell of bans and proposed restrictions on facial recognition bubbling up in cities like San Francisco[5] and states like Massachusetts[6].The companies say these moves would cut off beneficial uses of the technology, like speeding up airport security or finding missing children.Yes, but: They stand to gain from keeping the market open. What's happening: In a white paper shared first with Axios[7], IBM is calling for what it calls \"precision regulation.\" </p><p>That means limiting potentially harmful uses rather than forbidding use of the technology entirely. IBM proposes treating various kinds of facial recognition differently. Face detection software, which simply counts the number of faces in the scene, is less prone to abuse than face matching, which can pick specific people out of a crowd.\"There will always be use cases that will be off-limits,\" IBM chief privacy officer Christina Montgomery tells Axios. \"That includes mass surveillance and racial profiling.\" At issue is public trust in facial recognition. Companies hope that curtailing some uses will rescue the technology from sliding into pariah status. According to a Morning Consult/Politico poll this summer, two-fifths of Americans support the technology[8], down from nearly half of Americans a year before.\"Absent the trust, you're going to see calls for bans,\" Montgomery says. Details: IBM calls for three policies it says are ready to be implemented immediately. Requiring notice and consent for people subject to facial recognition authentication, such as in a workplace or on a social media platform.Implementing export controls that prevent the sale of facial matching technology \u2014 the kind police could use to pick wanted criminals out of a crowd.Mandating that law enforcement disclose facial recognition technology and publish regular transparency reports. For big companies, overseas businessinterests can complicate matters. In its white paper, IBM says companies \"must be accountable for ensuring they don't facilitate human rights abuses by deploying technologies such as facial matching in regimes known for human rights violations.\"Earlier this year, BuzzFeed News reported that IBM was among several companies marketing facial recognition[9] in the notoriously repressive[10] United Arab Emirates.IBM says the technology referenced in the BuzzFeed story cannot identify individuals based on their faces. That is, it's not facial matching software. What they're saying: \"We're responsible stewards of technology,\" Montgomery tells Axios. \"We vet client engagements at the highest levels of the company.\"'If adopted, IBM's proposal would clear the way for the deployment of this authoritarian technology in our communities, a move opposed by the public, AI experts and democratically elected legislatures across the United States,\" says Matt Cagle of the ACLU of Northern California.

And lawmakers are on the move to retrieve the money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Drug lords, kidnappings and now trade tariffs is this what we get for the $10 billion in aid the U.S. gives to Mexico? We've got a hot debate straight ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And does IBM have sunny days ahead? If you're just waking up here comes the sun -- IBM wanting to buy Sun Microsystems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We've got the latest. We're serving all that and so much more for you right here on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>Well, good morning everybody. Welcome to a special edition of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. The AIG America's out outraged. I am Liz Claman. Alexis Glick is off today.</p><p>We're going to have much more on all this anger, this drama stemming from the AIG bonuses, and so much of it, we know it's coming from you.</p><p>And we actually really do want to hear from you. Are you outraged? But specifically, why? Don't just say, \"Yes, I'm furious.\" We want to know why you're outrage and you can actually email us right here at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email> and we'll actually share those with you later in the show. We'll read what some of you have to say.</p><p>But first let's get you caught up on the futures here and this after a day where we had a triple digit gain for the DOW Jones Industrial. Futures are lower today at the moment DOW Jones Industrial futures down 44 but we tend to look more at the S&amp;P futures, they give you a better sense of what might happen with the market, they're down nearly five points; the NASDAQ down four.</p><p>Let's send it right now to Connell McShane at the Fox Business desk with the very latest. He's got earnings out from General Mills -- Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: They look a little light, Liz, $3.79 a share X-items has been the number that's been reported by General Mills but the Street's looking for $0.88, so light on that front. Interesting to point out that the company says it's raising its guidance for the full year but when you look at it the guidance is still light, of where the Street estimate is. You see where the stock close yesterday $3.38 to $3.87 for the full year, $3.94 is the estimate. So the top end of the guidance at $3.87 is still light of the estimate.</p><p>General Mills among other things talking about currency translations hurting their earnings a little bit, reducing sales growth by three percentage points. The currency translation so GIS, General Mills certainly will a stock to watch today here, Liz. This one is down about 11 percent with the markets so far this year.</p><p>But the earnings look light, we'll have more on it later on the morning, right now back over to you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, we'll be talking much more about General Mills because clearly you cannot ignore Count Chocolate and Boo Berry. Very important.</p><p>MCSHANE: I know it.</p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you Connell.</p><p>As I mentioned we're taking a closer look at this hour at the outrage over AIG. So let's start with the latest news, first off, Chairman and CEO of American International Group Ed Liddy pulling up a chair at a Congressional witness table today. This one is going to be so closely watched he will take massive heat. I promise you every lawmaker is going to want to make his or her voice heard very loudly, this over the more than $200 million in bonuses.</p><p>Meanwhile, Congress and the White House trying to find ways to strip bonus recipients of the money they got. Some of these people are not even with the company anymore and they we're getting millions and million of dollars worth.</p><p>The chairman of ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee proposed companies and individuals pay a 35 percent tax on all retention awards and bonuses over $50,000.</p><p>And in a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner suggesting holding back the bonus amount from upcoming bailout funds for AIG.</p><p>There are all kinds of ideas being thrown out here on how to get the money back but do you have ideas, I mean, how angry are you over this bonus debacle? If you are steamed, you're not alone we're not just talking about lawmakers.</p><p>Fox Business's senior Washington correspondent, Peter Barnes is in our Washington Bureau with the results -- Peter a new Pew Research Center Poll, boy they gets these things out pretty quickly, what do we see?</p><p>PETER BARNES, FBN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well that's right, Liz, the AIG bonus controversy a possible big political headache for President Obama if the financial bailout doesn't work and if he has to go back to Congress later for more money to help banks.</p><p>The White House continuing to express outrage about the bonuses, distancing itself from the controversy and trying to get out in front of the story that was inevitably going to dominate the headlines anyway.</p><p>But the President remains fully vested in a bank rescue plan, he voted for it as a Senator. And as President he says it is critical to reviving bank lending and the economy.</p><p>On Monday, the Pew Research Center released the poll that found that 87 percent of people are outright angry about or at least bothered by bank bailouts.</p><p>In the poll, despite their anger, people still supported bank rescues as a policy 48 percent to 40 percent. But the poll was taken last week before revelations of the AIG bonuses.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL DIMOCK, PEW RESEARCH CENTER: I think if anything this has intensified the emotional feeling that people have. Again, they've been giving a clear example of the downside of this policy the problems with the way that this money is being spent. I think that intensifies the anger now. Whether it's going to undermine the support for the policy, it's something that we're going to need to see how it plays out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES: Now, the President has to be somewhat careful on how he plays the AIG bonus controversy, Dimock says. His job approval rating is starting to slip. The PEW poll shows it down five points from February to March, Dimock says mainly over public concern about his stimulus plan, his budget and how they will increase the deficit as well as some concern over his foreign policy.</p><p>But the President did include a $750 billion placeholder in his budget for more funding for bank bailouts if he needs it. Being outraged about how AIG now may leave the President in a delicate political position, later with Congress and voters trying to turn a negative consequence of the bailout, taxpayer money going to big bonuses into a positive, cleaning up the system by continuing those very bailouts.</p><p>Liz, back to you.</p><p>CLAMAN: There is no way Peter, anybody is going rubber-stamp more spending with these AIG bonuses unless this gets resolved. Unbelievable. Thanks for the PEW Research Center.</p><p>BARNES: No way, you're right.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, here take my money.</p><p>BARNES: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: The AIG bonus was the talk of the halls on Capitol Hill yesterday. Massachusetts Congressman and Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee Barney Frank was confounded by Ed Liddy of AIG's reasoning for payment of the bonuses. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BARNEY FRANK, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE: Mr. Liddy gave two arguments. One, was my hands are tied legally but the other was a policy argument. He doesn't want to rescind them because he wants to retain those people. I am very skeptical that retaining the people who made the mistakes is a good idea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAMAN: For more on today's hearings and this outrage that we know so many of you are feeling, I am joined now by Democratic Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut and Republican Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. Both served on the House Financial Services Committee.</p><p>Well, did you bring your boxing gloves? Both of you, I can only imagine...</p><p>REP. JIM HIMES (D), CONNECTICUT: Good morning Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: Ed Liddy sitting in front of you. I will start with the Representative Himes. Give me a sense of what you want and need to hear from Ed Liddy today.</p><p>HIMES: Well, you know, as you pointed out in your story the outrage is out there is unbelievable. And you know, Congress represents the people and so I think you are going to see some outrage today.</p><p>But you know I had the opportunity to sit with Mr. Liddy in my office yesterday. And what I told him was, it's not just important that the right thing happens but that the right thing be seen to happen.</p><p>So I said, you know look, my experience is that 10 very smart lawyers in the room can make just about anything happen so please get 10 lawyers in the room and figure out how to fix this.</p><p>And if you can't do that, get these 73 people that are receiving these bonuses together in a conference room and say folks, this is the time to stand up and do the right thing for your country.</p><p>Give back the money. Because if those two things don't happen, action will be taken either in the halls of Congress or by the State of Connecticut where this particular unit is resident. And it's really important that they step up and do the right thing not just so that the many people who have lost their jobs out there see that everybody is in this together but because as you point out, we are not through stabilizing the financial sector yet.</p><p>We've got work yet to do and every time something like this happens our hands get tied.</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Moore Capito, Ed Liddy has an op-ed piece in the \"Washington Post\" today and in it one of the lines that caught my eye was where he said, \"In America when we owe people money we pay them, ok.\" So I think that's not nod to the hall if there is a contract you can't break it in America we get that.</p><p>We understand that but Representative Himes, just said, get a couple of lawyers into the room. We can figure something out here.</p><p>Congress has suggested taxing these bonuses up to 95 percent and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner says that he's working on this as well but what is your solution? What do you and your brethren in Congress feel about this?</p><p>SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO (R), WEST VIRGINIA: Well, I think we recognize with all of the different programs and policies that are coming forward, that just this morning as I was coming in the guard said to me something isn't right. And we need to make this situation to a point where people understand what's going on but still reflecting the outrage and the astonishment of the lack of transparency and the lack of accountability.</p><p>My question to Mr. Liddy will be you knew these were part of the contract, you knew in good faith and bargaining good faith with the United States government why were these questions not answered?</p><p>Where is the transparency and accountability of the tax dollars? Why did AIG not come forward and if they did, why did the Treasury accept this as part of the agreement to further fund and to further bailout this company?</p><p>CLAMAN: I am glad you brought up the Treasury Secretary. Representative Himes, we talked about what Treasury Secretary Geithner wants to do and he says, \"We will impose on AIG in essence a contractual commitment to pay the Treasury from the operations of the company the amount of retention awards just paid. In addition we will deduct the $30 billion -- deduct from there in assistance an amount basically equal to the amount of those payments.\" What does that really mean? And is that the solution?</p><p>HIMES: Well, what that really means is that our taxpayer dollars are not going to pay bonuses for people who are not just involved but remember these are folks that were in the unit of AIG that created the credit defaults swap exposure that brought the company down.</p><p>And so I think as a matter of principle the notion that our hard earned taxpayer dollars aren't going to provide bonuses to those people is a pretty good notion. Now, the Treasury affect debt maybe Congressional legislation could affect that but frankly, as I said before I'd like to see AIG stand up and do the right thing here, either by getting those people together to agree to give back the money or to figure out a way to get around those contracts.</p><p>And this notion that you can't get around the contract look, all over this country, firefighters, policeman, teachers are being asked to reopen their contracts to give back wages and benefits. So I don't think it's crazy to say that we ought to take a look at that here.</p><p>CLAMAN: It's not. Representative Moore Capito, but the argument out there also floating around on Wall Street, well, you take away their bonuses and you're not going to find anybody to these jobs. Do you buy that?</p><p>MOORE CAPITO: Well, I inherently disagree with that, I mean, I think that you are looking at large financial institutions that were brought to their knees by basically a lot of greed and over extension of risk.</p><p>And to think that the American spirit and as the young good minds in this country, would not want to bring these companies back without, you know, extravagant bonuses, without holding the taxpayer out for more and more dollars. I think that's a ridiculous concept. I don't buy that.</p><p>And I think that the fact that I agree with Jim when he says there are people all over this country that are taking pay cuts, that are working for less times, that are losing their jobs, that are making adjustments in their families and why these employees at AIG and others can not tighten their belts and make adjustments too or break a contract is just doesn't pass the snip test.</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Himes, you're out there in Connecticut where most of your constituents and many of them and certainly are hedge fund people or financial people but you're also looking at constituents who are looking specifically at Congress and saying, so many members, many of actually the sub-Committee members have taken money from AIG in the form of donations.</p><p>How do you answer to that?</p><p>HIMES: Well, you know the overall campaign finance system is a broken system and I think you'd find general agreement on that in Congress.</p><p>But look, you raised another very broader and an important point which is that as the stones get thrown today and rightly so, Congress is not blame free here. The product -- the credit defaults swaps that are at the heart of AIG's mess were explicitly unregulated by an act of Congress a number of years ago.</p><p>So while this will be a day of popular expression of anger at AIG we need to not forget that to some degree Congress was complicit in the mess that grew up at AIG. And we need to look forward and say, look, we need a smart set of regulations, not necessarily more regulations, but smart regulations that are going to prevent this from happening ever again. That's our job. And we've got to step up to do it.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, the party starts at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. I mean, this is going to be interesting. Fox Business will be carrying these grilling of Ed Liddy. Congress Member Jim Himes and Shelley Moore Capito, thank you both for joining us.</p><p>MOORE CAPITO: Thank you.</p><p>HIMES: Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Anytime. We really appreciate your perspective</p><p>And out there, you guys, we want to hear what you think about what is going on with AIG and certainly how this event in Congress is going to developer. Send us an e-mail at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>Get up out of bed. Fire up the computer; share some of your thoughts with us. We're actually going to be reading some of them coming up.</p><p>We do have a lot of market news here. General Mills reporting earnings this morning and giving full year forecast. You may be eating some of their food for breakfast. What's the breakdown in store for the cereal maker?</p><p>But first, let the sun shine in. That's what IBM is saying as a massive computer deal may be in the offing -- the biggest deal possibly that IBM has ever made?</p><p>Good morning to you. That's a big news story coming up. We are back in two minutes.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE: Connell McShane back on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST with some breaking news out of the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning with an interesting report that IBM might be in the market to buy Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash to do so which would be, give or take, a 100 percent premium over the close for Sun yesterday.</p><p>Now let's take a look at the stock prices involved. You would expect that Sun Microsystems would be higher and it is. There is IBM down about two or three percent in the pre-market; as you see, the bid's 90.25 and the stock had closed just under 93 yesterday. Sun, ticker simple JAVA, these days is up to $8.10. So that's a 60 percent move, give or take, on the stock so being bid up on the \"Wall Street Journal\" report again that these two are in talks, Liz, about a possible deal. That'll be very, very interesting.</p><p>CLAMAN: Maybe making that deal. Wouldn't that be interesting to see?</p><p>MCSHANE: That would be up.</p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you very much, Connell. For more on this possible deal between IBM and Sun Microsystems I'm joined by Emerald Asset Management's Joe Besecker, and president of Penn Financial Group, Matt McCall.</p><p>Joe, you wake up and you find out...</p><p>JOE BESECKER, EMERALD ASSET MANAGEMENT: A jab, a jolt.</p><p>CLAMAN: The jab, a jolt. Seriously? IBM the sleepy -- not sleepy but the more serious sort of button-down company going for the mavericky so to speak?</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>BESECKER: I just like the fact that business is being done out there. We're back to doing business.</p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you.</p><p>BESECKER: We're not talking about -- listen, that's the thing. IBM is taking advantage of opportunities that exist out there. You know, Mark Twain once said he was rarely able to spot an opportunity until it ceased to be one. And so, maybe now the companies will start to pay -- get out from under their desks, start to look for business and do business. And that's what I'm excited about.</p><p>Whether or not this is the best deal for IBM or maybe the market's (ph) thing and maybe they could have gotten it a little bit cheaper?</p><p>CLAMAN: Exactly that. I'm wondering, are they overpaying in this market? Aren't you supposed to beat somebody down to their last dollar?</p><p>MATT MCCALL, PRESIDENT, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP: You are but you figure, Sun already fell 71 percent in the last year. So maybe it has been beaten down already paying at $10 a share, whatever it may be $6.5 billion. I don't think that is that bad. I actually think they are getting a pretty good deal.</p><p>And what I love about this is the synergy that it creates between the two companies. But I think we're going to see a lot more mergers going on in the coming months that creates synergies and using...</p><p>BESECKER: I hope so.</p><p>MCCALL: ...and using its beaten down prices and as Joe said this is a good sign, I think, for the market.</p><p>CLAMAN: Both make corporate systems. And I think that that's something that these corporations who don't depend specifically on Microsoft Windows, for example, are very interested in seeing who gets nervous over this. Is it Hewlett-Packard, the big competitor?</p><p>BESECKER: Go back to what I'm saying. Now it puts us in a position where people start to think strategically about business again. How do we deploy money? How do we go out and do things?</p><p>So yes, I think Hewlett-Packard has to be concerned about this. I think in general, IBM does a lot of service business. I think this will add to the service. And they penetrate different areas they may not have had.</p><p>It appears to get customers and get customers cheaply and that's what they're doing because that customer base is an annuity that brings all that money in. Oracle reports today or tomorrow, that is the only thing that's going to go well for them. And so you want to have growth as well and I think they'll get a growth opportunity...</p><p>CLAMAN: Sources, by the way, say this, of course, could still fall apart. So we caution people to make sure they understand that but what about regulatory hurdles, Matt? These are two gigantic companies that could eliminate some of the little guys out there.</p><p>MCCALL: And it probably will. The thing is though, Sun has lost a lot of market share over the last couple of years. So I think they'll be able to get through the hurdles.</p><p>And I think HP gets hurt the most because when you think about it HP actually had a chance to buy Sun. In the last year they went to them and they turned them down and now IBM is jumping on that after the price fell a bit more. So I think IBM is being pro-active here looking forward or HP's kind of sitting back waiting for the business to come to them.</p><p>CLAMAN: What is the best possible sense that you make specifically I think for other suitors? Anybody -- you know Matt has talked about Hewlett-Packard. They're not going to come back maybe and start fighting, would they?</p><p>BESECKER: Why wouldn't they? I mean if they really thought -- depending on price. I think that is why the price is what it is. We don't know the price because it has not been announced. We just hear rumors. But if the price is there, I think that's one of the reasons that they came out with a good best offer.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm with Joe Besecker right now because I'd look at this and I say we have some deals going.</p><p>BESECKER: Exactly.</p><p>CLAMAN: So what is the next digital deal that might be done?</p><p>MCCALL: You know, I'm actually going to go away from digital because I don't know if it is going to be as much in technology. I think the more deals are going to be in biotech. I think we're going to have a huge boom in the second half where large pharma with no pipelines are going to start picking up a lot biotech companies. And I think that's going to be one of the biggest sectors and one of the biggest drivers of this market in the second half of the year.</p><p>CLAMAN: How does the average investor get in on something like that in advance?</p><p>BESECKER: Carefully. Because we still have a lot of land mines out there. You look at the companies -- I actually think the play is, and we were talking a little bit earlier, some of these companies that have platforms that they can add things to might be the better place than trying to guess which ones are the ones that are acquired because if you're not acquired and you run out of cash, it is kind of an all or nothing and minor event.</p><p>So that's in the (INAUDIBLE) I agree with you 100 percent, that's why we buy a basket. If you have muss (ph), you can buy a basket or you can buy one of the -- you have to do a lot of homework and that's why...</p><p>MCCALL: And you never buy a company just on the anticipation of being taken over. You never do that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Right. Never. Never do that.</p><p>Well, let the sun shine in. We have ourselves a deal here.</p><p>BESECKER: We have business. That's right. We have business.</p><p>CLAMAN: We have business going Joe and Matt. Thank you very much.</p><p>Coming up, let's take a check of today's news headlines. The latest -- did you hear about this? This tragic ski trip taken by one of Broadway's leading actresses, we will be talking about that in a moment.</p><p>And the company behind Cheerios, Betty Crocker and Haagen-Dazs -- General Mills planning to take one dinner table favorite out of the food roster? You get to guess -- I guarantee you, unless you grew up on one of those organic farms which, I went Berkeley and all about that. You ate this product, they're taking it out of the mix.</p><p>Get ready to cry. We'll get a closer look when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GREY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Gavin Grey, standing in for Ashley Webster in London and a quick look at the markets straight off.</p><p>Let's start off in Germany with the Dax, that's been leading the way this morning, I'm pleased to say. And it's still doing very well; up almost 60 points at 4,045 that's up almost 1.5 percent. Moving across to Paris, the CAC, that's also doing pretty well; up 0.9 of a percent at 2,792. And lastly the FTSE; that spent most of this morning in negative territory but it's just crept positive, up almost seven points at 3,863.</p><p>All of those figures despite some pretty bad news on the unemployment front that's come out just within the last hour or two. And that is that unemployment in the U.K. has now topped 2 million; that is about 6.5 percent of the working population. Figures due to get much worse however and indeed it is the rate of the rise that is worrying most people.</p><p>Two million is the worst it's been since 1997. But the rate of the rise has been the fastest increase for a couple of decades, so a bit worrying there for the government and plenty of dire predictions following on from that.</p><p>The Royal Bank of Scotland, next. That's the bank that's been almost bought out by the government; two-thirds now owned by the U.K. taxpayer. But optimistic comments from the chairman who says that the banks benefited from buoyant corporate banking activity and has noted increased business as a resulting corporate debt issuance and equity underwriting -- so a positive note there.</p><p>Homeowners though, well those with mortgages -- that is not such clever news because indeed it has been estimated now that in the last year, the number of people who have fallen into arrears with their mortgage has risen a third and that is obviously worrying and that, of course, despite those on track of mortgages noticing a sharp decline in the monthly repayment. So very worrying for them, too.</p><p>A quick look at the dollar and the currencies, it is down against the euro, 1.30 to the dollar. And the pound there, it is up against the pound and 1 pound is now going to cost around $1.39.</p><p>Back to you Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Thank you very much. Good morning once again everyone.</p><p>We are taking a look at some of the top news stories of the day.</p><p>China rejecting Coca-Cola's bid to buy a major Chinese juice maker breaking up what would have been the largest ever foreign take over of a Chinese company. China's commerce ministry rejecting the $2.5 billion bid for the Huiyuan Juice Group saying Coke's buy out would potentially squeeze out smaller players.</p><p>This development comes as China recently enacted stronger anti-monopoly law so big question about whether this is an isolated event or something that other businesses should be concerned about.</p><p>Actress, Natasha Richardson is hospitalized, in critical condition after a skiing accident in Montreal. Richardson was flown back to New York City for medical treatment after suffering a serious head injury during a beginner's ski lesson. Members of Richardson's family have gathered near her bedside now. And Richardson, by the way, is the wife of actor Liam Neeson. She's an accomplished actress, though; she won a Tony award for her 1998 performance in Cabaret.</p><p>Back to business news now, Dunkin Donuts is going back to its roots. Years after the company ran ads featuring Fred the baker saying it is time to make the donuts, the company's advertising its doughnuts again. It will launch a new $10 million campaign. In the recent years the company has focused more on coffee and breakfast sandwiches in its advertising and the coolest part of this campaign though is a Design Your Own Donut contest. Yes, you got it, customers can design their own donuts on the company's Web site. A winner will be chosen in June and be sold in the company's 8,000 stores. So start designing, get to it.</p><p>You're up to date here on the Fox Business Network.

We'll be right back with more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FBN ANCHOR: Thirty minutes after the hour. So glad you're with us on this special edition of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST, \"AIG, America's Outrage.\" I'm Liz Claman. Alexis Glick is off today.</p><p>We're going to have more on the growing anger over the failed insurer's decision to give out bonuses, millions and millions of dollars in bonuses to some people who actually don't even work there anymore.</p><p>And if you've seen the markets lately, up six of the last seven days. Not bad at all. Let's take a look at how they're shaping up with the futures. A little bit of weakness here at the moment. We actually had some decent numbers out of Asia overnight. The Hang Seng did pretty well, up more than 1 percent.</p><p>But for -- our futures here, we're down for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. NASDAQ just popped in to positive territory to the upside and S&amp;P futures have come up off of their lows in the last half hour. They were down about 4 points, but right now down 2.20.</p><p>The company behind breakfast staples like Wheaties and Cheerios, you know, you've eaten it all. You know you ate Count Chocula growing up, admit it. General Mills, out with 3rd quarter earnings this morning, coming in at $0.79 excluding items, missing analysts' expectations of $0.88 per share.</p><p>As consumers cut costs, food makers are cutting unprofitable businesses. So to that end, I'm stunned. Did you -- Jenna, Jenna cannot believe it. General Mills says it will no longer make, excuse me for a moment, Pillsbury frozen dinner rolls. They're gone, folks.</p><p>I -- Charles Payne is speechless.</p><p>For more on this I'm enjoined by Jennifer Niemela of the St. Paul Business Journal and Erin Smith, an analyst with the Argus Research Company. We're all stunned and shocked today.</p><p>Good evening, (INAUDIBLE) our way, but first Pillsbury dough rolls are no longer going to be available.</p><p>Erin, let's start with the numbers here. They missed but they also guided higher for the year. They're upping their guidance. I find that interesting. What do you pick out of this report?</p><p>ERIN SMITH, ARGUS RESEARCH COMPANY ANALYST: Well, they actually mentioned that cost inflation is supposed to improve in the next -- not bit high at next quarter, and I think that's a big benefit. And our estimates for the 3rd quarter is actually below consensus so they actually came in just a little bit below our estimates. We expected the 4th quarter would be a little bit stronger.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jennifer, last week General Mills announced it will no longer make, as I said, these Pillsbury frozen dinner rolls and they've actually decided to sell the frozen dough portion of its bakeries and food service. So they're shedding this part of it. Why? Why has the company decided to drop this part of their business?</p><p>JENNIFER NIEMELA, ST. PAUL BUSINESS JOURNAL REPORTER: Well, when I talked to General Mills they mentioned that they're really trying to focus on some of their strengths and like a lot of food companies, they are trying to trim out some of the less profitable parts of their business.</p><p>So those are the reasons that they gave me. And yes, they sold it to a company called Pennant Foods. They sold four of their factories, shed about 60 positions. So they are focusing on cutting their costs right now.</p><p>CLAMAN: Erin, what impact, do you think, the sale will have on General Mills' future? I thought it was so iconic. I can't let go of this. I...</p><p>SMITH: Well, I do like their Pillsbury rolls.</p><p>CLAMAN: It's dinner -- exactly.</p><p>SMITH: But at the same time, Pillsbury division has been -- hasn't been performing as well as some of their other divisions. Cereals been very strong, yogurt and soup. So I can understand. I think long term this is a good strategy to try to revitalize that -- the Pillsbury brand over the past year. And it's probably -- I assumed that it hasn't been doing as well.</p><p>CLAMAN: But Jennifer, we've got to get to the stronger dollar aspect of this because clearly a strong dollar hurts a global company that has an international footprint. Right now we're looking at a dollar that seems to be doing well. General Mills operates in about 100 different companies. Does this hurt them going forward? They must not think it's going to really pressure them because they're upping the guidance for the full year.</p><p>NIEMELA: Right. Well, they have been focusing a lot on cutting their costs. And here in the twin cities, they have decreased their work force by about 2 percent so I think going forward they're pretty optimistic.</p><p>The CEO also mentioned that while commodity prices have been up, he does expect those to go down once the recession ends. So I think that they're optimistic going forward and that makes sense.</p><p>CLAMAN: Erin, everybody says go for consumer staple companies and healthcare because those are the two things people won't cut back on. These earnings indicate that even if people continue to buy these products, costs are higher. We don't know where commodities are going. It's obviously a real challenge to operate a company like this.</p><p>Is it all about the management and how smart they are as far as organic growth is concerned? And specifically, cuts in the way they operate?</p><p>SMITH: I think that's very important and I also think if you look at the company's brand and if they have leading brands, what kind of types of products? General Mills have a very strong portfolio of affordable brands for consumers. General mixes, soup and cereals. So you have to look at what they're offering.</p><p>CLAMAN: And Jennifer, we spoke about how General Mills is cutting costs by selling some of those less profitable brands. How many have cut costs, say for example, by laying employees off and what does General Mills employment situation look like?</p><p>NIEMELA: Well, here in the twin cities we have seen -- actually some of our larger companies including Cargill, another big food company here, have actually increased their work force over the past year. But General Mills has decreased their -- over 2008 they decreased by about 1.8 percent. Their employment here. So they are focusing on cutting their costs.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jennifer and Erin...</p><p>NIEMELA: In that way as well.</p><p>CLAMAN: We're going to wrap it there. Once again General Mills, missing estimates but upping their guidance for the full year numbers.</p><p>We thank you very much for coming in. We've actually got some breaking news.</p><p>Connell, what do you have for us?</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Liz, we talked about the Coke story. You may have heard us talk about the fact that this deal had been rejected by the Chinese government for Coke to buy a juice company in China for $2.5 billion.</p><p>Well, the company itself has actually come out with some comments here in the last few minutes crossing on the wire from Coca-Cola. They're saying they're not going to pursue this. This Huiyuan deal, that's the name of the company, in China, the juice company. They're not going to pursue it after the government had rejected it.</p><p>So they're not going to press this anymore. They said they were disappointed about the rejection that came out of the Chinese government, but they rejected -- they, I should say, they respect the decision and they're going to focus on growing existing brands in China with a long-term view of the Chinese market.</p><p>So, again, Coca-Cola after being rejected by the Chinese government for an attempt to $2.5 billion acquisition of a major juice company in China now says that's it. we respect your decision, we're not going to pursue it any further.</p><p>Interesting story. We'll continue to follow it and all the political ramifications, all the rest of it throughout the day. But right now it is time for \"Charles' Choice.\" It's down to Charles Payne in the studio.</p><p>What do you have, Charles?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks, Connell. Well, you know, first, no more dinner rolls and now Coke being knocked down in China, bad news. But I'm going to stick with this China thing, Connell, because two of the three stocks I'm watching are actually based in China.</p><p>The first is Focus Media. That was the tease that Jenna Lee gave you. I've got to tell you, folks, someone just opened some biscuits in the background. The stock has won some pretty good support right around the $5 area so I like it on the downside.</p><p>Listen, Wall Street expects this company to earn $1.48 in the fiscal '09 and it's trading at $5.90. If it traded at ten times book, I mean the stock would be somewhere right around here so this is really one of these stocks that has a lot of room to the upside. A little on the downside. Nevertheless, I consider it a high-risk play, although yesterday my high-risk play is still soft, which is up 25 percent. A 15 percent after the open.</p><p>OK. A little risky in my opinion is NetEase. It's another Chinese plate. It's a Web portal, offers online communities and e-commerce services, a lot of games. One of the things we're starting to see here with this stock is look at that trend. Upbrilled (ph), nice here, looks really, really great. On the cusp of a major, major break out. I've mentioned this stock several times in the past. I think you want to have exposure to China. This is one of my top three plays in China along with Baidu and Sohu.</p><p>And finally, Simon Property Group. This is my contrarian play of the day, if you will. We were short to stock at Wall Street strategies, WStreet.com, for a long time. And indeed it came down but it was really tough. It didn't come down and it showed a lot of resolve if you will.</p><p>The stock is on a verge of a major breakout here. I like this -- use 29 and 1/2 if you do this stock as an idea -- as a stop-loss. And I have an exclusive pick. Go to FOXBusiness.com/MoneyforBreakfast. It's a controversial company.</p><p>Coming up, folks, we're going to see which of your favorite brands have the strength to carry their companies through the downturn. And a border war is brewing. It can cost you and our economy billions of dollars. Details just ahead when we come back with more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: This morning the Obama administration is preparing to send more federal agents to the Mexican border in a move to stop the flow of drugs and rash of kidnappings that is plaguing the Mexican border. This comes as the Obama administration not only copes with the drug war, but now possibly a trade war as well.</p><p>Folks, trade wars only exacerbated the Great Depression but is this all mean? And Mexico says, well, if you do that, we're going to impose tariffs on U.S. imports and produce and products, such as, and we're just getting this information because before we weren't sure what the products where, sunglasses, toilet paper, pet food and soy sauce.</p><p>I think Christmas trees were thrown in there as well.</p><p>This move is on the heels of Washington banning Mexican trucks from pretty much free access of the U.S. roads which Mexico says violate NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p><p>Drugs, tariffs, kidnappings, and that's all after we, the United States, gave Mexico $10 billion in aid.</p><p>Boy, what do we make of all of this? For more now I'm joined by Todd Spencer. He's the executive vice president of the Owner, Operator Independent Drivers Association. And Jim Roberts, a research fellow with the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>Welcome to you both.</p><p>Jim, what exactly did the U.S. remove, take away? And how is Mexico retaliating?</p><p>JIM ROBERTS, HERITAGE FOUNDATION RESEARCH FELLOW: Well, you know, this is one trade dispute where, to pardon the express, the rubber is really meeting the road. To judge the Obama administration by their rhetoric, you would think that they understand that the only way to increase prosperity for Americans and grow our economy is to expand trade opportunities, not contract them.</p><p>They understand that protectionism in the 1930s made the depression worst. And yet we have to judge them by their actions. And so far their actions have been to cave in to protectionists on the left, big labor, first in the stimulus package with the Buy America provisions, now in this omnibus bill, they've killed a pilot program with Mexico by defunding it, that had -- had allowed the Mexican government to put off filing this action that they have a legal right to do under NAFTA...</p><p>CLAMAN: OK.</p><p>ROBERTS: ... to put tariffs on some of our products.</p><p>CLAMAN: Somebody who feels completely different about this is Tom Spencer.</p><p>Todd, how does the elimination of this program, which, in essence if I understand it correctly, allowed Mexican 18-wheelers unfettered access back and forth across the border to the U.S. delivering all kinds of goods? How does this benefit you, the U.S. trucker and more valuable than the challenges and the costs of the tariffs?</p><p>TODD SPENCER, OWNER OPERATOR INDEPENDENT DRIVERS ASSOC.: Liz, it's amazing their comments, the rhetoric coming from the other side on this issue. The arbitration panel that looked at this issue, several years ago said the U.S. was totally within its rights to establish safety systems and insists on safety systems that would assure safety on our highways.</p><p>Those systems have not been in place, they have not -- they are simply not functional. This feigned outrage about protectionism is simply rhetoric. This is not a new issue. Congress, both sides of Congress have been outraged, concerned about the prospect of an unequal playing field in terms of safety and security all the way back to 2001.</p><p>They've insisted our system was being put in place. They haven't been put in place. And it would be foolhardy, idiotic for us to open our highways any other way.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jim, why do I -- Jim, why do I want Mexican truck drivers if they're not insured, if it hasn't had the proper safeguards attached to this program? Why do I want them on the road here in America? We've got enough problems of our own.</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, you wouldn't want drivers like that on our roads but those aren't the drivers that have been participating in this program. In fact, they have had a better safety records than our own companies. These drivers are well trained and you want them because American consumers are paying $400 more per year in products imported from Mexico because of this additional uploading and reloading and warehouses within the 25-mile limit of the border.</p><p>That's just adding costs to American consumers just to featherbed some jobs for the teamsters and improve teamster dues, but it's hurting the American consumer and it's hurting our relations with Mexico and our economy.</p><p>CLAMAN: Todd, is it all about the teamsters flexing their muscle?</p><p>SPENCER: Not in the least. The overwhelming majority, 90 percent of truckers are small business entities, people that own 10 or fewer trucks. These are the people that are actually on the frontlines economically. They're on the frontlines for highway safety and they're the ones that actually are being disadvantaged by this unleveled playing field and actually risks at the border.</p><p>How many segments are we going to talk about how crazy, how lawless it is on that side? And we're going to say...</p><p>CLAMAN: But you understand, Todd -- you understand that any kind of tariffs that are imposed now which is what the Mexicans are doing for our goods, we get a little bit of a trade war going here, at a time when -- our economy is rough, hard you, sort of justify that with what the boobs (ph) are.</p><p>SPENCER: That makes no sense whatsoever. Mexico has benefited so much from trade with the U.S. I mean, they'd be cutting off their nose to spite their face...</p><p>CLAMAN: OK.</p><p>SPENCER: ... to do something idiotic like that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jim, let me give you the last word here. Mexico gets $10 billion in aid from us. They're a mess. The State Department is encouraging people not to travel to Mexico right now because of the drug wars. And now this?</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, certainly parts of northern Mexico are dangerous but other parts of Mexico are if you take precautions but I would say this trucking program would have improved and will improve border security because there are fewer opportunities for drugs and cash to move south and empty trucks if the trucks are loaded. And so it seems to me that this makes more sense and always economically and with national security.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, the discussion and conversation will continue.</p><p>Todd and Jim, thank you for being a part of it right here on FOX. Thank you so much.</p><p>SPENCER: Thank you, Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: Now let's get over to Charles Payne. Charles, what do you have?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, Liz, Starbucks holds its annual shareholders meeting today in Seattle and it's one of the many brands battling this downward economy. And it's clearly been hurt in an annual core brand power ranking. So last year Starbucks ranked number 10 out of 20 and this year's survey, it slipped down to 214.</p><p>With a look at who's the king of the brand world, I'm joined by Jim Gregory, the CEO of CoreBrand, and Matt McCall, the president of the Penn Financial Group.</p><p>Jim, I want to start with you. I just mentioned Starbucks a minute ago. Obviously the economy has had an impact but has the company made a lot of mistakes as well?</p><p>JIM GREGORY, COREBRAND CEO: Certainly. You know, it's important to understand that the brand is -- might be doing well, but the underlying financial fundamentals are not more important than the brand.</p><p>PAYNE: I don't get what that means, though.</p><p>GREGORY: I'm sorry. I said that incorrectly, but the brand is very important but the underlying financial fundamentals are more important than the brands, so even though the brand is quite strong, it's not more important than the company getting out of whack, so to speak.</p><p>PAYNE: Let's start now with your top five. We're going to start with the number five on your brand rankings. Campbell Soup. What makes this so good?</p><p>GREGORY: It's a great brand. When you have a brand that stands for one thing, for nourishment for so many decades and mm-hmm good concept is so clear in everyone's mind, you know that it's a really highly focused food company. And they are really focused on three major areas, simple mills, baked snacks and healthy beverages.</p><p>And so that's a very complex company simplified.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, Matt, it's interesting because Peter Lindt (ph) said buy what you know. And obviously everybody knows Campbell Soup but there is somewhat of a disconnect between a great brand and a great investment.</p><p>What do you think about Campbell as an investment?</p><p>MATT MCCALL, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP PRESIDENT: I really don't like his investment. It's gotten crushed. It hit a five-year low just recently, and it's not really growth story. You won't be looking grow stocks now. And I think they've really gotten hurt by private label. People are shopping at Wal-Mart, getting their groceries there. They're going to go for the private label brand versus the Campbell brand...</p><p>PAYNE: Wal-Mart just said they're going to actually increase that strategy.</p><p>Jim, let's go to number four, Hershey Foods. Why is this a premiere brand? </p><p>GREGORY: Well, first of all, it's one of the original companies that we're involved in corporate social responsibility. The voting shares of the company are controlled by the Hershey trust and that's for the benefit of the Milton Hershey School for Disadvantaged Children. So they do well by doing good and it's a great company. Again, very consistent brand over time.</p><p>Also, it's important to realize that they are no longer the king of candy. Mars has taken that with the acquisition of Wrigley's.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>GREGORY: So they're not quite as strong as they were.</p><p>PAYNE: So...</p><p>GREGORY: But they do have a great brand.</p><p>PAYNE: So Jim, let's go to the other end of the political correctness - - spectrum, if you will. Harley-Davidson, number three. Why is this still such a powerful brand?</p><p>GREGORY: Well, this is one of my favorite brands and it's done so well over time. When you think about Harley-Davidson in 1990 when we started our corporate branding index, they were near bankruptcy. They have improved consistently over time and they are -- have reached the pinnacle of our brand ranking of 1,200 companies.</p><p>So one of the concerns I have about Harley-Davidson is they are -- might be expanding too much. They have over 35 different models and it's almost what I call the GM syndrome. They want to be all things to all people. That's not the way that -- to continue to expand their brand.</p><p>PAYNE: And of course, Jim, too, household names Johnson &amp; Johnson number 2, and number one, Coca-Cola. What do you think? How come this is still such a powerful brand?</p><p>GREGORY: Well, Coca-cola has been the number one soft drink in the world, of course, and in our corporate branding index has been number one since 1997. They -- even in down markets, they continue to invest in the brands. They've launched Coca-Cola Zero this year as well as their open happiness advertising campaign.</p><p>They understand how to grow their brand even in a down market and that's quite impressive.</p><p>PAYNE: Matt, three -- everyone knows HOG, though, hit a high, 75 November of 2006. It's come straight down. Would you even consider buying the stock here?</p><p>MCCALL: I would not. And that's something where -- that was the dream for the middle class. The middle class is struggling right now so the last thing they'll do is going to be throwing $25,000 at a discretionary item such as a HOG.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, Johnson &amp; Johnson at number two on the list. It's a consistent player. They're probably out there looking for acquisitions right now. It's a core stock in a lot of folks' portfolio. It's been hit. OK, what do you think about it?</p><p>MCCALL: I love it. I ought to call my clients right now and this is more than just a consumer Johnson &amp; Johnson you see at the grocery story. The medical device, there's the pharmaceuticals, great diverse company and has some cash as well.</p><p>PAYNE: At least we got one buy out of you. Thanks a lot, Matt.</p><p>Jim, thank you very much. Really appreciate it.</p><p>Coming up, folks, we're going to into the pit and read some of the e- mails that you have been sending us about AIG. More MONEY FOR BREAKFAST when we return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: I mean, we still cannot believe that General Mills is getting rid of the Pillsbury dinner rolls, the frozen rolls. We opened it. I was banging this thing like I was a monkey and then it popped open and freaked me out. But I think we should bronze this because they're not going to ...</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: They're collector's item.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: It is.</p><p>LEE: Put that on eBay.</p><p>PAYNE: Actually you shouldn't have opened that one. You probably should have put it in a vault somewhere, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Put it on eBay.</p><p>LEE: I bet it were last in the universe.</p><p>PAYNE: But they're keeping their dinner rolls, I mean, the flaky biscuits.</p><p>CLAMAN: That's right. I mean if you grew up having the three can stew and the tuna casserole like we did, you know, every -- every other Tuesday, tuna casserole, you have to have the dinner rolls.</p><p>We have been asking you all morning long for your take on the bonus backlash over at AIG. Let's see what you have to say. We've been getting hundreds of e-mails.</p><p>David Medas (ph) says, quote, \"You should only get a bonus when produce above the job requirements.\" He says AIG executives failed to produce to meet their requirements of their contract goals but failed far below their goals nullifying any bonuses.</p><p>See, I like David. Because aren't there two sides to a contract? Why were AIG executives pay bonus when they lost money?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, I think one of the problems is we have not actually seen the contract themselves. That might be great if we could get a chance to see what those contracts were.</p><p>CLAMAN: I called a lot of lawyers last night, and they said Liz, got to see the contract</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: Let me see the contract. But good for you, David. I like that.</p><p>LEE: They're not alone, too. A lot of CEOs got paid on Wall Street that maybe didn't deserve it.</p><p>Next question, well anyways. Sean Webb says, \"I would like to know if all these politicians are going to give back the contributions they received from these Wall Street crooks.\"</p><p>CLAMAN: Good point.</p><p>LEE: I think, Charles, you have a list there.</p><p>PAYNE: God, are you kidding me? The list from the Center of Responsible Politics. I left it outside. Amazing. Chris Dodd at the top, $280,000.</p><p>CLAMAN: But Republicans also peppering this list as well.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: They were seated at the top 10. There were six Democrats and four Republicans. And by the way, they did a great job hedging themselves. They had all the presidential candidates.</p><p>Dook Barela (ph) of Riverside, California says, \"The AIG bonuses are unacceptable. Our congressional representatives have no excuse for overlooking this AIG bonus when they hadn't taken the time to read the stimulus bill before passing it nor our president for signing it.\"</p><p>Everyone, obviously, should have some outrage towards Congress. There's no doubt about. Another $30 billion a week ago.</p><p>CLAMAN: Henry Paulson shoved this thing -- Henry Paulson, George Bush and Congress shoved this.</p><p>PAYNE: But just a week ago, they got another 30 billion, Liz. Someone else has to take responsibility.</p><p>CLAMAN: We got another e-mail. Richard Suttmeier, he's a frequest guest. Hi, Richard (INAUDIBLE) from ValueEngine.com, saying, \"You can't break employment contracts after the fact. Our Ivy League bank regulatory geniuses who bought 80 percent of AIG on behalf of U.S. taxpayers lacked the common sense to void all employment agreements.\" </p><p>PAYNE: You know what, what it...</p><p>CLAMAN: Renegotiate, Richard. Not void.</p><p>PAYNE: A bankruptcy would have renegotiated it as well, too. But you know what, on that note, Richard, I'm glad you're watching. We can also use the tax code as a weapon. I think that's going to be a big mistake if we go that road.</p><p>CLAMAN: Gang, we love the comments. You can keep them coming. We're getting hundreds of them. Join the crowd here. Send us an e-mail at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@FOXbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@FOXbusiness.com</email> We'll share some of your thoughts in the next hour. It's three minutes until the top of the hour.</p><p>Coming up right after the break, we're talking live to lawmakers including Republican senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas about what she and other lawmakers are doing about the handouts at AIG. We're serving up so much more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. Do not move. I mean you can go brush your teeth but other than that, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: And good morning, everybody. Welcome to hour number two of this special edition of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. The \"AIG, America's Outrage.\" I'm Liz Claman. Alexis Glick is off today. </p><p>We're going to have much more. The growing anger, I mean, each day it's getting worse and worse here among both you the public and lawmakers over the AIG bonuses. This morning we are getting hundreds and hundreds of e-mails. Please we want to hear from you. Specifically, what is it that outrages you so much about this? Is it Congress not having put in stopgaps for these kinds of problems back in September when the first TARP was announced? Is it just being so angry at AIG? Who, where, what? E-mail us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email> and we'll share them a little later in the show. It's very cathartic when you sit down, you e-mail us and maybe we'll read yours and you'll feel better about the anger.</p><p>First, let's get a quick check of the U.S. futures. But, remember, yesterday, the market did wonderfully. Up triple digits for the Dow Jones Industrials. The Dow futures, right now, slightly weaker. S&amp;P, we were trying to make a good of the flat line here. Got down as far as down about 2 points. But now we're down 5.70. The Nasdaq futures down 3.75. Nasdaq had a great double digit gain yesterday.</p><p>But let me send it up to Connell McShane, he's at the Fox Business desk, for some breaking details.</p><p>The IBM deal that isn't yet a deal, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, not yet a deal. But while it's fun to talk about it, isn't it? This morning in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Liz, the possibility being brought up that IBM might buy Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash to do so. It would be about -- would literally be a 100 percent premium over where Sun closed yet. Both stocks, as you might expect, are moving in the pre-market as a result of this speculation.</p><p>Let's first go to IBM, which is down about 3 percent in pre-market trading. It's actually moved under $90 a share. $89.91 is the bid, as you see, on it there. Java, Sun Microsystems, you might also expect that to be higher. It is. Look at that, up to $8.25 a share. So you're talking about a 60 some odd percent gain in the shares of Sun Microsystems. Again, on the speculation this morning that IBM might be a buyer of Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash in order to buy Sun.</p><p>Now, just breaking as we speak and crossing the wires are some headlines out of the Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis. Crossing the wires from \"The Charlotte Observer,\" as a matter of fact. I have not had a lot of time to go over this because they're just crossing, so I'll read a few of them as you look at the B of A stock price.</p><p>Lewis saying that the bank could pay back $45 billion in TARP money, Liz, by late this year or early next year, depending on the economy. So Lewis talking about not taking more money from the government, but paying it back. He says, in addition to that, that the bank expects to be profitable in 2009, absent what he calls an unexpected meltdown. Unexpected meltdown, a quote from Ken Lewis.</p><p>Bank of America saying it could repay the TARP money now if it had to, if it were not maintaining higher than normal capital cushion amid some fragile economic conditions. So it's not able to do it because of that right now, but should be able to do it late this year or early next year, Liz. $45 billion that Bank of America took. The CEO says it will be able to pay it back and it will be profitable in 2009 unless things really go wrong.</p><p>CLAMAN: Fine. Yes, we'll take it. We'll take it.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, we will take it. Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: And that way you don't have to have Congress complaining about your bonuses.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, that's right.</p><p>CLAMAN: If you don't like that . . .</p><p>MCSHANE: Pay whatever you want as long as you don't take government money, right?</p><p>CLAMAN: Exactly. Connell, we'll see you later.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>CLAMAN: As I mentioned, we're taking a closer look at this hour at the outrage that has boiled over about AIG. So let's start with the latest news. Chairman and CEO of American International Group, Edward Liddy, will pull up that chair at a congressional witness table today to take the heat. I mean this could be a blow torch. They are literally going to bring in blow torches because they know the cameras will be on them. The lawmakers will be out there screaming about these bonuses. </p><p>And in the meantime, Congress and the White House are actually trying to find ways to strip bonus recipients of that money. The chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee proposed companies and individuals play a 90 percent plus tax on all retention awards and bonuses over $50,000. And in a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner suggested holding back the bonus amount from upcoming bailout funds for AIG. But the story continues.</p><p>Joining me now for more on Liddy's testimony today are two congressional members. Democratic Congressman Gary Peters of Michigan and Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. Both of them sit on the subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government Sponsored Enterprises, which is holding today's hearings.</p><p>So you both have skin in the game. You'll both be out there. I will start first with Michele Bachmann. And I like that you're both here. And I want to explain to our viewers, Michele is a tax litigation attorney. Gary has a masters in business administration and law degree. So you both understand what perhaps can and could not be done regarding these bonuses. But, Representative Bachmann, what do you hope to learn about AIG's use of federal funds regarding the bonuses and how all the money is being allocated?</p><p>REP. MICHELE BACHMANN, (R) MINNESOTA: Well, there's a number of questions that I think all the members of the committee will have. First of all will be, what is the exit strategy to get the American taxpayer out of AIG and out of these private businesses. We're only beginning to learn where all of the tax money has gone from AIG. At least $20 billion has gone to pay off foreign investors who've invested in AIG. I don't think the American taxpayers signed up to bail out foreign investors. This is an economic quagmire. We need to get the American taxpayer out of bailing out these failed businesses. This is $173 billion plus that we have invested. It's a black hole. I don't think that the American taxpayer should have to pony up any more money for a failed enterprise like AIG.</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Peters, a lot of times you get the American public huddled before the televisions like it's the landing on the moon for these things. Everybody wants to watch it. And all they see is a lot of bloviating. I'm interested to know if there will be fact finding on your behalf. What do you want to find out here?</p><p>REP. GARY PETERS, (D) MICHIGAN: Well, I hope there is fact finding. This should not just be a media circus. We've got a lot of information that we need to find out. Certainly about an exit strategy, which I think are very good questions.</p><p>And in terms of the bonus and compensation, which is the -- what everybody is talking about right now, I think we need to be thinking generally about compensation in these financial firms and looking at those compensation matrix and how those are determined. I think it's -- what is really outrageous to the American public now and myself as well is that you have individuals at AIG, the very individuals that contributed to AIG being brought to their knees, losing billions of dollars, and contributing to this financial mess, getting $160 million in bonuses. Basically these individuals failed and they failed in a spectacular fashion. How could they . . .</p><p>CLAMAN: I want that deal. I want that deal.</p><p>PETERS: How could they be rewarded? Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: I want to be able to fail and get paid so much money.</p><p>PETERS: How could they be awarded, Alexis (ph).</p><p>CLAMAN: Look, no matter what side of the aisle you're on, House Finance Committee Chairman Barney Frank struck a cord yesterday when he said we should approach the AIG situation from the standpoint of the government and the taxpayer being the owner of the company now. Let's listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BARNEY FRANK, HOUSE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I think the time has come to exercise our ownership rights. We own most of the company. And then say, as owner, you know, I'm not paying you the bonus. You didn't perform.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Bachmann, how much leverage does the government realistically have in retrieving these bonuses?</p><p>BACHMANN: Well, we have all the leverage in the world. We do own AIG. And that's exactly the problem. I don't want to have the American taxpayer owning private companies. That's when we get the government into extra constitutional business we have no business being in.</p><p>CLAMAN: But now that we do, now that we do, Representative Bachmann, can we retrieve the bonuses?</p><p>BACHMANN: Sure, we can do anything we want to do. But what we need to do is get out and stop pouring money down a black hole. Just like we should not have the Obama administration running Detroit with GN or Chrysler. This is what will happen. We'll see more of this the more government stays involved in private businesses. We will see more of these fiascos. Government was never designed to run private businesses. We need to get out and we need to return these businesses to the private hands or they need to fail. And we need to be prepared to accept that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Peters, you're the one with the law degree. Is there some type of sort of clause that might enable this to get back the money? Or is this a red herring and do we need to look at what Representative Bachmann is talking about and, ooh, let me say it, let AIG fail? Everybody's so nervous about that and this so-called systemic risk.</p><p>PETERS: Well, first off, let me say that I've proposed a bill that I proposed yesterday that would use the tax code to recover that money for the taxpayers. This money is being paid out and to me the best approach right now would be to put a tax of roughly about 100 percent. That brings that money back to the taxpayers where it belongs.</p><p>It is a bill that only deals with situations where you have substantial investments of taxpayer money in a company. In this case, over $170 billion. And basically my approach is that there shouldn't be any bonuses paid out until the taxpayers are paid back first. After the taxpayers are paid back, the company is free to pay any bonuses they'd like and have any kind of compensation schedule, but they need to pay back the taxpayers first.</p><p>CLAMAN: I just love that.</p><p>BACHMANN: Liz?</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>BACHMANN: Liz?</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p>BACHMANN: The bigger question is, when will we get a pay back of the tranche of $173 billion. This was $165 million that was paid out in bonuses. What about the $173 billion that the taxpayers have already invested into AIG? When will we get paid that money back? It doesn't look like it will be any time soon. And let's not forget, it was the Obama stimulus bill that contains the clause that prohibits the federal government from bringing those bonuses back in. It was a clause slipped in by Chris Dodd.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, it was. Yes, it was.</p><p>BACHMANN: And we members of Congress, we were prevented from reading this bill because we didn't even have the bill online until after midnight. We had to debate at 9:00.</p><p>CLAMAN: And let me end on Representative Peters then. What about Chris Dodd slipping that in that actually allowed these bonuses to be given out? Quickly, if you could.</p><p>PETERS: Well, my understand is the deal's going forward. The bill it says forward (ph) that these bonuses cannot be paid. It wasn't backward looking. It was forward looking. It doesn't prohibit us from doing that now. Now we need to get a solution, bring that money back to the taxpayers and bring it back now.</p><p>BACHMANN: No, it actually does. It actually does (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, I can say this much. That Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, probably wanted something that allowed those bonuses to because he came from Wall Street and he has that mentality that, oh, you can't retain anybody on Wall Street unless you promise them millions in bonuses. Folks, and I'm talking to the viewers now, it is an unspoken word on Wall Street that you get paid $100,000 to $200,000 base salary, but then the promise of the bonus comes through. But usually, as I understand it, to both of you representatives, it's based on performance. And we know the performance with AIG was dismal.</p><p>PETERS: Right. Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: All right. Thanks to both of you, Congress members Gary Peters, Michele Bachmann. We'll be watching both of you today.</p><p>BACHMANN: Thanks so much, Liz. Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: You're welcome. We'll watch you on the hearing.</p><p>Washington isn't the only entity going after AIG. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo looking into taking legal action to try to find justice for you, the American taxpayer, who has kept the company afloat. With a closer look at Cuomo's case against AIG, I'm joined by Leslie Crocker Snyder, a retired New York state supreme court justice and an Manhattan district attorney candidate.</p><p>Nice to see you.</p><p>LESLIE CROCKER SNYDER, RETIRED NY STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: Nice to see you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, we just had all this storm (ph) and drong (ph) and yelling and talking of what can be done.</p><p>SNYDER: Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: You probably are somebody who knows. Can anything be done?</p><p>SNYDER: Well, there are all sorts of solutions that have been proposed, as we've just heard. And we also heard the political spin from each party, which I think we're going to hear a lot of, you know, criticizing the administration, not criticizing the administration.</p><p>CLAMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>SNYDER: My interest is really a legal one. We're all morally outraged. This is a terrible situation. But we have to balance that with the law. So right now we have Attorney General Cuomo, who is looking into whether or not there was any fraud involved in the original contracts.</p><p>CLAMAN: What would fraud look like? Tell us what we should be looking for.</p><p>SNYDER: Well, I guess it would be if people knew that they would never be able to pay out these bonuses because losses were occurring in the derivative section and basically they entered into this with some kind of fraudulent knowledge. It could be a number of things. But remember, basically we do have the rule of law. Contracts are sacrosanct unless there's something wrong with them.</p><p>So we have to look at the other solutions. Can we embarrass these people into not accepting the bonuses? That seems unlikely, but you never know.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, half of them are -- you know, a couple of them are gone and most of them are out in London and these are derivatives traders who probably are kind faceless. We haven't seen any names. Cuomo is trying to get the names.</p><p>SNYDER: Right. But we have to find a legal solution is my point. Maybe the clawback solution where we deduct the millions from the next payout would be a reasonable one. I like that because it seems as if it might have the cloak of law. So as much as we're outraged and we have to find a solution, we have to find a legal solution. And we can't lose sight of that. The public gets morally outraged, but we do operate in a rule of law.</p><p>CLAMAN: Absolutely. Well, in his letter to Congressman Barney Frank, Andrew Cuomo said it appears AIG had far more perhaps that was underneath the actual story, the meat of the issue, and so we perhaps might find more underneath there, but . . .</p><p>SNYDER: Cuomo's lawyers are great. They're going to conduct a terrific investigation. If there's fraud there or something that could undo the bonuses, they'll find it. But if there isn't, then we're going to have to look at, is this contract valid? Is there some other way to approach the situation?</p><p>CLAMAN: Now we don't want to do the old ripage (ph) of the contract. And here on your screen is the actual breakdown here. Top seven executives getting more than $4 million each. I like the 22 with more than $2 million. But the bottom one, 11 of these people who got at least $1 million are no longer at AIG. And you call them retention bonuses. This is a joke. It's an outrage. And it really, I think, hits the crux of the matter.</p><p>SNYDER: But we all feel that way. It's outrageous. And to see these people leave when they supposedly were being paid this to stay is even more outrageous. But at the same time, what I'm saying is, there is a legal solution here, we just don't know what it is yet. We're going to find that legal solution. You can't start tearing up valid contracts because then any time one side said, oh this is a bad contract by public policy. Let's just unilaterally rip it up.</p><p>CLAMAN: But if it says -- but if the contract says you have to perform a job, surely the job wasn't to put the company in the toilet.</p><p>SNYDER: I agree with that. So you have to look technically at that contract and find a way out of it. You can't just rip it up. </p><p>CLAMAN: Anybody have a copy? Anybody have a copy of these contracts? We'll take it.</p><p>SNYDER: We'll find a way, I am sure, whatever it is. It might be the clawback.</p><p>CLAMAN: Leslie Crocker Snyder, former New York state supreme justice, former prosecutor, I might add as well.</p><p>SNYDER: As well, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Tough, tough woman sitting next to me.</p><p>SNYDER: Oh, I've got a soft side, really, just not for AIG. </p><p>CLAMAN: I know. I don't think many Americans do. Thank you for coming in.</p><p>SNYDER: Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: We have some breaking news from \"The New York Post.\" AIG is trying to sell its 66-story headquarters in Manhattan for $100 million. The firm may also try and sell 72 Wall Street, that's the union which represents Dorman and Porters (ph). And that may be the potential buyer. \"The Post\" is owned by our parent company News Corp., but this goes back to Bear Stearns and the whole headquarters issue. What do you do with the building? They could sell it and make some money there.</p><p>SNYDER: Possibility.</p><p>CLAMAN: Then how do they run the business?</p><p>SNYDER: That's another question.</p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you, Leslie, very much.</p><p>Keep the e-mails coming folks, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>Coming up, major news on the tech front. If you're just waking up, we've got reports that IBM is ready to make a massive deal that could move the tech sector -- huge -- with a big name that was so hot during the dot-com go-go era.</p><p>And later on Fox Business, I'll have an exclusive interview with AutoNation President Mike Maroone. AutoNation preparing to make a major announcement today. It involves anyone buying a car from them. They are the nation's largest auto dealer. Wait till you hear this news, exclusively at 3:30 p.m. on a count down to the closing bell right here with me and the rest of the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Stay tuned. Much more coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: So we've got some major tech headlines this morning. This is fun. Action here in the business world. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that IBM is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems. Yes, Java, big blue could pay $6.5 billion in cash. And then Oracle, the software giant, releasing earnings today after the bell. Fox Business' Shibani Joshi joining me now with more.</p><p>What do you want to start with? There's just so many good stories.</p><p>SHIBANI JOSHI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: I know, there's so much god stuff. It's great stuff.</p><p>Well, let's talk about this big merger going on today. IBM potentially buying Sun Microsystems in cash, $6.5 billion. Now, Sun Microsystems has been long called an acquisition target for many, many years. IBM, Dell, HP, all the names that are being throwing out there or have been thrown out there that could potentially be interested in the company. IBM apparently in the works of making a move out there. And you can see what the stock price of Sun is, about $5, and the deal would be actually double the stock price right now. IBM trying to become more of the Wal- Mart of the technology industry. The one-stop shop. The place that you go to for hardware and software. It's just so big . . .</p><p>CLAMAN: That's 100 percent premium for that price.</p><p>JOSHI: One hundred percent premium. But this stock price has been battered. And it's a $5 stock. And as you mentioned, it was the darling of the technology sector when the boom happened. No longer, though.</p><p>CLAMAN: Interesting. And let's go to Oracle.</p><p>JOSHI: Oracle. Great company. This -- the earnings are coming out after the close today. You know, this company's interesting because, look, there's no such thing as recession resistant in this industry, recession proof, but this company's very recession resistant in the fact a lot of their revenues and their sales are recurring. So they've locked in contracts. They have a licensed business. And basically they have recurring revenue coming in month after month after month.</p><p>CLAMAN: Keep this chart up. Keep this chart up. Everybody look at it right now. It's rare to see any 52-week chart where there isn't a massive drop off. Look at Oracle. Not necessarily at its 52-week highs, but it's not that far from it, at least halfway. And this -- I find that interesting. They're doing business properly in a tough climate.</p><p>JOSHI: Right. And that's because of this recurring revenue phenomenon that the company has. The company's also been doing some amazing cost cutting initiatives. Also been buying back stocks. So that's helped to stabilize earnings per share.</p><p>Overall, people expecting 32 cents a share. Probably going to come in line. Friedman Billings and Ramsey thinks it's going to come in a little bit under. But even still, this company is -- this is one of the companies you want to bet on to stay more stabilized in whatever is going to happen over the next six to nine months.</p><p>CLAMAN: I find it fascinating the Nasdaq had a great day yesterday.</p><p>JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Up double digits.</p><p>JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Is it tech stocks that will lead us out of this recession?</p><p>JOSHI: It's so hard to say because a lot of people say, yes, because these companies are cash rich, they're debt less or debt low. And they're innovating. You know want, it's so remarkable, and what I always talk about when I'm at the Nasdaq is, this is the stuff that you want to watch and pay attention to in these very volatile times. These companies are starting to play offense. We've got Microsoft, IBM, Cisco all making big announcements. They're coming out and investing just (ph) for the long term.</p><p>CLAMAN: Shibani Joshi is your woman when those numbers come out. Thank you very much.</p><p>JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Coming up, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas joining us live to talk about what lawmakers are doing to get money back from AIG. And that is now your money.</p><p>And California here he comes. President Obama heading to the golden state today. We'll tell you what's on tap there.</p><p>Much more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST on the way.

I'm Gavin Gray in London, standing in this week for Ashley Webster.</p><p>A check on the European markets so far. Let's start where, well, where it's best, I'm afraid. The only bit of green on the board. Frankfurt DAX up 17 points just over the 4,000 barrier there. That a rise of about 0.4 percent. To Paris. I'm afraid the CAC 40 has come down now. It did start the morning in positive territory. But down almost five points. And over to the FTSE, which only for a few moments went into green. It spent the rest of the day in red and it's currently there, down almost 30 points.</p><p>And a little bit about unemployment today. We've had the figures out. Unemployment up to over 2 million in the U.K. That's about 6.5 percent of the workforce. It was a step rise and one that's caused a bit of a shock over here.</p><p>Back to you, Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.</p><p>Good morning, once again, everyone. We're going to update you here on the AIG saga.</p><p>AIG's CEO Ed Liddy ready to face the music on Capitol Hill today. He'll likely be grilled about $165 million in bonuses paid to employees at the very unit that led to AIG's near collapse. Liddy has defended the bonuses, saying AIG was contractually obligated to pay them. In fact, in an op-ed piece in today's \"Washington Post,\" Liddy says, \"in America, when you owe people money, you pay them.\" Earlier on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST, we spoke with Representative Jim Himes, who had the chance to met with Liddy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM HIMES, (D) CONNECTICUT: Well, I had the opportunity to sit with Mr. Liddy in my office yesterday. And what I told him was, you know, it's not just important that the right thing happen, but that the right thing be seen to happen. So I said, you know, look, my experience is that 10 very smart lawyers in a room can make just about anything happen. So, please, get 10 lawyers in a room and figure out how to fix this. And if you can't do that, get these 73 people that are receiving these bonuses together in a conference room and say, folks, this is the time to stand up and do the right thing for your country. Give back the money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEE: Give back the money. The Treasury Department and several senators are looking at ways to get the money back from AIG or from the individual employees.</p><p>Well, the family of a Connecticut woman violently attacked by a chimpanzee is suing for $50 million in damages from the chimps owner. Lawyers for Charla Nash allege Sandra Herold, the chimp's owner, was liable for the attack as a result of her negligence and recklessness in caring for the ape. They claim Herold knew about the chimp's violent history and did not do enough to protect people.</p><p>All right. You're up-to-date here on the Fox Business Network.

Alexis Glick is off today.</p><p>I want to take a quick look at the futures here. We've pretty much been languishing slightly below positive territory here. That would be negative, Liz. Dow Jones Industrials down 53 points. Those are the futures numbers. S&amp;P, which gives us a better sense of how the markets might open, showing some red on the screen, down 4.40. The Nasdaq down about 3. Remember, we're coming off a triple digit gain for the Dow Jones Industrials, which was a really strong move for the Nasdaq yesterday. And that was, what, five days out of six that we were moving higher.</p><p>We are awaiting the release of the February Consumer Price Index, the CPI. And analyst estimates, the all items CPI climbed by 0.4 percent last month. That would actually mark the second consecutive increase. Let's get the number right now.</p><p>MCSHANE: Al right, Liz, appreciate it.</p><p>And here comes the number coming down. And we'll see whether or not if we did get the increase or not. CPI up 0.4 percent. So there you have it, exactly what you would expect. Ex food and energy, up 0.2 percent. The consensus had been for a 0.1 percent gain on that particular metric there. So up 0.4 percent on the headline figure. Up 0.2 percent when you back out the so-called food and energy volatile prices there.</p><p>Now, the year-over-year increase, .2 percent. The consensus had been for that to be unchanged year-over-year, so it actually went up a little bit on that measure. And when you take out food and energy on a yearly basis, it was up 1.8 percent.</p><p>So that is the CPI figure there. As you see it, the only other thing that's coming out right now is the current account deficit, which is $132.8 billion, a little bit less than the consensus, $137 billion, that had been expected.</p><p>Now, a quick look at the markets to see how we are reacting to these figures. Liz showed you that the futures were down exactly as they are now, by 50-plus points on the Dow, and about 4 on the S&amp;P futures.</p><p>So, again, CPI going up, and that's exactly what we expected, Liz, with the consensus on the core rate. A little bit above -- I should say the consensus was a little below the actual number, which was .2 on the core.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>CLAMAN: And always important to point out that the Consumer Price Index is really -- for folks who don't understand the CPI -- it's basically inflation at the consumer level, for what you pay out there.</p><p>Joining me now with instant analysis of the February Consumer Price Index, Stephen Leeb, president of Leeb Capital Management, and Matt McCall, the president of Penn Financial Group.</p><p>Stephen, this number...</p><p>STEPHEN LEEB, PRESIDENT, LEEB CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Half full, half empty.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, but why are we even looking at inflation right now? Should we be?</p><p>LEEB: Well, you know, I think, Liz, before we know it, we should be looking at it. I mean, this is an economy that I think once it recovers, and if we get this banking crisis under control, which I think we will one of these days, this recovery could be breathtaking, and it could lead very, very quickly to a lot of inflation.</p><p>CLAMAN: That is an interesting point.</p><p>Just as quickly as economists were caught flat-footed by this downturn, could they well be caught by an upturn?</p><p>MATT MCCALL, PRESIDENT, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP: Absolutely. And a lot of economists are talking about deflation right now. And I'm on the opposite side of the field.</p><p>I think inflation is going to be a major issue. When you're really spending $3 trillion, and you have to budget that, where's that money coming from?</p><p>You're going to have to raise rates, and it's going to lead to inflation. And at the end of the day, if you're not ready for this, and you don't have your portfolio set, you could really be caught like you just said, like economists were.</p><p>LEEB: Well, you know, Liz, if you look at some of the data that's coming, I mean, oil prices from $35 to nearly $50. And this economy down 6 percent. What's going to happen when we're growing by 2 percent?</p><p>Copper prices up 20 percent. I mean, you've had this tremendous rally in commodities, even before we've gotten off the tarmac in this economy. Imagine what happens when the world really starts to grow. There is going to be no natural resources.</p><p>CLAMAN: And what about this theory that we have printed so much money, that the value of the dollar will eventually go down and inflation will rear its head?</p><p>MCCALL: Absolutely. I mean, you have to play, if you're looking at stocks, what is going to -- how do you play a falling dollar? You look global. How do you play inflation? Gold kips (ph).</p><p>And I'm actually putting my money where my mouth is. I've been buying kips (ph) over the last couple months, I've been buying gold over the last couple of years, setting up for what could possibly be hyperinflation.</p><p>LEEB: I have no argument with him. I'd love to argue with him, but no...</p><p>CLAMAN: Fight him. Come on.</p><p>LEEB: I can't. No, I mean, kips (ph) and gold are probably our largest positions right now. I mean, it's not so much the dollar.</p><p>CLAMAN: Even though gold touched $1,000 a couple of weeks ago? And look at it now. It's down $10 at the moment to $906. Is this a buying opportunity?</p><p>LEEB: Yes, it is. I mean, can gold go to $850 or $800? Absolutely. But just look at gold the last eight years. What asset has finished every year in the last 8 higher than it was the year before?</p><p>CLAMAN: But let's go back to consumer prices. We do see a slight uptick, of course, of the core rate, which often sort of strips out the very volatile food and energy prices, although energy is not so volatile lately. But the consumer, how will he or she feel it out there?</p><p>MCCALL: I think they're going to feel -- going to the food, I mean, we all go to the grocery store every day. And when we see how the prices - - they have not come down.</p><p>Even though this economy has come down, our wages have come down, prices at the grocery store have not come down. Maybe we're buying the private label versus the brand name; however, those prices are still high. And once we see wheat prices, corn prices start picking back up again, as you spoke of earlier with the commodity prices, we're going to see even higher prices for the consumer.</p><p>CLAMAN: By the way, we got General Mills' numbers earlier this morning, and they actually missed estimates. But interestingly enough, they upped their full-year guidance, and commodity prices are down. They're still managing to make money. Something tells me that when they hiked those cereal prices -- remember that?</p><p>LEEB: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: ... or they made the boxes smaller but kept the price the same, they still have pricing power.</p><p>LEEB: Liz, what you have to understand, there are 2.3 billion people in China and India. These economies are still growing. So are the Middle Eastern economies.</p><p>At least half the world is still growing. And that half is the world that needs commodities in order to grow. They need evermore commodities.</p><p>In this country, we can grow without using additional commodities. Europe can grow without using additional commodities. But the engine of this world need commodities in order to grow.</p><p>MCCALL: And as the middle class grows, more food.</p><p>LEEB: Everything more. Moving up the food chain.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm not hearing either of you say buy equities. You're not saying that now.</p><p>LEEB: Well, I think buy selected equities.</p><p>CLAMAN: That are related to commodities?</p><p>LEEB: Well, that are related to inflation. I mean, you know, growth stocks that -- I think, you know, basically any company that came through 2008, which I think is kind of a microcosm for what to expect over the next five to 10 years, inflation, deflation, et cetera, is probably a good buy. Stocks like TEVA, for example, stocks like CVS.</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you own those?</p><p>LEEB: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: What about you?</p><p>MCCALL: I do. I like stocks here, but you have to be a stock picker. But I think the two areas that I'm looking at, one is market turns, emerging markets and commodities, both based on this commodity inflation play.</p><p>CLAMAN: Stephen, Matt, thanks to both of you.</p><p>LEEB: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: They're liking gold right now. What can I say? And copper.</p><p>Let me guess, you like palladium, too?</p><p>LEEB: Yes!</p><p>CLAMAN: I knew he liked palladium!</p><p>LEEB: And platinum.</p><p>CLAMAN: Nickel and zinc as well. </p><p>LEEB: We're compatriots. I didn't know him the first time I met you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: Coming up, we'll see if Apple's big iPhone update gave its stock a big boost with a look at the Fox 50.</p><p>And then in 90 seconds, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas joining me live to talk about the growing outrage from lawmakers in Washington over the bonuses handed out by AIG. And what about her colleagues who took money from the troubled insurer?</p><p>A lot of answering that we are expecting here, but stay tuned. We've got much more than that on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAYNE: The Fox 50 returning to its winning ways yesterday. Our index gained 17 points to close at 584.</p><p>This morning, there is word of a posible merger in the index. IBM could buy Sun Microsystems.</p><p>For more, I'm joined by Matt McCall, the president of Penn Financial Group.</p><p>Let's start with Apple real quick, though.</p><p>The stock was up big time yesterday. It had been floating around. It looks like it's on the cusp of a major breakout through $100. Is it all about updating their software or is there more to it?</p><p>MCCALL: I think there's more to it. I mean, updating the software, the good news always gives Apple, you know, a bit of a bounce. People love hearing the new products coming out.</p><p>However, I think Apple is just a value at this level. If you're looking for growth plays, looking for something to play off the consumer turning around, Apple's the best play. I own the stock and think it's a great long-term...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: You got a target on it?</p><p>MCCALL: You know, I'm looking at about $120 is the next couple of months. If it breaks through -- like you just said, if it gets through that $100 level, it's going to take off. But it's been struggling there over the last few weeks.</p><p>PAYNE: IBM in the news in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning, perhaps buying Sun Micro $6.5 billion. Do you like the deal? IBM just down a little bit on that news.</p><p>MCCALL: I think it's a good deal. I think they're picking up on cheap -- I mean, Sun's down 71 percent over the last 12 months. Even though you're paying 100 percent premium, I think it's a nice play.</p><p>And you look at IBM stock over the last couple of years, it's one of the few big tech stocks that's held up very well. So it's one of those -- you know, the grandmother stock. Your grandmother can buy IBM and throw it in her basket.</p><p>PAYNE: Do you own any?</p><p>MCCALL: I do own some IBM, yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Really? Good. Good.</p><p>All right. We've got to talk about Coca-Cola. This is really interesting.</p><p>We've seen some saber rattling out of China with respect to holding out treasuries. We think something is going on here behind the scenes. Now they're rejecting a possible takeover of Coke, one of their largest fruit juice companies, $2.4 billion bid for high-end juice.</p><p>What do you make of this and what's the impact going to be on IBM?</p><p>MCCALL: I think eventually it's going to get through. I think this deal will eventually get through. Maybe not this company...</p><p>PAYNE: IBM's already said though -- I think they've said already this morning that they're not going to pursue it any more. I'm sorry, Coke.</p><p>MCCALL: Coke.</p><p>PAYNE: Obviously IBM's not going to pursue it.</p><p>MCCALL: They'll take a different angle. I think they want to get in China. They know the growth potential in China. They're going to get over there.</p><p>The one concern though with Coke, in looking at the way the stock has performed recently, it's gotten hit because of the dollar. I mean, the dollar has risen, and they're such a global company, but I think the U.S. dollar is going to fall in the next, let's say, 12 to 18 months. So this is a play on the falling U.S. dollar, it is a play on growth.</p><p>But as a stock, I don't know. And I think there's a lot more exciting plays out there right now.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, let's talk about something that's been really exciting recently, Bank of America. The chairman, he's really been on the offensive here recently. Now talking about possibly paying back TARP money this year.</p><p>A, do you believe him? And B, could this help the stock? It was edging up before we came on air. It was edging just a little bit higher.</p><p>MCCALL: I mean, how can you believe him? I mean, honestly, I don't believe a word out of anybody's mouth from Wall Street to the White House anymore. I think (INAUDIBLE) research. Buying Bank of America here, it's like throwing a dart. I mean, it's probably going to be one to make it out.</p><p>I'm much prefer...</p><p>PAYNE: You just said you want excitement. This is exciting.</p><p>MCCALL: It's exciting, but I also want to get some sleep at night as well. So I don't like it here. I like J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley. Those are the three that I'd be looking at. Not as exciting as a Bank of America or Citigroup, but a much better risk reward play.</p><p>PAYNE: Right, less risk. And...</p><p>MCCALL: And the reward is still high. I mean, I think you have a lot of upside on all three of those stocks.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks a lot, Matt. Really appreciate it.</p><p>MCCALL: Thanks, Charles.</p><p>(NEWSBREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: Lawmakers are up in arms over the $165 million bonuses handed out to American International Group. And the head of the Senate Banking Committee, Chris Dodd of Connecticut, says he supports his colleagues' calls to recoup the taxpayer funds.</p><p>Dodd, though, has received nearly $300,000 over 20 years from the failed insurer. And folks, you know what? He's not alone. The list is legion, including both Republicans and Democrats who took money from AIG.</p><p>But here now to weigh in on the topic, Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.</p><p>Welcome, Senator. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>SEN. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON (R), TEXAS: Thank you, liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, let me ask you, first, did you take any money from AIG in campaign contributions?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Liz, I don't know. I'm so sorry. I don't know. I have not even looked at my contribution list with regard to that.</p><p>CLAMAN: It's never come up? Really?</p><p>HUTCHISON: I have a very firm opinion about these bonuses.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p>HUTCHISON: You know, regardless of whether I have -- and we can certainly check that -- I think that what the executives are doing is outrageous. I think retention bonuses for people who have already left is just not acceptable to the American people.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm sure, because it's become such a hot-button issue here. We have received this morning alone hundreds and hundreds of e-mails.</p><p>What are your constituents telling you, Senator?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Oh, they're outraged. They're outraged by all of the big spending that scares people to death with the debt that we have and the deficits that we are accumulating.</p><p>They are outraged by these bailouts. Some are to big to fail, some are not. The bailout mania, I think, has just gone out of control, and that's what I'm hearing from my constituents.</p><p>And you know, Liz, there is more of a fear factor than I've known in my lifetime right now, because they see the problem, but they don't see a solution that is going to work. And that's what I'm hearing.</p><p>CLAMAN: These bonuses have everybody so riled up, Senator, as you know. But are we missing the bigger picture? And that is that when the TARP was pushed through initially, it just wasn't put in place where there were handcuffs that would prevent this kind of thing from happening, even though people demanded it. </p><p>Did Congress members read this closely enough? Why didn't they ensure that something would be put in that would prevent us down the road from facing this angst and anger?</p><p>HUTCHISON: I think that is a very legitimate criticism. I do.</p><p>Originally, Secretary Paulson asked for no strings at all, wanted $700 billion, and said that the global economy was going to crash if we didn't do it.</p><p>CLAMAN: I remember.</p><p>HUTCHISON: We didn't give him a no-strings-attached opening of the Treasury. We cut it to $350 billion.</p><p>We did put parameters around it. But clearly, we did not foresee all of the things that these people would do, like take trips, like give bonuses. We just thought that there would be a factor where all of these executives would come together like Americans come together to solve problems, and that they would do the right thing.</p><p>That was a mistaken assumption. However, now, Liz, we are not learning from that mistake, and we are continuing to throw money at problems without the necessary restraint and parameters put around it.</p><p>CLAMAN: Sure. Are you, Senator -- are you of the belief we can't let AIG go down because something horrible will happen?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Well, as I understand it, AIG has such a global impact because it is an insurer of last resort in so many areas. And that's why the original AIG bailout came from the Treasury, because Mr. Bernanke saw that as well.</p><p>Now we actually have put 80 percent of the company's capital on the line from American taxpayers, and I just think we've got to take a stronger control here. And we can't own 80 percent of a company and have executives taking bonuses for retention when they've already left.</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you think...</p><p>HUTCHISON: Let me say, too, Liz, I think you all talked about this earlier today. The contracts have already been breached. So to say this is a contractual obligation, when they have not met the performance standards that are in the contract, I think does bring into question that we would have the power to do more.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm absolutely with you on that. A contract, I absolutely believe, should be held up. But when the other side doesn't deliver what they promised, that's a problem.</p><p>An opinion article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" yesterday said this: \"The politicians prefer to talk about AIG's latest bonus payments because they deflect attention from Washington's failure to supervise AIG.\"</p><p>How do you respond to that, Senator?</p><p>HUTCHISON: I think it's valid. I think that the regulatory reform that is needed for AIG and for our financial institutions, and for the institutions that are doing all of these fancy derivatives that have been virtually unregulated, must be regulated in a responsible way. We don't want to go overboard, but we certainly know where the vacancies are in our regulatory system today, and we need to address that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Senator, one of your constituents just shot us an e-mail, wanted to get it to you. Neil Lewis in Granbury, Texas, says, \"Why are we outraged at the bonuses when we are supporting foreign banks to the tunes of tens of billions of dollars?\"</p><p>Now, just to clarify, foreigners have bought a lot of our debt. So this is perhaps a hairier, more complex issue. But do you have an answer for him?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Well, I think that it's correct to say that some of this stimulus or bailout money has gone to foreign banks. Part of it AIG. And that is an area that we need to look at, where this money is going, and have more strings on it so that we assure that our financial institutions are being shored up, but also that they're getting credit out there.</p><p>You say, what are my constituents saying? My constituents are saying they cannot get credit in the marketplace.</p><p>CLAMAN: Still, after all of that?</p><p>HUTCHISON: My small businesses, my medium-size businesses cannot get credit. My auto dealers cannot get credit. It is -- that's what we've got to address. And where all of this money is going from the bailout, into foreign coffers, I think is a legitimate question, of course.</p><p>CLAMAN: Last question. Quickly, do you think Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has a handle on this? </p><p>HUTCHISON: Well, I have to say that I don't see that he has come forward with a plan that can work. We don't see credit flowing.</p><p>I think that we made mistakes last fall, but we have not learned from those mistakes this spring. And I am very concerned that he is not on top of it, and that we have got to get a handle on the financial situation and the housing situation and stop all these stimulus packages until we correct that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Very sensible talking from you this morning, Senator. Thank you.</p><p>Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.</p><p>HUTCHISON: Thank you, Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: Any time.</p><p>Coming up, we have a look at \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: And now it's time for \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>And that is people are still buzzing over AIG's bonus handouts. We've been getting your e-mails all morning long. We wanted to read a few more. Thank you so much for sending them.</p><p>Time to dig -- and so let's read some of these e-mails. We'll dig into the mail bag and see what everybody is talking about.</p><p>Glenn in Auburn, Alabama talks about AIG employees who are threatening to leave if they don't get their bonuses. Ah, yes. He says, \"These people caused the problems! So what if they leave? Good riddance!\"</p><p>PAYNE: Well, the point is, half of them are already gone.</p><p>CLAMAN: I know. They left with the money. See, they're smarter than we are.</p><p>LEE: Left with the money, yes.</p><p>Robert of Charleston, South Carolina, says, \"Almost anything the government or AIG does to address the utter audacity of this scandal will be hard to trust.\"</p><p>So that's the next kind of chapter of this problem, right?</p><p>CLAMAN: And remember, Fox Business will be carrying that at 10:00 a.m. Eastern today, the hearing on Capitol Hill.</p><p>PAYNE: By the way, guys, ,on that trust issue, how can private funds trust the government not to limit their profits if they go into this partnership on these toxic assets, considering the uproar? Because billions are going to be made on that if it's done right.</p><p>Bill Stevens of Jamestown, North Carolina, asks, \"Where was Timothy Geithner on this issue? Where was he when agreements were extended under his watch? I'll tell you what -- out to lunch -- like he is on all other economic issues.\"</p><p>CLAMAN: It was interesting. Did you just see Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison? She took a breath when I said does Tim Geithner have a handle on this? Granted, he's got to have a handle on a bunch of other issues, too. So it's very tough out there.</p><p>LEE: Yes, she did kind of...</p><p>PAYNE: But he's the number one guy. We need confidence in him, and obviously very few people have confidence.</p><p>CLAMAN: If he's there, you have got to have confidence in these people.</p><p>Keep the e-mails coming, folks, moneyforbreakfast @foxbusiness.com. It's very important that you e-mail us and let us know, because we are the one network who is letting your e-mails be, you know, read. And we understand how this feels.</p><p>But we've got to move this discussion forward. The dialogue has to move forward from, yes, we're totally annoyed, to what's going to happen?</p><p>LEE: And speaking of moving it forward, you have a big interview coming up on \"THE CLOSING BELL\" today.</p><p>CLAMAN: Mike Maroone of AutoNation. He's the president of the nation's largest auto dealer. They have a huge announcement, exclusively right here on Fox Business. It affects every single person who wants to buy any kind of car from these AutoNation dealers.</p><p>So stay tuned for that.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. Well, I'll definitely be watching.</p><p>CLAMAN: \"COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL,\" 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Thank you so much for joining us. We hope you have a great day.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

And lawmakers are on the move to retrieve the money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Drug lords, kidnappings and now trade tariffs is this what we get for the $10 billion in aid the U.S. gives to Mexico? We've got a hot debate straight ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And does IBM have sunny days ahead? If you're just waking up here comes the sun -- IBM wanting to buy Sun Microsystems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We've got the latest. We're serving all that and so much more for you right here on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>Well, good morning everybody. Welcome to a special edition of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. The AIG America's out outraged. I am Liz Claman. Alexis Glick is off today.</p><p>We're going to have much more on all this anger, this drama stemming from the AIG bonuses, and so much of it, we know it's coming from you.</p><p>And we actually really do want to hear from you. Are you outraged? But specifically, why? Don't just say, \"Yes, I'm furious.\" We want to know why you're outrage and you can actually email us right here at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email> and we'll actually share those with you later in the show. We'll read what some of you have to say.</p><p>But first let's get you caught up on the futures here and this after a day where we had a triple digit gain for the DOW Jones Industrial. Futures are lower today at the moment DOW Jones Industrial futures down 44 but we tend to look more at the S&amp;P futures, they give you a better sense of what might happen with the market, they're down nearly five points; the NASDAQ down four.</p><p>Let's send it right now to Connell McShane at the Fox Business desk with the very latest. He's got earnings out from General Mills -- Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: They look a little light, Liz, $3.79 a share X-items has been the number that's been reported by General Mills but the Street's looking for $0.88, so light on that front. Interesting to point out that the company says it's raising its guidance for the full year but when you look at it the guidance is still light, of where the Street estimate is. You see where the stock close yesterday $3.38 to $3.87 for the full year, $3.94 is the estimate. So the top end of the guidance at $3.87 is still light of the estimate.</p><p>General Mills among other things talking about currency translations hurting their earnings a little bit, reducing sales growth by three percentage points. The currency translation so GIS, General Mills certainly will a stock to watch today here, Liz. This one is down about 11 percent with the markets so far this year.</p><p>But the earnings look light, we'll have more on it later on the morning, right now back over to you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, we'll be talking much more about General Mills because clearly you cannot ignore Count Chocolate and Boo Berry. Very important.</p><p>MCSHANE: I know it.</p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you Connell.</p><p>As I mentioned we're taking a closer look at this hour at the outrage over AIG. So let's start with the latest news, first off, Chairman and CEO of American International Group Ed Liddy pulling up a chair at a Congressional witness table today. This one is going to be so closely watched he will take massive heat. I promise you every lawmaker is going to want to make his or her voice heard very loudly, this over the more than $200 million in bonuses.</p><p>Meanwhile, Congress and the White House trying to find ways to strip bonus recipients of the money they got. Some of these people are not even with the company anymore and they we're getting millions and million of dollars worth.</p><p>The chairman of ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee proposed companies and individuals pay a 35 percent tax on all retention awards and bonuses over $50,000.</p><p>And in a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner suggesting holding back the bonus amount from upcoming bailout funds for AIG.</p><p>There are all kinds of ideas being thrown out here on how to get the money back but do you have ideas, I mean, how angry are you over this bonus debacle? If you are steamed, you're not alone we're not just talking about lawmakers.</p><p>Fox Business's senior Washington correspondent, Peter Barnes is in our Washington Bureau with the results -- Peter a new Pew Research Center Poll, boy they gets these things out pretty quickly, what do we see?</p><p>PETER BARNES, FBN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well that's right, Liz, the AIG bonus controversy a possible big political headache for President Obama if the financial bailout doesn't work and if he has to go back to Congress later for more money to help banks.</p><p>The White House continuing to express outrage about the bonuses, distancing itself from the controversy and trying to get out in front of the story that was inevitably going to dominate the headlines anyway.</p><p>But the President remains fully vested in a bank rescue plan, he voted for it as a Senator. And as President he says it is critical to reviving bank lending and the economy.</p><p>On Monday, the Pew Research Center released the poll that found that 87 percent of people are outright angry about or at least bothered by bank bailouts.</p><p>In the poll, despite their anger, people still supported bank rescues as a policy 48 percent to 40 percent. But the poll was taken last week before revelations of the AIG bonuses.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL DIMOCK, PEW RESEARCH CENTER: I think if anything this has intensified the emotional feeling that people have. Again, they've been giving a clear example of the downside of this policy the problems with the way that this money is being spent. I think that intensifies the anger now. Whether it's going to undermine the support for the policy, it's something that we're going to need to see how it plays out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES: Now, the President has to be somewhat careful on how he plays the AIG bonus controversy, Dimock says. His job approval rating is starting to slip. The PEW poll shows it down five points from February to March, Dimock says mainly over public concern about his stimulus plan, his budget and how they will increase the deficit as well as some concern over his foreign policy.</p><p>But the President did include a $750 billion placeholder in his budget for more funding for bank bailouts if he needs it. Being outraged about how AIG now may leave the President in a delicate political position, later with Congress and voters trying to turn a negative consequence of the bailout, taxpayer money going to big bonuses into a positive, cleaning up the system by continuing those very bailouts.</p><p>Liz, back to you.</p><p>CLAMAN: There is no way Peter, anybody is going rubber-stamp more spending with these AIG bonuses unless this gets resolved. Unbelievable. Thanks for the PEW Research Center.</p><p>BARNES: No way, you're right.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, here take my money.</p><p>BARNES: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: The AIG bonus was the talk of the halls on Capitol Hill yesterday. Massachusetts Congressman and Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee Barney Frank was confounded by Ed Liddy of AIG's reasoning for payment of the bonuses. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BARNEY FRANK, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE: Mr. Liddy gave two arguments. One, was my hands are tied legally but the other was a policy argument. He doesn't want to rescind them because he wants to retain those people. I am very skeptical that retaining the people who made the mistakes is a good idea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAMAN: For more on today's hearings and this outrage that we know so many of you are feeling, I am joined now by Democratic Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut and Republican Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. Both served on the House Financial Services Committee.</p><p>Well, did you bring your boxing gloves? Both of you, I can only imagine...</p><p>REP. JIM HIMES (D), CONNECTICUT: Good morning Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: Ed Liddy sitting in front of you. I will start with the Representative Himes. Give me a sense of what you want and need to hear from Ed Liddy today.</p><p>HIMES: Well, you know, as you pointed out in your story the outrage is out there is unbelievable. And you know, Congress represents the people and so I think you are going to see some outrage today.</p><p>But you know I had the opportunity to sit with Mr. Liddy in my office yesterday. And what I told him was, it's not just important that the right thing happens but that the right thing be seen to happen.</p><p>So I said, you know look, my experience is that 10 very smart lawyers in the room can make just about anything happen so please get 10 lawyers in the room and figure out how to fix this.</p><p>And if you can't do that, get these 73 people that are receiving these bonuses together in a conference room and say folks, this is the time to stand up and do the right thing for your country.</p><p>Give back the money. Because if those two things don't happen, action will be taken either in the halls of Congress or by the State of Connecticut where this particular unit is resident. And it's really important that they step up and do the right thing not just so that the many people who have lost their jobs out there see that everybody is in this together but because as you point out, we are not through stabilizing the financial sector yet.</p><p>We've got work yet to do and every time something like this happens our hands get tied.</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Moore Capito, Ed Liddy has an op-ed piece in the \"Washington Post\" today and in it one of the lines that caught my eye was where he said, \"In America when we owe people money we pay them, ok.\" So I think that's not nod to the hall if there is a contract you can't break it in America we get that.</p><p>We understand that but Representative Himes, just said, get a couple of lawyers into the room. We can figure something out here.</p><p>Congress has suggested taxing these bonuses up to 95 percent and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner says that he's working on this as well but what is your solution? What do you and your brethren in Congress feel about this?</p><p>SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO (R), WEST VIRGINIA: Well, I think we recognize with all of the different programs and policies that are coming forward, that just this morning as I was coming in the guard said to me something isn't right. And we need to make this situation to a point where people understand what's going on but still reflecting the outrage and the astonishment of the lack of transparency and the lack of accountability.</p><p>My question to Mr. Liddy will be you knew these were part of the contract, you knew in good faith and bargaining good faith with the United States government why were these questions not answered?</p><p>Where is the transparency and accountability of the tax dollars? Why did AIG not come forward and if they did, why did the Treasury accept this as part of the agreement to further fund and to further bailout this company?</p><p>CLAMAN: I am glad you brought up the Treasury Secretary. Representative Himes, we talked about what Treasury Secretary Geithner wants to do and he says, \"We will impose on AIG in essence a contractual commitment to pay the Treasury from the operations of the company the amount of retention awards just paid. In addition we will deduct the $30 billion -- deduct from there in assistance an amount basically equal to the amount of those payments.\" What does that really mean? And is that the solution?</p><p>HIMES: Well, what that really means is that our taxpayer dollars are not going to pay bonuses for people who are not just involved but remember these are folks that were in the unit of AIG that created the credit defaults swap exposure that brought the company down.</p><p>And so I think as a matter of principle the notion that our hard earned taxpayer dollars aren't going to provide bonuses to those people is a pretty good notion. Now, the Treasury affect debt maybe Congressional legislation could affect that but frankly, as I said before I'd like to see AIG stand up and do the right thing here, either by getting those people together to agree to give back the money or to figure out a way to get around those contracts.</p><p>And this notion that you can't get around the contract look, all over this country, firefighters, policeman, teachers are being asked to reopen their contracts to give back wages and benefits. So I don't think it's crazy to say that we ought to take a look at that here.</p><p>CLAMAN: It's not. Representative Moore Capito, but the argument out there also floating around on Wall Street, well, you take away their bonuses and you're not going to find anybody to these jobs. Do you buy that?</p><p>MOORE CAPITO: Well, I inherently disagree with that, I mean, I think that you are looking at large financial institutions that were brought to their knees by basically a lot of greed and over extension of risk.</p><p>And to think that the American spirit and as the young good minds in this country, would not want to bring these companies back without, you know, extravagant bonuses, without holding the taxpayer out for more and more dollars. I think that's a ridiculous concept. I don't buy that.</p><p>And I think that the fact that I agree with Jim when he says there are people all over this country that are taking pay cuts, that are working for less times, that are losing their jobs, that are making adjustments in their families and why these employees at AIG and others can not tighten their belts and make adjustments too or break a contract is just doesn't pass the snip test.</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Himes, you're out there in Connecticut where most of your constituents and many of them and certainly are hedge fund people or financial people but you're also looking at constituents who are looking specifically at Congress and saying, so many members, many of actually the sub-Committee members have taken money from AIG in the form of donations.</p><p>How do you answer to that?</p><p>HIMES: Well, you know the overall campaign finance system is a broken system and I think you'd find general agreement on that in Congress.</p><p>But look, you raised another very broader and an important point which is that as the stones get thrown today and rightly so, Congress is not blame free here. The product -- the credit defaults swaps that are at the heart of AIG's mess were explicitly unregulated by an act of Congress a number of years ago.</p><p>So while this will be a day of popular expression of anger at AIG we need to not forget that to some degree Congress was complicit in the mess that grew up at AIG. And we need to look forward and say, look, we need a smart set of regulations, not necessarily more regulations, but smart regulations that are going to prevent this from happening ever again. That's our job. And we've got to step up to do it.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, the party starts at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. I mean, this is going to be interesting. Fox Business will be carrying these grilling of Ed Liddy. Congress Member Jim Himes and Shelley Moore Capito, thank you both for joining us.</p><p>MOORE CAPITO: Thank you.</p><p>HIMES: Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Anytime. We really appreciate your perspective</p><p>And out there, you guys, we want to hear what you think about what is going on with AIG and certainly how this event in Congress is going to developer. Send us an e-mail at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>Get up out of bed. Fire up the computer; share some of your thoughts with us. We're actually going to be reading some of them coming up.</p><p>We do have a lot of market news here. General Mills reporting earnings this morning and giving full year forecast. You may be eating some of their food for breakfast. What's the breakdown in store for the cereal maker?</p><p>But first, let the sun shine in. That's what IBM is saying as a massive computer deal may be in the offing -- the biggest deal possibly that IBM has ever made?</p><p>Good morning to you. That's a big news story coming up. We are back in two minutes.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE: Connell McShane back on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST with some breaking news out of the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning with an interesting report that IBM might be in the market to buy Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash to do so which would be, give or take, a 100 percent premium over the close for Sun yesterday.</p><p>Now let's take a look at the stock prices involved. You would expect that Sun Microsystems would be higher and it is. There is IBM down about two or three percent in the pre-market; as you see, the bid's 90.25 and the stock had closed just under 93 yesterday. Sun, ticker simple JAVA, these days is up to $8.10. So that's a 60 percent move, give or take, on the stock so being bid up on the \"Wall Street Journal\" report again that these two are in talks, Liz, about a possible deal. That'll be very, very interesting.</p><p>CLAMAN: Maybe making that deal. Wouldn't that be interesting to see?</p><p>MCSHANE: That would be up.</p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you very much, Connell. For more on this possible deal between IBM and Sun Microsystems I'm joined by Emerald Asset Management's Joe Besecker, and president of Penn Financial Group, Matt McCall.</p><p>Joe, you wake up and you find out...</p><p>JOE BESECKER, EMERALD ASSET MANAGEMENT: A jab, a jolt.</p><p>CLAMAN: The jab, a jolt. Seriously? IBM the sleepy -- not sleepy but the more serious sort of button-down company going for the mavericky so to speak?</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>BESECKER: I just like the fact that business is being done out there. We're back to doing business.</p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you.</p><p>BESECKER: We're not talking about -- listen, that's the thing. IBM is taking advantage of opportunities that exist out there. You know, Mark Twain once said he was rarely able to spot an opportunity until it ceased to be one. And so, maybe now the companies will start to pay -- get out from under their desks, start to look for business and do business. And that's what I'm excited about.</p><p>Whether or not this is the best deal for IBM or maybe the market's (ph) thing and maybe they could have gotten it a little bit cheaper?</p><p>CLAMAN: Exactly that. I'm wondering, are they overpaying in this market? Aren't you supposed to beat somebody down to their last dollar?</p><p>MATT MCCALL, PRESIDENT, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP: You are but you figure, Sun already fell 71 percent in the last year. So maybe it has been beaten down already paying at $10 a share, whatever it may be $6.5 billion. I don't think that is that bad. I actually think they are getting a pretty good deal.</p><p>And what I love about this is the synergy that it creates between the two companies. But I think we're going to see a lot more mergers going on in the coming months that creates synergies and using...</p><p>BESECKER: I hope so.</p><p>MCCALL: ...and using its beaten down prices and as Joe said this is a good sign, I think, for the market.</p><p>CLAMAN: Both make corporate systems. And I think that that's something that these corporations who don't depend specifically on Microsoft Windows, for example, are very interested in seeing who gets nervous over this. Is it Hewlett-Packard, the big competitor?</p><p>BESECKER: Go back to what I'm saying. Now it puts us in a position where people start to think strategically about business again. How do we deploy money? How do we go out and do things?</p><p>So yes, I think Hewlett-Packard has to be concerned about this. I think in general, IBM does a lot of service business. I think this will add to the service. And they penetrate different areas they may not have had.</p><p>It appears to get customers and get customers cheaply and that's what they're doing because that customer base is an annuity that brings all that money in. Oracle reports today or tomorrow, that is the only thing that's going to go well for them. And so you want to have growth as well and I think they'll get a growth opportunity...</p><p>CLAMAN: Sources, by the way, say this, of course, could still fall apart. So we caution people to make sure they understand that but what about regulatory hurdles, Matt? These are two gigantic companies that could eliminate some of the little guys out there.</p><p>MCCALL: And it probably will. The thing is though, Sun has lost a lot of market share over the last couple of years. So I think they'll be able to get through the hurdles.</p><p>And I think HP gets hurt the most because when you think about it HP actually had a chance to buy Sun. In the last year they went to them and they turned them down and now IBM is jumping on that after the price fell a bit more. So I think IBM is being pro-active here looking forward or HP's kind of sitting back waiting for the business to come to them.</p><p>CLAMAN: What is the best possible sense that you make specifically I think for other suitors? Anybody -- you know Matt has talked about Hewlett-Packard. They're not going to come back maybe and start fighting, would they?</p><p>BESECKER: Why wouldn't they? I mean if they really thought -- depending on price. I think that is why the price is what it is. We don't know the price because it has not been announced. We just hear rumors. But if the price is there, I think that's one of the reasons that they came out with a good best offer.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm with Joe Besecker right now because I'd look at this and I say we have some deals going.</p><p>BESECKER: Exactly.</p><p>CLAMAN: So what is the next digital deal that might be done?</p><p>MCCALL: You know, I'm actually going to go away from digital because I don't know if it is going to be as much in technology. I think the more deals are going to be in biotech. I think we're going to have a huge boom in the second half where large pharma with no pipelines are going to start picking up a lot biotech companies. And I think that's going to be one of the biggest sectors and one of the biggest drivers of this market in the second half of the year.</p><p>CLAMAN: How does the average investor get in on something like that in advance?</p><p>BESECKER: Carefully. Because we still have a lot of land mines out there. You look at the companies -- I actually think the play is, and we were talking a little bit earlier, some of these companies that have platforms that they can add things to might be the better place than trying to guess which ones are the ones that are acquired because if you're not acquired and you run out of cash, it is kind of an all or nothing and minor event.</p><p>So that's in the (INAUDIBLE) I agree with you 100 percent, that's why we buy a basket. If you have muss (ph), you can buy a basket or you can buy one of the -- you have to do a lot of homework and that's why...</p><p>MCCALL: And you never buy a company just on the anticipation of being taken over. You never do that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Right. Never. Never do that.</p><p>Well, let the sun shine in. We have ourselves a deal here.</p><p>BESECKER: We have business. That's right. We have business.</p><p>CLAMAN: We have business going Joe and Matt. Thank you very much.</p><p>Coming up, let's take a check of today's news headlines. The latest -- did you hear about this? This tragic ski trip taken by one of Broadway's leading actresses, we will be talking about that in a moment.</p><p>And the company behind Cheerios, Betty Crocker and Haagen-Dazs -- General Mills planning to take one dinner table favorite out of the food roster? You get to guess -- I guarantee you, unless you grew up on one of those organic farms which, I went Berkeley and all about that. You ate this product, they're taking it out of the mix.</p><p>Get ready to cry. We'll get a closer look when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GREY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Gavin Grey, standing in for Ashley Webster in London and a quick look at the markets straight off.</p><p>Let's start off in Germany with the Dax, that's been leading the way this morning, I'm pleased to say. And it's still doing very well; up almost 60 points at 4,045 that's up almost 1.5 percent. Moving across to Paris, the CAC, that's also doing pretty well; up 0.9 of a percent at 2,792. And lastly the FTSE; that spent most of this morning in negative territory but it's just crept positive, up almost seven points at 3,863.</p><p>All of those figures despite some pretty bad news on the unemployment front that's come out just within the last hour or two. And that is that unemployment in the U.K. has now topped 2 million; that is about 6.5 percent of the working population. Figures due to get much worse however and indeed it is the rate of the rise that is worrying most people.</p><p>Two million is the worst it's been since 1997. But the rate of the rise has been the fastest increase for a couple of decades, so a bit worrying there for the government and plenty of dire predictions following on from that.</p><p>The Royal Bank of Scotland, next. That's the bank that's been almost bought out by the government; two-thirds now owned by the U.K. taxpayer. But optimistic comments from the chairman who says that the banks benefited from buoyant corporate banking activity and has noted increased business as a resulting corporate debt issuance and equity underwriting -- so a positive note there.</p><p>Homeowners though, well those with mortgages -- that is not such clever news because indeed it has been estimated now that in the last year, the number of people who have fallen into arrears with their mortgage has risen a third and that is obviously worrying and that, of course, despite those on track of mortgages noticing a sharp decline in the monthly repayment. So very worrying for them, too.</p><p>A quick look at the dollar and the currencies, it is down against the euro, 1.30 to the dollar. And the pound there, it is up against the pound and 1 pound is now going to cost around $1.39.</p><p>Back to you Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Thank you very much. Good morning once again everyone.</p><p>We are taking a look at some of the top news stories of the day.</p><p>China rejecting Coca-Cola's bid to buy a major Chinese juice maker breaking up what would have been the largest ever foreign take over of a Chinese company. China's commerce ministry rejecting the $2.5 billion bid for the Huiyuan Juice Group saying Coke's buy out would potentially squeeze out smaller players.</p><p>This development comes as China recently enacted stronger anti-monopoly law so big question about whether this is an isolated event or something that other businesses should be concerned about.</p><p>Actress, Natasha Richardson is hospitalized, in critical condition after a skiing accident in Montreal. Richardson was flown back to New York City for medical treatment after suffering a serious head injury during a beginner's ski lesson. Members of Richardson's family have gathered near her bedside now. And Richardson, by the way, is the wife of actor Liam Neeson. She's an accomplished actress, though; she won a Tony award for her 1998 performance in Cabaret.</p><p>Back to business news now, Dunkin Donuts is going back to its roots. Years after the company ran ads featuring Fred the baker saying it is time to make the donuts, the company's advertising its doughnuts again. It will launch a new $10 million campaign. In the recent years the company has focused more on coffee and breakfast sandwiches in its advertising and the coolest part of this campaign though is a Design Your Own Donut contest. Yes, you got it, customers can design their own donuts on the company's Web site. A winner will be chosen in June and be sold in the company's 8,000 stores. So start designing, get to it.</p><p>You're up to date here on the Fox Business Network. Remember foxbusiness.com is where you want to go throughout the day.</p><p>And coming up advertising sales may be down but Charles Payne is still promoting one ad company's stock. He'll explain why next.</p><p>We'll have much more on the outrage over AIG and its millions and millions in bonuses. AIG chairman, of course, Ed Liddy headed to Capitol Hill today to appear before a house committee. He's going to be answering some tough questions. So we want to know what would you ask him?</p><p>Send us an e-mail at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email> We'll share some of your thoughts a little later on in the show. We'll be right back with more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FBN ANCHOR: Thirty minutes after the hour. So glad you're with us on this special edition of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST, \"AIG, America's Outrage.\" I'm Liz Claman. Alexis Glick is off today.</p><p>We're going to have more on the growing anger over the failed insurer's decision to give out bonuses, millions and millions of dollars in bonuses to some people who actually don't even work there anymore.</p><p>And if you've seen the markets lately, up six of the last seven days. Not bad at all. Let's take a look at how they're shaping up with the futures. A little bit of weakness here at the moment. We actually had some decent numbers out of Asia overnight. The Hang Seng did pretty well, up more than 1 percent.</p><p>But for -- our futures here, we're down for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. NASDAQ just popped in to positive territory to the upside and S&amp;P futures have come up off of their lows in the last half hour. They were down about 4 points, but right now down 2.20.</p><p>The company behind breakfast staples like Wheaties and Cheerios, you know, you've eaten it all. You know you ate Count Chocula growing up, admit it. General Mills, out with 3rd quarter earnings this morning, coming in at $0.79 excluding items, missing analysts' expectations of $0.88 per share.</p><p>As consumers cut costs, food makers are cutting unprofitable businesses. So to that end, I'm stunned. Did you -- Jenna, Jenna cannot believe it. General Mills says it will no longer make, excuse me for a moment, Pillsbury frozen dinner rolls. They're gone, folks.</p><p>I -- Charles Payne is speechless.</p><p>For more on this I'm enjoined by Jennifer Niemela of the St. Paul Business Journal and Erin Smith, an analyst with the Argus Research Company. We're all stunned and shocked today.</p><p>Good evening, (INAUDIBLE) our way, but first Pillsbury dough rolls are no longer going to be available.</p><p>Erin, let's start with the numbers here. They missed but they also guided higher for the year. They're upping their guidance. I find that interesting. What do you pick out of this report?</p><p>ERIN SMITH, ARGUS RESEARCH COMPANY ANALYST: Well, they actually mentioned that cost inflation is supposed to improve in the next -- not bit high at next quarter, and I think that's a big benefit. And our estimates for the 3rd quarter is actually below consensus so they actually came in just a little bit below our estimates. We expected the 4th quarter would be a little bit stronger.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jennifer, last week General Mills announced it will no longer make, as I said, these Pillsbury frozen dinner rolls and they've actually decided to sell the frozen dough portion of its bakeries and food service. So they're shedding this part of it. Why? Why has the company decided to drop this part of their business?</p><p>JENNIFER NIEMELA, ST. PAUL BUSINESS JOURNAL REPORTER: Well, when I talked to General Mills they mentioned that they're really trying to focus on some of their strengths and like a lot of food companies, they are trying to trim out some of the less profitable parts of their business.</p><p>So those are the reasons that they gave me. And yes, they sold it to a company called Pennant Foods. They sold four of their factories, shed about 60 positions. So they are focusing on cutting their costs right now.</p><p>CLAMAN: Erin, what impact, do you think, the sale will have on General Mills' future? I thought it was so iconic. I can't let go of this. I...</p><p>SMITH: Well, I do like their Pillsbury rolls.</p><p>CLAMAN: It's dinner -- exactly.</p><p>SMITH: But at the same time, Pillsbury division has been -- hasn't been performing as well as some of their other divisions. Cereals been very strong, yogurt and soup. So I can understand. I think long term this is a good strategy to try to revitalize that -- the Pillsbury brand over the past year. And it's probably -- I assumed that it hasn't been doing as well.</p><p>CLAMAN: But Jennifer, we've got to get to the stronger dollar aspect of this because clearly a strong dollar hurts a global company that has an international footprint. Right now we're looking at a dollar that seems to be doing well. General Mills operates in about 100 different companies. Does this hurt them going forward? They must not think it's going to really pressure them because they're upping the guidance for the full year.</p><p>NIEMELA: Right. Well, they have been focusing a lot on cutting their costs. And here in the twin cities, they have decreased their work force by about 2 percent so I think going forward they're pretty optimistic.</p><p>The CEO also mentioned that while commodity prices have been up, he does expect those to go down once the recession ends. So I think that they're optimistic going forward and that makes sense.</p><p>CLAMAN: Erin, everybody says go for consumer staple companies and healthcare because those are the two things people won't cut back on. These earnings indicate that even if people continue to buy these products, costs are higher. We don't know where commodities are going. It's obviously a real challenge to operate a company like this.</p><p>Is it all about the management and how smart they are as far as organic growth is concerned? And specifically, cuts in the way they operate?</p><p>SMITH: I think that's very important and I also think if you look at the company's brand and if they have leading brands, what kind of types of products? General Mills have a very strong portfolio of affordable brands for consumers. General mixes, soup and cereals. So you have to look at what they're offering.</p><p>CLAMAN: And Jennifer, we spoke about how General Mills is cutting costs by selling some of those less profitable brands. How many have cut costs, say for example, by laying employees off and what does General Mills employment situation look like?</p><p>NIEMELA: Well, here in the twin cities we have seen -- actually some of our larger companies including Cargill, another big food company here, have actually increased their work force over the past year. But General Mills has decreased their -- over 2008 they decreased by about 1.8 percent. Their employment here. So they are focusing on cutting their costs.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jennifer and Erin...</p><p>NIEMELA: In that way as well.</p><p>CLAMAN: We're going to wrap it there. Once again General Mills, missing estimates but upping their guidance for the full year numbers.</p><p>We thank you very much for coming in. We've actually got some breaking news.</p><p>Connell, what do you have for us?</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Liz, we talked about the Coke story. You may have heard us talk about the fact that this deal had been rejected by the Chinese government for Coke to buy a juice company in China for $2.5 billion.</p><p>Well, the company itself has actually come out with some comments here in the last few minutes crossing on the wire from Coca-Cola. They're saying they're not going to pursue this. This Huiyuan deal, that's the name of the company, in China, the juice company. They're not going to pursue it after the government had rejected it.</p><p>So they're not going to press this anymore. They said they were disappointed about the rejection that came out of the Chinese government, but they rejected -- they, I should say, they respect the decision and they're going to focus on growing existing brands in China with a long-term view of the Chinese market.</p><p>So, again, Coca-Cola after being rejected by the Chinese government for an attempt to $2.5 billion acquisition of a major juice company in China now says that's it. we respect your decision, we're not going to pursue it any further.</p><p>Interesting story. We'll continue to follow it and all the political ramifications, all the rest of it throughout the day. But right now it is time for \"Charles' Choice.\" It's down to Charles Payne in the studio.</p><p>What do you have, Charles?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks, Connell. Well, you know, first, no more dinner rolls and now Coke being knocked down in China, bad news. But I'm going to stick with this China thing, Connell, because two of the three stocks I'm watching are actually based in China.</p><p>The first is Focus Media. That was the tease that Jenna Lee gave you. I've got to tell you, folks, someone just opened some biscuits in the background. The stock has won some pretty good support right around the $5 area so I like it on the downside.</p><p>Listen, Wall Street expects this company to earn $1.48 in the fiscal '09 and it's trading at $5.90. If it traded at ten times book, I mean the stock would be somewhere right around here so this is really one of these stocks that has a lot of room to the upside. A little on the downside. Nevertheless, I consider it a high-risk play, although yesterday my high-risk play is still soft, which is up 25 percent. A 15 percent after the open.</p><p>OK. A little risky in my opinion is NetEase. It's another Chinese plate. It's a Web portal, offers online communities and e-commerce services, a lot of games. One of the things we're starting to see here with this stock is look at that trend. Upbrilled (ph), nice here, looks really, really great. On the cusp of a major, major break out. I've mentioned this stock several times in the past. I think you want to have exposure to China. This is one of my top three plays in China along with Baidu and Sohu.</p><p>And finally, Simon Property Group. This is my contrarian play of the day, if you will. We were short to stock at Wall Street strategies, WStreet.com, for a long time. And indeed it came down but it was really tough. It didn't come down and it showed a lot of resolve if you will.</p><p>The stock is on a verge of a major breakout here. I like this -- use 29 and 1/2 if you do this stock as an idea -- as a stop-loss. And I have an exclusive pick. Go to FOXBusiness.com/MoneyforBreakfast. It's a controversial company.</p><p>Coming up, folks, we're going to see which of your favorite brands have the strength to carry their companies through the downturn. And a border war is brewing. It can cost you and our economy billions of dollars. Details just ahead when we come back with more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: This morning the Obama administration is preparing to send more federal agents to the Mexican border in a move to stop the flow of drugs and rash of kidnappings that is plaguing the Mexican border. This comes as the Obama administration not only copes with the drug war, but now possibly a trade war as well.</p><p>Folks, trade wars only exacerbated the Great Depression but is this all mean? And Mexico says, well, if you do that, we're going to impose tariffs on U.S. imports and produce and products, such as, and we're just getting this information because before we weren't sure what the products where, sunglasses, toilet paper, pet food and soy sauce.</p><p>I think Christmas trees were thrown in there as well.</p><p>This move is on the heels of Washington banning Mexican trucks from pretty much free access of the U.S. roads which Mexico says violate NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p><p>Drugs, tariffs, kidnappings, and that's all after we, the United States, gave Mexico $10 billion in aid.</p><p>Boy, what do we make of all of this? For more now I'm joined by Todd Spencer. He's the executive vice president of the Owner, Operator Independent Drivers Association. And Jim Roberts, a research fellow with the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>Welcome to you both.</p><p>Jim, what exactly did the U.S. remove, take away? And how is Mexico retaliating?</p><p>JIM ROBERTS, HERITAGE FOUNDATION RESEARCH FELLOW: Well, you know, this is one trade dispute where, to pardon the express, the rubber is really meeting the road. To judge the Obama administration by their rhetoric, you would think that they understand that the only way to increase prosperity for Americans and grow our economy is to expand trade opportunities, not contract them.</p><p>They understand that protectionism in the 1930s made the depression worst. And yet we have to judge them by their actions. And so far their actions have been to cave in to protectionists on the left, big labor, first in the stimulus package with the Buy America provisions, now in this omnibus bill, they've killed a pilot program with Mexico by defunding it, that had -- had allowed the Mexican government to put off filing this action that they have a legal right to do under NAFTA...</p><p>CLAMAN: OK.</p><p>ROBERTS: ... to put tariffs on some of our products.</p><p>CLAMAN: Somebody who feels completely different about this is Tom Spencer.</p><p>Todd, how does the elimination of this program, which, in essence if I understand it correctly, allowed Mexican 18-wheelers unfettered access back and forth across the border to the U.S. delivering all kinds of goods? How does this benefit you, the U.S. trucker and more valuable than the challenges and the costs of the tariffs?</p><p>TODD SPENCER, OWNER OPERATOR INDEPENDENT DRIVERS ASSOC.: Liz, it's amazing their comments, the rhetoric coming from the other side on this issue. The arbitration panel that looked at this issue, several years ago said the U.S. was totally within its rights to establish safety systems and insists on safety systems that would assure safety on our highways.</p><p>Those systems have not been in place, they have not -- they are simply not functional. This feigned outrage about protectionism is simply rhetoric. This is not a new issue. Congress, both sides of Congress have been outraged, concerned about the prospect of an unequal playing field in terms of safety and security all the way back to 2001.</p><p>They've insisted our system was being put in place. They haven't been put in place. And it would be foolhardy, idiotic for us to open our highways any other way.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jim, why do I -- Jim, why do I want Mexican truck drivers if they're not insured, if it hasn't had the proper safeguards attached to this program? Why do I want them on the road here in America? We've got enough problems of our own.</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, you wouldn't want drivers like that on our roads but those aren't the drivers that have been participating in this program. In fact, they have had a better safety records than our own companies. These drivers are well trained and you want them because American consumers are paying $400 more per year in products imported from Mexico because of this additional uploading and reloading and warehouses within the 25-mile limit of the border.</p><p>That's just adding costs to American consumers just to featherbed some jobs for the teamsters and improve teamster dues, but it's hurting the American consumer and it's hurting our relations with Mexico and our economy.</p><p>CLAMAN: Todd, is it all about the teamsters flexing their muscle?</p><p>SPENCER: Not in the least. The overwhelming majority, 90 percent of truckers are small business entities, people that own 10 or fewer trucks. These are the people that are actually on the frontlines economically. They're on the frontlines for highway safety and they're the ones that actually are being disadvantaged by this unleveled playing field and actually risks at the border.</p><p>How many segments are we going to talk about how crazy, how lawless it is on that side? And we're going to say...</p><p>CLAMAN: But you understand, Todd -- you understand that any kind of tariffs that are imposed now which is what the Mexicans are doing for our goods, we get a little bit of a trade war going here, at a time when -- our economy is rough, hard you, sort of justify that with what the boobs (ph) are.</p><p>SPENCER: That makes no sense whatsoever. Mexico has benefited so much from trade with the U.S. I mean, they'd be cutting off their nose to spite their face...</p><p>CLAMAN: OK.</p><p>SPENCER: ... to do something idiotic like that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jim, let me give you the last word here. Mexico gets $10 billion in aid from us. They're a mess. The State Department is encouraging people not to travel to Mexico right now because of the drug wars. And now this?</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, certainly parts of northern Mexico are dangerous but other parts of Mexico are if you take precautions but I would say this trucking program would have improved and will improve border security because there are fewer opportunities for drugs and cash to move south and empty trucks if the trucks are loaded. And so it seems to me that this makes more sense and always economically and with national security.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, the discussion and conversation will continue.</p><p>Todd and Jim, thank you for being a part of it right here on FOX. Thank you so much.</p><p>SPENCER: Thank you, Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: Now let's get over to Charles Payne. Charles, what do you have?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, Liz, Starbucks holds its annual shareholders meeting today in Seattle and it's one of the many brands battling this downward economy. And it's clearly been hurt in an annual core brand power ranking. So last year Starbucks ranked number 10 out of 20 and this year's survey, it slipped down to 214.</p><p>With a look at who's the king of the brand world, I'm joined by Jim Gregory, the CEO of CoreBrand, and Matt McCall, the president of the Penn Financial Group.</p><p>Jim, I want to start with you. I just mentioned Starbucks a minute ago. Obviously the economy has had an impact but has the company made a lot of mistakes as well?</p><p>JIM GREGORY, COREBRAND CEO: Certainly. You know, it's important to understand that the brand is -- might be doing well, but the underlying financial fundamentals are not more important than the brand.</p><p>PAYNE: I don't get what that means, though.</p><p>GREGORY: I'm sorry. I said that incorrectly, but the brand is very important but the underlying financial fundamentals are more important than the brands, so even though the brand is quite strong, it's not more important than the company getting out of whack, so to speak.</p><p>PAYNE: Let's start now with your top five. We're going to start with the number five on your brand rankings. Campbell Soup. What makes this so good?</p><p>GREGORY: It's a great brand. When you have a brand that stands for one thing, for nourishment for so many decades and mm-hmm good concept is so clear in everyone's mind, you know that it's a really highly focused food company. And they are really focused on three major areas, simple mills, baked snacks and healthy beverages.</p><p>And so that's a very complex company simplified.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, Matt, it's interesting because Peter Lindt (ph) said buy what you know. And obviously everybody knows Campbell Soup but there is somewhat of a disconnect between a great brand and a great investment.</p><p>What do you think about Campbell as an investment?</p><p>MATT MCCALL, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP PRESIDENT: I really don't like his investment. It's gotten crushed. It hit a five-year low just recently, and it's not really growth story. You won't be looking grow stocks now. And I think they've really gotten hurt by private label. People are shopping at Wal-Mart, getting their groceries there. They're going to go for the private label brand versus the Campbell brand...</p><p>PAYNE: Wal-Mart just said they're going to actually increase that strategy.</p><p>Jim, let's go to number four, Hershey Foods. Why is this a premiere brand? </p><p>GREGORY: Well, first of all, it's one of the original companies that we're involved in corporate social responsibility. The voting shares of the company are controlled by the Hershey trust and that's for the benefit of the Milton Hershey School for Disadvantaged Children. So they do well by doing good and it's a great company. Again, very consistent brand over time.</p><p>Also, it's important to realize that they are no longer the king of candy. Mars has taken that with the acquisition of Wrigley's.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>GREGORY: So they're not quite as strong as they were.</p><p>PAYNE: So...</p><p>GREGORY: But they do have a great brand.</p><p>PAYNE: So Jim, let's go to the other end of the political correctness - - spectrum, if you will. Harley-Davidson, number three. Why is this still such a powerful brand?</p><p>GREGORY: Well, this is one of my favorite brands and it's done so well over time. When you think about Harley-Davidson in 1990 when we started our corporate branding index, they were near bankruptcy. They have improved consistently over time and they are -- have reached the pinnacle of our brand ranking of 1,200 companies.</p><p>So one of the concerns I have about Harley-Davidson is they are -- might be expanding too much. They have over 35 different models and it's almost what I call the GM syndrome. They want to be all things to all people. That's not the way that -- to continue to expand their brand.</p><p>PAYNE: And of course, Jim, too, household names Johnson &amp; Johnson number 2, and number one, Coca-Cola. What do you think? How come this is still such a powerful brand?</p><p>GREGORY: Well, Coca-cola has been the number one soft drink in the world, of course, and in our corporate branding index has been number one since 1997. They -- even in down markets, they continue to invest in the brands. They've launched Coca-Cola Zero this year as well as their open happiness advertising campaign.</p><p>They understand how to grow their brand even in a down market and that's quite impressive.</p><p>PAYNE: Matt, three -- everyone knows HOG, though, hit a high, 75 November of 2006. It's come straight down. Would you even consider buying the stock here?</p><p>MCCALL: I would not. And that's something where -- that was the dream for the middle class. The middle class is struggling right now so the last thing they'll do is going to be throwing $25,000 at a discretionary item such as a HOG.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, Johnson &amp; Johnson at number two on the list. It's a consistent player. They're probably out there looking for acquisitions right now. It's a core stock in a lot of folks' portfolio. It's been hit. OK, what do you think about it?</p><p>MCCALL: I love it. I ought to call my clients right now and this is more than just a consumer Johnson &amp; Johnson you see at the grocery story. The medical device, there's the pharmaceuticals, great diverse company and has some cash as well.</p><p>PAYNE: At least we got one buy out of you. Thanks a lot, Matt.</p><p>Jim, thank you very much. Really appreciate it.</p><p>Coming up, folks, we're going to into the pit and read some of the e- mails that you have been sending us about AIG. More MONEY FOR BREAKFAST when we return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: I mean, we still cannot believe that General Mills is getting rid of the Pillsbury dinner rolls, the frozen rolls. We opened it. I was banging this thing like I was a monkey and then it popped open and freaked me out. But I think we should bronze this because they're not going to ...</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: They're collector's item.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: It is.</p><p>LEE: Put that on eBay.</p><p>PAYNE: Actually you shouldn't have opened that one. You probably should have put it in a vault somewhere, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Put it on eBay.</p><p>LEE: I bet it were last in the universe.</p><p>PAYNE: But they're keeping their dinner rolls, I mean, the flaky biscuits.</p><p>CLAMAN: That's right. I mean if you grew up having the three can stew and the tuna casserole like we did, you know, every -- every other Tuesday, tuna casserole, you have to have the dinner rolls.</p><p>We have been asking you all morning long for your take on the bonus backlash over at AIG. Let's see what you have to say. We've been getting hundreds of e-mails.</p><p>David Medas (ph) says, quote, \"You should only get a bonus when produce above the job requirements.\" He says AIG executives failed to produce to meet their requirements of their contract goals but failed far below their goals nullifying any bonuses.</p><p>See, I like David. Because aren't there two sides to a contract? Why were AIG executives pay bonus when they lost money?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, I think one of the problems is we have not actually seen the contract themselves. That might be great if we could get a chance to see what those contracts were.</p><p>CLAMAN: I called a lot of lawyers last night, and they said Liz, got to see the contract</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: Let me see the contract. But good for you, David. I like that.</p><p>LEE: They're not alone, too. A lot of CEOs got paid on Wall Street that maybe didn't deserve it.</p><p>Next question, well anyways. Sean Webb says, \"I would like to know if all these politicians are going to give back the contributions they received from these Wall Street crooks.\"</p><p>CLAMAN: Good point.</p><p>LEE: I think, Charles, you have a list there.</p><p>PAYNE: God, are you kidding me? The list from the Center of Responsible Politics. I left it outside. Amazing. Chris Dodd at the top, $280,000.</p><p>CLAMAN: But Republicans also peppering this list as well.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: They were seated at the top 10. There were six Democrats and four Republicans. And by the way, they did a great job hedging themselves. They had all the presidential candidates.</p><p>Dook Barela (ph) of Riverside, California says, \"The AIG bonuses are unacceptable. Our congressional representatives have no excuse for overlooking this AIG bonus when they hadn't taken the time to read the stimulus bill before passing it nor our president for signing it.\"</p><p>Everyone, obviously, should have some outrage towards Congress. There's no doubt about. Another $30 billion a week ago.</p><p>CLAMAN: Henry Paulson shoved this thing -- Henry Paulson, George Bush and Congress shoved this.</p><p>PAYNE: But just a week ago, they got another 30 billion, Liz. Someone else has to take responsibility.</p><p>CLAMAN: We got another e-mail. Richard Suttmeier, he's a frequest guest. Hi, Richard (INAUDIBLE) from ValueEngine.com, saying, \"You can't break employment contracts after the fact. Our Ivy League bank regulatory geniuses who bought 80 percent of AIG on behalf of U.S. taxpayers lacked the common sense to void all employment agreements.\" </p><p>PAYNE: You know what, what it...</p><p>CLAMAN: Renegotiate, Richard. Not void.</p><p>PAYNE: A bankruptcy would have renegotiated it as well, too. But you know what, on that note, Richard, I'm glad you're watching. We can also use the tax code as a weapon. I think that's going to be a big mistake if we go that road.</p><p>CLAMAN: Gang, we love the comments. You can keep them coming. We're getting hundreds of them. Join the crowd here. Send us an e-mail at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@FOXbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@FOXbusiness.com</email> We'll share some of your thoughts in the next hour. It's three minutes until the top of the hour.</p><p>Coming up right after the break, we're talking live to lawmakers including Republican senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas about what she and other lawmakers are doing about the handouts at AIG. We're serving up so much more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. Do not move. I mean you can go brush your teeth but other than that, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: And good morning, everybody. Welcome to hour number two of this special edition of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. The \"AIG, America's Outrage.\" I'm Liz Claman. Alexis Glick is off today. </p><p>We're going to have much more. The growing anger, I mean, each day it's getting worse and worse here among both you the public and lawmakers over the AIG bonuses. This morning we are getting hundreds and hundreds of e-mails. Please we want to hear from you. Specifically, what is it that outrages you so much about this? Is it Congress not having put in stopgaps for these kinds of problems back in September when the first TARP was announced? Is it just being so angry at AIG? Who, where, what? E-mail us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email> and we'll share them a little later in the show. It's very cathartic when you sit down, you e-mail us and maybe we'll read yours and you'll feel better about the anger.</p><p>First, let's get a quick check of the U.S. futures. But, remember, yesterday, the market did wonderfully. Up triple digits for the Dow Jones Industrials. The Dow futures, right now, slightly weaker. S&amp;P, we were trying to make a good of the flat line here. Got down as far as down about 2 points. But now we're down 5.70. The Nasdaq futures down 3.75. Nasdaq had a great double digit gain yesterday.</p><p>But let me send it up to Connell McShane, he's at the Fox Business desk, for some breaking details.</p><p>The IBM deal that isn't yet a deal, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, not yet a deal. But while it's fun to talk about it, isn't it? This morning in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Liz, the possibility being brought up that IBM might buy Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash to do so. It would be about -- would literally be a 100 percent premium over where Sun closed yet. Both stocks, as you might expect, are moving in the pre-market as a result of this speculation.</p><p>Let's first go to IBM, which is down about 3 percent in pre-market trading. It's actually moved under $90 a share. $89.91 is the bid, as you see, on it there. Java, Sun Microsystems, you might also expect that to be higher. It is. Look at that, up to $8.25 a share. So you're talking about a 60 some odd percent gain in the shares of Sun Microsystems. Again, on the speculation this morning that IBM might be a buyer of Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash in order to buy Sun.</p><p>Now, just breaking as we speak and crossing the wires are some headlines out of the Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis. Crossing the wires from \"The Charlotte Observer,\" as a matter of fact. I have not had a lot of time to go over this because they're just crossing, so I'll read a few of them as you look at the B of A stock price.</p><p>Lewis saying that the bank could pay back $45 billion in TARP money, Liz, by late this year or early next year, depending on the economy. So Lewis talking about not taking more money from the government, but paying it back. He says, in addition to that, that the bank expects to be profitable in 2009, absent what he calls an unexpected meltdown. Unexpected meltdown, a quote from Ken Lewis.</p><p>Bank of America saying it could repay the TARP money now if it had to, if it were not maintaining higher than normal capital cushion amid some fragile economic conditions. So it's not able to do it because of that right now, but should be able to do it late this year or early next year, Liz. $45 billion that Bank of America took. The CEO says it will be able to pay it back and it will be profitable in 2009 unless things really go wrong.</p><p>CLAMAN: Fine. Yes, we'll take it. We'll take it.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, we will take it. Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: And that way you don't have to have Congress complaining about your bonuses.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, that's right.</p><p>CLAMAN: If you don't like that . . .</p><p>MCSHANE: Pay whatever you want as long as you don't take government money, right?</p><p>CLAMAN: Exactly. Connell, we'll see you later.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>CLAMAN: As I mentioned, we're taking a closer look at this hour at the outrage that has boiled over about AIG. So let's start with the latest news. Chairman and CEO of American International Group, Edward Liddy, will pull up that chair at a congressional witness table today to take the heat. I mean this could be a blow torch. They are literally going to bring in blow torches because they know the cameras will be on them. The lawmakers will be out there screaming about these bonuses. </p><p>And in the meantime, Congress and the White House are actually trying to find ways to strip bonus recipients of that money. The chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee proposed companies and individuals play a 90 percent plus tax on all retention awards and bonuses over $50,000. And in a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner suggested holding back the bonus amount from upcoming bailout funds for AIG. But the story continues.</p><p>Joining me now for more on Liddy's testimony today are two congressional members. Democratic Congressman Gary Peters of Michigan and Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. Both of them sit on the subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government Sponsored Enterprises, which is holding today's hearings.</p><p>So you both have skin in the game. You'll both be out there. I will start first with Michele Bachmann. And I like that you're both here. And I want to explain to our viewers, Michele is a tax litigation attorney. Gary has a masters in business administration and law degree. So you both understand what perhaps can and could not be done regarding these bonuses. But, Representative Bachmann, what do you hope to learn about AIG's use of federal funds regarding the bonuses and how all the money is being allocated?</p><p>REP. MICHELE BACHMANN, (R) MINNESOTA: Well, there's a number of questions that I think all the members of the committee will have. First of all will be, what is the exit strategy to get the American taxpayer out of AIG and out of these private businesses. We're only beginning to learn where all of the tax money has gone from AIG. At least $20 billion has gone to pay off foreign investors who've invested in AIG. I don't think the American taxpayers signed up to bail out foreign investors. This is an economic quagmire. We need to get the American taxpayer out of bailing out these failed businesses. This is $173 billion plus that we have invested. It's a black hole. I don't think that the American taxpayer should have to pony up any more money for a failed enterprise like AIG.</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Peters, a lot of times you get the American public huddled before the televisions like it's the landing on the moon for these things. Everybody wants to watch it. And all they see is a lot of bloviating. I'm interested to know if there will be fact finding on your behalf. What do you want to find out here?</p><p>REP. GARY PETERS, (D) MICHIGAN: Well, I hope there is fact finding. This should not just be a media circus. We've got a lot of information that we need to find out. Certainly about an exit strategy, which I think are very good questions.</p><p>And in terms of the bonus and compensation, which is the -- what everybody is talking about right now, I think we need to be thinking generally about compensation in these financial firms and looking at those compensation matrix and how those are determined. I think it's -- what is really outrageous to the American public now and myself as well is that you have individuals at AIG, the very individuals that contributed to AIG being brought to their knees, losing billions of dollars, and contributing to this financial mess, getting $160 million in bonuses. Basically these individuals failed and they failed in a spectacular fashion. How could they . . .</p><p>CLAMAN: I want that deal. I want that deal.</p><p>PETERS: How could they be rewarded? Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: I want to be able to fail and get paid so much money.</p><p>PETERS: How could they be awarded, Alexis (ph).</p><p>CLAMAN: Look, no matter what side of the aisle you're on, House Finance Committee Chairman Barney Frank struck a cord yesterday when he said we should approach the AIG situation from the standpoint of the government and the taxpayer being the owner of the company now. Let's listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BARNEY FRANK, HOUSE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I think the time has come to exercise our ownership rights. We own most of the company. And then say, as owner, you know, I'm not paying you the bonus. You didn't perform.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Bachmann, how much leverage does the government realistically have in retrieving these bonuses?</p><p>BACHMANN: Well, we have all the leverage in the world. We do own AIG. And that's exactly the problem. I don't want to have the American taxpayer owning private companies. That's when we get the government into extra constitutional business we have no business being in.</p><p>CLAMAN: But now that we do, now that we do, Representative Bachmann, can we retrieve the bonuses?</p><p>BACHMANN: Sure, we can do anything we want to do. But what we need to do is get out and stop pouring money down a black hole. Just like we should not have the Obama administration running Detroit with GN or Chrysler. This is what will happen. We'll see more of this the more government stays involved in private businesses. We will see more of these fiascos. Government was never designed to run private businesses. We need to get out and we need to return these businesses to the private hands or they need to fail. And we need to be prepared to accept that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Peters, you're the one with the law degree. Is there some type of sort of clause that might enable this to get back the money? Or is this a red herring and do we need to look at what Representative Bachmann is talking about and, ooh, let me say it, let AIG fail? Everybody's so nervous about that and this so-called systemic risk.</p><p>PETERS: Well, first off, let me say that I've proposed a bill that I proposed yesterday that would use the tax code to recover that money for the taxpayers. This money is being paid out and to me the best approach right now would be to put a tax of roughly about 100 percent. That brings that money back to the taxpayers where it belongs.</p><p>It is a bill that only deals with situations where you have substantial investments of taxpayer money in a company. In this case, over $170 billion. And basically my approach is that there shouldn't be any bonuses paid out until the taxpayers are paid back first. After the taxpayers are paid back, the company is free to pay any bonuses they'd like and have any kind of compensation schedule, but they need to pay back the taxpayers first.</p><p>CLAMAN: I just love that.</p><p>BACHMANN: Liz?</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>BACHMANN: Liz?</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p>BACHMANN: The bigger question is, when will we get a pay back of the tranche of $173 billion. This was $165 million that was paid out in bonuses. What about the $173 billion that the taxpayers have already invested into AIG? When will we get paid that money back? It doesn't look like it will be any time soon. And let's not forget, it was the Obama stimulus bill that contains the clause that prohibits the federal government from bringing those bonuses back in. It was a clause slipped in by Chris Dodd.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, it was. Yes, it was.</p><p>BACHMANN: And we members of Congress, we were prevented from reading this bill because we didn't even have the bill online until after midnight. We had to debate at 9:00.</p><p>CLAMAN: And let me end on Representative Peters then. What about Chris Dodd slipping that in that actually allowed these bonuses to be given out? Quickly, if you could.</p><p>PETERS: Well, my understand is the deal's going forward. The bill it says forward (ph) that these bonuses cannot be paid. It wasn't backward looking. It was forward looking. It doesn't prohibit us from doing that now. Now we need to get a solution, bring that money back to the taxpayers and bring it back now.</p><p>BACHMANN: No, it actually does. It actually does (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, I can say this much. That Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, probably wanted something that allowed those bonuses to because he came from Wall Street and he has that mentality that, oh, you can't retain anybody on Wall Street unless you promise them millions in bonuses. Folks, and I'm talking to the viewers now, it is an unspoken word on Wall Street that you get paid $100,000 to $200,000 base salary, but then the promise of the bonus comes through. But usually, as I understand it, to both of you representatives, it's based on performance. And we know the performance with AIG was dismal.</p><p>PETERS: Right. Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: All right. Thanks to both of you, Congress members Gary Peters, Michele Bachmann. We'll be watching both of you today.</p><p>BACHMANN: Thanks so much, Liz. Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: You're welcome. We'll watch you on the hearing.</p><p>Washington isn't the only entity going after AIG. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo looking into taking legal action to try to find justice for you, the American taxpayer, who has kept the company afloat. With a closer look at Cuomo's case against AIG, I'm joined by Leslie Crocker Snyder, a retired New York state supreme court justice and an Manhattan district attorney candidate.</p><p>Nice to see you.</p><p>LESLIE CROCKER SNYDER, RETIRED NY STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: Nice to see you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, we just had all this storm (ph) and drong (ph) and yelling and talking of what can be done.</p><p>SNYDER: Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: You probably are somebody who knows. Can anything be done?</p><p>SNYDER: Well, there are all sorts of solutions that have been proposed, as we've just heard. And we also heard the political spin from each party, which I think we're going to hear a lot of, you know, criticizing the administration, not criticizing the administration.</p><p>CLAMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>SNYDER: My interest is really a legal one. We're all morally outraged. This is a terrible situation. But we have to balance that with the law. So right now we have Attorney General Cuomo, who is looking into whether or not there was any fraud involved in the original contracts.</p><p>CLAMAN: What would fraud look like? Tell us what we should be looking for.</p><p>SNYDER: Well, I guess it would be if people knew that they would never be able to pay out these bonuses because losses were occurring in the derivative section and basically they entered into this with some kind of fraudulent knowledge. It could be a number of things. But remember, basically we do have the rule of law. Contracts are sacrosanct unless there's something wrong with them.</p><p>So we have to look at the other solutions. Can we embarrass these people into not accepting the bonuses? That seems unlikely, but you never know.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, half of them are -- you know, a couple of them are gone and most of them are out in London and these are derivatives traders who probably are kind faceless. We haven't seen any names. Cuomo is trying to get the names.</p><p>SNYDER: Right. But we have to find a legal solution is my point. Maybe the clawback solution where we deduct the millions from the next payout would be a reasonable one. I like that because it seems as if it might have the cloak of law. So as much as we're outraged and we have to find a solution, we have to find a legal solution. And we can't lose sight of that. The public gets morally outraged, but we do operate in a rule of law.</p><p>CLAMAN: Absolutely. Well, in his letter to Congressman Barney Frank, Andrew Cuomo said it appears AIG had far more perhaps that was underneath the actual story, the meat of the issue, and so we perhaps might find more underneath there, but . . .</p><p>SNYDER: Cuomo's lawyers are great. They're going to conduct a terrific investigation. If there's fraud there or something that could undo the bonuses, they'll find it. But if there isn't, then we're going to have to look at, is this contract valid? Is there some other way to approach the situation?</p><p>CLAMAN: Now we don't want to do the old ripage (ph) of the contract. And here on your screen is the actual breakdown here. Top seven executives getting more than $4 million each. I like the 22 with more than $2 million. But the bottom one, 11 of these people who got at least $1 million are no longer at AIG. And you call them retention bonuses. This is a joke. It's an outrage. And it really, I think, hits the crux of the matter.</p><p>SNYDER: But we all feel that way. It's outrageous. And to see these people leave when they supposedly were being paid this to stay is even more outrageous. But at the same time, what I'm saying is, there is a legal solution here, we just don't know what it is yet. We're going to find that legal solution. You can't start tearing up valid contracts because then any time one side said, oh this is a bad contract by public policy. Let's just unilaterally rip it up.</p><p>CLAMAN: But if it says -- but if the contract says you have to perform a job, surely the job wasn't to put the company in the toilet.</p><p>SNYDER: I agree with that. So you have to look technically at that contract and find a way out of it. You can't just rip it up. </p><p>CLAMAN: Anybody have a copy? Anybody have a copy of these contracts? We'll take it.</p><p>SNYDER: We'll find a way, I am sure, whatever it is. It might be the clawback.</p><p>CLAMAN: Leslie Crocker Snyder, former New York state supreme justice, former prosecutor, I might add as well.</p><p>SNYDER: As well, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Tough, tough woman sitting next to me.</p><p>SNYDER: Oh, I've got a soft side, really, just not for AIG. </p><p>CLAMAN: I know. I don't think many Americans do. Thank you for coming in.</p><p>SNYDER: Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: We have some breaking news from \"The New York Post.\" AIG is trying to sell its 66-story headquarters in Manhattan for $100 million. The firm may also try and sell 72 Wall Street, that's the union which represents Dorman and Porters (ph). And that may be the potential buyer. \"The Post\" is owned by our parent company News Corp., but this goes back to Bear Stearns and the whole headquarters issue. What do you do with the building? They could sell it and make some money there.</p><p>SNYDER: Possibility.</p><p>CLAMAN: Then how do they run the business?</p><p>SNYDER: That's another question.</p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you, Leslie, very much.</p><p>Keep the e-mails coming folks, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>Coming up, major news on the tech front. If you're just waking up, we've got reports that IBM is ready to make a massive deal that could move the tech sector -- huge -- with a big name that was so hot during the dot-com go-go era.</p><p>And later on Fox Business, I'll have an exclusive interview with AutoNation President Mike Maroone. AutoNation preparing to make a major announcement today. It involves anyone buying a car from them. They are the nation's largest auto dealer. Wait till you hear this news, exclusively at 3:30 p.m. on a count down to the closing bell right here with me and the rest of the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Stay tuned. Much more coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: So we've got some major tech headlines this morning. This is fun. Action here in the business world. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that IBM is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems. Yes, Java, big blue could pay $6.5 billion in cash. And then Oracle, the software giant, releasing earnings today after the bell. Fox Business' Shibani Joshi joining me now with more.</p><p>What do you want to start with? There's just so many good stories.</p><p>SHIBANI JOSHI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: I know, there's so much god stuff. It's great stuff.</p><p>Well, let's talk about this big merger going on today. IBM potentially buying Sun Microsystems in cash, $6.5 billion. Now, Sun Microsystems has been long called an acquisition target for many, many years. IBM, Dell, HP, all the names that are being throwing out there or have been thrown out there that could potentially be interested in the company. IBM apparently in the works of making a move out there. And you can see what the stock price of Sun is, about $5, and the deal would be actually double the stock price right now. IBM trying to become more of the Wal- Mart of the technology industry. The one-stop shop. The place that you go to for hardware and software. It's just so big . . .</p><p>CLAMAN: That's 100 percent premium for that price.</p><p>JOSHI: One hundred percent premium. But this stock price has been battered. And it's a $5 stock. And as you mentioned, it was the darling of the technology sector when the boom happened. No longer, though.</p><p>CLAMAN: Interesting. And let's go to Oracle.</p><p>JOSHI: Oracle. Great company. This -- the earnings are coming out after the close today. You know, this company's interesting because, look, there's no such thing as recession resistant in this industry, recession proof, but this company's very recession resistant in the fact a lot of their revenues and their sales are recurring. So they've locked in contracts. They have a licensed business. And basically they have recurring revenue coming in month after month after month.</p><p>CLAMAN: Keep this chart up. Keep this chart up. Everybody look at it right now. It's rare to see any 52-week chart where there isn't a massive drop off. Look at Oracle. Not necessarily at its 52-week highs, but it's not that far from it, at least halfway. And this -- I find that interesting. They're doing business properly in a tough climate.</p><p>JOSHI: Right. And that's because of this recurring revenue phenomenon that the company has. The company's also been doing some amazing cost cutting initiatives. Also been buying back stocks. So that's helped to stabilize earnings per share.</p><p>Overall, people expecting 32 cents a share. Probably going to come in line. Friedman Billings and Ramsey thinks it's going to come in a little bit under. But even still, this company is -- this is one of the companies you want to bet on to stay more stabilized in whatever is going to happen over the next six to nine months.</p><p>CLAMAN: I find it fascinating the Nasdaq had a great day yesterday.</p><p>JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Up double digits.</p><p>JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Is it tech stocks that will lead us out of this recession?</p><p>JOSHI: It's so hard to say because a lot of people say, yes, because these companies are cash rich, they're debt less or debt low. And they're innovating. You know want, it's so remarkable, and what I always talk about when I'm at the Nasdaq is, this is the stuff that you want to watch and pay attention to in these very volatile times. These companies are starting to play offense. We've got Microsoft, IBM, Cisco all making big announcements. They're coming out and investing just (ph) for the long term.</p><p>CLAMAN: Shibani Joshi is your woman when those numbers come out. Thank you very much.</p><p>JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Coming up, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas joining us live to talk about what lawmakers are doing to get money back from AIG. And that is now your money.</p><p>And California here he comes. President Obama heading to the golden state today. We'll tell you what's on tap there.</p><p>Much more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST on the way. We're so happy you're joining us this Tuesday morning -- Wednesday. Wednesday.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Gavin Gray in London, standing in this week for Ashley Webster.</p><p>A check on the European markets so far. Let's start where, well, where it's best, I'm afraid. The only bit of green on the board. Frankfurt DAX up 17 points just over the 4,000 barrier there. That a rise of about 0.4 percent. To Paris. I'm afraid the CAC 40 has come down now. It did start the morning in positive territory. But down almost five points. And over to the FTSE, which only for a few moments went into green. It spent the rest of the day in red and it's currently there, down almost 30 points.</p><p>And a little bit about unemployment today. We've had the figures out. Unemployment up to over 2 million in the U.K. That's about 6.5 percent of the workforce. It was a step rise and one that's caused a bit of a shock over here.</p><p>Back to you, Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.</p><p>Good morning, once again, everyone. We're going to update you here on the AIG saga.</p><p>AIG's CEO Ed Liddy ready to face the music on Capitol Hill today. He'll likely be grilled about $165 million in bonuses paid to employees at the very unit that led to AIG's near collapse. Liddy has defended the bonuses, saying AIG was contractually obligated to pay them. In fact, in an op-ed piece in today's \"Washington Post,\" Liddy says, \"in America, when you owe people money, you pay them.\" Earlier on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST, we spoke with Representative Jim Himes, who had the chance to met with Liddy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM HIMES, (D) CONNECTICUT: Well, I had the opportunity to sit with Mr. Liddy in my office yesterday. And what I told him was, you know, it's not just important that the right thing happen, but that the right thing be seen to happen. So I said, you know, look, my experience is that 10 very smart lawyers in a room can make just about anything happen. So, please, get 10 lawyers in a room and figure out how to fix this. And if you can't do that, get these 73 people that are receiving these bonuses together in a conference room and say, folks, this is the time to stand up and do the right thing for your country. Give back the money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEE: Give back the money. The Treasury Department and several senators are looking at ways to get the money back from AIG or from the individual employees.</p><p>Well, the family of a Connecticut woman violently attacked by a chimpanzee is suing for $50 million in damages from the chimps owner. Lawyers for Charla Nash allege Sandra Herold, the chimp's owner, was liable for the attack as a result of her negligence and recklessness in caring for the ape. They claim Herold knew about the chimp's violent history and did not do enough to protect people.</p><p>All right. You're up-to-date here on the Fox Business Network. Coming up, we're going to see if prices for your groceries are falling with the latest Consumer Price Index number. That's next on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST coming up at 8:30 Eastern Time. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: And happy Wednesday. Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Liz Claman. Alexis Glick is off today.</p><p>I want to take a quick look at the futures here. We've pretty much been languishing slightly below positive territory here. That would be negative, Liz. Dow Jones Industrials down 53 points. Those are the futures numbers. S&amp;P, which gives us a better sense of how the markets might open, showing some red on the screen, down 4.40. The Nasdaq down about 3. Remember, we're coming off a triple digit gain for the Dow Jones Industrials, which was a really strong move for the Nasdaq yesterday. And that was, what, five days out of six that we were moving higher.</p><p>We are awaiting the release of the February Consumer Price Index, the CPI. And analyst estimates, the all items CPI climbed by 0.4 percent last month. That would actually mark the second consecutive increase. Let's get the number right now.</p><p>MCSHANE: Al right, Liz, appreciate it.</p><p>And here comes the number coming down. And we'll see whether or not if we did get the increase or not. CPI up 0.4 percent. So there you have it, exactly what you would expect. Ex food and energy, up 0.2 percent. The consensus had been for a 0.1 percent gain on that particular metric there. So up 0.4 percent on the headline figure. Up 0.2 percent when you back out the so-called food and energy volatile prices there.</p><p>Now, the year-over-year increase, .2 percent. The consensus had been for that to be unchanged year-over-year, so it actually went up a little bit on that measure. And when you take out food and energy on a yearly basis, it was up 1.8 percent.</p><p>So that is the CPI figure there. As you see it, the only other thing that's coming out right now is the current account deficit, which is $132.8 billion, a little bit less than the consensus, $137 billion, that had been expected.</p><p>Now, a quick look at the markets to see how we are reacting to these figures. Liz showed you that the futures were down exactly as they are now, by 50-plus points on the Dow, and about 4 on the S&amp;P futures.</p><p>So, again, CPI going up, and that's exactly what we expected, Liz, with the consensus on the core rate. A little bit above -- I should say the consensus was a little below the actual number, which was .2 on the core.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>CLAMAN: And always important to point out that the Consumer Price Index is really -- for folks who don't understand the CPI -- it's basically inflation at the consumer level, for what you pay out there.</p><p>Joining me now with instant analysis of the February Consumer Price Index, Stephen Leeb, president of Leeb Capital Management, and Matt McCall, the president of Penn Financial Group.</p><p>Stephen, this number...</p><p>STEPHEN LEEB, PRESIDENT, LEEB CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Half full, half empty.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, but why are we even looking at inflation right now? Should we be?</p><p>LEEB: Well, you know, I think, Liz, before we know it, we should be looking at it. I mean, this is an economy that I think once it recovers, and if we get this banking crisis under control, which I think we will one of these days, this recovery could be breathtaking, and it could lead very, very quickly to a lot of inflation.</p><p>CLAMAN: That is an interesting point.</p><p>Just as quickly as economists were caught flat-footed by this downturn, could they well be caught by an upturn?</p><p>MATT MCCALL, PRESIDENT, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP: Absolutely. And a lot of economists are talking about deflation right now. And I'm on the opposite side of the field.</p><p>I think inflation is going to be a major issue. When you're really spending $3 trillion, and you have to budget that, where's that money coming from?</p><p>You're going to have to raise rates, and it's going to lead to inflation. And at the end of the day, if you're not ready for this, and you don't have your portfolio set, you could really be caught like you just said, like economists were.</p><p>LEEB: Well, you know, Liz, if you look at some of the data that's coming, I mean, oil prices from $35 to nearly $50. And this economy down 6 percent. What's going to happen when we're growing by 2 percent?</p><p>Copper prices up 20 percent. I mean, you've had this tremendous rally in commodities, even before we've gotten off the tarmac in this economy. Imagine what happens when the world really starts to grow. There is going to be no natural resources.</p><p>CLAMAN: And what about this theory that we have printed so much money, that the value of the dollar will eventually go down and inflation will rear its head?</p><p>MCCALL: Absolutely. I mean, you have to play, if you're looking at stocks, what is going to -- how do you play a falling dollar? You look global. How do you play inflation? Gold kips (ph).</p><p>And I'm actually putting my money where my mouth is. I've been buying kips (ph) over the last couple months, I've been buying gold over the last couple of years, setting up for what could possibly be hyperinflation.</p><p>LEEB: I have no argument with him. I'd love to argue with him, but no...</p><p>CLAMAN: Fight him. Come on.</p><p>LEEB: I can't. No, I mean, kips (ph) and gold are probably our largest positions right now. I mean, it's not so much the dollar.</p><p>CLAMAN: Even though gold touched $1,000 a couple of weeks ago? And look at it now. It's down $10 at the moment to $906. Is this a buying opportunity?</p><p>LEEB: Yes, it is. I mean, can gold go to $850 or $800? Absolutely. But just look at gold the last eight years. What asset has finished every year in the last 8 higher than it was the year before?</p><p>CLAMAN: But let's go back to consumer prices. We do see a slight uptick, of course, of the core rate, which often sort of strips out the very volatile food and energy prices, although energy is not so volatile lately. But the consumer, how will he or she feel it out there?</p><p>MCCALL: I think they're going to feel -- going to the food, I mean, we all go to the grocery store every day. And when we see how the prices - - they have not come down.</p><p>Even though this economy has come down, our wages have come down, prices at the grocery store have not come down. Maybe we're buying the private label versus the brand name; however, those prices are still high. And once we see wheat prices, corn prices start picking back up again, as you spoke of earlier with the commodity prices, we're going to see even higher prices for the consumer.</p><p>CLAMAN: By the way, we got General Mills' numbers earlier this morning, and they actually missed estimates. But interestingly enough, they upped their full-year guidance, and commodity prices are down. They're still managing to make money. Something tells me that when they hiked those cereal prices -- remember that?</p><p>LEEB: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: ... or they made the boxes smaller but kept the price the same, they still have pricing power.</p><p>LEEB: Liz, what you have to understand, there are 2.3 billion people in China and India. These economies are still growing. So are the Middle Eastern economies.</p><p>At least half the world is still growing. And that half is the world that needs commodities in order to grow. They need evermore commodities.</p><p>In this country, we can grow without using additional commodities. Europe can grow without using additional commodities. But the engine of this world need commodities in order to grow.</p><p>MCCALL: And as the middle class grows, more food.</p><p>LEEB: Everything more. Moving up the food chain.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm not hearing either of you say buy equities. You're not saying that now.</p><p>LEEB: Well, I think buy selected equities.</p><p>CLAMAN: That are related to commodities?</p><p>LEEB: Well, that are related to inflation. I mean, you know, growth stocks that -- I think, you know, basically any company that came through 2008, which I think is kind of a microcosm for what to expect over the next five to 10 years, inflation, deflation, et cetera, is probably a good buy. Stocks like TEVA, for example, stocks like CVS.</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you own those?</p><p>LEEB: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: What about you?</p><p>MCCALL: I do. I like stocks here, but you have to be a stock picker. But I think the two areas that I'm looking at, one is market turns, emerging markets and commodities, both based on this commodity inflation play.</p><p>CLAMAN: Stephen, Matt, thanks to both of you.</p><p>LEEB: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: They're liking gold right now. What can I say? And copper.</p><p>Let me guess, you like palladium, too?</p><p>LEEB: Yes!</p><p>CLAMAN: I knew he liked palladium!</p><p>LEEB: And platinum.</p><p>CLAMAN: Nickel and zinc as well. </p><p>LEEB: We're compatriots. I didn't know him the first time I met you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: Coming up, we'll see if Apple's big iPhone update gave its stock a big boost with a look at the Fox 50.</p><p>And then in 90 seconds, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas joining me live to talk about the growing outrage from lawmakers in Washington over the bonuses handed out by AIG. And what about her colleagues who took money from the troubled insurer?</p><p>A lot of answering that we are expecting here, but stay tuned. We've got much more than that on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAYNE: The Fox 50 returning to its winning ways yesterday. Our index gained 17 points to close at 584.</p><p>This morning, there is word of a posible merger in the index. IBM could buy Sun Microsystems.</p><p>For more, I'm joined by Matt McCall, the president of Penn Financial Group.</p><p>Let's start with Apple real quick, though.</p><p>The stock was up big time yesterday. It had been floating around. It looks like it's on the cusp of a major breakout through $100. Is it all about updating their software or is there more to it?</p><p>MCCALL: I think there's more to it. I mean, updating the software, the good news always gives Apple, you know, a bit of a bounce. People love hearing the new products coming out.</p><p>However, I think Apple is just a value at this level. If you're looking for growth plays, looking for something to play off the consumer turning around, Apple's the best play. I own the stock and think it's a great long-term...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: You got a target on it?</p><p>MCCALL: You know, I'm looking at about $120 is the next couple of months. If it breaks through -- like you just said, if it gets through that $100 level, it's going to take off. But it's been struggling there over the last few weeks.</p><p>PAYNE: IBM in the news in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning, perhaps buying Sun Micro $6.5 billion. Do you like the deal? IBM just down a little bit on that news.</p><p>MCCALL: I think it's a good deal. I think they're picking up on cheap -- I mean, Sun's down 71 percent over the last 12 months. Even though you're paying 100 percent premium, I think it's a nice play.</p><p>And you look at IBM stock over the last couple of years, it's one of the few big tech stocks that's held up very well. So it's one of those -- you know, the grandmother stock. Your grandmother can buy IBM and throw it in her basket.</p><p>PAYNE: Do you own any?</p><p>MCCALL: I do own some IBM, yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Really? Good. Good.</p><p>All right. We've got to talk about Coca-Cola. This is really interesting.</p><p>We've seen some saber rattling out of China with respect to holding out treasuries. We think something is going on here behind the scenes. Now they're rejecting a possible takeover of Coke, one of their largest fruit juice companies, $2.4 billion bid for high-end juice.</p><p>What do you make of this and what's the impact going to be on IBM?</p><p>MCCALL: I think eventually it's going to get through. I think this deal will eventually get through. Maybe not this company...</p><p>PAYNE: IBM's already said though -- I think they've said already this morning that they're not going to pursue it any more. I'm sorry, Coke.</p><p>MCCALL: Coke.</p><p>PAYNE: Obviously IBM's not going to pursue it.</p><p>MCCALL: They'll take a different angle. I think they want to get in China. They know the growth potential in China. They're going to get over there.</p><p>The one concern though with Coke, in looking at the way the stock has performed recently, it's gotten hit because of the dollar. I mean, the dollar has risen, and they're such a global company, but I think the U.S. dollar is going to fall in the next, let's say, 12 to 18 months. So this is a play on the falling U.S. dollar, it is a play on growth.</p><p>But as a stock, I don't know. And I think there's a lot more exciting plays out there right now.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, let's talk about something that's been really exciting recently, Bank of America. The chairman, he's really been on the offensive here recently. Now talking about possibly paying back TARP money this year.</p><p>A, do you believe him? And B, could this help the stock? It was edging up before we came on air. It was edging just a little bit higher.</p><p>MCCALL: I mean, how can you believe him? I mean, honestly, I don't believe a word out of anybody's mouth from Wall Street to the White House anymore. I think (INAUDIBLE) research. Buying Bank of America here, it's like throwing a dart. I mean, it's probably going to be one to make it out.</p><p>I'm much prefer...</p><p>PAYNE: You just said you want excitement. This is exciting.</p><p>MCCALL: It's exciting, but I also want to get some sleep at night as well. So I don't like it here. I like J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley. Those are the three that I'd be looking at. Not as exciting as a Bank of America or Citigroup, but a much better risk reward play.</p><p>PAYNE: Right, less risk. And...</p><p>MCCALL: And the reward is still high. I mean, I think you have a lot of upside on all three of those stocks.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks a lot, Matt. Really appreciate it.</p><p>MCCALL: Thanks, Charles.</p><p>(NEWSBREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: Lawmakers are up in arms over the $165 million bonuses handed out to American International Group. And the head of the Senate Banking Committee, Chris Dodd of Connecticut, says he supports his colleagues' calls to recoup the taxpayer funds.</p><p>Dodd, though, has received nearly $300,000 over 20 years from the failed insurer. And folks, you know what? He's not alone. The list is legion, including both Republicans and Democrats who took money from AIG.</p><p>But here now to weigh in on the topic, Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.</p><p>Welcome, Senator. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>SEN. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON (R), TEXAS: Thank you, liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, let me ask you, first, did you take any money from AIG in campaign contributions?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Liz, I don't know. I'm so sorry. I don't know. I have not even looked at my contribution list with regard to that.</p><p>CLAMAN: It's never come up? Really?</p><p>HUTCHISON: I have a very firm opinion about these bonuses.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p>HUTCHISON: You know, regardless of whether I have -- and we can certainly check that -- I think that what the executives are doing is outrageous. I think retention bonuses for people who have already left is just not acceptable to the American people.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm sure, because it's become such a hot-button issue here. We have received this morning alone hundreds and hundreds of e-mails.</p><p>What are your constituents telling you, Senator?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Oh, they're outraged. They're outraged by all of the big spending that scares people to death with the debt that we have and the deficits that we are accumulating.</p><p>They are outraged by these bailouts. Some are to big to fail, some are not. The bailout mania, I think, has just gone out of control, and that's what I'm hearing from my constituents.</p><p>And you know, Liz, there is more of a fear factor than I've known in my lifetime right now, because they see the problem, but they don't see a solution that is going to work. And that's what I'm hearing.</p><p>CLAMAN: These bonuses have everybody so riled up, Senator, as you know. But are we missing the bigger picture? And that is that when the TARP was pushed through initially, it just wasn't put in place where there were handcuffs that would prevent this kind of thing from happening, even though people demanded it. </p><p>Did Congress members read this closely enough? Why didn't they ensure that something would be put in that would prevent us down the road from facing this angst and anger?</p><p>HUTCHISON: I think that is a very legitimate criticism. I do.</p><p>Originally, Secretary Paulson asked for no strings at all, wanted $700 billion, and said that the global economy was going to crash if we didn't do it.</p><p>CLAMAN: I remember.</p><p>HUTCHISON: We didn't give him a no-strings-attached opening of the Treasury. We cut it to $350 billion.</p><p>We did put parameters around it. But clearly, we did not foresee all of the things that these people would do, like take trips, like give bonuses. We just thought that there would be a factor where all of these executives would come together like Americans come together to solve problems, and that they would do the right thing.</p><p>That was a mistaken assumption. However, now, Liz, we are not learning from that mistake, and we are continuing to throw money at problems without the necessary restraint and parameters put around it.</p><p>CLAMAN: Sure. Are you, Senator -- are you of the belief we can't let AIG go down because something horrible will happen?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Well, as I understand it, AIG has such a global impact because it is an insurer of last resort in so many areas. And that's why the original AIG bailout came from the Treasury, because Mr. Bernanke saw that as well.</p><p>Now we actually have put 80 percent of the company's capital on the line from American taxpayers, and I just think we've got to take a stronger control here. And we can't own 80 percent of a company and have executives taking bonuses for retention when they've already left.</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you think...</p><p>HUTCHISON: Let me say, too, Liz, I think you all talked about this earlier today. The contracts have already been breached. So to say this is a contractual obligation, when they have not met the performance standards that are in the contract, I think does bring into question that we would have the power to do more.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm absolutely with you on that. A contract, I absolutely believe, should be held up. But when the other side doesn't deliver what they promised, that's a problem.</p><p>An opinion article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" yesterday said this: \"The politicians prefer to talk about AIG's latest bonus payments because they deflect attention from Washington's failure to supervise AIG.\"</p><p>How do you respond to that, Senator?</p><p>HUTCHISON: I think it's valid. I think that the regulatory reform that is needed for AIG and for our financial institutions, and for the institutions that are doing all of these fancy derivatives that have been virtually unregulated, must be regulated in a responsible way. We don't want to go overboard, but we certainly know where the vacancies are in our regulatory system today, and we need to address that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Senator, one of your constituents just shot us an e-mail, wanted to get it to you. Neil Lewis in Granbury, Texas, says, \"Why are we outraged at the bonuses when we are supporting foreign banks to the tunes of tens of billions of dollars?\"</p><p>Now, just to clarify, foreigners have bought a lot of our debt. So this is perhaps a hairier, more complex issue. But do you have an answer for him?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Well, I think that it's correct to say that some of this stimulus or bailout money has gone to foreign banks. Part of it AIG. And that is an area that we need to look at, where this money is going, and have more strings on it so that we assure that our financial institutions are being shored up, but also that they're getting credit out there.</p><p>You say, what are my constituents saying? My constituents are saying they cannot get credit in the marketplace.</p><p>CLAMAN: Still, after all of that?</p><p>HUTCHISON: My small businesses, my medium-size businesses cannot get credit. My auto dealers cannot get credit. It is -- that's what we've got to address. And where all of this money is going from the bailout, into foreign coffers, I think is a legitimate question, of course.</p><p>CLAMAN: Last question. Quickly, do you think Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has a handle on this? </p><p>HUTCHISON: Well, I have to say that I don't see that he has come forward with a plan that can work. We don't see credit flowing.</p><p>I think that we made mistakes last fall, but we have not learned from those mistakes this spring. And I am very concerned that he is not on top of it, and that we have got to get a handle on the financial situation and the housing situation and stop all these stimulus packages until we correct that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Very sensible talking from you this morning, Senator. Thank you.</p><p>Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.</p><p>HUTCHISON: Thank you, Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: Any time.</p><p>Coming up, we have a look at \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: And now it's time for \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>And that is people are still buzzing over AIG's bonus handouts. We've been getting your e-mails all morning long. We wanted to read a few more. Thank you so much for sending them.</p><p>Time to dig -- and so let's read some of these e-mails. We'll dig into the mail bag and see what everybody is talking about.</p><p>Glenn in Auburn, Alabama talks about AIG employees who are threatening to leave if they don't get their bonuses. Ah, yes. He says, \"These people caused the problems! So what if they leave? Good riddance!\"</p><p>PAYNE: Well, the point is, half of them are already gone.</p><p>CLAMAN: I know. They left with the money. See, they're smarter than we are.</p><p>LEE: Left with the money, yes.</p><p>Robert of Charleston, South Carolina, says, \"Almost anything the government or AIG does to address the utter audacity of this scandal will be hard to trust.\"</p><p>So that's the next kind of chapter of this problem, right?</p><p>CLAMAN: And remember, Fox Business will be carrying that at 10:00 a.m. Eastern today, the hearing on Capitol Hill.</p><p>PAYNE: By the way, guys, ,on that trust issue, how can private funds trust the government not to limit their profits if they go into this partnership on these toxic assets, considering the uproar? Because billions are going to be made on that if it's done right.</p><p>Bill Stevens of Jamestown, North Carolina, asks, \"Where was Timothy Geithner on this issue? Where was he when agreements were extended under his watch? I'll tell you what -- out to lunch -- like he is on all other economic issues.\"</p><p>CLAMAN: It was interesting. Did you just see Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison? She took a breath when I said does Tim Geithner have a handle on this? Granted, he's got to have a handle on a bunch of other issues, too. So it's very tough out there.</p><p>LEE: Yes, she did kind of...</p><p>PAYNE: But he's the number one guy. We need confidence in him, and obviously very few people have confidence.</p><p>CLAMAN: If he's there, you have got to have confidence in these people.</p><p>Keep the e-mails coming, folks, moneyforbreakfast @foxbusiness.com. It's very important that you e-mail us and let us know, because we are the one network who is letting your e-mails be, you know, read. And we understand how this feels.</p><p>But we've got to move this discussion forward. The dialogue has to move forward from, yes, we're totally annoyed, to what's going to happen?</p><p>LEE: And speaking of moving it forward, you have a big interview coming up on \"THE CLOSING BELL\" today.</p><p>CLAMAN: Mike Maroone of AutoNation. He's the president of the nation's largest auto dealer. They have a huge announcement, exclusively right here on Fox Business. It affects every single person who wants to buy any kind of car from these AutoNation dealers.</p><p>So stay tuned for that.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. Well, I'll definitely be watching.</p><p>CLAMAN: \"COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL,\" 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Thank you so much for joining us. We hope you have a great day.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

And lawmakers are on the  move to retrieve the money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Drug lords, kidnappings and now trade tariffs is this what we get for  the $10 billion in aid the U.S. gives to Mexico?  We've got a hot debate  straight ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And does IBM have sunny days ahead?  If you're just waking up here comes  the sun -- IBM wanting to buy Sun Microsystems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We've got the latest.  We're serving all that and so much more for you  right here on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>Well, good morning everybody.  Welcome to a special edition of MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.  The AIG America's out outraged.  I am Liz Claman.  Alexis  Glick is off today.</p><p>We're going to have much more on all this anger, this drama stemming  from the AIG bonuses, and so much of it, we know it's coming from you.</p><p>And we actually really do want to hear from you.  Are you outraged?  But  specifically, why?  Don't just say, \"Yes, I'm furious.\"  We want to know  why you're outrage and you can actually email us right here at  <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email> and we'll actually share those with  you later in the show.  We'll read what some of you have to say.</p><p>But first let's get you caught up on the futures here and this after a  day where we had a triple digit gain for the DOW Jones Industrial.   Futures are lower today at the moment DOW Jones Industrial futures down  44 but we tend to look more at the S&amp;P futures, they give you a better  sense of what might happen with the market, they're down nearly five  points; the NASDAQ down four.</p><p>Let's send it right now to Connell McShane at the Fox Business desk with  the very latest.  He's got earnings out from General Mills -- Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  They look a little light, Liz,  $3.79 a share X-items has been the number that's been reported by  General Mills but the Street's looking for $0.88, so light on that  front.  Interesting to point out that the company says it's raising its  guidance for the full year but when you look at it the guidance is still  light, of where the Street estimate is.  You see where the stock close  yesterday $3.38 to $3.87 for the full year, $3.94 is the estimate.  So  the top end of the guidance at $3.87 is still light of the estimate.</p><p>General Mills among other things talking about currency translations  hurting their earnings a little bit, reducing sales growth by three  percentage points.  The currency translation so GIS, General Mills  certainly will a stock to watch today here, Liz.  This one is down about  11 percent with the markets so far this year.</p><p>But the earnings look light, we'll have more on it later on the morning,  right now back over to you.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Yes, we'll be talking much more about General Mills because  clearly you cannot ignore Count Chocolate and Boo Berry.  Very  important.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I know it.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Thank you Connell.</p><p>As I mentioned we're taking a closer look at this hour at the outrage  over AIG.  So let's start with the latest news, first off, Chairman and  CEO of American International Group Ed Liddy pulling up a chair at a  Congressional witness table today.  This one is going to be so closely  watched he will take massive heat.  I promise you every lawmaker is  going to want to make his or her voice heard very loudly, this over the  more than $200 million in bonuses.</p><p>Meanwhile, Congress and the White House trying to find ways to strip  bonus recipients of the money they got.  Some of these people are not  even with the company anymore and they we're getting millions and  million of dollars worth.</p><p>The chairman of ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee proposed  companies and individuals pay a 35 percent tax on all retention awards  and bonuses over $50,000.</p><p>And in a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner suggesting  holding back the bonus amount from upcoming bailout funds for AIG.</p><p>There are all kinds of ideas being thrown out here on how to get the  money back but do you have ideas, I mean, how angry are you over this  bonus debacle?  If you are steamed, you're not alone we're not just  talking about lawmakers.</p><p>Fox Business's senior Washington correspondent, Peter Barnes is in our  Washington Bureau with the results -- Peter a new Pew Research Center  Poll, boy they gets these things out pretty quickly, what do we see?</p><p>PETER BARNES, FBN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Well that's right,  Liz, the AIG bonus controversy a possible big political headache for  President Obama if the financial bailout doesn't work and if he has to  go back to Congress later for more money to help banks.</p><p>The White House continuing to express outrage about the bonuses,  distancing itself from the controversy and trying to get out in front of  the story that was inevitably going to dominate the headlines anyway.</p><p>But the President remains fully vested in a bank rescue plan, he voted  for it as a Senator.  And as President he says it is critical to  reviving bank lending and the economy.</p><p>On Monday, the Pew Research Center released the poll that found that 87  percent of people are outright angry about or at least bothered by bank  bailouts.</p><p>In the poll, despite their anger, people still supported bank rescues as  a policy 48 percent to 40 percent.  But the poll was taken last week  before revelations of the AIG bonuses.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL DIMOCK, PEW RESEARCH CENTER:  I think if anything this has  intensified the emotional feeling that people have.  Again, they've been  giving a clear example of the downside of this policy the problems with  the way that this money is being spent.  I think that intensifies the  anger now.  Whether it's going to undermine the support for the policy,  it's something that we're going to need to see how it plays out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES:  Now, the President has to be somewhat careful on how he plays  the AIG bonus controversy, Dimock says.  His job approval rating is  starting to slip.  The PEW poll shows it down five points from February  to March, Dimock says mainly over public concern about his stimulus  plan, his budget and how they will increase the deficit as well as some  concern over his foreign policy.</p><p>But the President did include a $750 billion placeholder in his budget  for more funding for bank bailouts if he needs it.  Being outraged about  how AIG now may leave the President in a delicate political position,  later with Congress and voters trying to turn a negative consequence of  the bailout, taxpayer money going to big bonuses into a positive,  cleaning up the system by continuing those very bailouts.</p><p>Liz, back to you.</p><p>CLAMAN:  There is no way Peter, anybody is going rubber-stamp more  spending with these AIG bonuses unless this gets resolved.   Unbelievable.  Thanks for the PEW Research Center.</p><p>BARNES:  No way, you're right.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Yes, here take my money.</p><p>BARNES:  Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN:  The AIG bonus was the talk of the halls on Capitol Hill  yesterday.  Massachusetts Congressman and Chairman of the House  Financial Services Committee Barney Frank was confounded by Ed Liddy of  AIG's reasoning for payment of the bonuses.  Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BARNEY FRANK, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE:   Mr. Liddy gave two arguments.  One, was my hands are tied legally but  the other was a policy argument.  He doesn't want to rescind them  because he wants to retain those people.  I am very skeptical that  retaining the people who made the mistakes is a good idea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAMAN:  For more on today's hearings and this outrage that we know so  many of you are feeling, I am joined now by Democratic Congressman Jim  Himes of Connecticut and Republican Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito  of West Virginia.  Both served on the House Financial Services  Committee.</p><p>Well, did you bring your boxing gloves?  Both of you, I can only  imagine...</p><p>REP. JIM HIMES (D), CONNECTICUT:  Good morning Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Ed Liddy sitting in front of you.  I will start with the  Representative Himes.  Give me a sense of what you want and need to hear  from Ed Liddy today.</p><p>HIMES:  Well, you know, as you pointed out in your story the outrage is  out there is unbelievable.  And you know, Congress represents the people  and so I think you are going to see some outrage today.</p><p>But you know I had the opportunity to sit with Mr. Liddy in my office  yesterday.  And what I told him was, it's not just important that the  right thing happens but that the right thing be seen to happen.</p><p>So I said, you know look, my experience is that 10 very smart lawyers in  the room can make just about anything happen so please get 10 lawyers in  the room and figure out how to fix this.</p><p>And if you can't do that, get these 73 people that are receiving these  bonuses together in a conference room and say folks, this is the time to  stand up and do the right thing for your country.</p><p>Give back the money.  Because if those two things don't happen, action  will be taken either in the halls of Congress or by the State of  Connecticut where this particular unit is resident.  And it's really  important that they step up and do the right thing not just so that the  many people who have lost their jobs out there see that everybody is in  this together but because as you point out, we are not through  stabilizing the financial sector yet.</p><p>We've got work yet to do and every time something like this happens our  hands get tied.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Representative Moore Capito, Ed Liddy has an op-ed piece in the  \"Washington Post\" today and in it one of the lines that caught my eye  was where he said, \"In America when we owe people money we pay them,  ok.\"  So I think that's not nod to the hall if there is a contract you  can't break it in America we get that.</p><p>We understand that but Representative Himes, just said, get a couple of  lawyers into the room.  We can figure something out here.</p><p>Congress has suggested taxing these bonuses up to 95 percent and  Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner says that he's working on this as well  but what is your solution?  What do you and your brethren in Congress  feel about this?</p><p>SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO (R), WEST VIRGINIA:  Well, I think we recognize  with all of the different programs and policies that are coming forward,  that just this morning as I was coming in the guard said to me something  isn't right.  And we need to make this situation to a point where people  understand what's going on but still reflecting the outrage and the  astonishment of the lack of transparency and the lack of accountability.</p><p>My question to Mr. Liddy will be you knew these were part of the  contract, you knew in good faith and bargaining good faith with the  United States government why were these questions not answered?</p><p>Where is the transparency and accountability of the tax dollars?  Why  did AIG not come forward and if they did, why did the Treasury accept  this as part of the agreement to further fund and to further bailout  this company?</p><p>CLAMAN:  I am glad you brought up the Treasury Secretary.   Representative Himes, we talked about what Treasury Secretary Geithner  wants to do and he says, \"We will impose on AIG in essence a contractual  commitment to pay the Treasury from the operations of the company the  amount of retention awards just paid.  In addition we will deduct the  $30 billion -- deduct from there in assistance an amount basically equal  to the amount of those payments.\"  What does that really mean?  And is  that the solution?</p><p>HIMES:  Well, what that really means is that our taxpayer dollars are  not going to pay bonuses for people who are not just involved but  remember these are folks that were in the unit of AIG that created the  credit defaults swap exposure that brought the company down.</p><p>And so I think as a matter of principle the notion that our hard earned  taxpayer dollars aren't going to provide bonuses to those people is a  pretty good notion.  Now, the Treasury affect debt maybe Congressional  legislation could affect that but frankly, as I said before I'd like to  see AIG stand up and do the right thing here, either by getting those  people together to agree to give back the money or to figure out a way  to get around those contracts.</p><p>And this notion that you can't get around the contract look, all over  this country, firefighters, policeman, teachers are being asked to  reopen their contracts to give back wages and benefits.  So I don't  think it's crazy to say that we ought to take a look at that here.</p><p>CLAMAN:  It's not.  Representative Moore Capito, but the argument out  there also floating around on Wall Street, well, you take away their  bonuses and you're not going to find anybody to these jobs.  Do you buy  that?</p><p>MOORE CAPITO:  Well, I inherently disagree with that, I mean, I think  that you are looking at large financial institutions that were brought  to their knees by basically a lot of greed and over extension of risk.</p><p>And to think that the American spirit and as the young good minds in  this country, would not want to bring these companies back without, you  know, extravagant bonuses, without holding the taxpayer out for more and  more dollars.  I think that's a ridiculous concept.  I don't buy that.</p><p>And I think that the fact that I agree with Jim when he says there are  people all over this country that are taking pay cuts, that are working  for less times, that are losing their jobs, that are making adjustments  in their families and why these employees at AIG and others can not  tighten their belts and make adjustments too or break a contract is just  doesn't pass the snip test.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Representative Himes, you're out there in Connecticut where  most of your constituents and many of them and certainly are hedge fund  people or financial people but you're also looking at constituents who  are looking specifically at Congress and saying, so many members, many  of actually the sub-Committee members have taken money from AIG in the  form of donations.</p><p>How do you answer to that?</p><p>HIMES:  Well, you know the overall campaign finance system is a broken  system and I think you'd find general agreement on that in Congress.</p><p>But look, you raised another very broader and an important point which  is that as the stones get thrown today and rightly so, Congress is not  blame free here.  The product -- the credit defaults swaps that are at  the heart of AIG's mess were explicitly unregulated by an act of  Congress a number of years ago.</p><p>So while this will be a day of popular expression of anger at AIG we  need to not forget that to some degree Congress was complicit in the  mess that grew up at AIG.  And we need to look forward and say, look, we  need a smart set of regulations, not necessarily more regulations, but  smart regulations that are going to prevent this from happening ever  again.  That's our job.  And we've got to step up to do it.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Well, the party starts at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.  I mean,  this is going to be interesting.  Fox Business will be carrying these  grilling of Ed Liddy.  Congress Member Jim Himes and Shelley Moore  Capito, thank you both for joining us.</p><p>MOORE CAPITO:  Thank you.</p><p>HIMES:  Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Anytime.  We really appreciate your perspective</p><p>And out there, you guys, we want to hear what you think about what is  going on with AIG and certainly how this event in Congress is going to  developer.  Send us an e-mail at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>Get up out of bed.  Fire up the computer; share some of your thoughts  with us.  We're actually going to be reading some of them coming up.</p><p>We do have a lot of market news here.  General Mills reporting earnings  this morning and giving full year forecast.  You may be eating some of  their food for breakfast.  What's the breakdown in store for the cereal  maker?</p><p>But first, let the sun shine in.  That's what IBM is saying as a massive  computer deal may be in the offing -- the biggest deal possibly that IBM  has ever made?</p><p>Good morning to you.  That's a big news story coming up.  We are back in  two minutes.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Connell McShane back on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST with some breaking  news out of the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning with an interesting  report that IBM might be in the market to buy Sun Microsystems and pay  $6.5 billion in cash to do so which would be, give or take, a 100  percent premium over the close for Sun yesterday.</p><p>Now let's take a look at the stock prices involved.  You would expect  that Sun Microsystems would be higher and it is.  There is IBM down  about two or three percent in the pre-market; as you see, the bid's  90.25 and the stock had closed just under 93 yesterday.  Sun, ticker  simple JAVA, these days is up to $8.10.  So that's a 60 percent move,  give or take, on the stock so being bid up on the \"Wall Street Journal\"  report again that these two are in talks, Liz, about a possible deal.   That'll be very, very interesting.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Maybe making that deal.  Wouldn't that be interesting to see?</p><p>MCSHANE:  That would be up.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Thank you very much, Connell.  For more on this possible deal  between IBM and Sun Microsystems I'm joined by Emerald Asset  Management's Joe Besecker, and president of Penn Financial Group, Matt  McCall.</p><p>Joe, you wake up and you find out... </p><p>JOE BESECKER, EMERALD ASSET MANAGEMENT:  A jab, a jolt.</p><p>CLAMAN:  The jab, a jolt.  Seriously?  IBM the sleepy -- not sleepy but  the more serious sort of button-down company going for the mavericky so  to speak?</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>BESECKER:  I just like the fact that business is being done out there.   We're back to doing business.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>BESECKER:  We're not talking about -- listen, that's the thing.  IBM is  taking advantage of opportunities that exist out there.  You know, Mark  Twain once said he was rarely able to spot an opportunity until it  ceased to be one.  And so, maybe now the companies will start to pay --  get out from under their desks, start to look for business and do  business.  And that's what I'm excited about.</p><p>Whether or not this is the best deal for IBM or maybe the market's (ph)  thing and maybe they could have gotten it a little bit cheaper?</p><p>CLAMAN:  Exactly that.  I'm wondering, are they overpaying in this  market?  Aren't you supposed to beat somebody down to their last dollar?  </p><p>MATT MCCALL, PRESIDENT, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP:  You are but you figure,  Sun already fell 71 percent in the last year.  So maybe it has been  beaten down already paying at $10 a share, whatever it may be $6.5  billion.  I don't think that is that bad.  I actually think they are  getting a pretty good deal.</p><p>And what I love about this is the synergy that it creates between the  two companies.  But I think we're going to see a lot more mergers going  on in the coming months that creates synergies and using... </p><p>BESECKER:  I hope so.</p><p>MCCALL:  ...and using its beaten down prices and as Joe said this is a  good sign, I think, for the market.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Both make corporate systems.  And I think that that's something  that these corporations who don't depend specifically on Microsoft  Windows, for example, are very interested in seeing who gets nervous  over this.  Is it Hewlett-Packard, the big competitor?</p><p>BESECKER:  Go back to what I'm saying.  Now it puts us in a position  where people start to think strategically about business again.  How do  we deploy money?  How do we go out and do things?</p><p>So yes, I think Hewlett-Packard has to be concerned about this.  I think  in general, IBM does a lot of service business.  I think this will add  to the service.  And they penetrate different areas they may not have  had.</p><p>It appears to get customers and get customers cheaply and that's what  they're doing because that customer base is an annuity that brings all  that money in.  Oracle reports today or tomorrow, that is the only thing  that's going to go well for them.  And so you want to have growth as  well and I think they'll get a growth opportunity... </p><p>CLAMAN:  Sources, by the way, say this, of course, could still fall  apart.  So we caution people to make sure they understand that but what  about regulatory hurdles, Matt?  These are two gigantic companies that  could eliminate some of the little guys out there.</p><p>MCCALL:  And it probably will.  The thing is though, Sun has lost a lot  of market share over the last couple of years.  So I think they'll be  able to get through the hurdles.</p><p>And I think HP gets hurt the most because when you think about it HP  actually had a chance to buy Sun.  In the last year they went to them  and they turned them down and now IBM is jumping on that after the price  fell a bit more.  So I think IBM is being pro-active here looking  forward or HP's kind of sitting back waiting for the business to come to  them.</p><p>CLAMAN:  What is the best possible sense that you make specifically I  think for other suitors?  Anybody -- you know Matt has talked about  Hewlett-Packard.  They're not going to come back maybe and start  fighting, would they?</p><p>BESECKER:  Why wouldn't they?  I mean if they really thought --  depending on price.  I think that is why the price is what it is.  We  don't know the price because it has not been announced.  We just hear  rumors.  But if the price is there, I think that's one of the reasons  that they came out with a good best offer.</p><p>CLAMAN:  I'm with Joe Besecker right now because I'd look at this and I  say we have some deals going.</p><p>BESECKER:  Exactly.</p><p>CLAMAN:  So what is the next digital deal that might be done?</p><p>MCCALL:  You know, I'm actually going to go away from digital because I  don't know if it is going to be as much in technology.  I think the more  deals are going to be in biotech.  I think we're going to have a huge  boom in the second half where large pharma with no pipelines are going  to start picking up a lot biotech companies.  And I think that's going  to be one of the biggest sectors and one of the biggest drivers of this  market in the second half of the year.</p><p>CLAMAN:  How does the average investor get in on something like that in  advance?</p><p>BESECKER:  Carefully.  Because we still have a lot of land mines out  there.  You look at the companies -- I actually think the play is, and  we were talking a little bit earlier, some of these companies that have  platforms that they can add things to might be the better place than  trying to guess which ones are the ones that are acquired because if  you're not acquired and you run out of cash, it is kind of an all or  nothing and minor event.</p><p>So that's in the (INAUDIBLE) I agree with you 100 percent, that's why we  buy a basket.  If you have muss (ph), you can buy a basket or you can  buy one of the -- you have to do a lot of homework and that's why...</p><p>MCCALL:  And you never buy a company just on the anticipation of being  taken over.  You never do that.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Right.  Never.  Never do that.</p><p>Well, let the sun shine in.  We have ourselves a deal here.</p><p>BESECKER:  We have business.  That's right.  We have business.</p><p>CLAMAN:  We have business going Joe and Matt.  Thank you very much.</p><p>Coming up, let's take a check of today's news headlines.  The latest --  did you hear about this?  This tragic ski trip taken by one of  Broadway's leading actresses, we will be talking about that in a moment.</p><p>And the company behind Cheerios, Betty Crocker and Haagen-Dazs --  General Mills planning to take one dinner table favorite out of the food  roster?  You get to guess -- I guarantee you, unless you grew up on one  of those organic farms which, I went Berkeley and all about that.  You  ate this product, they're taking it out of the mix.</p><p>Get ready to cry.  We'll get a closer look when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GREY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm  Gavin Grey, standing in for Ashley Webster in London and a quick look at  the markets straight off.</p><p>Let's start off in Germany with the Dax, that's been leading the way  this morning, I'm pleased to say.  And it's still doing very well; up  almost 60 points at 4,045 that's up almost 1.5 percent.  Moving across  to Paris, the CAC, that's also doing pretty well; up 0.9 of a percent at  2,792.  And lastly the FTSE; that spent most of this morning in negative  territory but it's just crept positive, up almost seven points at 3,863.</p><p>All of those figures despite some pretty bad news on the unemployment  front that's come out just within the last hour or two.  And that is  that unemployment in the U.K. has now topped 2 million; that is about  6.5 percent of the working population.  Figures due to get much worse  however and indeed it is the rate of the rise that is worrying most  people.</p><p>Two million is the worst it's been since 1997.  But the rate of the rise  has been the fastest increase for a couple of decades, so a bit worrying  there for the government and plenty of dire predictions following on  from that.</p><p>The Royal Bank of Scotland, next.  That's the bank that's been almost  bought out by the government; two-thirds now owned by the U.K. taxpayer.   But optimistic comments from the chairman who says that the banks  benefited from buoyant corporate banking activity and has noted  increased business as a resulting corporate debt issuance and equity  underwriting -- so a positive note there.</p><p>Homeowners though, well those with mortgages -- that is not such clever  news because indeed it has been estimated now that in the last year, the  number of people who have fallen into arrears with their mortgage has  risen a third and that is obviously worrying and that, of course,  despite those on track of mortgages noticing a sharp decline in the  monthly repayment.  So very worrying for them, too.</p><p>A quick look at the dollar and the currencies, it is down against the  euro, 1.30 to the dollar.  And the pound there, it is up against the  pound and 1 pound is now going to cost around $1.39.</p><p>Back to you Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Thank you very much.

China's commerce ministry rejecting the $2.5 billion  bid for the Huiyuan Juice Group saying Coke's buy out would potentially  squeeze out smaller players.</p><p>This development comes as China recently enacted stronger anti-monopoly  law so big question about whether this is an isolated event or something  that other businesses should be concerned about.</p><p>Actress, Natasha Richardson is hospitalized, in critical condition after  a skiing accident in Montreal.  Richardson was flown back to New York  City for medical treatment after suffering a serious head injury during  a beginner's ski lesson.  Members of Richardson's family have gathered  near her bedside now.  And Richardson, by the way, is the wife of actor  Liam Neeson.  She's an accomplished actress, though; she won a Tony  award for her 1998 performance in Cabaret.</p><p>Back to business news now, Dunkin Donuts is going back to its roots.   Years after the company ran ads featuring Fred the baker saying it is  time to make the donuts, the company's advertising its doughnuts again.   It will launch a new $10 million campaign.  In the recent years the  company has focused more on coffee and breakfast sandwiches in its  advertising and the coolest part of this campaign though is a Design  Your Own Donut contest.

So glad you're  with us on this special edition of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST, \"AIG, America's  Outrage.\"  I'm Liz Claman.  Alexis Glick is off today.  </p><p>We're going to have more on the growing anger over the failed insurer's  decision to give out bonuses, millions and millions of dollars in  bonuses to some people who actually don't even work there anymore.  </p><p>And if you've seen the markets lately, up six of the last seven days.   Not bad at all.  Let's take a look at how they're shaping up with the  futures.  A little bit of weakness here at the moment.  We actually had  some decent numbers out of Asia overnight.  The Hang Seng did pretty  well, up more than 1 percent.  </p><p>But for -- our futures here, we're down for the Dow Jones Industrial  Average.  NASDAQ just popped in to positive territory to the upside and  S&amp;P futures have come up off of their lows in the last half hour.  They  were down about 4 points, but right now down 2.20.  </p><p>The company behind breakfast staples like Wheaties and Cheerios, you  know, you've eaten it all.  You know you ate Count Chocula growing up,  admit it.  General Mills, out with 3rd quarter earnings this morning,  coming in at $0.79 excluding items, missing analysts' expectations of  $0.88 per share.  </p><p>As consumers cut costs, food makers are cutting unprofitable businesses.   So to that end, I'm stunned.  Did you -- Jenna, Jenna cannot believe it.   General Mills says it will no longer make, excuse me for a moment,  Pillsbury frozen dinner rolls.  They're gone, folks.  </p><p>I -- Charles Payne is speechless.  </p><p>For more on this I'm enjoined by Jennifer Niemela of the St. Paul  Business Journal and Erin Smith, an analyst with the Argus Research  Company.  We're all stunned and shocked today.  </p><p>Good evening, (INAUDIBLE) our way, but first Pillsbury dough rolls are  no longer going to be available.  </p><p>Erin, let's start with the numbers here.  They missed but they also  guided higher for the year.  They're upping their guidance.  I find that  interesting.  What do you pick out of this report?  </p><p>ERIN SMITH, ARGUS RESEARCH COMPANY ANALYST:  Well, they actually  mentioned that cost inflation is supposed to improve in the next -- not  bit high at next quarter, and I think that's a big benefit.  And our  estimates for the 3rd quarter is actually below consensus so they  actually came in just a little bit below our estimates.  We expected the  4th quarter would be a little bit stronger.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Jennifer, last week General Mills announced it will no longer  make, as I said, these Pillsbury frozen dinner rolls and they've  actually decided to sell the frozen dough portion of its bakeries and  food service.  So they're shedding this part of it.  Why?  Why has the  company decided to drop this part of their business?  </p><p>JENNIFER NIEMELA, ST. PAUL BUSINESS JOURNAL REPORTER:  Well, when I  talked to General Mills they mentioned that they're really trying to  focus on some of their strengths and like a lot of food companies, they  are trying to trim out some of the less profitable parts of their  business.  </p><p>So those are the reasons that they gave me.  And yes, they sold it to a  company called Pennant Foods.  They sold four of their factories, shed  about 60 positions.  So they are focusing on cutting their costs right  now.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Erin, what impact, do you think, the sale will have on General  Mills' future?  I thought it was so iconic.  I can't let go of this.   I...</p><p>SMITH:  Well, I do like their Pillsbury rolls.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  It's dinner -- exactly.  </p><p>SMITH:  But at the same time, Pillsbury division has been -- hasn't been  performing as well as some of their other divisions.  Cereals been very  strong, yogurt and soup.  So I can understand.  I think long term this  is a good strategy to try to revitalize that -- the Pillsbury brand over  the past year.  And it's probably -- I assumed that it hasn't been doing  as well.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  But Jennifer, we've got to get to the stronger dollar aspect of  this because clearly a strong dollar hurts a global company that has an  international footprint.  Right now we're looking at a dollar that seems  to be doing well.  General Mills operates in about 100 different  companies.  Does this hurt them going forward?  They must not think it's  going to really pressure them because they're upping the guidance for  the full year.  </p><p>NIEMELA:  Right.  Well, they have been focusing a lot on cutting their  costs.  And here in the twin cities, they have decreased their work  force by about 2 percent so I think going forward they're pretty  optimistic.  </p><p>The CEO also mentioned that while commodity prices have been up, he does  expect those to go down once the recession ends.  So I think that  they're optimistic going forward and that makes sense.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Erin, everybody says go for consumer staple companies and  healthcare because those are the two things people won't cut back on.   These earnings indicate that even if people continue to buy these  products, costs are higher.  We don't know where commodities are going.   It's obviously a real challenge to operate a company like this.  </p><p>Is it all about the management and how smart they are as far as organic  growth is concerned?  And specifically, cuts in the way they operate?  </p><p>SMITH:  I think that's very important and I also think if you look at  the company's brand and if they have leading brands, what kind of types  of products?  General Mills have a very strong portfolio of affordable  brands for consumers.  General mixes, soup and cereals.  So you have to  look at what they're offering.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  And Jennifer, we spoke about how General Mills is cutting costs  by selling some of those less profitable brands.  How many have cut  costs, say for example, by laying employees off and what does General  Mills employment situation look like?  </p><p>NIEMELA:  Well, here in the twin cities we have seen -- actually some of  our larger companies including Cargill, another big food company here,  have actually increased their work force over the past year.  But  General Mills has decreased their -- over 2008 they decreased by about  1.8 percent.  Their employment here.  So they are focusing on cutting  their costs.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Jennifer and Erin...</p><p>NIEMELA:  In that way as well.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  We're going to wrap it there.  Once again General Mills,  missing estimates but upping their guidance for the full year numbers.  </p><p>We thank you very much for coming in.  We've actually got some breaking  news.  </p><p>Connell, what do you have for us?  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Liz, we talked about the Coke  story.  You may have heard us talk about the fact that this deal had  been rejected by the Chinese government for Coke to buy a juice company  in China for $2.5 billion.  </p><p>Well, the company itself has actually come out with some comments here  in the last few minutes crossing on the wire from Coca-Cola.  They're  saying they're not going to pursue this.  This Huiyuan deal, that's the  name of the company, in China, the juice company.  They're not going to  pursue it after the government had rejected it.  </p><p>So they're not going to press this anymore.  They said they were  disappointed about the rejection that came out of the Chinese  government, but they rejected -- they, I should say, they respect the  decision and they're going to focus on growing existing brands in China  with a long-term view of the Chinese market.  </p><p>So, again, Coca-Cola after being rejected by the Chinese government for  an attempt to $2.5 billion acquisition of a major juice company in China  now says that's it. we respect your decision, we're not going to pursue  it any further.  </p><p>Interesting story.  We'll continue to follow it and all the political  ramifications, all the rest of it throughout the day.  But right now it  is time for \"Charles' Choice.\"  It's down to Charles Payne in the  studio.  </p><p>What do you have, Charles?  </p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thanks, Connell.  Well, you  know, first, no more dinner rolls and now Coke being knocked down in  China, bad news.  But I'm going to stick with this China thing, Connell,  because two of the three stocks I'm watching are actually based in  China.  </p><p>The first is Focus Media.  That was the tease that Jenna Lee gave you.   I've got to tell you, folks, someone just opened some biscuits in the  background.  The stock has won some pretty good support right around the  $5 area so I like it on the downside.  </p><p>Listen, Wall Street expects this company to earn $1.48 in the fiscal '09  and it's trading at $5.90.  If it traded at ten times book, I mean the  stock would be somewhere right around here so this is really one of  these stocks that has a lot of room to the upside.  A little on the  downside.  Nevertheless, I consider it a high-risk play, although  yesterday my high-risk play is still soft, which is up 25 percent.  A 15  percent after the open.  </p><p>OK.  A little risky in my opinion is NetEase.  It's another Chinese  plate.  It's a Web portal, offers online communities and e-commerce  services, a lot of games.  One of the things we're starting to see here  with this stock is look at that trend.  Upbrilled (ph), nice here, looks  really, really great.  On the cusp of a major, major break out.  I've  mentioned this stock several times in the past.  I think you want to  have exposure to China.  This is one of my top three plays in China  along with Baidu and Sohu.  </p><p>And finally, Simon Property Group.  This is my contrarian play of the  day, if you will.  We were short to stock at Wall Street strategies,  WStreet.com, for a long time.  And indeed it came down but it was really  tough.  It didn't come down and it showed a lot of resolve if you will.  </p><p>The stock is on a verge of a major breakout here.  I like this -- use 29  and 1/2 if you do this stock as an idea -- as a stop-loss.  And I have  an exclusive pick.  Go to FOXBusiness.com/MoneyforBreakfast.  It's a  controversial company.  </p><p>Coming up, folks, we're going to see which of your favorite brands have  the strength to carry their companies through the downturn.  And a  border war is brewing.  It can cost you and our economy billions of  dollars.  Details just ahead when we come back with more MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN:  This morning the Obama administration is preparing to send more  federal agents to the Mexican border in a move to stop the flow of drugs  and rash of kidnappings that is plaguing the Mexican border.  This comes  as the Obama administration not only copes with the drug war, but now  possibly a trade war as well.  </p><p>Folks, trade wars only exacerbated the Great Depression but is this all  mean?  And Mexico says, well, if you do that, we're going to impose  tariffs on U.S. imports and produce and products, such as, and we're  just getting this information because before we weren't sure what the  products where, sunglasses, toilet paper, pet food and soy sauce.  </p><p>I think Christmas trees were thrown in there as well.  </p><p>This move is on the heels of Washington banning Mexican trucks from  pretty much free access of the U.S. roads which Mexico says violate  NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.  </p><p>Drugs, tariffs, kidnappings, and that's all after we, the United States,  gave Mexico $10 billion in aid.  </p><p>Boy, what do we make of all of this?  For more now I'm joined by Todd  Spencer.  He's the executive vice president of the Owner, Operator  Independent Drivers Association.  And Jim Roberts, a research fellow  with the Heritage Foundation.  </p><p>Welcome to you both.  </p><p>Jim, what exactly did the U.S. remove, take away?  And how is Mexico  retaliating?  </p><p>JIM ROBERTS, HERITAGE FOUNDATION RESEARCH FELLOW:  Well, you know, this  is one trade dispute where, to pardon the express, the rubber is really  meeting the road.  To judge the Obama administration by their rhetoric,  you would think that they understand that the only way to increase  prosperity for Americans and grow our economy is to expand trade  opportunities, not contract them.  </p><p>They understand that protectionism in the 1930s made the depression  worst.  And yet we have to judge them by their actions.  And so far  their actions have been to cave in to protectionists on the left, big  labor, first in the stimulus package with the Buy America provisions,  now in this omnibus bill, they've killed a pilot program with Mexico by  defunding it, that had -- had allowed the Mexican government to put off  filing this action that they have a legal right to do under NAFTA...</p><p>CLAMAN:  OK.  </p><p>ROBERTS:  ... to put tariffs on some of our products.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Somebody who feels completely different about this is Tom  Spencer.  </p><p>Todd, how does the elimination of this program, which, in essence if I  understand it correctly, allowed Mexican 18-wheelers unfettered access  back and forth across the border to the U.S. delivering all kinds of  goods?  How does this benefit you, the U.S. trucker and more valuable  than the challenges and the costs of the tariffs?  </p><p>TODD SPENCER, OWNER OPERATOR INDEPENDENT DRIVERS ASSOC.:  Liz, it's  amazing their comments, the rhetoric coming from the other side on this  issue.  The arbitration panel that looked at this issue, several years  ago said the U.S. was totally within its rights to establish safety  systems and insists on safety systems that would assure safety on our  highways.  </p><p>Those systems have not been in place, they have not -- they are simply  not functional.  This feigned outrage about protectionism is simply  rhetoric.  This is not a new issue.  Congress, both sides of Congress  have been outraged, concerned about the prospect of an unequal playing  field in terms of safety and security all the way back to 2001.  </p><p>They've insisted our system was being put in place.  They haven't been  put in place.  And it would be foolhardy, idiotic for us to open our  highways any other way.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Jim, why do I -- Jim, why do I want Mexican truck drivers if  they're not insured, if it hasn't had the proper safeguards attached to  this program?  Why do I want them on the road here in America?  We've  got enough problems of our own.  </p><p>ROBERTS:  Well, you wouldn't want drivers like that on our roads but  those aren't the drivers that have been participating in this program.   In fact, they have had a better safety records than our own companies.   These drivers are well trained and you want them because American  consumers are paying $400 more per year in products imported from Mexico  because of this additional uploading and reloading and warehouses within  the 25-mile limit of the border.  </p><p>That's just adding costs to American consumers just to featherbed some  jobs for the teamsters and improve teamster dues, but it's hurting the  American consumer and it's hurting our relations with Mexico and our  economy.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Todd, is it all about the teamsters flexing their muscle?  </p><p>SPENCER:  Not in the least.  The overwhelming majority, 90 percent of  truckers are small business entities, people that own 10 or fewer  trucks.  These are the people that are actually on the frontlines  economically.  They're on the frontlines for highway safety and they're  the ones that actually are being disadvantaged by this unleveled playing  field and actually risks at the border.  </p><p>How many segments are we going to talk about how crazy, how lawless it  is on that side?  And we're going to say...</p><p>CLAMAN:  But you understand, Todd -- you understand that any kind of  tariffs that are imposed now which is what the Mexicans are doing for  our goods, we get a little bit of a trade war going here, at a time when  -- our economy is rough, hard you, sort of justify that with what the  boobs (ph) are.  </p><p>SPENCER:  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Mexico has benefited so much  from trade with the U.S. I mean, they'd be cutting off their nose to  spite their face...</p><p>CLAMAN:  OK.  </p><p>SPENCER:  ... to do something idiotic like that.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Jim, let me give you the last word here.  Mexico gets $10  billion in aid from us.  They're a mess.  The State Department is  encouraging people not to travel to Mexico right now because of the drug  wars.  And now this?  </p><p>ROBERTS:  Well, certainly parts of northern Mexico are dangerous but  other parts of Mexico are if you take precautions but I would say this  trucking program would have improved and will improve border security  because there are fewer opportunities for drugs and cash to move south  and empty trucks if the trucks are loaded.  And so it seems to me that  this makes more sense and always economically and with national  security.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Well, the discussion and conversation will continue.  </p><p>Todd and Jim, thank you for being a part of it right here on FOX.  Thank  you so much.  </p><p>SPENCER:  Thank you, Liz.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Now let's get over to Charles Payne.  Charles, what do you  have?  </p><p>PAYNE:  Well, Liz, Starbucks holds its annual shareholders meeting today  in Seattle and it's one of the many brands battling this downward  economy.  And it's clearly been hurt in an annual core brand power  ranking.  So last year Starbucks ranked number 10 out of 20 and this  year's survey, it slipped down to 214.  </p><p>With a look at who's the king of the brand world, I'm joined by Jim  Gregory, the CEO of CoreBrand, and Matt McCall, the president of the  Penn Financial Group.  </p><p>Jim, I want to start with you.  I just mentioned Starbucks a minute ago.   Obviously the economy has had an impact but has the company made a lot  of mistakes as well?  </p><p>JIM GREGORY, COREBRAND CEO:  Certainly.  You know, it's important to  understand that the brand is -- might be doing well, but the underlying  financial fundamentals are not more important than the brand.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I don't get what that means, though.  </p><p>GREGORY:  I'm sorry.  I said that incorrectly, but the brand is very  important but the underlying financial fundamentals are more important  than the brands, so even though the brand is quite strong, it's not more  important than the company getting out of whack, so to speak.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Let's start now with your top five.  We're going to start with  the number five on your brand rankings.  Campbell Soup.  What makes this  so good?  </p><p>GREGORY:  It's a great brand.  When you have a brand that stands for one  thing, for nourishment for so many decades and mm-hmm good concept is so  clear in everyone's mind, you know that it's a really highly focused  food company.  And they are really focused on three major areas, simple  mills, baked snacks and healthy beverages.  </p><p>And so that's a very complex company simplified.  </p><p>PAYNE:  You know, Matt, it's interesting because Peter Lindt (ph) said  buy what you know.  And obviously everybody knows Campbell Soup but  there is somewhat of a disconnect between a great brand and a great  investment.  </p><p>What do you think about Campbell as an investment?  </p><p>MATT MCCALL, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP PRESIDENT:  I really don't like his  investment.  It's gotten crushed.  It hit a five-year low just recently,  and it's not really growth story.  You won't be looking grow stocks now.   And I think they've really gotten hurt by private label.  People are  shopping at Wal-Mart, getting their groceries there.  They're going to  go for the private label brand versus the Campbell brand...</p><p>PAYNE:  Wal-Mart just said they're going to actually increase that  strategy.  </p><p>Jim, let's go to number four, Hershey Foods.  Why is this a premiere  brand?  </p><p>GREGORY:  Well, first of all, it's one of the original companies that  we're involved in corporate social responsibility.  The voting shares of  the company are controlled by the Hershey trust and that's for the  benefit of the Milton Hershey School for Disadvantaged Children.  So  they do well by doing good and it's a great company.  Again, very  consistent brand over time.  </p><p>Also, it's important to realize that they are no longer the king of  candy.  Mars has taken that with the acquisition of Wrigley's.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p>GREGORY:  So they're not quite as strong as they were.  </p><p>PAYNE:  So...</p><p>GREGORY:  But they do have a great brand.  </p><p>PAYNE:  So Jim, let's go to the other end of the political correctness - - spectrum, if you will.  Harley-Davidson, number three.  Why is this  still such a powerful brand?  </p><p>GREGORY:  Well, this is one of my favorite brands and it's done so well  over time.  When you think about Harley-Davidson in 1990 when we started  our corporate branding index, they were near bankruptcy.  They have  improved consistently over time and they are -- have reached the  pinnacle of our brand ranking of 1,200 companies.  </p><p>So one of the concerns I have about Harley-Davidson is they are -- might  be expanding too much.  They have over 35 different models and it's  almost what I call the GM syndrome.  They want to be all things to all  people.  That's not the way that -- to continue to expand their brand.  </p><p>PAYNE:  And of course, Jim, too, household names Johnson &amp; Johnson  number 2, and number one, Coca-Cola.  What do you think?  How come this  is still such a powerful brand?  </p><p>GREGORY:  Well, Coca-cola has been the number one soft drink in the  world, of course, and in our corporate branding index has been number  one since 1997.  They -- even in down markets, they continue to invest  in the brands.  They've launched Coca-Cola Zero this year as well as  their open happiness advertising campaign.  </p><p>They understand how to grow their brand even in a down market and that's  quite impressive.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Matt, three -- everyone knows HOG, though, hit a high, 75  November of 2006.  It's come straight down.  Would you even consider  buying the stock here?  </p><p>MCCALL:  I would not.  And that's something where -- that was the dream  for the middle class.  The middle class is struggling right now so the  last thing they'll do is going to be throwing $25,000 at a discretionary  item such as a HOG.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Well, Johnson &amp; Johnson at number two on the list.  It's a  consistent player.  They're probably out there looking for acquisitions  right now.  It's a core stock in a lot of folks' portfolio.  It's been  hit.  OK, what do you think about it?  </p><p>MCCALL:  I love it.  I ought to call my clients right now and this is  more than just a consumer Johnson &amp; Johnson you see at the grocery  story.  The medical device, there's the pharmaceuticals, great diverse  company and has some cash as well.  </p><p>PAYNE:  At least we got one buy out of you.  Thanks a lot, Matt.  </p><p>Jim, thank you very much.  Really appreciate it.  </p><p>Coming up, folks, we're going to into the pit and read some of the e- mails that you have been sending us about AIG.  More MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  when we return.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN:  I mean, we still cannot believe that General Mills is getting  rid of the Pillsbury dinner rolls, the frozen rolls.  We opened it.  I  was banging this thing like I was a monkey and then it popped open and  freaked me out.  But I think we should bronze this because they're not  going to ...</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  They're collector's item.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  It is.  </p><p>LEE:  Put that on eBay.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Actually you shouldn't have opened that one.  You probably  should have put it in a vault somewhere, yes.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Put it on eBay.  </p><p>LEE:  I bet it were last in the universe.  </p><p>PAYNE:  But they're keeping their dinner rolls, I mean, the flaky  biscuits.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  That's right.  I mean if you grew up having the three can stew  and the tuna casserole like we did, you know, every -- every other  Tuesday, tuna casserole, you have to have the dinner rolls.  </p><p>We have been asking you all morning long for your take on the bonus  backlash over at AIG.  Let's see what you have to say.  We've been  getting hundreds of e-mails.  </p><p>David Medas (ph) says, quote, \"You should only get a bonus when produce  above the job requirements.\"  He says AIG executives failed to produce  to meet their requirements of their contract goals but failed far below  their goals nullifying any bonuses.  </p><p>See, I like David.  Because aren't there two sides to a contract?  Why  were AIG executives pay bonus when they lost money?  </p><p>PAYNE:  Well, I think one of the problems is we have not actually seen  the contract themselves.  That might be great if we could get a chance  to see what those contracts were.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  I called a lot of lawyers last night, and they said Liz, got to  see the contract  </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Let me see the contract.  But good for you, David.  I like  that.  </p><p>LEE:  They're not alone, too.  A lot of CEOs got paid on Wall Street  that maybe didn't deserve it.  </p><p>Next question, well anyways.  Sean Webb says, \"I would like to know if  all these politicians are going to give back the contributions they  received from these Wall Street crooks.\"  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Good point.  </p><p>LEE:  I think, Charles, you have a list there.  </p><p>PAYNE:  God, are you kidding me?  The list from the Center of  Responsible Politics.  I left it outside.  Amazing.  Chris Dodd at the  top, $280,000.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  But Republicans also peppering this list as well.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE:  They were seated at the top 10.  There were six Democrats and  four Republicans.  And by the way, they did a great job hedging  themselves.  They had all the presidential candidates.  </p><p>Dook Barela (ph) of Riverside, California says, \"The AIG bonuses are  unacceptable.  Our congressional representatives have no excuse for  overlooking this AIG bonus when they hadn't taken the time to read the  stimulus bill before passing it nor our president for signing it.\"  </p><p>Everyone, obviously, should have some outrage towards Congress.  There's  no doubt about.  Another $30 billion a week ago.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Henry Paulson shoved this thing -- Henry Paulson, George Bush  and Congress shoved this.  </p><p>PAYNE:  But just a week ago, they got another 30 billion, Liz.  Someone  else has to take responsibility.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  We got another e-mail.  Richard Suttmeier, he's a frequest  guest.  Hi, Richard (INAUDIBLE) from ValueEngine.com, saying, \"You can't  break employment contracts after the fact.  Our Ivy League bank  regulatory geniuses who bought 80 percent of AIG on behalf of U.S.  taxpayers lacked the common sense to void all employment agreements.\"  </p><p>PAYNE:  You know what, what it...</p><p>CLAMAN:  Renegotiate, Richard.  Not void.  </p><p>PAYNE:  A bankruptcy would have renegotiated it as well, too.  But you  know what, on that note, Richard, I'm glad you're watching.  We can also  use the tax code as a weapon.  I think that's going to be a big mistake  if we go that road.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Gang, we love the comments.  You can keep them coming.  We're  getting hundreds of them.  Join the crowd here.  Send us an e-mail at  <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@FOXbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@FOXbusiness.com</email>  We'll share some of your thoughts in  the next hour.  It's three minutes until the top of the hour.  </p><p>Coming up right after the break, we're talking live to lawmakers  including Republican senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas about what  she and other lawmakers are doing about the handouts at AIG.  We're  serving up so much more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  Do not move.  I mean you  can go brush your teeth but other than that, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN:  And good morning, everybody.  Welcome to hour number two of  this special edition of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  The \"AIG, America's  Outrage.\"  I'm Liz Claman.  Alexis Glick is off today.  </p><p>We're going to have much more.  The growing anger, I mean, each day it's  getting worse and worse here among both you the public and lawmakers  over the AIG bonuses.  This morning we are getting hundreds and hundreds  of e-mails.  Please we want to hear from you.  Specifically, what is it  that outrages you so much about this?  Is it Congress not having put in  stopgaps for these kinds of problems back in September when the first  TARP was announced?  Is it just being so angry at AIG?  Who, where,  what?  E-mail us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email> and we'll share  them a little later in the show.  It's very cathartic when you sit down,  you e-mail us and maybe we'll read yours and you'll feel better about  the anger.  </p><p>First, let's get a quick check of the U.S. futures.  But, remember,  yesterday, the market did wonderfully.  Up triple digits for the Dow  Jones Industrials.  The Dow futures, right now, slightly weaker.  S&amp;P,  we were trying to make a good of the flat line here.  Got down as far as  down about 2 points.  But now we're down 5.70.  The Nasdaq futures down  3.75.  Nasdaq had a great double digit gain yesterday.  </p><p>But let me send it up to Connell McShane, he's at the Fox Business desk,  for some breaking details.  </p><p>The IBM deal that isn't yet a deal, Connell.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, not yet a deal.  But  while it's fun to talk about it, isn't it?  This morning in \"The Wall  Street Journal,\" Liz, the possibility being brought up that IBM might  buy Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash to do so.  It would be  about -- would literally be a 100 percent premium over where Sun closed  yet.  Both stocks, as you might expect, are moving in the pre-market as  a result of this speculation.  </p><p>Let's first go to IBM, which is down about 3 percent in pre-market  trading.  It's actually moved under $90 a share.  $89.91 is the bid, as  you see, on it there.  Java, Sun Microsystems, you might also expect  that to be higher.  It is.  Look at that, up to $8.25 a share.  So  you're talking about a 60 some odd percent gain in the shares of Sun  Microsystems.  Again, on the speculation this morning that IBM might be  a buyer of Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash in order to buy  Sun.  </p><p>Now, just breaking as we speak and crossing the wires are some headlines  out of the Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis.  Crossing the wires from \"The  Charlotte Observer,\" as a matter of fact.  I have not had a lot of time  to go over this because they're just crossing, so I'll read a few of  them as you look at the B of A stock price.  </p><p>Lewis saying that the bank could pay back $45 billion in TARP money,  Liz, by late this year or early next year, depending on the economy.  So  Lewis talking about not taking more money from the government, but  paying it back.  He says, in addition to that, that the bank expects to  be profitable in 2009, absent what he calls an unexpected meltdown.   Unexpected meltdown, a quote from Ken Lewis.  </p><p>Bank of America saying it could repay the TARP money now if it had to,  if it were not maintaining higher than normal capital cushion amid some  fragile economic conditions.  So it's not able to do it because of that  right now, but should be able to do it late this year or early next  year, Liz.  $45 billion that Bank of America took.  The CEO says it will  be able to pay it back and it will be profitable in 2009 unless things  really go wrong.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Fine.  Yes, we'll take it.  We'll take it.  </p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, we will take it.  Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: And that way you don't have to have Congress complaining about  your bonuses.  </p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, that's right.</p><p>CLAMAN: If you don't like that . . .</p><p>MCSHANE: Pay whatever you want as long as you don't take government  money, right?</p><p>CLAMAN: Exactly.  Connell, we'll see you later.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>CLAMAN: As I mentioned, we're taking a closer look at this hour at the  outrage that has boiled over about AIG.  So let's start with the latest  news.  Chairman and CEO of American International Group, Edward Liddy,  will pull up that chair at a congressional witness table today to take  the heat.  I mean this could be a blow torch.  They are literally going  to bring in blow torches because they know the cameras will be on them.   The lawmakers will be out there screaming about these bonuses.  </p><p>And in the meantime, Congress and the White House are actually trying to  find ways to strip bonus recipients of that money.  The chairman and  ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee proposed companies and  individuals play a 90 percent plus tax on all retention awards and  bonuses over $50,000.  And in a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary  Tim Geithner suggested holding back the bonus amount from upcoming  bailout funds for AIG.  But the story continues.</p><p>Joining me now for more on Liddy's testimony today are two congressional  members.  Democratic Congressman Gary Peters of Michigan and Republican  Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota.  Both of them sit on the  subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government Sponsored  Enterprises, which is holding today's hearings.  </p><p>So you both have skin in the game.  You'll both be out there.  I will  start first with Michele Bachmann.  And I like that you're both here.   And I want to explain to our viewers, Michele is a tax litigation  attorney.  Gary has a masters in business administration and law degree.   So you both understand what perhaps can and could not be done regarding  these bonuses.  But, Representative Bachmann, what do you hope to learn  about AIG's use of federal funds regarding the bonuses and how all the  money is being allocated? </p><p>REP. MICHELE BACHMANN, (R) MINNESOTA: Well, there's a number of  questions that I think all the members of the committee will have.   First of all will be, what is the exit strategy to get the American  taxpayer out of AIG and out of these private businesses.  We're only  beginning to learn where all of the tax money has gone from AIG.  At  least $20 billion has gone to pay off foreign investors who've invested  in AIG.  I don't think the American taxpayers signed up to bail out  foreign investors.  This is an economic quagmire.  We need to get the  American taxpayer out of bailing out these failed businesses.  This is  $173 billion plus that we have invested.  It's a black hole.  I don't  think that the American taxpayer should have to pony up any more money  for a failed enterprise like AIG.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Peters, a lot of times you get the American  public huddled before the televisions like it's the landing on the moon  for these things.  Everybody wants to watch it.  And all they see is a  lot of bloviating.  I'm interested to know if there will be fact finding  on your behalf.  What do you want to find out here? </p><p>REP. GARY PETERS, (D) MICHIGAN: Well, I hope there is fact finding.   This should not just be a media circus.  We've got a lot of information  that we need to find out.  Certainly about an exit strategy, which I  think are very good questions.  </p><p>And in terms of the bonus and compensation, which is the -- what  everybody is talking about right now, I think we need to be thinking  generally about compensation in these financial firms and looking at  those compensation matrix and how those are determined.  I think it's --  what is really outrageous to the American public now and myself as well  is that you have individuals at AIG, the very individuals that  contributed to AIG being brought to their knees, losing billions of  dollars, and contributing to this financial mess, getting $160 million  in bonuses.  Basically these individuals failed and they failed in a  spectacular fashion.  How could they . . .</p><p>CLAMAN: I want that deal.  I want that deal.</p><p>PETERS: How could they be rewarded?  Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: I want to be able to fail and get paid so much money.  </p><p>PETERS: How could they be awarded, Alexis (ph).</p><p>CLAMAN: Look, no matter what side of the aisle you're on, House Finance  Committee Chairman Barney Frank struck a cord yesterday when he said we  should approach the AIG situation from the standpoint of the government  and the taxpayer being the owner of the company now.  Let's listen in.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BARNEY FRANK, HOUSE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I think the time  has come to exercise our ownership rights.  We own most of the company.   And then say, as owner, you know, I'm not paying you the bonus.  You  didn't perform.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Bachmann, how much leverage does the government  realistically have in retrieving these bonuses? </p><p>BACHMANN: Well, we have all the leverage in the world.  We do own AIG.   And that's exactly the problem.  I don't want to have the American  taxpayer owning private companies.  That's when we get the government  into extra constitutional business we have no business being in.</p><p>CLAMAN: But now that we do, now that we do, Representative Bachmann, can  we retrieve the bonuses? </p><p>BACHMANN: Sure, we can do anything we want to do.  But what we need to  do is get out and stop pouring money down a black hole.  Just like we  should not have the Obama administration running Detroit with GN or  Chrysler.  This is what will happen.  We'll see more of this the more  government stays involved in private businesses.  We will see more of  these fiascos.  Government was never designed to run private businesses.   We need to get out and we need to return these businesses to the private  hands or they need to fail.  And we need to be prepared to accept that.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Peters, you're the one with the law degree.  Is  there some type of sort of clause that might enable this to get back the  money?  Or is this a red herring and do we need to look at what  Representative Bachmann is talking about and, ooh, let me say it, let  AIG fail? Everybody's so nervous about that and this so-called systemic  risk.  </p><p>PETERS: Well, first off, let me say that I've proposed a bill that I  proposed yesterday that would use the tax code to recover that money for  the taxpayers.  This money is being paid out and to me the best approach  right now would be to put a tax of roughly about 100 percent.  That  brings that money back to the taxpayers where it belongs.  </p><p>It is a bill that only deals with situations where you have substantial  investments of taxpayer money in a company.  In this case, over $170  billion.  And basically my approach is that there shouldn't be any  bonuses paid out until the taxpayers are paid back first.  After the  taxpayers are paid back, the company is free to pay any bonuses they'd  like and have any kind of compensation schedule, but they need to pay  back the taxpayers first.  </p><p>CLAMAN: I just love that.</p><p>BACHMANN: Liz? </p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, go ahead.  </p><p>BACHMANN: Liz?</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p>BACHMANN: The bigger question is, when will we get a pay back of the  tranche of $173 billion.  This was $165 million that was paid out in  bonuses.  What about the $173 billion that the taxpayers have already  invested into AIG?  When will we get paid that money back?  It doesn't  look like it will be any time soon.  And let's not forget, it was the  Obama stimulus bill that contains the clause that prohibits the federal  government from bringing those bonuses back in.  It was a clause slipped  in by Chris Dodd.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, it was.  Yes, it was.</p><p>BACHMANN: And we members of Congress, we were prevented from reading  this bill because we didn't even have the bill online until after  midnight.  We had to debate at 9:00.  </p><p>CLAMAN: And let me end on Representative Peters then.  What about Chris  Dodd slipping that in that actually allowed these bonuses to be given  out?  Quickly, if you could.  </p><p>PETERS: Well, my understand is the deal's going forward.  The bill it  says forward (ph) that these bonuses cannot be paid.  It wasn't backward  looking.  It was forward looking.  It doesn't prohibit us from doing  that now.  Now we need to get a solution, bring that money back to the  taxpayers and bring it back now.</p><p>BACHMANN: No, it actually does.  It actually does (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, I can say this much.  That Henry Paulson, the Treasury  secretary, probably wanted something that allowed those bonuses to  because he came from Wall Street and he has that mentality that, oh, you  can't retain anybody on Wall Street unless you promise them millions in  bonuses.  Folks, and I'm talking to the viewers now, it is an unspoken  word on Wall Street that you get paid $100,000 to $200,000 base salary,  but then the promise of the bonus comes through.  But usually, as I  understand it, to both of you representatives, it's based on  performance.  And we know the performance with AIG was dismal.  </p><p>PETERS: Right.  Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: All right.  Thanks to both of you, Congress members Gary Peters,  Michele Bachmann.  We'll be watching both of you today.  </p><p>BACHMANN: Thanks so much, Liz.  Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: You're welcome.  We'll watch you on the hearing.  </p><p>Washington isn't the only entity going after AIG.  New York Attorney  General Andrew Cuomo looking into taking legal action to try to find  justice for you, the American taxpayer, who has kept the company afloat.   With a closer look at Cuomo's case against AIG, I'm joined by Leslie  Crocker Snyder, a retired New York state supreme court justice and an  Manhattan district attorney candidate.  </p><p>Nice to see you.  </p><p>LESLIE CROCKER SNYDER, RETIRED NY STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: Nice to  see you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, we just had all this storm (ph) and drong (ph) and yelling  and talking of what can be done.  </p><p>SNYDER: Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: You probably are somebody who knows.  Can anything be done? </p><p>SNYDER: Well, there are all sorts of solutions that have been proposed,  as we've just heard.  And we also heard the political spin from each  party, which I think we're going to hear a lot of, you know, criticizing  the administration, not criticizing the administration.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>SNYDER: My interest is really a legal one.  We're all morally outraged.   This is a terrible situation.  But we have to balance that with the law.   So right now we have Attorney General Cuomo, who is looking into whether  or not there was any fraud involved in the original contracts.</p><p>CLAMAN: What would fraud look like?  Tell us what we should be looking  for.  </p><p>SNYDER: Well, I guess it would be if people knew that they would never  be able to pay out these bonuses because losses were occurring in the  derivative section and basically they entered into this with some kind  of fraudulent knowledge.  It could be a number of things.  But remember,  basically we do have the rule of law.  Contracts are sacrosanct unless  there's something wrong with them.  </p><p>So we have to look at the other solutions.  Can we embarrass these  people into not accepting the bonuses?  That seems unlikely, but you  never know.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Well, half of them are -- you know, a couple of them are gone  and most of them are out in London and these are derivatives traders who  probably are kind faceless.  We haven't seen any names.  Cuomo is trying  to get the names.  </p><p>SNYDER: Right.  But we have to find a legal solution is my point.  Maybe  the clawback solution where we deduct the millions from the next payout  would be a reasonable one.  I like that because it seems as if it might  have the cloak of law.  So as much as we're outraged and we have to find  a solution, we have to find a legal solution.  And we can't lose sight  of that.  The public gets morally outraged, but we do operate in a rule  of law.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Absolutely.  Well, in his letter to Congressman Barney Frank,  Andrew Cuomo said it appears AIG had far more perhaps that was  underneath the actual story, the meat of the issue, and so we perhaps  might find more underneath there, but . . .</p><p>SNYDER: Cuomo's lawyers are great.  They're going to conduct a terrific  investigation.  If there's fraud there or something that could undo the  bonuses, they'll find it.  But if there isn't, then we're going to have  to look at, is this contract valid?  Is there some other way to approach  the situation? </p><p>CLAMAN: Now we don't want to do the old ripage (ph) of the contract.   And here on your screen is the actual breakdown here.  Top seven  executives getting more than $4 million each.  I like the 22 with more  than $2 million.  But the bottom one, 11 of these people who got at  least $1 million are no longer at AIG.  And you call them retention  bonuses.  This is a joke.  It's an outrage.  And it really, I think,  hits the crux of the matter.  </p><p>SNYDER: But we all feel that way.  It's outrageous.  And to see these  people leave when they supposedly were being paid this to stay is even  more outrageous.  But at the same time, what I'm saying is, there is a  legal solution here, we just don't know what it is yet.  We're going to  find that legal solution.  You can't start tearing up valid contracts  because then any time one side said, oh this is a bad contract by public  policy.  Let's just unilaterally rip it up.  </p><p>CLAMAN: But if it says -- but if the contract says you have to perform a  job, surely the job wasn't to put the company in the toilet.  </p><p>SNYDER: I agree with that.  So you have to look technically at that  contract and find a way out of it.  You can't just rip it up.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Anybody have a copy?  Anybody have a copy of these contracts?   We'll take it.</p><p>SNYDER: We'll find a way, I am sure, whatever it is.  It might be the  clawback.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Leslie Crocker Snyder, former New York state supreme justice,  former prosecutor, I might add as well.  </p><p>SNYDER: As well, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Tough, tough woman sitting next to me.  </p><p>SNYDER: Oh, I've got a soft side, really, just not for AIG.  </p><p>CLAMAN: I know.  I don't think many Americans do.  Thank you for coming  in.  </p><p>SNYDER: Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: We have some breaking news from \"The New York Post.\"  AIG is  trying to sell its 66-story headquarters in Manhattan for $100 million.   The firm may also try and sell 72 Wall Street, that's the union which  represents Dorman and Porters (ph).  And that may be the potential  buyer.  \"The Post\" is owned by our parent company News Corp., but this  goes back to Bear Stearns and the whole headquarters issue.  What do you  do with the building?  They could sell it and make some money there.  </p><p>SNYDER: Possibility.</p><p>CLAMAN: Then how do they run the business?  </p><p>SNYDER: That's another question.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you, Leslie, very much.  </p><p>Keep the e-mails coming folks, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>Coming up, major news on the tech front.  If you're just waking up,  we've got reports that IBM is ready to make a massive deal that could  move the tech sector -- huge -- with a big name that was so hot during  the dot-com go-go era.  </p><p>And later on Fox Business, I'll have an exclusive interview with  AutoNation President Mike Maroone.  AutoNation preparing to make a major  announcement today.  It involves anyone buying a car from them.  They  are the nation's largest auto dealer.  Wait till you hear this news,  exclusively at 3:30 p.m. on a count down to the closing bell right here  with me and the rest of the Fox Business Network.  </p><p>Stay tuned.  Much more coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: So we've got some major tech headlines this morning.  This is  fun.  Action here in the business world.  \"The Wall Street Journal\"  reporting that IBM is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems.  Yes, Java, big  blue could pay $6.5 billion in cash.  And then Oracle, the software  giant, releasing earnings today after the bell.  Fox Business' Shibani  Joshi joining me now with more.  </p><p>What do you want to start with?  There's just so many good stories.</p><p>SHIBANI JOSHI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: I know, there's so much god stuff.   It's great stuff.  </p><p>Well, let's talk about this big merger going on today.  IBM potentially  buying Sun Microsystems in cash, $6.5 billion.  Now, Sun Microsystems  has been long called an acquisition target for many, many years.  IBM,  Dell, HP, all the names that are being throwing out there or have been  thrown out there that could potentially be interested in the company.   IBM apparently in the works of making a move out there.  And you can see  what the stock price of Sun is, about $5, and the deal would be actually  double the stock price right now.  IBM trying to become more of the Wal- Mart of the technology industry.  The one-stop shop.  The place that you  go to for hardware and software.  It's just so big . . .</p><p>CLAMAN: That's 100 percent premium for that price.</p><p>JOSHI: One hundred percent premium.  But this stock price has been  battered.  And it's a $5 stock.  And as you mentioned, it was the  darling of the technology sector when the boom happened.  No longer,  though.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Interesting.  And let's go to Oracle.  </p><p>JOSHI: Oracle.  Great company.  This -- the earnings are coming out  after the close today.  You know, this company's interesting because,  look, there's no such thing as recession resistant in this industry,  recession proof, but this company's very recession resistant in the fact  a lot of their revenues and their sales are recurring.  So they've  locked in contracts.  They have a licensed business.  And basically they  have recurring revenue coming in month after month after month.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Keep this chart up.  Keep this chart up.  Everybody look at it  right now.  It's rare to see any 52-week chart where there isn't a  massive drop off.  Look at Oracle.  Not necessarily at its 52-week  highs, but it's not that far from it, at least halfway.  And this -- I  find that interesting. They're doing business properly in a tough  climate.  </p><p>JOSHI: Right.  And that's because of this recurring revenue phenomenon  that the company has.  The company's also been doing some amazing cost  cutting initiatives.  Also been buying back stocks.  So that's helped to  stabilize earnings per share.  </p><p>Overall, people expecting 32 cents a share.  Probably going to come in  line.  Friedman Billings and Ramsey thinks it's going to come in a  little bit under.  But even still, this company is -- this is one of the  companies you want to bet on to stay more stabilized in whatever is  going to happen over the next six to nine months.  </p><p>CLAMAN: I find it fascinating the Nasdaq had a great day yesterday.</p><p>JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Up double digits.  </p><p>JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Is it tech stocks that will lead us out of this recession? </p><p>JOSHI: It's so hard to say because a lot of people say, yes, because  these companies are cash rich, they're debt less or debt low.  And  they're innovating.  You know want, it's so remarkable, and what I  always talk about when I'm at the Nasdaq is, this is the stuff that you  want to watch and pay attention to in these very volatile times.  These  companies are starting to play offense.  We've got Microsoft, IBM, Cisco  all making big announcements.  They're coming out and investing just  (ph) for the long term.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Shibani Joshi is your woman when those numbers come out.  Thank  you very much.</p><p>JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Coming up, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas joining us  live to talk about what lawmakers are doing to get money back from AIG.   And that is now your money.  </p><p>And California here he comes.  President Obama heading to the golden  state today.  We'll tell you what's on tap there.  </p><p>Much more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST on the way.  We're so happy you're joining  us this Tuesday morning -- Wednesday.  Wednesday.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm  Gavin Gray in London, standing in this week for Ashley Webster.  </p><p>A check on the European markets so far.  Let's start where, well, where  it's best, I'm afraid.  The only bit of green on the board.  Frankfurt  DAX up 17 points just over the 4,000 barrier there.  That a rise of  about 0.4 percent.  To Paris.  I'm afraid the CAC 40 has come down now.   It did start the morning in positive territory.  But down almost five  points.  And over to the FTSE, which only for a few moments went into  green.  It spent the rest of the day in red and it's currently there,  down almost 30 points.  </p><p>And a little bit about unemployment today.  We've had the figures out.   Unemployment up to over 2 million in the U.K.  That's about 6.5 percent  of the workforce.  It was a step rise and one that's caused a bit of a  shock over here.  </p><p>Back to you, Jenna.  </p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.  </p><p>Good morning, once again, everyone.  We're going to update you here on  the AIG saga.  </p><p>AIG's CEO Ed Liddy ready to face the music on Capitol Hill today.  He'll  likely be grilled about $165 million in bonuses paid to employees at the  very unit that led to AIG's near collapse.  Liddy has defended the  bonuses, saying AIG was contractually obligated to pay them.  In fact,  in an op-ed piece in today's \"Washington Post,\" Liddy says, \"in America,  when you owe people money, you pay them.\"  Earlier on MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST, we spoke with Representative Jim Himes, who had the chance to  met with Liddy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM HIMES, (D) CONNECTICUT: Well, I had the opportunity to sit with  Mr. Liddy in my office yesterday.  And what I told him was, you know,  it's not just important that the right thing happen, but that the right  thing be seen to happen.  So I said, you know, look, my experience is  that 10 very smart lawyers in a room can make just about anything  happen.  So, please, get 10 lawyers in a room and figure out how to fix  this.  And if you can't do that, get these 73 people that are receiving  these bonuses together in a conference room and say, folks, this is the  time to stand up and do the right thing for your country.  Give back the  money.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEE: Give back the money.  The Treasury Department and several senators  are looking at ways to get the money back from AIG or from the  individual employees.  </p><p>Well, the family of a Connecticut woman violently attacked by a  chimpanzee is suing for $50 million in damages from the chimps owner.   Lawyers for Charla Nash allege Sandra Herold, the chimp's owner, was  liable for the attack as a result of her negligence and recklessness in  caring for the ape.  They claim Herold knew about the chimp's violent  history and did not do enough to protect people.  </p><p>All right.  You're up-to-date here on the Fox Business Network.  Coming  up, we're going to see if prices for your groceries are falling with the  latest Consumer Price Index number.  That's next on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  coming up at 8:30 Eastern Time.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: And happy Wednesday.  Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm  Liz Claman.  Alexis Glick is off today.  </p><p>I want to take a quick look at the futures here.  We've pretty much been  languishing slightly below positive territory here.  That would be  negative, Liz.  Dow Jones Industrials down 53 points.  Those are the  futures numbers.  S&amp;P, which gives us a better sense of how the markets  might open, showing some red on the screen, down 4.40.  The Nasdaq down  about 3.  Remember, we're coming off a triple digit gain for the Dow  Jones Industrials, which was a really strong move for the Nasdaq  yesterday.  And that was, what, five days out of six that we were moving  higher.  </p><p>We are awaiting the release of the February Consumer Price Index, the  CPI.  And analyst estimates, the all items CPI climbed by 0.4 percent  last month.  That would actually mark the second consecutive increase.   Let's get the number right now.  </p><p>MCSHANE: Al right, Liz, appreciate it.  </p><p>And here comes the number coming down.  And we'll see whether or not if  we did get the increase or not.  CPI up 0.4 percent.  So there you have  it, exactly what you would expect.  Ex food and energy, up 0.2 percent.   The consensus had been for a 0.1 percent gain on that particular metric  there.  So up 0.4 percent on the headline figure.  Up 0.2 percent when  you back out the so-called food and energy volatile prices there.  </p><p>Now, the year-over-year increase, .2 percent.  The consensus had been  for that to be unchanged year-over-year, so it actually went up a little  bit on that measure.  And when you take out food and energy on a yearly  basis, it was up 1.8 percent.  </p><p>So that is the CPI figure there.  As you see it, the only other thing  that's coming out right now is the current account deficit, which is  $132.8 billion, a little bit less than the consensus, $137 billion, that  had been expected.  </p><p>Now, a quick look at the markets to see how we are reacting to these  figures.  Liz showed you that the futures were down exactly as they are  now, by 50-plus points on the Dow, and about 4 on the S&amp;P futures.  </p><p>So, again, CPI going up, and that's exactly what we expected, Liz, with  the consensus on the core rate.  A little bit above -- I should say the  consensus was a little below the actual number, which was .2 on the  core.  </p><p>Back to you.</p><p>CLAMAN:  And always important to point out that the Consumer Price Index  is really -- for folks who don't understand the CPI -- it's basically  inflation at the consumer level, for what you pay out there.  </p><p>Joining me now with instant analysis of the February Consumer Price  Index, Stephen Leeb, president of Leeb Capital Management, and Matt  McCall, the president of Penn Financial Group.  </p><p>Stephen, this number...</p><p>STEPHEN LEEB, PRESIDENT, LEEB CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Half full, half  empty.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Yes, but why are we even looking at inflation right now?   Should we be?  </p><p>LEEB:  Well, you know, I think, Liz, before we know it, we should be  looking at it.  I mean, this is an economy that I think once it  recovers, and if we get this banking crisis under control, which I think  we will one of these days, this recovery could be breathtaking, and it  could lead very, very quickly to a lot of inflation.</p><p>CLAMAN:  That is an interesting point.  </p><p>Just as quickly as economists were caught flat-footed by this downturn,  could they well be caught by an upturn?  </p><p>MATT MCCALL, PRESIDENT, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP:  Absolutely.  And a lot of  economists are talking about deflation right now.  And I'm on the  opposite side of the field.  </p><p>I think inflation is going to be a major issue.  When you're really  spending $3 trillion, and you have to budget that, where's that money  coming from?  </p><p>You're going to have to raise rates, and it's going to lead to  inflation.  And at the end of the day, if you're not ready for this, and  you don't have your portfolio set, you could really be caught like you  just said, like economists were.  </p><p>LEEB:  Well, you know, Liz, if you look at some of the data that's  coming, I mean, oil prices from $35 to nearly $50.  And this economy  down 6 percent.  What's going to happen when we're growing by 2 percent?  </p><p>Copper prices up 20 percent.  I mean, you've had this tremendous rally  in commodities, even before we've gotten off the tarmac in this economy.   Imagine what happens when the world really starts to grow.  There is  going to be no natural resources.</p><p>CLAMAN:  And what about this theory that we have printed so much money,  that the value of the dollar will eventually go down and inflation will  rear its head?  </p><p>MCCALL:  Absolutely.  I mean, you have to play, if you're looking at  stocks, what is going to -- how do you play a falling dollar?  You look  global.  How do you play inflation?  Gold kips (ph).  </p><p>And I'm actually putting my money where my mouth is.  I've been buying  kips (ph) over the last couple months, I've been buying gold over the  last couple of years, setting up for what could possibly be  hyperinflation.  </p><p>LEEB:  I have no argument with him.  I'd love to argue with him, but  no...</p><p>CLAMAN:  Fight him.  Come on.  </p><p>LEEB:  I can't.  No, I mean, kips (ph) and gold are probably our largest  positions right now.  I mean, it's not so much the dollar.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Even though gold touched $1,000 a couple of weeks ago?  And  look at it now.  It's down $10 at the moment to $906.  Is this a buying  opportunity?  </p><p>LEEB:  Yes, it is.  I mean, can gold go to $850 or $800?  Absolutely.   But just look at gold the last eight years.  What asset has finished  every year in the last 8 higher than it was the year before?   </p><p>CLAMAN:  But let's go back to consumer prices.  We do see a slight  uptick, of course, of the core rate, which often sort of strips out the  very volatile food and energy prices, although energy is not so volatile  lately.  But the consumer, how will he or she feel it out there?  </p><p>MCCALL:  I think they're going to feel -- going to the food, I mean, we  all go to the grocery store every day.  And when we see how the prices - - they have not come down.  </p><p>Even though this economy has come down, our wages have come down, prices  at the grocery store have not come down.  Maybe we're buying the private  label versus the brand name; however, those prices are still high.  And  once we see wheat prices, corn prices start picking back up again, as  you spoke of earlier with the commodity prices, we're going to see even  higher prices for the consumer.</p><p>CLAMAN:  By the way, we got General Mills' numbers earlier this morning,  and they actually missed estimates.  But interestingly enough, they  upped their full-year guidance, and commodity prices are down.  They're  still managing to make money.  Something tells me that when they hiked  those cereal prices -- remember that?</p><p>LEEB:  Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN:  ... or they made the boxes smaller but kept the price the same,  they still have pricing power.  </p><p>LEEB:  Liz, what you have to understand, there are 2.3 billion people in  China and India.  These economies are still growing.  So are the Middle  Eastern economies.</p><p>At least half the world is still growing.  And that half is the world  that needs commodities in order to grow.  They need evermore  commodities.  </p><p>In this country, we can grow without using additional commodities.   Europe can grow without using additional commodities.  But the engine of  this world need commodities in order to grow.  </p><p>MCCALL:  And as the middle class grows, more food.</p><p>LEEB:  Everything more.  Moving up the food chain.</p><p>CLAMAN:  I'm not hearing either of you say buy equities.  You're not  saying that now.  </p><p>LEEB:  Well, I think buy selected equities.</p><p>CLAMAN:  That are related to commodities?  </p><p>LEEB:  Well, that are related to inflation.  I mean, you know, growth  stocks that -- I think, you know, basically any company that came  through 2008, which I think is kind of a microcosm for what to expect  over the next five to 10 years, inflation, deflation, et cetera, is  probably a good buy.  Stocks like TEVA, for example, stocks like CVS.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Do you own those?  </p><p>LEEB:  Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN:  What about you?  </p><p>MCCALL:  I do.  I like stocks here, but you have to be a stock picker.   But I think the two areas that I'm looking at, one is market turns,  emerging markets and commodities, both based on this commodity inflation  play.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Stephen, Matt, thanks to both of you.  </p><p>LEEB:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN:  They're liking gold right now.  What can I say?  And copper.  </p><p>Let me guess, you like palladium, too?  </p><p>LEEB:  Yes!  </p><p>CLAMAN:  I knew he liked palladium!</p><p>LEEB:  And platinum.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Nickel and zinc as well.  </p><p>LEEB:  We're compatriots.  I didn't know him the first time I met you.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN:  Coming up, we'll see if Apple's big iPhone update gave its  stock a big boost with a look at the Fox 50.  </p><p>And then in 90 seconds, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas joining me  live to talk about the growing outrage from lawmakers in Washington over  the bonuses handed out by AIG.  And what about her colleagues who took  money from the troubled insurer?  </p><p>A lot of answering that we are expecting here, but stay tuned.  We've  got much more than that on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>PAYNE:  The Fox 50 returning to its winning ways yesterday.  Our index  gained 17 points to close at 584.  </p><p>This morning, there is word of a posible merger in the index.  IBM could  buy Sun Microsystems.  </p><p>For more, I'm joined by Matt McCall, the president of Penn Financial  Group.  </p><p>Let's start with Apple real quick, though.</p><p>The stock was up big time yesterday.  It had been floating around.  It  looks like it's on the cusp of a major breakout through $100.  Is it all  about updating their software or is there more to it?  </p><p>MCCALL:  I think there's more to it.  I mean, updating the software, the  good news always gives Apple, you know, a bit of a bounce.  People love  hearing the new products coming out.  </p><p>However, I think Apple is just a value at this level.  If you're looking  for growth plays, looking for something to play off the consumer turning  around, Apple's the best play.  I own the stock and think it's a great  long-term...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE:  You got a target on it?  </p><p>MCCALL:  You know, I'm looking at about $120 is the next couple of  months.  If it breaks through -- like you just said, if it gets through  that $100 level, it's going to take off.  But it's been struggling there  over the last few weeks.</p><p>PAYNE:  IBM in the news in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning,  perhaps buying Sun Micro $6.5 billion.  Do you like the deal?  IBM just  down a little bit on that news.   </p><p>MCCALL:  I think it's a good deal.  I think they're picking up on cheap  -- I mean, Sun's down 71 percent over the last 12 months.  Even though  you're paying 100 percent premium, I think it's a nice play.  </p><p>And you look at IBM stock over the last couple of years, it's one of the  few big tech stocks that's held up very well.  So it's one of those --  you know, the grandmother stock.  Your grandmother can buy IBM and throw  it in her basket.</p><p>PAYNE:  Do you own any?  </p><p>MCCALL:  I do own some IBM, yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  Really?  Good.  Good.  </p><p>All right.  We've got to talk about Coca-Cola.  This is really  interesting.  </p><p>We've seen some saber rattling out of China with respect to holding out  treasuries.  We think something is going on here behind the scenes.  Now  they're rejecting a possible takeover of Coke, one of their largest  fruit juice companies, $2.4 billion bid for high-end juice.  </p><p>What do you make of this and what's the impact going to be on IBM?  </p><p>MCCALL:  I think eventually it's going to get through.  I think this  deal will eventually get through.  Maybe not this company...</p><p>PAYNE:  IBM's already said though -- I think they've said already this  morning that they're not going to pursue it any more.  I'm sorry, Coke.  </p><p>MCCALL:  Coke.</p><p>PAYNE:  Obviously IBM's not going to pursue it.</p><p>MCCALL:  They'll take a different angle.  I think they want to get in  China.  They know the growth potential in China.  They're going to get  over there.</p><p>The one concern though with Coke, in looking at the way the stock has  performed recently, it's gotten hit because of the dollar.  I mean, the  dollar has risen, and they're such a global company, but I think the  U.S. dollar is going to fall in the next, let's say, 12 to 18 months.   So this is a play on the falling U.S. dollar, it is a play on growth.  </p><p>But as a stock, I don't know.  And I think there's a lot more exciting  plays out there right now.</p><p>PAYNE:  Well, let's talk about something that's been really exciting  recently, Bank of America.  The chairman, he's really been on the  offensive here recently.  Now talking about possibly paying back TARP  money this year.  </p><p>A, do you believe him?  And B, could this help the stock?  It was edging  up before we came on air.  It was edging just a little bit higher.  </p><p>MCCALL:  I mean, how can you believe him?  I mean, honestly, I don't  believe a word out of anybody's mouth from Wall Street to the White  House anymore.  I think (INAUDIBLE) research.  Buying Bank of America  here, it's like throwing a dart.  I mean, it's probably going to be one  to make it out.  </p><p>I'm much prefer...</p><p>PAYNE:  You just said you want excitement.  This is exciting.  </p><p>MCCALL:  It's exciting, but I also want to get some sleep at night as  well.  So I don't like it here.  I like J.P.  Morgan, Goldman Sachs,  Morgan Stanley.  Those are the three that I'd be looking at.  Not as  exciting as a Bank of America or Citigroup, but a much better risk  reward play.</p><p>PAYNE:  Right, less risk.  And...</p><p>MCCALL:  And the reward is still high.  I mean, I think you have a lot  of upside on all three of those stocks.</p><p>PAYNE:  Thanks a lot, Matt.  Really appreciate it.</p><p>MCCALL:  Thanks, Charles.</p><p>(NEWSBREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN:  Lawmakers are up in arms over the $165 million bonuses handed  out to American International Group.  And the head of the Senate Banking  Committee, Chris Dodd of Connecticut, says he supports his colleagues'  calls to recoup the taxpayer funds.  </p><p>Dodd, though, has received nearly $300,000 over 20 years from the failed  insurer.  And folks, you know what?  He's not alone.  The list is  legion, including both Republicans and Democrats who took money from  AIG.</p><p>But here now to weigh in on the topic, Republican Senator Kay Bailey  Hutchison of Texas.  </p><p>Welcome, Senator.  Thank you for joining us.  </p><p>SEN. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON (R), TEXAS:  Thank you, liz.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Well, let me ask you, first, did you take any money from AIG in  campaign contributions?  </p><p>HUTCHISON:  Liz, I don't know.  I'm so sorry.  I don't know.  I have not  even looked at my contribution list with regard to that.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  It's never come up?  Really?</p><p>HUTCHISON:  I have a very firm opinion about these bonuses.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Yes.</p><p>HUTCHISON:  You know, regardless of whether I have -- and we can  certainly check that -- I think that what the executives are doing is  outrageous.  I think retention bonuses for people who have already left  is just not acceptable to the American people.</p><p>CLAMAN:  I'm sure, because it's become such a hot-button issue here.  We  have received this morning alone hundreds and hundreds of e-mails.  </p><p>What are your constituents telling you, Senator?  </p><p>HUTCHISON:  Oh, they're outraged.  They're outraged by all of the big  spending that scares people to death with the debt that we have and the  deficits that we are accumulating.  </p><p>They are outraged by these bailouts.  Some are to big to fail, some are  not.  The bailout mania, I think, has just gone out of control, and  that's what I'm hearing from my constituents.  </p><p>And you know, Liz, there is more of a fear factor than I've known in my  lifetime right now, because they see the problem, but they don't see a  solution that is going to work.  And that's what I'm hearing.</p><p>CLAMAN:  These bonuses have everybody so riled up, Senator, as you know.   But are we missing the bigger picture?  And that is that when the TARP  was pushed through initially, it just wasn't put in place where there  were handcuffs that would prevent this kind of thing from happening,  even though people demanded it.  </p><p>Did Congress members read this closely enough?  Why didn't they ensure  that something would be put in that would prevent us down the road from  facing this angst and anger?  </p><p>HUTCHISON:  I think that is a very legitimate criticism.  I do.  </p><p>Originally, Secretary Paulson asked for no strings at all, wanted $700  billion, and said that the global economy was going to crash if we  didn't do it.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  I remember.</p><p>HUTCHISON:  We didn't give him a no-strings-attached opening of the  Treasury.  We cut it to $350 billion.  </p><p>We did put parameters around it.  But clearly, we did not foresee all of  the things that these people would do, like take trips, like give  bonuses.  We just thought that there would be a factor where all of  these executives would come together like Americans come together to  solve problems, and that they would do the right thing.  </p><p>That was a mistaken assumption.  However, now, Liz, we are not learning  from that mistake, and we are continuing to throw money at problems  without the necessary restraint and parameters put around it.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Sure.  Are you, Senator -- are you of the belief we can't let  AIG go down because something horrible will happen?  </p><p>HUTCHISON:  Well, as I understand it, AIG has such a global impact  because it is an insurer of last resort in so many areas.  And that's  why the original AIG bailout came from the Treasury, because Mr.  Bernanke saw that as well.  </p><p>Now we actually have put 80 percent of the company's capital on the line  from American taxpayers, and I just think we've got to take a stronger  control here.  And we can't own 80 percent of a company and have  executives taking bonuses for retention when they've already left.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Do you think...</p><p>HUTCHISON:  Let me say, too, Liz, I think you all talked about this  earlier today.  The contracts have already been breached.  So to say  this is a contractual obligation, when they have not met the performance  standards that are in the contract, I think does bring into question  that we would have the power to do more.</p><p>CLAMAN:  I'm absolutely with you on that.  A contract, I absolutely  believe, should be held up.  But when the other side doesn't deliver  what they promised, that's a problem.  </p><p>An opinion article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" yesterday said this:  \"The politicians prefer to talk about AIG's latest bonus payments  because they deflect attention from Washington's failure to supervise  AIG.\"</p><p>How do you respond to that, Senator?  </p><p>HUTCHISON:  I think it's valid.  I think that the regulatory reform that  is needed for AIG and for our financial institutions, and for the  institutions that are doing all of these fancy derivatives that have  been virtually unregulated, must be regulated in a responsible way.  We  don't want to go overboard, but we certainly know where the vacancies  are in our regulatory system today, and we need to address that.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Senator, one of your constituents just shot us an e-mail,  wanted to get it to you.  Neil Lewis in Granbury, Texas, says, \"Why are  we outraged at the bonuses when we are supporting foreign banks to the  tunes of tens of billions of dollars?\"</p><p>Now, just to clarify, foreigners have bought a lot of our debt.  So this  is perhaps a hairier, more complex issue.  But do you have an answer for  him?  </p><p>HUTCHISON:  Well, I think that it's correct to say that some of this  stimulus or bailout money has gone to foreign banks.  Part of it AIG.   And that is an area that we need to look at, where this money is going,  and have more strings on it so that we assure that our financial  institutions are being shored up, but also that they're getting credit  out there.  </p><p>You say, what are my constituents saying?  My constituents are saying  they cannot get credit in the marketplace.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Still, after all of that?</p><p>HUTCHISON:  My small businesses, my medium-size businesses cannot get  credit.  My auto dealers cannot get credit.  It is -- that's what we've  got to address.  And where all of this money is going from the bailout,  into foreign coffers, I think is a legitimate question, of course.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Last question.  Quickly, do you think Treasury Secretary Tim  Geithner has a handle on this?  </p><p>HUTCHISON:  Well, I have to say that I don't see that he has come  forward with a plan that can work.  We don't see credit flowing.  </p><p>I think that we made mistakes last fall, but we have not learned from  those mistakes this spring.  And I am very concerned that he is not on  top of it, and that we have got to get a handle on the financial  situation and the housing situation and stop all these stimulus packages  until we correct that.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Very sensible talking from you this morning, Senator.  Thank  you.</p><p>Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.  </p><p>HUTCHISON:  Thank you, Liz.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Any time.</p><p>Coming up, we have a look at \"The One Thing You Should Know.\" </p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN:  And now it's time for \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>And that is people are still buzzing over AIG's bonus handouts.  We've  been getting your e-mails all morning long.  We wanted to read a few  more.  Thank you so much for sending them.  </p><p>Time to dig -- and so let's read some of these e-mails.  We'll dig into  the mail bag and see what everybody is talking about.  </p><p>Glenn in Auburn, Alabama talks about AIG employees who are threatening  to leave if they don't get their bonuses.  Ah, yes.  He says, \"These  people caused the problems!  So what if they leave?  Good riddance!\"</p><p>PAYNE:  Well, the point is, half of them are already gone.</p><p>CLAMAN:  I know.  They left with the money.  See, they're smarter than  we are.</p><p>LEE:  Left with the money, yes.</p><p>Robert of Charleston, South Carolina, says, \"Almost anything the  government or AIG does to address the utter audacity of this scandal  will be hard to trust.\"</p><p>So that's the next kind of chapter of this problem, right?</p><p>CLAMAN:  And remember, Fox Business will be carrying that at 10:00 a.m.  Eastern today, the hearing on Capitol Hill.</p><p>PAYNE:  By the way, guys, ,on that trust issue, how can private funds  trust the government not to limit their profits if they go into this  partnership on these toxic assets, considering the uproar?  Because  billions are going to be made on that if it's done right.  </p><p>Bill Stevens of Jamestown, North Carolina, asks, \"Where was Timothy  Geithner on this issue?  Where was he when agreements were extended  under his watch?  I'll tell you what -- out to lunch -- like he is on  all other economic issues.\"</p><p>CLAMAN:  It was interesting.  Did you just see Senator Kay Bailey  Hutchison?  She took a breath when I said does Tim Geithner have a  handle on this?  Granted, he's got to have a handle on a bunch of other  issues, too.  So it's very tough out there.</p><p>LEE:  Yes, she did kind of...</p><p>PAYNE:  But he's the number one guy.  We need confidence in him, and  obviously very few people have confidence.</p><p>CLAMAN:  If he's there, you have got to have confidence in these people.  </p><p>Keep the e-mails coming, folks, moneyforbreakfast @foxbusiness.com.   It's very important that you e-mail us and let us know, because we are  the one network who is letting your e-mails be, you know, read.  And we  understand how this feels.  </p><p>But we've got to move this discussion forward.  The dialogue has to move  forward from, yes, we're totally annoyed, to what's going to happen?  </p><p>LEE:  And speaking of moving it forward, you have a big interview coming  up on \"THE CLOSING BELL\" today.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Mike Maroone of AutoNation.  He's the president of the nation's  largest auto dealer.  They have a huge announcement, exclusively right  here on Fox Business.  It affects every single person who wants to buy  any kind of car from these AutoNation dealers.  </p><p>So stay tuned for that.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  Well, I'll definitely be watching.</p><p>CLAMAN:  \"COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL,\" 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  </p><p>Thank you so much for joining us.  We hope you have a great day.   </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

And lawmakers are on the  move to retrieve the money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Drug lords, kidnappings and now trade tariffs is this what we get for  the $10 billion in aid the U.S. gives to Mexico?  We've got a hot debate  straight ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And does IBM have sunny days ahead?  If you're just waking up here comes  the sun -- IBM wanting to buy Sun Microsystems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We've got the latest.  We're serving all that and so much more for you  right here on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p> Well, good morning everybody.  Welcome to a special edition of MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.  The AIG America's out outraged.  I am Liz Claman.  Alexis  Glick is off today.</p><p> We're going to have much more on all this anger, this drama stemming  from the AIG bonuses, and so much of it, we know it's coming from you.</p><p> And we actually really do want to hear from you.  Are you outraged?  But  specifically, why?  Don't just say, \"Yes, I'm furious.\"  We want to know  why you're outrage and you can actually email us right here at  <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email> and we'll actually share those with  you later in the show.  We'll read what some of you have to say.</p><p> But first let's get you caught up on the futures here and this after a  day where we had a triple digit gain for the DOW Jones Industrial.   Futures are lower today at the moment DOW Jones Industrial futures down  44 but we tend to look more at the S&amp;P futures, they give you a better  sense of what might happen with the market, they're down nearly five  points; the NASDAQ down four.</p><p> Let's send it right now to Connell McShane at the Fox Business desk with  the very latest.  He's got earnings out from General Mills -- Connell.</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  They look a little light, Liz,  $3.79 a share X-items has been the number that's been reported by  General Mills but the Street's looking for $0.88, so light on that  front.  Interesting to point out that the company says it's raising its  guidance for the full year but when you look at it the guidance is still  light, of where the Street estimate is.  You see where the stock close  yesterday $3.38 to $3.87 for the full year, $3.94 is the estimate.  So  the top end of the guidance at $3.87 is still light of the estimate.</p><p> General Mills among other things talking about currency translations  hurting their earnings a little bit, reducing sales growth by three  percentage points.  The currency translation so GIS, General Mills  certainly will a stock to watch today here, Liz.  This one is down about  11 percent with the markets so far this year.</p><p> But the earnings look light, we'll have more on it later on the morning,  right now back over to you.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Yes, we'll be talking much more about General Mills because  clearly you cannot ignore Count Chocolate and Boo Berry.  Very  important.</p><p> MCSHANE:  I know it.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Thank you Connell.</p><p> As I mentioned we're taking a closer look at this hour at the outrage  over AIG.  So let's start with the latest news, first off, Chairman and  CEO of American International Group Ed Liddy pulling up a chair at a  Congressional witness table today.  This one is going to be so closely  watched he will take massive heat.  I promise you every lawmaker is  going to want to make his or her voice heard very loudly, this over the  more than $200 million in bonuses.</p><p> Meanwhile, Congress and the White House trying to find ways to strip  bonus recipients of the money they got.  Some of these people are not  even with the company anymore and they we're getting millions and  million of dollars worth.</p><p> The chairman of ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee proposed  companies and individuals pay a 35 percent tax on all retention awards  and bonuses over $50,000.</p><p> And in a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner suggesting  holding back the bonus amount from upcoming bailout funds for AIG.</p><p> There are all kinds of ideas being thrown out here on how to get the  money back but do you have ideas, I mean, how angry are you over this  bonus debacle?  If you are steamed, you're not alone we're not just  talking about lawmakers.</p><p> Fox Business's senior Washington correspondent, Peter Barnes is in our  Washington Bureau with the results -- Peter a new Pew Research Center  Poll, boy they gets these things out pretty quickly, what do we see?</p><p> PETER BARNES, FBN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Well that's right,  Liz, the AIG bonus controversy a possible big political headache for  President Obama if the financial bailout doesn't work and if he has to  go back to Congress later for more money to help banks.</p><p> The White House continuing to express outrage about the bonuses,  distancing itself from the controversy and trying to get out in front of  the story that was inevitably going to dominate the headlines anyway.</p><p> But the President remains fully vested in a bank rescue plan, he voted  for it as a Senator.  And as President he says it is critical to  reviving bank lending and the economy.</p><p> On Monday, the Pew Research Center released the poll that found that 87  percent of people are outright angry about or at least bothered by bank  bailouts.</p><p> In the poll, despite their anger, people still supported bank rescues as  a policy 48 percent to 40 percent.  But the poll was taken last week  before revelations of the AIG bonuses.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MICHAEL DIMOCK, PEW RESEARCH CENTER:  I think if anything this has  intensified the emotional feeling that people have.  Again, they've been  giving a clear example of the downside of this policy the problems with  the way that this money is being spent.  I think that intensifies the  anger now.  Whether it's going to undermine the support for the policy,  it's something that we're going to need to see how it plays out.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARNES:  Now, the President has to be somewhat careful on how he plays  the AIG bonus controversy, Dimock says.  His job approval rating is  starting to slip.  The PEW poll shows it down five points from February  to March, Dimock says mainly over public concern about his stimulus  plan, his budget and how they will increase the deficit as well as some  concern over his foreign policy.</p><p> But the President did include a $750 billion placeholder in his budget  for more funding for bank bailouts if he needs it.  Being outraged about  how AIG now may leave the President in a delicate political position,  later with Congress and voters trying to turn a negative consequence of  the bailout, taxpayer money going to big bonuses into a positive,  cleaning up the system by continuing those very bailouts.</p><p> Liz, back to you.</p><p> CLAMAN:  There is no way Peter, anybody is going rubber-stamp more  spending with these AIG bonuses unless this gets resolved.   Unbelievable.  Thanks for the PEW Research Center.</p><p> BARNES:  No way, you're right.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Yes, here take my money.</p><p> BARNES:  Yes.</p><p> CLAMAN:  The AIG bonus was the talk of the halls on Capitol Hill  yesterday.  Massachusetts Congressman and Chairman of the House  Financial Services Committee Barney Frank was confounded by Ed Liddy of  AIG's reasoning for payment of the bonuses.  Listen in.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. BARNEY FRANK, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE:   Mr. Liddy gave two arguments.  One, was my hands are tied legally but  the other was a policy argument.  He doesn't want to rescind them  because he wants to retain those people.  I am very skeptical that  retaining the people who made the mistakes is a good idea.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CLAMAN:  For more on today's hearings and this outrage that we know so  many of you are feeling, I am joined now by Democratic Congressman Jim  Himes of Connecticut and Republican Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito  of West Virginia.  Both served on the House Financial Services  Committee.</p><p> Well, did you bring your boxing gloves?  Both of you, I can only  imagine...</p><p> REP. JIM HIMES (D), CONNECTICUT:  Good morning Liz.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Ed Liddy sitting in front of you.  I will start with the  Representative Himes.  Give me a sense of what you want and need to hear  from Ed Liddy today.</p><p> HIMES:  Well, you know, as you pointed out in your story the outrage is  out there is unbelievable.  And you know, Congress represents the people  and so I think you are going to see some outrage today.</p><p> But you know I had the opportunity to sit with Mr. Liddy in my office  yesterday.  And what I told him was, it's not just important that the  right thing happens but that the right thing be seen to happen.</p><p> So I said, you know look, my experience is that 10 very smart lawyers in  the room can make just about anything happen so please get 10 lawyers in  the room and figure out how to fix this.</p><p> And if you can't do that, get these 73 people that are receiving these  bonuses together in a conference room and say folks, this is the time to  stand up and do the right thing for your country.</p><p> Give back the money.  Because if those two things don't happen, action  will be taken either in the halls of Congress or by the State of  Connecticut where this particular unit is resident.  And it's really  important that they step up and do the right thing not just so that the  many people who have lost their jobs out there see that everybody is in  this together but because as you point out, we are not through  stabilizing the financial sector yet.</p><p> We've got work yet to do and every time something like this happens our  hands get tied.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Representative Moore Capito, Ed Liddy has an op-ed piece in the  \"Washington Post\" today and in it one of the lines that caught my eye  was where he said, \"In America when we owe people money we pay them,  ok.\"  So I think that's not nod to the hall if there is a contract you  can't break it in America we get that.</p><p> We understand that but Representative Himes, just said, get a couple of  lawyers into the room.  We can figure something out here.</p><p>Congress has suggested taxing these bonuses up to 95 percent and  Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner says that he's working on this as well  but what is your solution?  What do you and your brethren in Congress  feel about this?</p><p> SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO (R), WEST VIRGINIA:  Well, I think we recognize  with all of the different programs and policies that are coming forward,  that just this morning as I was coming in the guard said to me something  isn't right.  And we need to make this situation to a point where people  understand what's going on but still reflecting the outrage and the  astonishment of the lack of transparency and the lack of accountability.</p><p> My question to Mr. Liddy will be you knew these were part of the  contract, you knew in good faith and bargaining good faith with the  United States government why were these questions not answered?</p><p> Where is the transparency and accountability of the tax dollars?  Why  did AIG not come forward and if they did, why did the Treasury accept  this as part of the agreement to further fund and to further bailout  this company?</p><p> CLAMAN:  I am glad you brought up the Treasury Secretary.   Representative Himes, we talked about what Treasury Secretary Geithner  wants to do and he says, \"We will impose on AIG in essence a contractual  commitment to pay the Treasury from the operations of the company the  amount of retention awards just paid.  In addition we will deduct the  $30 billion -- deduct from there in assistance an amount basically equal  to the amount of those payments.\"  What does that really mean?  And is  that the solution?</p><p> HIMES:  Well, what that really means is that our taxpayer dollars are  not going to pay bonuses for people who are not just involved but  remember these are folks that were in the unit of AIG that created the  credit defaults swap exposure that brought the company down.</p><p> And so I think as a matter of principle the notion that our hard earned  taxpayer dollars aren't going to provide bonuses to those people is a  pretty good notion.  Now, the Treasury affect debt maybe Congressional  legislation could affect that but frankly, as I said before I'd like to  see AIG stand up and do the right thing here, either by getting those  people together to agree to give back the money or to figure out a way  to get around those contracts.</p><p> And this notion that you can't get around the contract look, all over  this country, firefighters, policeman, teachers are being asked to  reopen their contracts to give back wages and benefits.  So I don't  think it's crazy to say that we ought to take a look at that here.</p><p> CLAMAN:  It's not.  Representative Moore Capito, but the argument out  there also floating around on Wall Street, well, you take away their  bonuses and you're not going to find anybody to these jobs.  Do you buy  that?</p><p> MOORE CAPITO:  Well, I inherently disagree with that, I mean, I think  that you are looking at large financial institutions that were brought  to their knees by basically a lot of greed and over extension of risk.</p><p> And to think that the American spirit and as the young good minds in  this country, would not want to bring these companies back without, you  know, extravagant bonuses, without holding the taxpayer out for more and  more dollars.  I think that's a ridiculous concept.  I don't buy that.</p><p> And I think that the fact that I agree with Jim when he says there are  people all over this country that are taking pay cuts, that are working  for less times, that are losing their jobs, that are making adjustments  in their families and why these employees at AIG and others can not  tighten their belts and make adjustments too or break a contract is just  doesn't pass the snip test.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Representative Himes, you're out there in Connecticut where  most of your constituents and many of them and certainly are hedge fund  people or financial people but you're also looking at constituents who  are looking specifically at Congress and saying, so many members, many  of actually the sub-Committee members have taken money from AIG in the  form of donations.</p><p> How do you answer to that?</p><p> HIMES:  Well, you know the overall campaign finance system is a broken  system and I think you'd find general agreement on that in Congress.</p><p> But look, you raised another very broader and an important point which  is that as the stones get thrown today and rightly so, Congress is not  blame free here.  The product -- the credit defaults swaps that are at  the heart of AIG's mess were explicitly unregulated by an act of  Congress a number of years ago.</p><p> So while this will be a day of popular expression of anger at AIG we  need to not forget that to some degree Congress was complicit in the  mess that grew up at AIG.  And we need to look forward and say, look, we  need a smart set of regulations, not necessarily more regulations, but  smart regulations that are going to prevent this from happening ever  again.  That's our job.  And we've got to step up to do it.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Well, the party starts at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.  I mean,  this is going to be interesting.  Fox Business will be carrying these  grilling of Ed Liddy.  Congress Member Jim Himes and Shelley Moore  Capito, thank you both for joining us.</p><p> MOORE CAPITO:  Thank you.</p><p> HIMES:  Thank you.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Anytime.  We really appreciate your perspective</p><p> And out there, you guys, we want to hear what you think about what is  going on with AIG and certainly how this event in Congress is going to  developer.  Send us an e-mail at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p> Get up out of bed.  Fire up the computer; share some of your thoughts  with us.  We're actually going to be reading some of them coming up.</p><p> We do have a lot of market news here.  General Mills reporting earnings  this morning and giving full year forecast.  You may be eating some of  their food for breakfast.  What's the breakdown in store for the cereal  maker?</p><p> But first, let the sun shine in.  That's what IBM is saying as a massive  computer deal may be in the offing -- the biggest deal possibly that IBM  has ever made?</p><p> Good morning to you.  That's a big news story coming up.  We are back in  two minutes.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  Connell McShane back on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST with some breaking  news out of the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning with an interesting  report that IBM might be in the market to buy Sun Microsystems and pay  $6.5 billion in cash to do so which would be, give or take, a 100  percent premium over the close for Sun yesterday.</p><p> Now let's take a look at the stock prices involved.  You would expect  that Sun Microsystems would be higher and it is.  There is IBM down  about two or three percent in the pre-market; as you see, the bid's  90.25 and the stock had closed just under 93 yesterday.  Sun, ticker  simple JAVA, these days is up to $8.10.  So that's a 60 percent move,  give or take, on the stock so being bid up on the \"Wall Street Journal\"  report again that these two are in talks, Liz, about a possible deal.   That'll be very, very interesting.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Maybe making that deal.  Wouldn't that be interesting to see?</p><p> MCSHANE:  That would be up.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Thank you very much, Connell.  For more on this possible deal  between IBM and Sun Microsystems I'm joined by Emerald Asset  Management's Joe Besecker, and president of Penn Financial Group, Matt  McCall.</p><p> Joe, you wake up and you find out... </p><p> JOE BESECKER, EMERALD ASSET MANAGEMENT:  A jab, a jolt.</p><p> CLAMAN:  The jab, a jolt.  Seriously?  IBM the sleepy -- not sleepy but  the more serious sort of button-down company going for the mavericky so  to speak?</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> BESECKER:  I just like the fact that business is being done out there.   We're back to doing business.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Thank you.</p><p> BESECKER:  We're not talking about -- listen, that's the thing.  IBM is  taking advantage of opportunities that exist out there.  You know, Mark  Twain once said he was rarely able to spot an opportunity until it  ceased to be one.  And so, maybe now the companies will start to pay --  get out from under their desks, start to look for business and do  business.  And that's what I'm excited about.</p><p> Whether or not this is the best deal for IBM or maybe the market's (ph)  thing and maybe they could have gotten it a little bit cheaper?</p><p> CLAMAN:  Exactly that.  I'm wondering, are they overpaying in this  market?  Aren't you supposed to beat somebody down to their last dollar?  </p><p> MATT MCCALL, PRESIDENT, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP:  You are but you figure,  Sun already fell 71 percent in the last year.  So maybe it has been  beaten down already paying at $10 a share, whatever it may be $6.5  billion.  I don't think that is that bad.  I actually think they are  getting a pretty good deal.</p><p> And what I love about this is the synergy that it creates between the  two companies.  But I think we're going to see a lot more mergers going  on in the coming months that creates synergies and using... </p><p> BESECKER:  I hope so.</p><p> MCCALL:  ...and using its beaten down prices and as Joe said this is a  good sign, I think, for the market.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Both make corporate systems.  And I think that that's something  that these corporations who don't depend specifically on Microsoft  Windows, for example, are very interested in seeing who gets nervous  over this.  Is it Hewlett-Packard, the big competitor?</p><p> BESECKER:  Go back to what I'm saying.  Now it puts us in a position  where people start to think strategically about business again.  How do  we deploy money?  How do we go out and do things?</p><p> So yes, I think Hewlett-Packard has to be concerned about this.  I think  in general, IBM does a lot of service business.  I think this will add  to the service.  And they penetrate different areas they may not have  had.</p><p> It appears to get customers and get customers cheaply and that's what  they're doing because that customer base is an annuity that brings all  that money in.  Oracle reports today or tomorrow, that is the only thing  that's going to go well for them.  And so you want to have growth as  well and I think they'll get a growth opportunity... </p><p> CLAMAN:  Sources, by the way, say this, of course, could still fall  apart.  So we caution people to make sure they understand that but what  about regulatory hurdles, Matt?  These are two gigantic companies that  could eliminate some of the little guys out there.</p><p> MCCALL:  And it probably will.  The thing is though, Sun has lost a lot  of market share over the last couple of years.  So I think they'll be  able to get through the hurdles.</p><p> And I think HP gets hurt the most because when you think about it HP  actually had a chance to buy Sun.  In the last year they went to them  and they turned them down and now IBM is jumping on that after the price  fell a bit more.  So I think IBM is being pro-active here looking  forward or HP's kind of sitting back waiting for the business to come to  them.</p><p> CLAMAN:  What is the best possible sense that you make specifically I  think for other suitors?  Anybody -- you know Matt has talked about  Hewlett-Packard.  They're not going to come back maybe and start  fighting, would they?</p><p> BESECKER:  Why wouldn't they?  I mean if they really thought --  depending on price.  I think that is why the price is what it is.  We  don't know the price because it has not been announced.  We just hear  rumors.  But if the price is there, I think that's one of the reasons  that they came out with a good best offer.</p><p> CLAMAN:  I'm with Joe Besecker right now because I'd look at this and I  say we have some deals going.</p><p> BESECKER:  Exactly.</p><p> CLAMAN:  So what is the next digital deal that might be done?</p><p> MCCALL:  You know, I'm actually going to go away from digital because I  don't know if it is going to be as much in technology.  I think the more  deals are going to be in biotech.  I think we're going to have a huge  boom in the second half where large pharma with no pipelines are going  to start picking up a lot biotech companies.  And I think that's going  to be one of the biggest sectors and one of the biggest drivers of this  market in the second half of the year.</p><p> CLAMAN:  How does the average investor get in on something like that in  advance?</p><p> BESECKER:  Carefully.  Because we still have a lot of land mines out  there.  You look at the companies -- I actually think the play is, and  we were talking a little bit earlier, some of these companies that have  platforms that they can add things to might be the better place than  trying to guess which ones are the ones that are acquired because if  you're not acquired and you run out of cash, it is kind of an all or  nothing and minor event.</p><p> So that's in the (INAUDIBLE) I agree with you 100 percent, that's why we  buy a basket.  If you have muss (ph), you can buy a basket or you can  buy one of the -- you have to do a lot of homework and that's why...</p><p> MCCALL:  And you never buy a company just on the anticipation of being  taken over.  You never do that.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Right.  Never.  Never do that.</p><p> Well, let the sun shine in.  We have ourselves a deal here.</p><p> BESECKER:  We have business.  That's right.  We have business.</p><p> CLAMAN:  We have business going Joe and Matt.  Thank you very much.</p><p> Coming up, let's take a check of today's news headlines.  The latest --  did you hear about this?  This tragic ski trip taken by one of  Broadway's leading actresses, we will be talking about that in a moment.</p><p> And the company behind Cheerios, Betty Crocker and Haagen-Dazs --  General Mills planning to take one dinner table favorite out of the food  roster?  You get to guess -- I guarantee you, unless you grew up on one  of those organic farms which, I went Berkeley and all about that.  You  ate this product, they're taking it out of the mix.</p><p> Get ready to cry.  We'll get a closer look when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  continues.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GAVIN GREY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm  Gavin Grey, standing in for Ashley Webster in London and a quick look at  the markets straight off.</p><p> Let's start off in Germany with the Dax, that's been leading the way  this morning, I'm pleased to say.  And it's still doing very well; up  almost 60 points at 4,045 that's up almost 1.5 percent.  Moving across  to Paris, the CAC, that's also doing pretty well; up 0.9 of a percent at  2,792.  And lastly the FTSE; that spent most of this morning in negative  territory but it's just crept positive, up almost seven points at 3,863.</p><p> All of those figures despite some pretty bad news on the unemployment  front that's come out just within the last hour or two.  And that is  that unemployment in the U.K. has now topped 2 million; that is about  6.5 percent of the working population.  Figures due to get much worse  however and indeed it is the rate of the rise that is worrying most  people.</p><p> Two million is the worst it's been since 1997.  But the rate of the rise  has been the fastest increase for a couple of decades, so a bit worrying  there for the government and plenty of dire predictions following on  from that.</p><p>The Royal Bank of Scotland, next.  That's the bank that's been almost  bought out by the government; two-thirds now owned by the U.K. taxpayer.   But optimistic comments from the chairman who says that the banks  benefited from buoyant corporate banking activity and has noted  increased business as a resulting corporate debt issuance and equity  underwriting -- so a positive note there.</p><p> Homeowners though, well those with mortgages -- that is not such clever  news because indeed it has been estimated now that in the last year, the  number of people who have fallen into arrears with their mortgage has  risen a third and that is obviously worrying and that, of course,  despite those on track of mortgages noticing a sharp decline in the  monthly repayment.  So very worrying for them, too.</p><p> A quick look at the dollar and the currencies, it is down against the  euro, 1.30 to the dollar.  And the pound there, it is up against the  pound and 1 pound is now going to cost around $1.39.</p><p> Back to you Jenna.</p><p> JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Thank you very much.  Good morning once  again everyone.</p><p> We are taking a look at some of the top news stories of the day.</p><p> China rejecting Coca-Cola's bid to buy a major Chinese juice maker  breaking up what would have been the largest ever foreign take over of a  Chinese company.  China's commerce ministry rejecting the $2.5 billion  bid for the Huiyuan Juice Group saying Coke's buy out would potentially  squeeze out smaller players.</p><p> This development comes as China recently enacted stronger anti-monopoly  law so big question about whether this is an isolated event or something  that other businesses should be concerned about.</p><p> Actress, Natasha Richardson is hospitalized, in critical condition after  a skiing accident in Montreal.  Richardson was flown back to New York  City for medical treatment after suffering a serious head injury during  a beginner's ski lesson.  Members of Richardson's family have gathered  near her bedside now.  And Richardson, by the way, is the wife of actor  Liam Neeson.  She's an accomplished actress, though; she won a Tony  award for her 1998 performance in Cabaret.</p><p> Back to business news now, Dunkin Donuts is going back to its roots.   Years after the company ran ads featuring Fred the baker saying it is  time to make the donuts, the company's advertising its doughnuts again.   It will launch a new $10 million campaign.  In the recent years the  company has focused more on coffee and breakfast sandwiches in its  advertising and the coolest part of this campaign though is a Design  Your Own Donut contest.  Yes, you got it, customers can design their own  donuts on the company's Web site.  A winner will be chosen in June and  be sold in the company's 8,000 stores.  So start designing, get to it.</p><p> You're up to date here on the Fox Business Network.  Remember  foxbusiness.com is where you want to go throughout the day.</p><p> And coming up advertising sales may be down but Charles Payne is still  promoting one ad company's stock.  He'll explain why next.</p><p> We'll have much more on the outrage over AIG and its millions and  millions in bonuses.  AIG chairman, of course, Ed Liddy headed to  Capitol Hill today to appear before a house committee.  He's going to be  answering some tough questions.  So we want to know what would you ask  him?</p><p> Send us an e-mail at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email>  We'll share  some of your thoughts a little later on in the show.  We'll be right  back with more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FBN ANCHOR:  Thirty minutes after the hour.  So glad you're  with us on this special edition of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST, \"AIG, America's  Outrage.\"  I'm Liz Claman.  Alexis Glick is off today.  </p><p> We're going to have more on the growing anger over the failed insurer's  decision to give out bonuses, millions and millions of dollars in  bonuses to some people who actually don't even work there anymore.  </p><p> And if you've seen the markets lately, up six of the last seven days.   Not bad at all.  Let's take a look at how they're shaping up with the  futures.  A little bit of weakness here at the moment.  We actually had  some decent numbers out of Asia overnight.  The Hang Seng did pretty  well, up more than 1 percent.  </p><p> But for -- our futures here, we're down for the Dow Jones Industrial  Average.  NASDAQ just popped in to positive territory to the upside and  S&amp;P futures have come up off of their lows in the last half hour.  They  were down about 4 points, but right now down 2.20.  </p><p> The company behind breakfast staples like Wheaties and Cheerios, you  know, you've eaten it all.  You know you ate Count Chocula growing up,  admit it.  General Mills, out with 3rd quarter earnings this morning,  coming in at $0.79 excluding items, missing analysts' expectations of  $0.88 per share.  </p><p> As consumers cut costs, food makers are cutting unprofitable businesses.   So to that end, I'm stunned.  Did you -- Jenna, Jenna cannot believe it.   General Mills says it will no longer make, excuse me for a moment,  Pillsbury frozen dinner rolls.  They're gone, folks.  </p><p> I -- Charles Payne is speechless.  </p><p> For more on this I'm enjoined by Jennifer Niemela of the St. Paul  Business Journal and Erin Smith, an analyst with the Argus Research  Company.  We're all stunned and shocked today.  </p><p> Good evening, (INAUDIBLE) our way, but first Pillsbury dough rolls are  no longer going to be available.  </p><p> Erin, let's start with the numbers here.  They missed but they also  guided higher for the year.  They're upping their guidance.  I find that  interesting.  What do you pick out of this report?  </p><p> ERIN SMITH, ARGUS RESEARCH COMPANY ANALYST:  Well, they actually  mentioned that cost inflation is supposed to improve in the next -- not  bit high at next quarter, and I think that's a big benefit.  And our  estimates for the 3rd quarter is actually below consensus so they  actually came in just a little bit below our estimates.  We expected the  4th quarter would be a little bit stronger.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Jennifer, last week General Mills announced it will no longer  make, as I said, these Pillsbury frozen dinner rolls and they've  actually decided to sell the frozen dough portion of its bakeries and  food service.  So they're shedding this part of it.  Why?  Why has the  company decided to drop this part of their business?  </p><p> JENNIFER NIEMELA, ST. PAUL BUSINESS JOURNAL REPORTER:  Well, when I  talked to General Mills they mentioned that they're really trying to  focus on some of their strengths and like a lot of food companies, they  are trying to trim out some of the less profitable parts of their  business.  </p><p> So those are the reasons that they gave me.  And yes, they sold it to a  company called Pennant Foods.  They sold four of their factories, shed  about 60 positions.  So they are focusing on cutting their costs right  now.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Erin, what impact, do you think, the sale will have on General  Mills' future?  I thought it was so iconic.  I can't let go of this.   I...</p><p> SMITH:  Well, I do like their Pillsbury rolls.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  It's dinner -- exactly.  </p><p> SMITH:  But at the same time, Pillsbury division has been -- hasn't been  performing as well as some of their other divisions.  Cereals been very  strong, yogurt and soup.  So I can understand.  I think long term this  is a good strategy to try to revitalize that -- the Pillsbury brand over  the past year.  And it's probably -- I assumed that it hasn't been doing  as well.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  But Jennifer, we've got to get to the stronger dollar aspect of  this because clearly a strong dollar hurts a global company that has an  international footprint.  Right now we're looking at a dollar that seems  to be doing well.  General Mills operates in about 100 different  companies.  Does this hurt them going forward?  They must not think it's  going to really pressure them because they're upping the guidance for  the full year.  </p><p> NIEMELA:  Right.  Well, they have been focusing a lot on cutting their  costs.  And here in the twin cities, they have decreased their work  force by about 2 percent so I think going forward they're pretty  optimistic.  </p><p> The CEO also mentioned that while commodity prices have been up, he does  expect those to go down once the recession ends.  So I think that  they're optimistic going forward and that makes sense.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Erin, everybody says go for consumer staple companies and  healthcare because those are the two things people won't cut back on.   These earnings indicate that even if people continue to buy these  products, costs are higher.  We don't know where commodities are going.   It's obviously a real challenge to operate a company like this.  </p><p> Is it all about the management and how smart they are as far as organic  growth is concerned?  And specifically, cuts in the way they operate?  </p><p> SMITH:  I think that's very important and I also think if you look at  the company's brand and if they have leading brands, what kind of types  of products?  General Mills have a very strong portfolio of affordable  brands for consumers.  General mixes, soup and cereals.  So you have to  look at what they're offering.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  And Jennifer, we spoke about how General Mills is cutting costs  by selling some of those less profitable brands.  How many have cut  costs, say for example, by laying employees off and what does General  Mills employment situation look like?  </p><p> NIEMELA:  Well, here in the twin cities we have seen -- actually some of  our larger companies including Cargill, another big food company here,  have actually increased their work force over the past year.  But  General Mills has decreased their -- over 2008 they decreased by about  1.8 percent.  Their employment here.  So they are focusing on cutting  their costs.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Jennifer and Erin...</p><p> NIEMELA:  In that way as well.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  We're going to wrap it there.  Once again General Mills,  missing estimates but upping their guidance for the full year numbers.  </p><p> We thank you very much for coming in.  We've actually got some breaking  news.  </p><p> Connell, what do you have for us?  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Liz, we talked about the Coke  story.  You may have heard us talk about the fact that this deal had  been rejected by the Chinese government for Coke to buy a juice company  in China for $2.5 billion.  </p><p> Well, the company itself has actually come out with some comments here  in the last few minutes crossing on the wire from Coca-Cola.  They're  saying they're not going to pursue this.  This Huiyuan deal, that's the  name of the company, in China, the juice company.  They're not going to  pursue it after the government had rejected it.  </p><p> So they're not going to press this anymore.  They said they were  disappointed about the rejection that came out of the Chinese  government, but they rejected -- they, I should say, they respect the  decision and they're going to focus on growing existing brands in China  with a long-term view of the Chinese market.  </p><p> So, again, Coca-Cola after being rejected by the Chinese government for  an attempt to $2.5 billion acquisition of a major juice company in China  now says that's it. we respect your decision, we're not going to pursue  it any further.  </p><p> Interesting story.  We'll continue to follow it and all the political  ramifications, all the rest of it throughout the day.  But right now it  is time for \"Charles' Choice.\"  It's down to Charles Payne in the  studio.  </p><p> What do you have, Charles?  </p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thanks, Connell.  Well, you  know, first, no more dinner rolls and now Coke being knocked down in  China, bad news.  But I'm going to stick with this China thing, Connell,  because two of the three stocks I'm watching are actually based in  China.  </p><p> The first is Focus Media.  That was the tease that Jenna Lee gave you.   I've got to tell you, folks, someone just opened some biscuits in the  background.  The stock has won some pretty good support right around the  $5 area so I like it on the downside.  </p><p> Listen, Wall Street expects this company to earn $1.48 in the fiscal '09  and it's trading at $5.90.  If it traded at ten times book, I mean the  stock would be somewhere right around here so this is really one of  these stocks that has a lot of room to the upside.  A little on the  downside.  Nevertheless, I consider it a high-risk play, although  yesterday my high-risk play is still soft, which is up 25 percent.  A 15  percent after the open.  </p><p> OK.  A little risky in my opinion is NetEase.  It's another Chinese  plate.  It's a Web portal, offers online communities and e-commerce  services, a lot of games.  One of the things we're starting to see here  with this stock is look at that trend.  Upbrilled (ph), nice here, looks  really, really great.  On the cusp of a major, major break out.  I've  mentioned this stock several times in the past.  I think you want to  have exposure to China.  This is one of my top three plays in China  along with Baidu and Sohu.  </p><p> And finally, Simon Property Group.  This is my contrarian play of the  day, if you will.  We were short to stock at Wall Street strategies,  WStreet.com, for a long time.  And indeed it came down but it was really  tough.  It didn't come down and it showed a lot of resolve if you will.  </p><p> The stock is on a verge of a major breakout here.  I like this -- use 29  and 1/2 if you do this stock as an idea -- as a stop-loss.  And I have  an exclusive pick.  Go to FOXBusiness.com/MoneyforBreakfast.  It's a  controversial company.  </p><p> Coming up, folks, we're going to see which of your favorite brands have  the strength to carry their companies through the downturn.  And a  border war is brewing.  It can cost you and our economy billions of  dollars.  Details just ahead when we come back with more MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CLAMAN:  This morning the Obama administration is preparing to send more  federal agents to the Mexican border in a move to stop the flow of drugs  and rash of kidnappings that is plaguing the Mexican border.  This comes  as the Obama administration not only copes with the drug war, but now  possibly a trade war as well.  </p><p> Folks, trade wars only exacerbated the Great Depression but is this all  mean?  And Mexico says, well, if you do that, we're going to impose  tariffs on U.S. imports and produce and products, such as, and we're  just getting this information because before we weren't sure what the  products where, sunglasses, toilet paper, pet food and soy sauce.  </p><p> I think Christmas trees were thrown in there as well.  </p><p> This move is on the heels of Washington banning Mexican trucks from  pretty much free access of the U.S. roads which Mexico says violate  NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.  </p><p> Drugs, tariffs, kidnappings, and that's all after we, the United States,  gave Mexico $10 billion in aid.  </p><p> Boy, what do we make of all of this?  For more now I'm joined by Todd  Spencer.  He's the executive vice president of the Owner, Operator  Independent Drivers Association.  And Jim Roberts, a research fellow  with the Heritage Foundation.  </p><p> Welcome to you both.  </p><p> Jim, what exactly did the U.S. remove, take away?  And how is Mexico  retaliating?  </p><p> JIM ROBERTS, HERITAGE FOUNDATION RESEARCH FELLOW:  Well, you know, this  is one trade dispute where, to pardon the express, the rubber is really  meeting the road.  To judge the Obama administration by their rhetoric,  you would think that they understand that the only way to increase  prosperity for Americans and grow our economy is to expand trade  opportunities, not contract them.  </p><p> They understand that protectionism in the 1930s made the depression  worst.  And yet we have to judge them by their actions.  And so far  their actions have been to cave in to protectionists on the left, big  labor, first in the stimulus package with the Buy America provisions,  now in this omnibus bill, they've killed a pilot program with Mexico by  defunding it, that had -- had allowed the Mexican government to put off  filing this action that they have a legal right to do under NAFTA...</p><p> CLAMAN:  OK.  </p><p> ROBERTS:  ... to put tariffs on some of our products.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Somebody who feels completely different about this is Tom  Spencer.  </p><p> Todd, how does the elimination of this program, which, in essence if I  understand it correctly, allowed Mexican 18-wheelers unfettered access  back and forth across the border to the U.S. delivering all kinds of  goods?  How does this benefit you, the U.S. trucker and more valuable  than the challenges and the costs of the tariffs?  </p><p> TODD SPENCER, OWNER OPERATOR INDEPENDENT DRIVERS ASSOC.:  Liz, it's  amazing their comments, the rhetoric coming from the other side on this  issue.  The arbitration panel that looked at this issue, several years  ago said the U.S. was totally within its rights to establish safety  systems and insists on safety systems that would assure safety on our  highways.  </p><p> Those systems have not been in place, they have not -- they are simply  not functional.  This feigned outrage about protectionism is simply  rhetoric.  This is not a new issue.  Congress, both sides of Congress  have been outraged, concerned about the prospect of an unequal playing  field in terms of safety and security all the way back to 2001.  </p><p> They've insisted our system was being put in place.  They haven't been  put in place.  And it would be foolhardy, idiotic for us to open our  highways any other way.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Jim, why do I -- Jim, why do I want Mexican truck drivers if  they're not insured, if it hasn't had the proper safeguards attached to  this program?  Why do I want them on the road here in America?  We've  got enough problems of our own.  </p><p> ROBERTS:  Well, you wouldn't want drivers like that on our roads but  those aren't the drivers that have been participating in this program.   In fact, they have had a better safety records than our own companies.   These drivers are well trained and you want them because American  consumers are paying $400 more per year in products imported from Mexico  because of this additional uploading and reloading and warehouses within  the 25-mile limit of the border.  </p><p> That's just adding costs to American consumers just to featherbed some  jobs for the teamsters and improve teamster dues, but it's hurting the  American consumer and it's hurting our relations with Mexico and our  economy.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Todd, is it all about the teamsters flexing their muscle?  </p><p> SPENCER:  Not in the least.  The overwhelming majority, 90 percent of  truckers are small business entities, people that own 10 or fewer  trucks.  These are the people that are actually on the frontlines  economically.  They're on the frontlines for highway safety and they're  the ones that actually are being disadvantaged by this unleveled playing  field and actually risks at the border.  </p><p> How many segments are we going to talk about how crazy, how lawless it  is on that side?  And we're going to say...</p><p> CLAMAN:  But you understand, Todd -- you understand that any kind of  tariffs that are imposed now which is what the Mexicans are doing for  our goods, we get a little bit of a trade war going here, at a time when  -- our economy is rough, hard you, sort of justify that with what the  boobs (ph) are.  </p><p> SPENCER:  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Mexico has benefited so much  from trade with the U.S. I mean, they'd be cutting off their nose to  spite their face...</p><p> CLAMAN:  OK.  </p><p> SPENCER:  ... to do something idiotic like that.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Jim, let me give you the last word here.  Mexico gets $10  billion in aid from us.  They're a mess.  The State Department is  encouraging people not to travel to Mexico right now because of the drug  wars.  And now this?  </p><p> ROBERTS:  Well, certainly parts of northern Mexico are dangerous but  other parts of Mexico are if you take precautions but I would say this  trucking program would have improved and will improve border security  because there are fewer opportunities for drugs and cash to move south  and empty trucks if the trucks are loaded.  And so it seems to me that  this makes more sense and always economically and with national  security.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Well, the discussion and conversation will continue.  </p><p> Todd and Jim, thank you for being a part of it right here on FOX.  Thank  you so much.  </p><p> SPENCER:  Thank you, Liz.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Now let's get over to Charles Payne.  Charles, what do you  have?  </p><p> PAYNE:  Well, Liz, Starbucks holds its annual shareholders meeting today  in Seattle and it's one of the many brands battling this downward  economy.  And it's clearly been hurt in an annual core brand power  ranking.  So last year Starbucks ranked number 10 out of 20 and this  year's survey, it slipped down to 214.  </p><p> With a look at who's the king of the brand world, I'm joined by Jim  Gregory, the CEO of CoreBrand, and Matt McCall, the president of the  Penn Financial Group.  </p><p> Jim, I want to start with you.  I just mentioned Starbucks a minute ago.   Obviously the economy has had an impact but has the company made a lot  of mistakes as well?  </p><p> JIM GREGORY, COREBRAND CEO:  Certainly.  You know, it's important to  understand that the brand is -- might be doing well, but the underlying  financial fundamentals are not more important than the brand.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I don't get what that means, though.  </p><p> GREGORY:  I'm sorry.  I said that incorrectly, but the brand is very  important but the underlying financial fundamentals are more important  than the brands, so even though the brand is quite strong, it's not more  important than the company getting out of whack, so to speak.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Let's start now with your top five.  We're going to start with  the number five on your brand rankings.  Campbell Soup.  What makes this  so good?  </p><p> GREGORY:  It's a great brand.  When you have a brand that stands for one  thing, for nourishment for so many decades and mm-hmm good concept is so  clear in everyone's mind, you know that it's a really highly focused  food company.  And they are really focused on three major areas, simple  mills, baked snacks and healthy beverages.  </p><p> And so that's a very complex company simplified.  </p><p> PAYNE:  You know, Matt, it's interesting because Peter Lindt (ph) said  buy what you know.  And obviously everybody knows Campbell Soup but  there is somewhat of a disconnect between a great brand and a great  investment.  </p><p> What do you think about Campbell as an investment?  </p><p> MATT MCCALL, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP PRESIDENT:  I really don't like his  investment.  It's gotten crushed.  It hit a five-year low just recently,  and it's not really growth story.  You won't be looking grow stocks now.   And I think they've really gotten hurt by private label.  People are  shopping at Wal-Mart, getting their groceries there.  They're going to  go for the private label brand versus the Campbell brand...</p><p> PAYNE:  Wal-Mart just said they're going to actually increase that  strategy.  </p><p> Jim, let's go to number four, Hershey Foods.  Why is this a premiere  brand?  </p><p> GREGORY:  Well, first of all, it's one of the original companies that  we're involved in corporate social responsibility.  The voting shares of  the company are controlled by the Hershey trust and that's for the  benefit of the Milton Hershey School for Disadvantaged Children.  So  they do well by doing good and it's a great company.  Again, very  consistent brand over time.  </p><p> Also, it's important to realize that they are no longer the king of  candy.  Mars has taken that with the acquisition of Wrigley's.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p> GREGORY:  So they're not quite as strong as they were.  </p><p> PAYNE:  So...</p><p> GREGORY:  But they do have a great brand.  </p><p> PAYNE:  So Jim, let's go to the other end of the political correctness - - spectrum, if you will.  Harley-Davidson, number three.  Why is this  still such a powerful brand?  </p><p> GREGORY:  Well, this is one of my favorite brands and it's done so well  over time.  When you think about Harley-Davidson in 1990 when we started  our corporate branding index, they were near bankruptcy.  They have  improved consistently over time and they are -- have reached the  pinnacle of our brand ranking of 1,200 companies.  </p><p> So one of the concerns I have about Harley-Davidson is they are -- might  be expanding too much.  They have over 35 different models and it's  almost what I call the GM syndrome.  They want to be all things to all  people.  That's not the way that -- to continue to expand their brand.  </p><p> PAYNE:  And of course, Jim, too, household names Johnson &amp; Johnson  number 2, and number one, Coca-Cola.  What do you think?  How come this  is still such a powerful brand?  </p><p> GREGORY:  Well, Coca-cola has been the number one soft drink in the  world, of course, and in our corporate branding index has been number  one since 1997.  They -- even in down markets, they continue to invest  in the brands.  They've launched Coca-Cola Zero this year as well as  their open happiness advertising campaign.  </p><p> They understand how to grow their brand even in a down market and that's  quite impressive.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Matt, three -- everyone knows HOG, though, hit a high, 75  November of 2006.  It's come straight down.  Would you even consider  buying the stock here?  </p><p> MCCALL:  I would not.  And that's something where -- that was the dream  for the middle class.  The middle class is struggling right now so the  last thing they'll do is going to be throwing $25,000 at a discretionary  item such as a HOG.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Well, Johnson &amp; Johnson at number two on the list.  It's a  consistent player.  They're probably out there looking for acquisitions  right now.  It's a core stock in a lot of folks' portfolio.  It's been  hit.  OK, what do you think about it?  </p><p> MCCALL:  I love it.  I ought to call my clients right now and this is  more than just a consumer Johnson &amp; Johnson you see at the grocery  story.  The medical device, there's the pharmaceuticals, great diverse  company and has some cash as well.  </p><p> PAYNE:  At least we got one buy out of you.  Thanks a lot, Matt.  </p><p> Jim, thank you very much.  Really appreciate it.  </p><p> Coming up, folks, we're going to into the pit and read some of the e- mails that you have been sending us about AIG.  More MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  when we return.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CLAMAN:  I mean, we still cannot believe that General Mills is getting  rid of the Pillsbury dinner rolls, the frozen rolls.  We opened it.  I  was banging this thing like I was a monkey and then it popped open and  freaked me out.  But I think we should bronze this because they're not  going to ...</p><p> JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  They're collector's item.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  It is.  </p><p> LEE:  Put that on eBay.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Actually you shouldn't have opened that one.  You probably  should have put it in a vault somewhere, yes.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Put it on eBay.  </p><p> LEE:  I bet it were last in the universe.  </p><p> PAYNE:  But they're keeping their dinner rolls, I mean, the flaky  biscuits.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  That's right.  I mean if you grew up having the three can stew  and the tuna casserole like we did, you know, every -- every other  Tuesday, tuna casserole, you have to have the dinner rolls.  </p><p> We have been asking you all morning long for your take on the bonus  backlash over at AIG.  Let's see what you have to say.  We've been  getting hundreds of e-mails.  </p><p> David Medas (ph) says, quote, \"You should only get a bonus when produce  above the job requirements.\"  He says AIG executives failed to produce  to meet their requirements of their contract goals but failed far below  their goals nullifying any bonuses.  </p><p> See, I like David.  Because aren't there two sides to a contract?  Why  were AIG executives pay bonus when they lost money?  </p><p> PAYNE:  Well, I think one of the problems is we have not actually seen  the contract themselves.  That might be great if we could get a chance  to see what those contracts were.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  I called a lot of lawyers last night, and they said Liz, got to  see the contract  </p><p> PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Let me see the contract.  But good for you, David.  I like  that.  </p><p> LEE:  They're not alone, too.  A lot of CEOs got paid on Wall Street  that maybe didn't deserve it.  </p><p> Next question, well anyways.  Sean Webb says, \"I would like to know if  all these politicians are going to give back the contributions they  received from these Wall Street crooks.\"  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Good point.  </p><p> LEE:  I think, Charles, you have a list there.  </p><p> PAYNE:  God, are you kidding me?  The list from the Center of  Responsible Politics.  I left it outside.  Amazing.  Chris Dodd at the  top, $280,000.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  But Republicans also peppering this list as well.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PAYNE:  They were seated at the top 10.  There were six Democrats and  four Republicans.  And by the way, they did a great job hedging  themselves.  They had all the presidential candidates.  </p><p> Dook Barela (ph) of Riverside, California says, \"The AIG bonuses are  unacceptable.  Our congressional representatives have no excuse for  overlooking this AIG bonus when they hadn't taken the time to read the  stimulus bill before passing it nor our president for signing it.\"  </p><p> Everyone, obviously, should have some outrage towards Congress.  There's  no doubt about.  Another $30 billion a week ago.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Henry Paulson shoved this thing -- Henry Paulson, George Bush  and Congress shoved this.  </p><p> PAYNE:  But just a week ago, they got another 30 billion, Liz.  Someone  else has to take responsibility.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  We got another e-mail.  Richard Suttmeier, he's a frequest  guest.  Hi, Richard (INAUDIBLE) from ValueEngine.com, saying, \"You can't  break employment contracts after the fact.  Our Ivy League bank  regulatory geniuses who bought 80 percent of AIG on behalf of U.S.  taxpayers lacked the common sense to void all employment agreements.\"  </p><p> PAYNE:  You know what, what it...</p><p> CLAMAN:  Renegotiate, Richard.  Not void.  </p><p> PAYNE:  A bankruptcy would have renegotiated it as well, too.  But you  know what, on that note, Richard, I'm glad you're watching.  We can also  use the tax code as a weapon.  I think that's going to be a big mistake  if we go that road.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Gang, we love the comments.  You can keep them coming.  We're  getting hundreds of them.  Join the crowd here.  Send us an e-mail at  <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@FOXbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@FOXbusiness.com</email>  We'll share some of your thoughts in  the next hour.  It's three minutes until the top of the hour.  </p><p> Coming up right after the break, we're talking live to lawmakers  including Republican senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas about what  she and other lawmakers are doing about the handouts at AIG.  We're  serving up so much more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  Do not move.  I mean you  can go brush your teeth but other than that, stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CLAMAN:  And good morning, everybody.  Welcome to hour number two of  this special edition of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  The \"AIG, America's  Outrage.\"  I'm Liz Claman.  Alexis Glick is off today.  </p><p> We're going to have much more.  The growing anger, I mean, each day it's  getting worse and worse here among both you the public and lawmakers  over the AIG bonuses.  This morning we are getting hundreds and hundreds  of e-mails.  Please we want to hear from you.  Specifically, what is it  that outrages you so much about this?  Is it Congress not having put in  stopgaps for these kinds of problems back in September when the first  TARP was announced?  Is it just being so angry at AIG?  Who, where,  what?  E-mail us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email> and we'll share  them a little later in the show.  It's very cathartic when you sit down,  you e-mail us and maybe we'll read yours and you'll feel better about  the anger.  </p><p> First, let's get a quick check of the U.S. futures.  But, remember,  yesterday, the market did wonderfully.  Up triple digits for the Dow  Jones Industrials.  The Dow futures, right now, slightly weaker.  S&amp;P,  we were trying to make a good of the flat line here.  Got down as far as  down about 2 points.  But now we're down 5.70.  The Nasdaq futures down  3.75.  Nasdaq had a great double digit gain yesterday.  </p><p> But let me send it up to Connell McShane, he's at the Fox Business desk,  for some breaking details.  </p><p> The IBM deal that isn't yet a deal, Connell.  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, not yet a deal.  But  while it's fun to talk about it, isn't it?  This morning in \"The Wall  Street Journal,\" Liz, the possibility being brought up that IBM might  buy Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash to do so.  It would be  about -- would literally be a 100 percent premium over where Sun closed  yet.  Both stocks, as you might expect, are moving in the pre-market as  a result of this speculation.  </p><p> Let's first go to IBM, which is down about 3 percent in pre-market  trading.  It's actually moved under $90 a share.  $89.91 is the bid, as  you see, on it there.  Java, Sun Microsystems, you might also expect  that to be higher.  It is.  Look at that, up to $8.25 a share.  So  you're talking about a 60 some odd percent gain in the shares of Sun  Microsystems.  Again, on the speculation this morning that IBM might be  a buyer of Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash in order to buy  Sun.  </p><p> Now, just breaking as we speak and crossing the wires are some headlines  out of the Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis.  Crossing the wires from \"The  Charlotte Observer,\" as a matter of fact.  I have not had a lot of time  to go over this because they're just crossing, so I'll read a few of  them as you look at the B of A stock price.  </p><p> Lewis saying that the bank could pay back $45 billion in TARP money,  Liz, by late this year or early next year, depending on the economy.  So  Lewis talking about not taking more money from the government, but  paying it back.  He says, in addition to that, that the bank expects to  be profitable in 2009, absent what he calls an unexpected meltdown.   Unexpected meltdown, a quote from Ken Lewis.  </p><p> Bank of America saying it could repay the TARP money now if it had to,  if it were not maintaining higher than normal capital cushion amid some  fragile economic conditions.  So it's not able to do it because of that  right now, but should be able to do it late this year or early next  year, Liz.  $45 billion that Bank of America took.  The CEO says it will  be able to pay it back and it will be profitable in 2009 unless things  really go wrong.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Fine.  Yes, we'll take it.  We'll take it.  </p><p> MCSHANE: Yes, we will take it.  Absolutely.</p><p> CLAMAN: And that way you don't have to have Congress complaining about  your bonuses.  </p><p> MCSHANE: Yes, that's right.</p><p> CLAMAN: If you don't like that . . .</p><p> MCSHANE: Pay whatever you want as long as you don't take government  money, right?</p><p> CLAMAN: Exactly.  Connell, we'll see you later.</p><p> MCSHANE: OK.</p><p> CLAMAN: As I mentioned, we're taking a closer look at this hour at the  outrage that has boiled over about AIG.  So let's start with the latest  news.  Chairman and CEO of American International Group, Edward Liddy,  will pull up that chair at a congressional witness table today to take  the heat.  I mean this could be a blow torch.  They are literally going  to bring in blow torches because they know the cameras will be on them.   The lawmakers will be out there screaming about these bonuses.  </p><p> And in the meantime, Congress and the White House are actually trying to  find ways to strip bonus recipients of that money.  The chairman and  ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee proposed companies and  individuals play a 90 percent plus tax on all retention awards and  bonuses over $50,000.  And in a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary  Tim Geithner suggested holding back the bonus amount from upcoming  bailout funds for AIG.  But the story continues.</p><p> Joining me now for more on Liddy's testimony today are two congressional  members.  Democratic Congressman Gary Peters of Michigan and Republican  Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota.  Both of them sit on the  subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government Sponsored  Enterprises, which is holding today's hearings.  </p><p> So you both have skin in the game.  You'll both be out there.  I will  start first with Michele Bachmann.  And I like that you're both here.   And I want to explain to our viewers, Michele is a tax litigation  attorney.  Gary has a masters in business administration and law degree.   So you both understand what perhaps can and could not be done regarding  these bonuses.  But, Representative Bachmann, what do you hope to learn  about AIG's use of federal funds regarding the bonuses and how all the  money is being allocated? </p><p> REP. MICHELE BACHMANN, (R) MINNESOTA: Well, there's a number of  questions that I think all the members of the committee will have.   First of all will be, what is the exit strategy to get the American  taxpayer out of AIG and out of these private businesses.  We're only  beginning to learn where all of the tax money has gone from AIG.  At  least $20 billion has gone to pay off foreign investors who've invested  in AIG.  I don't think the American taxpayers signed up to bail out  foreign investors.  This is an economic quagmire.  We need to get the  American taxpayer out of bailing out these failed businesses.  This is  $173 billion plus that we have invested.  It's a black hole.  I don't  think that the American taxpayer should have to pony up any more money  for a failed enterprise like AIG.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Representative Peters, a lot of times you get the American  public huddled before the televisions like it's the landing on the moon  for these things.  Everybody wants to watch it.  And all they see is a  lot of bloviating.  I'm interested to know if there will be fact finding  on your behalf.  What do you want to find out here? </p><p> REP. GARY PETERS, (D) MICHIGAN: Well, I hope there is fact finding.   This should not just be a media circus.  We've got a lot of information  that we need to find out.  Certainly about an exit strategy, which I  think are very good questions.  </p><p> And in terms of the bonus and compensation, which is the -- what  everybody is talking about right now, I think we need to be thinking  generally about compensation in these financial firms and looking at  those compensation matrix and how those are determined.  I think it's --  what is really outrageous to the American public now and myself as well  is that you have individuals at AIG, the very individuals that  contributed to AIG being brought to their knees, losing billions of  dollars, and contributing to this financial mess, getting $160 million  in bonuses.  Basically these individuals failed and they failed in a  spectacular fashion.  How could they . . .</p><p> CLAMAN: I want that deal.  I want that deal.</p><p> PETERS: How could they be rewarded?  Absolutely.</p><p> CLAMAN: I want to be able to fail and get paid so much money.  </p><p> PETERS: How could they be awarded, Alexis (ph).</p><p> CLAMAN: Look, no matter what side of the aisle you're on, House Finance  Committee Chairman Barney Frank struck a cord yesterday when he said we  should approach the AIG situation from the standpoint of the government  and the taxpayer being the owner of the company now.  Let's listen in.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. BARNEY FRANK, HOUSE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I think the time  has come to exercise our ownership rights.  We own most of the company.   And then say, as owner, you know, I'm not paying you the bonus.  You  didn't perform.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CLAMAN: Representative Bachmann, how much leverage does the government  realistically have in retrieving these bonuses? </p><p> BACHMANN: Well, we have all the leverage in the world.  We do own AIG.   And that's exactly the problem.  I don't want to have the American  taxpayer owning private companies.  That's when we get the government  into extra constitutional business we have no business being in.</p><p> CLAMAN: But now that we do, now that we do, Representative Bachmann, can  we retrieve the bonuses? </p><p> BACHMANN: Sure, we can do anything we want to do.  But what we need to  do is get out and stop pouring money down a black hole.  Just like we  should not have the Obama administration running Detroit with GN or  Chrysler.  This is what will happen.  We'll see more of this the more  government stays involved in private businesses.  We will see more of  these fiascos.  Government was never designed to run private businesses.   We need to get out and we need to return these businesses to the private  hands or they need to fail.  And we need to be prepared to accept that.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Representative Peters, you're the one with the law degree.  Is  there some type of sort of clause that might enable this to get back the  money?  Or is this a red herring and do we need to look at what  Representative Bachmann is talking about and, ooh, let me say it, let  AIG fail? Everybody's so nervous about that and this so-called systemic  risk.  </p><p> PETERS: Well, first off, let me say that I've proposed a bill that I  proposed yesterday that would use the tax code to recover that money for  the taxpayers.  This money is being paid out and to me the best approach  right now would be to put a tax of roughly about 100 percent.  That  brings that money back to the taxpayers where it belongs.  </p><p> It is a bill that only deals with situations where you have substantial  investments of taxpayer money in a company.  In this case, over $170  billion.  And basically my approach is that there shouldn't be any  bonuses paid out until the taxpayers are paid back first.  After the  taxpayers are paid back, the company is free to pay any bonuses they'd  like and have any kind of compensation schedule, but they need to pay  back the taxpayers first.  </p><p> CLAMAN: I just love that.</p><p> BACHMANN: Liz? </p><p> CLAMAN: Yes, go ahead.  </p><p> BACHMANN: Liz?</p><p> CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p> BACHMANN: The bigger question is, when will we get a pay back of the  tranche of $173 billion.  This was $165 million that was paid out in  bonuses.  What about the $173 billion that the taxpayers have already  invested into AIG?  When will we get paid that money back?  It doesn't  look like it will be any time soon.  And let's not forget, it was the  Obama stimulus bill that contains the clause that prohibits the federal  government from bringing those bonuses back in.  It was a clause slipped  in by Chris Dodd.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Yes, it was.  Yes, it was.</p><p> BACHMANN: And we members of Congress, we were prevented from reading  this bill because we didn't even have the bill online until after  midnight.  We had to debate at 9:00.  </p><p> CLAMAN: And let me end on Representative Peters then.  What about Chris  Dodd slipping that in that actually allowed these bonuses to be given  out?  Quickly, if you could.  </p><p> PETERS: Well, my understand is the deal's going forward.  The bill it  says forward (ph) that these bonuses cannot be paid.  It wasn't backward  looking.  It was forward looking.  It doesn't prohibit us from doing  that now.  Now we need to get a solution, bring that money back to the  taxpayers and bring it back now.</p><p> BACHMANN: No, it actually does.  It actually does (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CLAMAN: Well, I can say this much.  That Henry Paulson, the Treasury  secretary, probably wanted something that allowed those bonuses to  because he came from Wall Street and he has that mentality that, oh, you  can't retain anybody on Wall Street unless you promise them millions in  bonuses.  Folks, and I'm talking to the viewers now, it is an unspoken  word on Wall Street that you get paid $100,000 to $200,000 base salary,  but then the promise of the bonus comes through.  But usually, as I  understand it, to both of you representatives, it's based on  performance.  And we know the performance with AIG was dismal.  </p><p> PETERS: Right.  Right.</p><p> CLAMAN: All right.  Thanks to both of you, Congress members Gary Peters,  Michele Bachmann.  We'll be watching both of you today.  </p><p> BACHMANN: Thanks so much, Liz.  Thank you.</p><p> CLAMAN: You're welcome.  We'll watch you on the hearing.  </p><p> Washington isn't the only entity going after AIG.  New York Attorney  General Andrew Cuomo looking into taking legal action to try to find  justice for you, the American taxpayer, who has kept the company afloat.   With a closer look at Cuomo's case against AIG, I'm joined by Leslie  Crocker Snyder, a retired New York state supreme court justice and an  Manhattan district attorney candidate.  </p><p> Nice to see you.  </p><p> LESLIE CROCKER SNYDER, RETIRED NY STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: Nice to  see you.</p><p> CLAMAN: Well, we just had all this storm (ph) and drong (ph) and yelling  and talking of what can be done.  </p><p> SNYDER: Absolutely.</p><p> CLAMAN: You probably are somebody who knows.  Can anything be done? </p><p> SNYDER: Well, there are all sorts of solutions that have been proposed,  as we've just heard.  And we also heard the political spin from each  party, which I think we're going to hear a lot of, you know, criticizing  the administration, not criticizing the administration.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Absolutely.</p><p> SNYDER: My interest is really a legal one.  We're all morally outraged.   This is a terrible situation.  But we have to balance that with the law.   So right now we have Attorney General Cuomo, who is looking into whether  or not there was any fraud involved in the original contracts.</p><p> CLAMAN: What would fraud look like?  Tell us what we should be looking  for.  </p><p> SNYDER: Well, I guess it would be if people knew that they would never  be able to pay out these bonuses because losses were occurring in the  derivative section and basically they entered into this with some kind  of fraudulent knowledge.  It could be a number of things.  But remember,  basically we do have the rule of law.  Contracts are sacrosanct unless  there's something wrong with them.  </p><p> So we have to look at the other solutions.  Can we embarrass these  people into not accepting the bonuses?  That seems unlikely, but you  never know.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Well, half of them are -- you know, a couple of them are gone  and most of them are out in London and these are derivatives traders who  probably are kind faceless.  We haven't seen any names.  Cuomo is trying  to get the names.  </p><p> SNYDER: Right.  But we have to find a legal solution is my point.  Maybe  the clawback solution where we deduct the millions from the next payout  would be a reasonable one.  I like that because it seems as if it might  have the cloak of law.  So as much as we're outraged and we have to find  a solution, we have to find a legal solution.  And we can't lose sight  of that.  The public gets morally outraged, but we do operate in a rule  of law.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Absolutely.  Well, in his letter to Congressman Barney Frank,  Andrew Cuomo said it appears AIG had far more perhaps that was  underneath the actual story, the meat of the issue, and so we perhaps  might find more underneath there, but . . .</p><p> SNYDER: Cuomo's lawyers are great.  They're going to conduct a terrific  investigation.  If there's fraud there or something that could undo the  bonuses, they'll find it.  But if there isn't, then we're going to have  to look at, is this contract valid?  Is there some other way to approach  the situation? </p><p> CLAMAN: Now we don't want to do the old ripage (ph) of the contract.   And here on your screen is the actual breakdown here.  Top seven  executives getting more than $4 million each.  I like the 22 with more  than $2 million.  But the bottom one, 11 of these people who got at  least $1 million are no longer at AIG.  And you call them retention  bonuses.  This is a joke.  It's an outrage.  And it really, I think,  hits the crux of the matter.  </p><p> SNYDER: But we all feel that way.  It's outrageous.  And to see these  people leave when they supposedly were being paid this to stay is even  more outrageous.  But at the same time, what I'm saying is, there is a  legal solution here, we just don't know what it is yet.  We're going to  find that legal solution.  You can't start tearing up valid contracts  because then any time one side said, oh this is a bad contract by public  policy.  Let's just unilaterally rip it up.  </p><p> CLAMAN: But if it says -- but if the contract says you have to perform a  job, surely the job wasn't to put the company in the toilet.  </p><p> SNYDER: I agree with that.  So you have to look technically at that  contract and find a way out of it.  You can't just rip it up.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Anybody have a copy?  Anybody have a copy of these contracts?   We'll take it.</p><p> SNYDER: We'll find a way, I am sure, whatever it is.  It might be the  clawback.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Leslie Crocker Snyder, former New York state supreme justice,  former prosecutor, I might add as well.  </p><p> SNYDER: As well, yes.</p><p> CLAMAN: Tough, tough woman sitting next to me.  </p><p> SNYDER: Oh, I've got a soft side, really, just not for AIG.  </p><p> CLAMAN: I know.  I don't think many Americans do.  Thank you for coming  in.  </p><p> SNYDER: Thank you.</p><p> CLAMAN: We have some breaking news from \"The New York Post.\"  AIG is  trying to sell its 66-story headquarters in Manhattan for $100 million.   The firm may also try and sell 72 Wall Street, that's the union which  represents Dorman and Porters (ph).  And that may be the potential  buyer.  \"The Post\" is owned by our parent company News Corp., but this  goes back to Bear Stearns and the whole headquarters issue.  What do you  do with the building?  They could sell it and make some money there.  </p><p> SNYDER: Possibility.</p><p> CLAMAN: Then how do they run the business?  </p><p> SNYDER: That's another question.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Thank you, Leslie, very much.  </p><p> Keep the e-mails coming folks, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p> Coming up, major news on the tech front.  If you're just waking up,  we've got reports that IBM is ready to make a massive deal that could  move the tech sector -- huge -- with a big name that was so hot during  the dot-com go-go era.  </p><p> And later on Fox Business, I'll have an exclusive interview with  AutoNation President Mike Maroone.  AutoNation preparing to make a major  announcement today.  It involves anyone buying a car from them.  They  are the nation's largest auto dealer.  Wait till you hear this news,  exclusively at 3:30 p.m. on a count down to the closing bell right here  with me and the rest of the Fox Business Network.  </p><p> Stay tuned.  Much more coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CLAMAN: So we've got some major tech headlines this morning.  This is  fun.  Action here in the business world.  \"The Wall Street Journal\"  reporting that IBM is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems.  Yes, Java, big  blue could pay $6.5 billion in cash.  And then Oracle, the software  giant, releasing earnings today after the bell.  Fox Business' Shibani  Joshi joining me now with more.  </p><p> What do you want to start with?  There's just so many good stories.</p><p> SHIBANI JOSHI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: I know, there's so much god stuff.   It's great stuff.  </p><p> Well, let's talk about this big merger going on today.  IBM potentially  buying Sun Microsystems in cash, $6.5 billion.  Now, Sun Microsystems  has been long called an acquisition target for many, many years.  IBM,  Dell, HP, all the names that are being throwing out there or have been  thrown out there that could potentially be interested in the company.   IBM apparently in the works of making a move out there.  And you can see  what the stock price of Sun is, about $5, and the deal would be actually  double the stock price right now.  IBM trying to become more of the Wal- Mart of the technology industry.  The one-stop shop.  The place that you  go to for hardware and software.  It's just so big . . .</p><p> CLAMAN: That's 100 percent premium for that price.</p><p> JOSHI: One hundred percent premium.  But this stock price has been  battered.  And it's a $5 stock.  And as you mentioned, it was the  darling of the technology sector when the boom happened.  No longer,  though.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Interesting.  And let's go to Oracle.  </p><p> JOSHI: Oracle.  Great company.  This -- the earnings are coming out  after the close today.  You know, this company's interesting because,  look, there's no such thing as recession resistant in this industry,  recession proof, but this company's very recession resistant in the fact  a lot of their revenues and their sales are recurring.  So they've  locked in contracts.  They have a licensed business.  And basically they  have recurring revenue coming in month after month after month.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Keep this chart up.  Keep this chart up.  Everybody look at it  right now.  It's rare to see any 52-week chart where there isn't a  massive drop off.  Look at Oracle.  Not necessarily at its 52-week  highs, but it's not that far from it, at least halfway.  And this -- I  find that interesting. They're doing business properly in a tough  climate.  </p><p> JOSHI: Right.  And that's because of this recurring revenue phenomenon  that the company has.  The company's also been doing some amazing cost  cutting initiatives.  Also been buying back stocks.  So that's helped to  stabilize earnings per share.  </p><p> Overall, people expecting 32 cents a share.  Probably going to come in  line.  Friedman Billings and Ramsey thinks it's going to come in a  little bit under.  But even still, this company is -- this is one of the  companies you want to bet on to stay more stabilized in whatever is  going to happen over the next six to nine months.  </p><p> CLAMAN: I find it fascinating the Nasdaq had a great day yesterday.</p><p> JOSHI: Yes.</p><p> CLAMAN: Up double digits.  </p><p> JOSHI: Yes.</p><p> CLAMAN: Is it tech stocks that will lead us out of this recession? </p><p> JOSHI: It's so hard to say because a lot of people say, yes, because  these companies are cash rich, they're debt less or debt low.  And  they're innovating.  You know want, it's so remarkable, and what I  always talk about when I'm at the Nasdaq is, this is the stuff that you  want to watch and pay attention to in these very volatile times.  These  companies are starting to play offense.  We've got Microsoft, IBM, Cisco  all making big announcements.  They're coming out and investing just  (ph) for the long term.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Shibani Joshi is your woman when those numbers come out.  Thank  you very much.</p><p> JOSHI: Yes.</p><p> CLAMAN: Coming up, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas joining us  live to talk about what lawmakers are doing to get money back from AIG.   And that is now your money.  </p><p> And California here he comes.  President Obama heading to the golden  state today.  We'll tell you what's on tap there.  </p><p> Much more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST on the way.  We're so happy you're joining  us this Tuesday morning -- Wednesday.  Wednesday.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GAVIN GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm  Gavin Gray in London, standing in this week for Ashley Webster.  </p><p> A check on the European markets so far.  Let's start where, well, where  it's best, I'm afraid.  The only bit of green on the board.  Frankfurt  DAX up 17 points just over the 4,000 barrier there.  That a rise of  about 0.4 percent.  To Paris.  I'm afraid the CAC 40 has come down now.   It did start the morning in positive territory.  But down almost five  points.  And over to the FTSE, which only for a few moments went into  green.  It spent the rest of the day in red and it's currently there,  down almost 30 points.  </p><p> And a little bit about unemployment today.  We've had the figures out.   Unemployment up to over 2 million in the U.K.  That's about 6.5 percent  of the workforce.  It was a step rise and one that's caused a bit of a  shock over here.  </p><p> Back to you, Jenna.  </p><p> JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.  </p><p> Good morning, once again, everyone.  We're going to update you here on  the AIG saga.  </p><p> AIG's CEO Ed Liddy ready to face the music on Capitol Hill today.  He'll  likely be grilled about $165 million in bonuses paid to employees at the  very unit that led to AIG's near collapse.  Liddy has defended the  bonuses, saying AIG was contractually obligated to pay them.  In fact,  in an op-ed piece in today's \"Washington Post,\" Liddy says, \"in America,  when you owe people money, you pay them.\"  Earlier on MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST, we spoke with Representative Jim Himes, who had the chance to  met with Liddy.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. JIM HIMES, (D) CONNECTICUT: Well, I had the opportunity to sit with  Mr. Liddy in my office yesterday.  And what I told him was, you know,  it's not just important that the right thing happen, but that the right  thing be seen to happen.  So I said, you know, look, my experience is  that 10 very smart lawyers in a room can make just about anything  happen.  So, please, get 10 lawyers in a room and figure out how to fix  this.  And if you can't do that, get these 73 people that are receiving  these bonuses together in a conference room and say, folks, this is the  time to stand up and do the right thing for your country.  Give back the  money.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LEE: Give back the money.  The Treasury Department and several senators  are looking at ways to get the money back from AIG or from the  individual employees.  </p><p> Well, the family of a Connecticut woman violently attacked by a  chimpanzee is suing for $50 million in damages from the chimps owner.   Lawyers for Charla Nash allege Sandra Herold, the chimp's owner, was  liable for the attack as a result of her negligence and recklessness in  caring for the ape.  They claim Herold knew about the chimp's violent  history and did not do enough to protect people.  </p><p> All right.  You're up-to-date here on the Fox Business Network.  Coming  up, we're going to see if prices for your groceries are falling with the  latest Consumer Price Index number.  That's next on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  coming up at 8:30 Eastern Time.  We'll be right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CLAMAN: And happy Wednesday.  Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm  Liz Claman.  Alexis Glick is off today.  </p><p> I want to take a quick look at the futures here.  We've pretty much been  languishing slightly below positive territory here.  That would be  negative, Liz.  Dow Jones Industrials down 53 points.  Those are the  futures numbers.  S&amp;P, which gives us a better sense of how the markets  might open, showing some red on the screen, down 4.40.  The Nasdaq down  about 3.  Remember, we're coming off a triple digit gain for the Dow  Jones Industrials, which was a really strong move for the Nasdaq  yesterday.  And that was, what, five days out of six that we were moving  higher.  </p><p> We are awaiting the release of the February Consumer Price Index, the  CPI.  And analyst estimates, the all items CPI climbed by 0.4 percent  last month.  That would actually mark the second consecutive increase.   Let's get the number right now.  </p><p> MCSHANE: Al right, Liz, appreciate it.  </p><p> And here comes the number coming down.  And we'll see whether or not if  we did get the increase or not.  CPI up 0.4 percent.  So there you have  it, exactly what you would expect.  Ex food and energy, up 0.2 percent.   The consensus had been for a 0.1 percent gain on that particular metric  there.  So up 0.4 percent on the headline figure.  Up 0.2 percent when  you back out the so-called food and energy volatile prices there.  </p><p> Now, the year-over-year increase, .2 percent.  The consensus had been  for that to be unchanged year-over-year, so it actually went up a little  bit on that measure.  And when you take out food and energy on a yearly  basis, it was up 1.8 percent.  </p><p> So that is the CPI figure there.  As you see it, the only other thing  that's coming out right now is the current account deficit, which is  $132.8 billion, a little bit less than the consensus, $137 billion, that  had been expected.  </p><p> Now, a quick look at the markets to see how we are reacting to these  figures.  Liz showed you that the futures were down exactly as they are  now, by 50-plus points on the Dow, and about 4 on the S&amp;P futures.  </p><p> So, again, CPI going up, and that's exactly what we expected, Liz, with  the consensus on the core rate.  A little bit above -- I should say the  consensus was a little below the actual number, which was .2 on the  core.  </p><p> Back to you.</p><p> CLAMAN:  And always important to point out that the Consumer Price Index  is really -- for folks who don't understand the CPI -- it's basically  inflation at the consumer level, for what you pay out there.  </p><p> Joining me now with instant analysis of the February Consumer Price  Index, Stephen Leeb, president of Leeb Capital Management, and Matt  McCall, the president of Penn Financial Group.  </p><p> Stephen, this number...</p><p> STEPHEN LEEB, PRESIDENT, LEEB CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Half full, half  empty.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Yes, but why are we even looking at inflation right now?   Should we be?  </p><p> LEEB:  Well, you know, I think, Liz, before we know it, we should be  looking at it.  I mean, this is an economy that I think once it  recovers, and if we get this banking crisis under control, which I think  we will one of these days, this recovery could be breathtaking, and it  could lead very, very quickly to a lot of inflation.</p><p> CLAMAN:  That is an interesting point.  </p><p> Just as quickly as economists were caught flat-footed by this downturn,  could they well be caught by an upturn?  </p><p> MATT MCCALL, PRESIDENT, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP:  Absolutely.  And a lot of  economists are talking about deflation right now.  And I'm on the  opposite side of the field.  </p><p> I think inflation is going to be a major issue.  When you're really  spending $3 trillion, and you have to budget that, where's that money  coming from?  </p><p> You're going to have to raise rates, and it's going to lead to  inflation.  And at the end of the day, if you're not ready for this, and  you don't have your portfolio set, you could really be caught like you  just said, like economists were.  </p><p> LEEB:  Well, you know, Liz, if you look at some of the data that's  coming, I mean, oil prices from $35 to nearly $50.  And this economy  down 6 percent.  What's going to happen when we're growing by 2 percent?  </p><p> Copper prices up 20 percent.  I mean, you've had this tremendous rally  in commodities, even before we've gotten off the tarmac in this economy.   Imagine what happens when the world really starts to grow.  There is  going to be no natural resources.</p><p> CLAMAN:  And what about this theory that we have printed so much money,  that the value of the dollar will eventually go down and inflation will  rear its head?  </p><p> MCCALL:  Absolutely.  I mean, you have to play, if you're looking at  stocks, what is going to -- how do you play a falling dollar?  You look  global.  How do you play inflation?  Gold kips (ph).  </p><p> And I'm actually putting my money where my mouth is.  I've been buying  kips (ph) over the last couple months, I've been buying gold over the  last couple of years, setting up for what could possibly be  hyperinflation.  </p><p> LEEB:  I have no argument with him.  I'd love to argue with him, but  no...</p><p> CLAMAN:  Fight him.  Come on.  </p><p> LEEB:  I can't.  No, I mean, kips (ph) and gold are probably our largest  positions right now.  I mean, it's not so much the dollar.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Even though gold touched $1,000 a couple of weeks ago?  And  look at it now.  It's down $10 at the moment to $906.  Is this a buying  opportunity?  </p><p> LEEB:  Yes, it is.  I mean, can gold go to $850 or $800?  Absolutely.   But just look at gold the last eight years.  What asset has finished  every year in the last 8 higher than it was the year before?   </p><p> CLAMAN:  But let's go back to consumer prices.  We do see a slight  uptick, of course, of the core rate, which often sort of strips out the  very volatile food and energy prices, although energy is not so volatile  lately.  But the consumer, how will he or she feel it out there?  </p><p> MCCALL:  I think they're going to feel -- going to the food, I mean, we  all go to the grocery store every day.  And when we see how the prices - - they have not come down.  </p><p> Even though this economy has come down, our wages have come down, prices  at the grocery store have not come down.  Maybe we're buying the private  label versus the brand name; however, those prices are still high.  And  once we see wheat prices, corn prices start picking back up again, as  you spoke of earlier with the commodity prices, we're going to see even  higher prices for the consumer.</p><p> CLAMAN:  By the way, we got General Mills' numbers earlier this morning,  and they actually missed estimates.  But interestingly enough, they  upped their full-year guidance, and commodity prices are down.  They're  still managing to make money.  Something tells me that when they hiked  those cereal prices -- remember that?</p><p> LEEB:  Yes.</p><p> CLAMAN:  ... or they made the boxes smaller but kept the price the same,  they still have pricing power.  </p><p> LEEB:  Liz, what you have to understand, there are 2.3 billion people in  China and India.  These economies are still growing.  So are the Middle  Eastern economies.</p><p> At least half the world is still growing.  And that half is the world  that needs commodities in order to grow.  They need evermore  commodities.  </p><p> In this country, we can grow without using additional commodities.   Europe can grow without using additional commodities.  But the engine of  this world need commodities in order to grow.  </p><p> MCCALL:  And as the middle class grows, more food.</p><p> LEEB:  Everything more.  Moving up the food chain.</p><p> CLAMAN:  I'm not hearing either of you say buy equities.  You're not  saying that now.  </p><p> LEEB:  Well, I think buy selected equities.</p><p> CLAMAN:  That are related to commodities?  </p><p> LEEB:  Well, that are related to inflation.  I mean, you know, growth  stocks that -- I think, you know, basically any company that came  through 2008, which I think is kind of a microcosm for what to expect  over the next five to 10 years, inflation, deflation, et cetera, is  probably a good buy.  Stocks like TEVA, for example, stocks like CVS.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Do you own those?  </p><p> LEEB:  Yes.</p><p> CLAMAN:  What about you?  </p><p> MCCALL:  I do.  I like stocks here, but you have to be a stock picker.   But I think the two areas that I'm looking at, one is market turns,  emerging markets and commodities, both based on this commodity inflation  play.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Stephen, Matt, thanks to both of you.  </p><p> LEEB:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p> CLAMAN:  They're liking gold right now.  What can I say?  And copper.  </p><p> Let me guess, you like palladium, too?  </p><p> LEEB:  Yes!  </p><p> CLAMAN:  I knew he liked palladium!</p><p> LEEB:  And platinum.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Nickel and zinc as well.  </p><p> LEEB:  We're compatriots.  I didn't know him the first time I met you.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CLAMAN:  Coming up, we'll see if Apple's big iPhone update gave its  stock a big boost with a look at the Fox 50.  </p><p> And then in 90 seconds, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas joining me  live to talk about the growing outrage from lawmakers in Washington over  the bonuses handed out by AIG.  And what about her colleagues who took  money from the troubled insurer?  </p><p> A lot of answering that we are expecting here, but stay tuned.  We've  got much more than that on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> PAYNE:  The Fox 50 returning to its winning ways yesterday.  Our index  gained 17 points to close at 584.  </p><p> This morning, there is word of a posible merger in the index.  IBM could  buy Sun Microsystems.  </p><p> For more, I'm joined by Matt McCall, the president of Penn Financial  Group.  </p><p> Let's start with Apple real quick, though.</p><p> The stock was up big time yesterday.  It had been floating around.  It  looks like it's on the cusp of a major breakout through $100.  Is it all  about updating their software or is there more to it?  </p><p> MCCALL:  I think there's more to it.  I mean, updating the software, the  good news always gives Apple, you know, a bit of a bounce.  People love  hearing the new products coming out.  </p><p> However, I think Apple is just a value at this level.  If you're looking  for growth plays, looking for something to play off the consumer turning  around, Apple's the best play.  I own the stock and think it's a great  long-term...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PAYNE:  You got a target on it?  </p><p> MCCALL:  You know, I'm looking at about $120 is the next couple of  months.  If it breaks through -- like you just said, if it gets through  that $100 level, it's going to take off.  But it's been struggling there  over the last few weeks.</p><p> PAYNE:  IBM in the news in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning,  perhaps buying Sun Micro $6.5 billion.  Do you like the deal?  IBM just  down a little bit on that news.   </p><p> MCCALL:  I think it's a good deal.  I think they're picking up on cheap  -- I mean, Sun's down 71 percent over the last 12 months.  Even though  you're paying 100 percent premium, I think it's a nice play.  </p><p> And you look at IBM stock over the last couple of years, it's one of the  few big tech stocks that's held up very well.  So it's one of those --  you know, the grandmother stock.  Your grandmother can buy IBM and throw  it in her basket.</p><p> PAYNE:  Do you own any?  </p><p> MCCALL:  I do own some IBM, yes.</p><p> PAYNE:  Really?  Good.  Good.  </p><p> All right.  We've got to talk about Coca-Cola.  This is really  interesting.  </p><p> We've seen some saber rattling out of China with respect to holding out  treasuries.  We think something is going on here behind the scenes.  Now  they're rejecting a possible takeover of Coke, one of their largest  fruit juice companies, $2.4 billion bid for high-end juice.  </p><p> What do you make of this and what's the impact going to be on IBM?  </p><p> MCCALL:  I think eventually it's going to get through.  I think this  deal will eventually get through.  Maybe not this company...</p><p> PAYNE:  IBM's already said though -- I think they've said already this  morning that they're not going to pursue it any more.  I'm sorry, Coke.  </p><p> MCCALL:  Coke.</p><p> PAYNE:  Obviously IBM's not going to pursue it.</p><p> MCCALL:  They'll take a different angle.  I think they want to get in  China.  They know the growth potential in China.  They're going to get  over there.</p><p> The one concern though with Coke, in looking at the way the stock has  performed recently, it's gotten hit because of the dollar.  I mean, the  dollar has risen, and they're such a global company, but I think the  U.S. dollar is going to fall in the next, let's say, 12 to 18 months.   So this is a play on the falling U.S. dollar, it is a play on growth.  </p><p> But as a stock, I don't know.  And I think there's a lot more exciting  plays out there right now.</p><p> PAYNE:  Well, let's talk about something that's been really exciting  recently, Bank of America.  The chairman, he's really been on the  offensive here recently.  Now talking about possibly paying back TARP  money this year.  </p><p> A, do you believe him?  And B, could this help the stock?  It was edging  up before we came on air.  It was edging just a little bit higher.  </p><p> MCCALL:  I mean, how can you believe him?  I mean, honestly, I don't  believe a word out of anybody's mouth from Wall Street to the White  House anymore.  I think (INAUDIBLE) research.  Buying Bank of America  here, it's like throwing a dart.  I mean, it's probably going to be one  to make it out.  </p><p> I'm much prefer...</p><p> PAYNE:  You just said you want excitement.  This is exciting.  </p><p> MCCALL:  It's exciting, but I also want to get some sleep at night as  well.  So I don't like it here.  I like J.P.  Morgan, Goldman Sachs,  Morgan Stanley.  Those are the three that I'd be looking at.  Not as  exciting as a Bank of America or Citigroup, but a much better risk  reward play.</p><p> PAYNE:  Right, less risk.  And...</p><p> MCCALL:  And the reward is still high.  I mean, I think you have a lot  of upside on all three of those stocks.</p><p> PAYNE:  Thanks a lot, Matt.  Really appreciate it.</p><p> MCCALL:  Thanks, Charles.</p><p> (NEWSBREAK)</p><p> CLAMAN:  Lawmakers are up in arms over the $165 million bonuses handed  out to American International Group.  And the head of the Senate Banking  Committee, Chris Dodd of Connecticut, says he supports his colleagues'  calls to recoup the taxpayer funds.  </p><p> Dodd, though, has received nearly $300,000 over 20 years from the failed  insurer.  And folks, you know what?  He's not alone.  The list is  legion, including both Republicans and Democrats who took money from  AIG.</p><p> But here now to weigh in on the topic, Republican Senator Kay Bailey  Hutchison of Texas.  </p><p> Welcome, Senator.  Thank you for joining us.  </p><p> SEN. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON (R), TEXAS:  Thank you, liz.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Well, let me ask you, first, did you take any money from AIG in  campaign contributions?  </p><p> HUTCHISON:  Liz, I don't know.  I'm so sorry.  I don't know.  I have not  even looked at my contribution list with regard to that.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  It's never come up?  Really?</p><p> HUTCHISON:  I have a very firm opinion about these bonuses.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Yes.</p><p> HUTCHISON:  You know, regardless of whether I have -- and we can  certainly check that -- I think that what the executives are doing is  outrageous.  I think retention bonuses for people who have already left  is just not acceptable to the American people.</p><p> CLAMAN:  I'm sure, because it's become such a hot-button issue here.  We  have received this morning alone hundreds and hundreds of e-mails.  </p><p> What are your constituents telling you, Senator?  </p><p> HUTCHISON:  Oh, they're outraged.  They're outraged by all of the big  spending that scares people to death with the debt that we have and the  deficits that we are accumulating.  </p><p> They are outraged by these bailouts.  Some are to big to fail, some are  not.  The bailout mania, I think, has just gone out of control, and  that's what I'm hearing from my constituents.  </p><p> And you know, Liz, there is more of a fear factor than I've known in my  lifetime right now, because they see the problem, but they don't see a  solution that is going to work.  And that's what I'm hearing.</p><p> CLAMAN:  These bonuses have everybody so riled up, Senator, as you know.   But are we missing the bigger picture?  And that is that when the TARP  was pushed through initially, it just wasn't put in place where there  were handcuffs that would prevent this kind of thing from happening,  even though people demanded it.  </p><p> Did Congress members read this closely enough?  Why didn't they ensure  that something would be put in that would prevent us down the road from  facing this angst and anger?  </p><p> HUTCHISON:  I think that is a very legitimate criticism.  I do.  </p><p> Originally, Secretary Paulson asked for no strings at all, wanted $700  billion, and said that the global economy was going to crash if we  didn't do it.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  I remember.</p><p> HUTCHISON:  We didn't give him a no-strings-attached opening of the  Treasury.  We cut it to $350 billion.  </p><p> We did put parameters around it.  But clearly, we did not foresee all of  the things that these people would do, like take trips, like give  bonuses.  We just thought that there would be a factor where all of  these executives would come together like Americans come together to  solve problems, and that they would do the right thing.  </p><p> That was a mistaken assumption.  However, now, Liz, we are not learning  from that mistake, and we are continuing to throw money at problems  without the necessary restraint and parameters put around it.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Sure.  Are you, Senator -- are you of the belief we can't let  AIG go down because something horrible will happen?  </p><p> HUTCHISON:  Well, as I understand it, AIG has such a global impact  because it is an insurer of last resort in so many areas.  And that's  why the original AIG bailout came from the Treasury, because Mr.  Bernanke saw that as well.  </p><p> Now we actually have put 80 percent of the company's capital on the line  from American taxpayers, and I just think we've got to take a stronger  control here.  And we can't own 80 percent of a company and have  executives taking bonuses for retention when they've already left.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Do you think...</p><p> HUTCHISON:  Let me say, too, Liz, I think you all talked about this  earlier today.  The contracts have already been breached.  So to say  this is a contractual obligation, when they have not met the performance  standards that are in the contract, I think does bring into question  that we would have the power to do more.</p><p> CLAMAN:  I'm absolutely with you on that.  A contract, I absolutely  believe, should be held up.  But when the other side doesn't deliver  what they promised, that's a problem.  </p><p> An opinion article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" yesterday said this:  \"The politicians prefer to talk about AIG's latest bonus payments  because they deflect attention from Washington's failure to supervise  AIG.\"</p><p> How do you respond to that, Senator?  </p><p> HUTCHISON:  I think it's valid.  I think that the regulatory reform that  is needed for AIG and for our financial institutions, and for the  institutions that are doing all of these fancy derivatives that have  been virtually unregulated, must be regulated in a responsible way.  We  don't want to go overboard, but we certainly know where the vacancies  are in our regulatory system today, and we need to address that.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Senator, one of your constituents just shot us an e-mail,  wanted to get it to you.  Neil Lewis in Granbury, Texas, says, \"Why are  we outraged at the bonuses when we are supporting foreign banks to the  tunes of tens of billions of dollars?\"</p><p> Now, just to clarify, foreigners have bought a lot of our debt.  So this  is perhaps a hairier, more complex issue.  But do you have an answer for  him?  </p><p> HUTCHISON:  Well, I think that it's correct to say that some of this  stimulus or bailout money has gone to foreign banks.  Part of it AIG.   And that is an area that we need to look at, where this money is going,  and have more strings on it so that we assure that our financial  institutions are being shored up, but also that they're getting credit  out there.  </p><p> You say, what are my constituents saying?  My constituents are saying  they cannot get credit in the marketplace.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Still, after all of that?</p><p> HUTCHISON:  My small businesses, my medium-size businesses cannot get  credit.  My auto dealers cannot get credit.  It is -- that's what we've  got to address.  And where all of this money is going from the bailout,  into foreign coffers, I think is a legitimate question, of course.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Last question.  Quickly, do you think Treasury Secretary Tim  Geithner has a handle on this?  </p><p> HUTCHISON:  Well, I have to say that I don't see that he has come  forward with a plan that can work.  We don't see credit flowing.  </p><p> I think that we made mistakes last fall, but we have not learned from  those mistakes this spring.  And I am very concerned that he is not on  top of it, and that we have got to get a handle on the financial  situation and the housing situation and stop all these stimulus packages  until we correct that.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Very sensible talking from you this morning, Senator.  Thank  you.</p><p> Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.  </p><p> HUTCHISON:  Thank you, Liz.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Any time.</p><p> Coming up, we have a look at \"The One Thing You Should Know.\" </p><p> Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CLAMAN:  And now it's time for \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p> And that is people are still buzzing over AIG's bonus handouts.  We've  been getting your e-mails all morning long.  We wanted to read a few  more.  Thank you so much for sending them.  </p><p> Time to dig -- and so let's read some of these e-mails.  We'll dig into  the mail bag and see what everybody is talking about.  </p><p> Glenn in Auburn, Alabama talks about AIG employees who are threatening  to leave if they don't get their bonuses.  Ah, yes.  He says, \"These  people caused the problems!  So what if they leave?  Good riddance!\"</p><p> PAYNE:  Well, the point is, half of them are already gone.</p><p> CLAMAN:  I know.  They left with the money.  See, they're smarter than  we are.</p><p> LEE:  Left with the money, yes.</p><p> Robert of Charleston, South Carolina, says, \"Almost anything the  government or AIG does to address the utter audacity of this scandal  will be hard to trust.\"</p><p> So that's the next kind of chapter of this problem, right?</p><p> CLAMAN:  And remember, Fox Business will be carrying that at 10:00 a.m.  Eastern today, the hearing on Capitol Hill.</p><p> PAYNE:  By the way, guys, ,on that trust issue, how can private funds  trust the government not to limit their profits if they go into this  partnership on these toxic assets, considering the uproar?  Because  billions are going to be made on that if it's done right.  </p><p> Bill Stevens of Jamestown, North Carolina, asks, \"Where was Timothy  Geithner on this issue?  Where was he when agreements were extended  under his watch?  I'll tell you what -- out to lunch -- like he is on  all other economic issues.\"</p><p> CLAMAN:  It was interesting.  Did you just see Senator Kay Bailey  Hutchison?  She took a breath when I said does Tim Geithner have a  handle on this?  Granted, he's got to have a handle on a bunch of other  issues, too.  So it's very tough out there.</p><p> LEE:  Yes, she did kind of...</p><p> PAYNE:  But he's the number one guy.  We need confidence in him, and  obviously very few people have confidence.</p><p> CLAMAN:  If he's there, you have got to have confidence in these people.  </p><p> Keep the e-mails coming, folks, moneyforbreakfast @foxbusiness.com.   It's very important that you e-mail us and let us know, because we are  the one network who is letting your e-mails be, you know, read.  And we  understand how this feels.  </p><p> But we've got to move this discussion forward.  The dialogue has to move  forward from, yes, we're totally annoyed, to what's going to happen?  </p><p> LEE:  And speaking of moving it forward, you have a big interview coming  up on \"THE CLOSING BELL\" today.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Mike Maroone of AutoNation.  He's the president of the nation's  largest auto dealer.  They have a huge announcement, exclusively right  here on Fox Business.  It affects every single person who wants to buy  any kind of car from these AutoNation dealers.  </p><p> So stay tuned for that.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  Well, I'll definitely be watching.</p><p> CLAMAN:  \"COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL,\" 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  </p><p> Thank you so much for joining us.  We hope you have a great day.   </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Alexis Glick is off today.</p><p>We're going to have much more on all this anger, this drama stemming from the AIG bonuses, and so much of it, we know it's coming from you.</p><p>And we actually really do want to hear from you. Are you outraged? But specifically, why? Don't just say, \"Yes, I'm furious.\" We want to know why you're outrage and you can actually email us right here at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email> and we'll actually share those with you later in the show. We'll read what some of you have to say.</p><p>But first let's get you caught up on the futures here and this after a day where we had a triple digit gain for the DOW Jones Industrial. Futures are lower today at the moment DOW Jones Industrial futures down 44 but we tend to look more at the S&amp;P futures, they give you a better sense of what might happen with the market, they're down nearly five points; the NASDAQ down four.</p><p>Let's send it right now to Connell McShane at the Fox Business desk with the very latest. He's got earnings out from General Mills -- Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: They look a little light, Liz, $3.79 a share X-items has been the number that's been reported by General Mills but the Street's looking for $0.88, so light on that front. Interesting to point out that the company says it's raising its guidance for the full year but when you look at it the guidance is still light, of where the Street estimate is. You see where the stock close yesterday $3.38 to $3.87 for the full year, $3.94 is the estimate. So the top end of the guidance at $3.87 is still light of the estimate.</p><p>General Mills among other things talking about currency translations hurting their earnings a little bit, reducing sales growth by three percentage points. The currency translation so GIS, General Mills certainly will a stock to watch today here, Liz. This one is down about 11 percent with the markets so far this year.</p><p>But the earnings look light, we'll have more on it later on the morning, right now back over to you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, we'll be talking much more about General Mills because clearly you cannot ignore Count Chocolate and Boo Berry. Very important.</p><p>MCSHANE: I know it.</p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you Connell.</p><p>As I mentioned we're taking a closer look at this hour at the outrage over AIG. So let's start with the latest news, first off, Chairman and CEO of American International Group Ed Liddy pulling up a chair at a Congressional witness table today. This one is going to be so closely watched he will take massive heat. I promise you every lawmaker is going to want to make his or her voice heard very loudly, this over the more than $200 million in bonuses.</p><p>Meanwhile, Congress and the White House trying to find ways to strip bonus recipients of the money they got. Some of these people are not even with the company anymore and they we're getting millions and million of dollars worth.</p><p>The chairman of ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee proposed companies and individuals pay a 35 percent tax on all retention awards and bonuses over $50,000.</p><p>And in a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner suggesting holding back the bonus amount from upcoming bailout funds for AIG.</p><p>There are all kinds of ideas being thrown out here on how to get the money back but do you have ideas, I mean, how angry are you over this bonus debacle? If you are steamed, you're not alone we're not just talking about lawmakers.</p><p>Fox Business's senior Washington correspondent, Peter Barnes is in our Washington Bureau with the results -- Peter a new Pew Research Center Poll, boy they gets these things out pretty quickly, what do we see?</p><p>PETER BARNES, FBN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well that's right, Liz, the AIG bonus controversy a possible big political headache for President Obama if the financial bailout doesn't work and if he has to go back to Congress later for more money to help banks.</p><p>The White House continuing to express outrage about the bonuses, distancing itself from the controversy and trying to get out in front of the story that was inevitably going to dominate the headlines anyway.</p><p>But the President remains fully vested in a bank rescue plan, he voted for it as a Senator. And as President he says it is critical to reviving bank lending and the economy.</p><p>On Monday, the Pew Research Center released the poll that found that 87 percent of people are outright angry about or at least bothered by bank bailouts.</p><p>In the poll, despite their anger, people still supported bank rescues as a policy 48 percent to 40 percent. But the poll was taken last week before revelations of the AIG bonuses.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL DIMOCK, PEW RESEARCH CENTER: I think if anything this has intensified the emotional feeling that people have. Again, they've been giving a clear example of the downside of this policy the problems with the way that this money is being spent. I think that intensifies the anger now. Whether it's going to undermine the support for the policy, it's something that we're going to need to see how it plays out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES: Now, the President has to be somewhat careful on how he plays the AIG bonus controversy, Dimock says. His job approval rating is starting to slip. The PEW poll shows it down five points from February to March, Dimock says mainly over public concern about his stimulus plan, his budget and how they will increase the deficit as well as some concern over his foreign policy.</p><p>But the President did include a $750 billion placeholder in his budget for more funding for bank bailouts if he needs it. Being outraged about how AIG now may leave the President in a delicate political position, later with Congress and voters trying to turn a negative consequence of the bailout, taxpayer money going to big bonuses into a positive, cleaning up the system by continuing those very bailouts.</p><p>Liz, back to you.</p><p>CLAMAN: There is no way Peter, anybody is going rubber-stamp more spending with these AIG bonuses unless this gets resolved. Unbelievable. Thanks for the PEW Research Center.</p><p>BARNES: No way, you're right.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, here take my money.</p><p>BARNES: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: The AIG bonus was the talk of the halls on Capitol Hill yesterday. Massachusetts Congressman and Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee Barney Frank was confounded by Ed Liddy of AIG's reasoning for payment of the bonuses. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BARNEY FRANK, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE: Mr. Liddy gave two arguments. One, was my hands are tied legally but the other was a policy argument. He doesn't want to rescind them because he wants to retain those people. I am very skeptical that retaining the people who made the mistakes is a good idea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAMAN: For more on today's hearings and this outrage that we know so many of you are feeling, I am joined now by Democratic Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut and Republican Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. Both served on the House Financial Services Committee.</p><p>Well, did you bring your boxing gloves? Both of you, I can only imagine...</p><p>REP. JIM HIMES (D), CONNECTICUT: Good morning Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: Ed Liddy sitting in front of you. I will start with the Representative Himes. Give me a sense of what you want and need to hear from Ed Liddy today.</p><p>HIMES: Well, you know, as you pointed out in your story the outrage is out there is unbelievable. And you know, Congress represents the people and so I think you are going to see some outrage today.</p><p>But you know I had the opportunity to sit with Mr. Liddy in my office yesterday. And what I told him was, it's not just important that the right thing happens but that the right thing be seen to happen.</p><p>So I said, you know look, my experience is that 10 very smart lawyers in the room can make just about anything happen so please get 10 lawyers in the room and figure out how to fix this.</p><p>And if you can't do that, get these 73 people that are receiving these bonuses together in a conference room and say folks, this is the time to stand up and do the right thing for your country.</p><p>Give back the money. Because if those two things don't happen, action will be taken either in the halls of Congress or by the State of Connecticut where this particular unit is resident. And it's really important that they step up and do the right thing not just so that the many people who have lost their jobs out there see that everybody is in this together but because as you point out, we are not through stabilizing the financial sector yet.</p><p>We've got work yet to do and every time something like this happens our hands get tied.</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Moore Capito, Ed Liddy has an op-ed piece in the \"Washington Post\" today and in it one of the lines that caught my eye was where he said, \"In America when we owe people money we pay them, ok.\" So I think that's not nod to the hall if there is a contract you can't break it in America we get that.</p><p>We understand that but Representative Himes, just said, get a couple of lawyers into the room. We can figure something out here.</p><p>Congress has suggested taxing these bonuses up to 95 percent and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner says that he's working on this as well but what is your solution? What do you and your brethren in Congress feel about this?</p><p>SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO (R), WEST VIRGINIA: Well, I think we recognize with all of the different programs and policies that are coming forward, that just this morning as I was coming in the guard said to me something isn't right. And we need to make this situation to a point where people understand what's going on but still reflecting the outrage and the astonishment of the lack of transparency and the lack of accountability.</p><p>My question to Mr. Liddy will be you knew these were part of the contract, you knew in good faith and bargaining good faith with the United States government why were these questions not answered?</p><p>Where is the transparency and accountability of the tax dollars? Why did AIG not come forward and if they did, why did the Treasury accept this as part of the agreement to further fund and to further bailout this company?</p><p>CLAMAN: I am glad you brought up the Treasury Secretary. Representative Himes, we talked about what Treasury Secretary Geithner wants to do and he says, \"We will impose on AIG in essence a contractual commitment to pay the Treasury from the operations of the company the amount of retention awards just paid. In addition we will deduct the $30 billion -- deduct from there in assistance an amount basically equal to the amount of those payments.\" What does that really mean? And is that the solution?</p><p>HIMES: Well, what that really means is that our taxpayer dollars are not going to pay bonuses for people who are not just involved but remember these are folks that were in the unit of AIG that created the credit defaults swap exposure that brought the company down.</p><p>And so I think as a matter of principle the notion that our hard earned taxpayer dollars aren't going to provide bonuses to those people is a pretty good notion. Now, the Treasury affect debt maybe Congressional legislation could affect that but frankly, as I said before I'd like to see AIG stand up and do the right thing here, either by getting those people together to agree to give back the money or to figure out a way to get around those contracts.</p><p>And this notion that you can't get around the contract look, all over this country, firefighters, policeman, teachers are being asked to reopen their contracts to give back wages and benefits. So I don't think it's crazy to say that we ought to take a look at that here.</p><p>CLAMAN: It's not. Representative Moore Capito, but the argument out there also floating around on Wall Street, well, you take away their bonuses and you're not going to find anybody to these jobs. Do you buy that?</p><p>MOORE CAPITO: Well, I inherently disagree with that, I mean, I think that you are looking at large financial institutions that were brought to their knees by basically a lot of greed and over extension of risk.</p><p>And to think that the American spirit and as the young good minds in this country, would not want to bring these companies back without, you know, extravagant bonuses, without holding the taxpayer out for more and more dollars. I think that's a ridiculous concept. I don't buy that.</p><p>And I think that the fact that I agree with Jim when he says there are people all over this country that are taking pay cuts, that are working for less times, that are losing their jobs, that are making adjustments in their families and why these employees at AIG and others can not tighten their belts and make adjustments too or break a contract is just doesn't pass the snip test.</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Himes, you're out there in Connecticut where most of your constituents and many of them and certainly are hedge fund people or financial people but you're also looking at constituents who are looking specifically at Congress and saying, so many members, many of actually the sub-Committee members have taken money from AIG in the form of donations.</p><p>How do you answer to that?</p><p>HIMES: Well, you know the overall campaign finance system is a broken system and I think you'd find general agreement on that in Congress.</p><p>But look, you raised another very broader and an important point which is that as the stones get thrown today and rightly so, Congress is not blame free here. The product -- the credit defaults swaps that are at the heart of AIG's mess were explicitly unregulated by an act of Congress a number of years ago.</p><p>So while this will be a day of popular expression of anger at AIG we need to not forget that to some degree Congress was complicit in the mess that grew up at AIG. And we need to look forward and say, look, we need a smart set of regulations, not necessarily more regulations, but smart regulations that are going to prevent this from happening ever again. That's our job. And we've got to step up to do it.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, the party starts at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. I mean, this is going to be interesting. Fox Business will be carrying these grilling of Ed Liddy. Congress Member Jim Himes and Shelley Moore Capito, thank you both for joining us.</p><p>MOORE CAPITO: Thank you.</p><p>HIMES: Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Anytime. We really appreciate your perspective</p><p>And out there, you guys, we want to hear what you think about what is going on with AIG and certainly how this event in Congress is going to developer.

Fire up the computer; share some of your thoughts with us. We're actually going to be reading some of them coming up.</p><p>We do have a lot of market news here. General Mills reporting earnings this morning and giving full year forecast. You may be eating some of their food for breakfast. What's the breakdown in store for the cereal maker?</p><p>But first, let the sun shine in. That's what IBM is saying as a massive computer deal may be in the offing -- the biggest deal possibly that IBM has ever made?</p><p>Good morning to you. That's a big news story coming up. We are back in two minutes.</p><p>MCSHANE: Connell McShane back on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST with some breaking news out of the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning with an interesting report that IBM might be in the market to buy Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash to do so which would be, give or take, a 100 percent premium over the close for Sun yesterday.</p><p>Now let's take a look at the stock prices involved. You would expect that Sun Microsystems would be higher and it is. There is IBM down about two or three percent in the pre-market; as you see, the bid's 90.25 and the stock had closed just under 93 yesterday. Sun, ticker simple JAVA, these days is up to $8.10. So that's a 60 percent move, give or take, on the stock so being bid up on the \"Wall Street Journal\" report again that these two are in talks, Liz, about a possible deal. That'll be very, very interesting.</p><p>CLAMAN: Maybe making that deal. Wouldn't that be interesting to see?</p><p>MCSHANE: That would be up.</p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you very much, Connell. For more on this possible deal between IBM and Sun Microsystems I'm joined by Emerald Asset Management's Joe Besecker, and president of Penn Financial Group, Matt McCall.</p><p>Joe, you wake up and you find out...</p><p>JOE BESECKER, EMERALD ASSET MANAGEMENT: A jab, a jolt.</p><p>CLAMAN: The jab, a jolt. Seriously? IBM the sleepy -- not sleepy but the more serious sort of button-down company going for the mavericky so to speak?</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>BESECKER: I just like the fact that business is being done out there. We're back to doing business.</p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you.</p><p>BESECKER: We're not talking about -- listen, that's the thing. IBM is taking advantage of opportunities that exist out there. You know, Mark Twain once said he was rarely able to spot an opportunity until it ceased to be one. And so, maybe now the companies will start to pay -- get out from under their desks, start to look for business and do business. And that's what I'm excited about.</p><p>Whether or not this is the best deal for IBM or maybe the market's (ph) thing and maybe they could have gotten it a little bit cheaper?</p><p>CLAMAN: Exactly that. I'm wondering, are they overpaying in this market? Aren't you supposed to beat somebody down to their last dollar?</p><p>MATT MCCALL, PRESIDENT, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP: You are but you figure, Sun already fell 71 percent in the last year. So maybe it has been beaten down already paying at $10 a share, whatever it may be $6.5 billion. I don't think that is that bad. I actually think they are getting a pretty good deal.</p><p>And what I love about this is the synergy that it creates between the two companies. But I think we're going to see a lot more mergers going on in the coming months that creates synergies and using...</p><p>BESECKER: I hope so.</p><p>MCCALL: ...and using its beaten down prices and as Joe said this is a good sign, I think, for the market.</p><p>CLAMAN: Both make corporate systems. And I think that that's something that these corporations who don't depend specifically on Microsoft Windows, for example, are very interested in seeing who gets nervous over this. Is it Hewlett-Packard, the big competitor?</p><p>BESECKER: Go back to what I'm saying. Now it puts us in a position where people start to think strategically about business again. How do we deploy money? How do we go out and do things?</p><p>So yes, I think Hewlett-Packard has to be concerned about this. I think in general, IBM does a lot of service business. I think this will add to the service. And they penetrate different areas they may not have had.</p><p>It appears to get customers and get customers cheaply and that's what they're doing because that customer base is an annuity that brings all that money in. Oracle reports today or tomorrow, that is the only thing that's going to go well for them. And so you want to have growth as well and I think they'll get a growth opportunity...</p><p>CLAMAN: Sources, by the way, say this, of course, could still fall apart. So we caution people to make sure they understand that but what about regulatory hurdles, Matt? These are two gigantic companies that could eliminate some of the little guys out there.</p><p>MCCALL: And it probably will. The thing is though, Sun has lost a lot of market share over the last couple of years. So I think they'll be able to get through the hurdles.</p><p>And I think HP gets hurt the most because when you think about it HP actually had a chance to buy Sun. In the last year they went to them and they turned them down and now IBM is jumping on that after the price fell a bit more. So I think IBM is being pro-active here looking forward or HP's kind of sitting back waiting for the business to come to them.</p><p>CLAMAN: What is the best possible sense that you make specifically I think for other suitors? Anybody -- you know Matt has talked about Hewlett-Packard. They're not going to come back maybe and start fighting, would they?</p><p>BESECKER: Why wouldn't they? I mean if they really thought -- depending on price. I think that is why the price is what it is. We don't know the price because it has not been announced. We just hear rumors. But if the price is there, I think that's one of the reasons that they came out with a good best offer.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm with Joe Besecker right now because I'd look at this and I say we have some deals going.</p><p>BESECKER: Exactly.</p><p>CLAMAN: So what is the next digital deal that might be done?</p><p>MCCALL: You know, I'm actually going to go away from digital because I don't know if it is going to be as much in technology. I think the more deals are going to be in biotech. I think we're going to have a huge boom in the second half where large pharma with no pipelines are going to start picking up a lot biotech companies. And I think that's going to be one of the biggest sectors and one of the biggest drivers of this market in the second half of the year.</p><p>CLAMAN: How does the average investor get in on something like that in advance?</p><p>BESECKER: Carefully. Because we still have a lot of land mines out there. You look at the companies -- I actually think the play is, and we were talking a little bit earlier, some of these companies that have platforms that they can add things to might be the better place than trying to guess which ones are the ones that are acquired because if you're not acquired and you run out of cash, it is kind of an all or nothing and minor event.</p><p>So that's in the (INAUDIBLE) I agree with you 100 percent, that's why we buy a basket. If you have muss (ph), you can buy a basket or you can buy one of the -- you have to do a lot of homework and that's why...</p><p>MCCALL: And you never buy a company just on the anticipation of being taken over. You never do that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Right. Never. Never do that.</p><p>Well, let the sun shine in. We have ourselves a deal here.</p><p>BESECKER: We have business. That's right. We have business.</p><p>CLAMAN: We have business going Joe and Matt. Thank you very much.</p><p>Coming up, let's take a check of today's news headlines. The latest -- did you hear about this? This tragic ski trip taken by one of Broadway's leading actresses, we will be talking about that in a moment.</p><p>And the company behind Cheerios, Betty Crocker and Haagen-Dazs -- General Mills planning to take one dinner table favorite out of the food roster? You get to guess -- I guarantee you, unless you grew up on one of those organic farms which, I went Berkeley and all about that. You ate this product, they're taking it out of the mix.</p><p>Get ready to cry. We'll get a closer look when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST continues.</p><p>GAVIN GREY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Gavin Grey, standing in for Ashley Webster in London and a quick look at the markets straight off.</p><p>Let's start off in Germany with the Dax, that's been leading the way this morning, I'm pleased to say. And it's still doing very well; up almost 60 points at 4,045 that's up almost 1.5 percent. Moving across to Paris, the CAC, that's also doing pretty well; up 0.9 of a percent at 2,792. And lastly the FTSE; that spent most of this morning in negative territory but it's just crept positive, up almost seven points at 3,863.</p><p>All of those figures despite some pretty bad news on the unemployment front that's come out just within the last hour or two. And that is that unemployment in the U.K. has now topped 2 million; that is about 6.5 percent of the working population. Figures due to get much worse however and indeed it is the rate of the rise that is worrying most people.</p><p>Two million is the worst it's been since 1997. But the rate of the rise has been the fastest increase for a couple of decades, so a bit worrying there for the government and plenty of dire predictions following on from that.</p><p>The Royal Bank of Scotland, next. That's the bank that's been almost bought out by the government; two-thirds now owned by the U.K. taxpayer. But optimistic comments from the chairman who says that the banks benefited from buoyant corporate banking activity and has noted increased business as a resulting corporate debt issuance and equity underwriting -- so a positive note there.</p><p>Homeowners though, well those with mortgages -- that is not such clever news because indeed it has been estimated now that in the last year, the number of people who have fallen into arrears with their mortgage has risen a third and that is obviously worrying and that, of course, despite those on track of mortgages noticing a sharp decline in the monthly repayment. So very worrying for them, too.</p><p>A quick look at the dollar and the currencies, it is down against the euro, 1.30 to the dollar. And the pound there, it is up against the pound and 1 pound is now going to cost around $1.39.</p><p>Back to you Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Thank you very much. Good morning once again everyone.</p><p>We are taking a look at some of the top news stories of the day.</p><p>China rejecting Coca-Cola's bid to buy a major Chinese juice maker breaking up what would have been the largest ever foreign take over of a Chinese company. China's commerce ministry rejecting the $2.5 billion bid for the Huiyuan Juice Group saying Coke's buy out would potentially squeeze out smaller players.</p><p>This development comes as China recently enacted stronger anti-monopoly law so big question about whether this is an isolated event or something that other businesses should be concerned about.</p><p>Actress, Natasha Richardson is hospitalized, in critical condition after a skiing accident in Montreal. Richardson was flown back to New York City for medical treatment after suffering a serious head injury during a beginner's ski lesson. Members of Richardson's family have gathered near her bedside now. And Richardson, by the way, is the wife of actor Liam Neeson. She's an accomplished actress, though; she won a Tony award for her 1998 performance in Cabaret.</p><p>Back to business news now, Dunkin Donuts is going back to its roots. Years after the company ran ads featuring Fred the baker saying it is time to make the donuts, the company's advertising its doughnuts again. It will launch a new $10 million campaign. In the recent years the company has focused more on coffee and breakfast sandwiches in its advertising and the coolest part of this campaign though is a Design Your Own Donut contest. Yes, you got it, customers can design their own donuts on the company's Web site. A winner will be chosen in June and be sold in the company's 8,000 stores. So start designing, get to it.</p><p>You're up to date here on the Fox Business Network. Remember foxbusiness.com is where you want to go throughout the day.</p><p>And coming up advertising sales may be down but Charles Payne is still promoting one ad company's stock. He'll explain why next.</p><p>We'll have much more on the outrage over AIG and its millions and millions in bonuses. AIG chairman, of course, Ed Liddy headed to Capitol Hill today to appear before a house committee. He's going to be answering some tough questions. So we want to know what would you ask him?</p><p>Send us an e-mail at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email> We'll share some of your thoughts a little later on in the show. We'll be right back with more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FBN ANCHOR: Thirty minutes after the hour. So glad you're with us on this special edition of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST, \"AIG, America's Outrage.\" I'm Liz Claman. Alexis Glick is off today.</p><p>We're going to have more on the growing anger over the failed insurer's decision to give out bonuses, millions and millions of dollars in bonuses to some people who actually don't even work there anymore.</p><p>And if you've seen the markets lately, up six of the last seven days. Not bad at all. Let's take a look at how they're shaping up with the futures. A little bit of weakness here at the moment. We actually had some decent numbers out of Asia overnight. The Hang Seng did pretty well, up more than 1 percent.</p><p>But for -- our futures here, we're down for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. NASDAQ just popped in to positive territory to the upside and S&amp;P futures have come up off of their lows in the last half hour. They were down about 4 points, but right now down 2.20.</p><p>The company behind breakfast staples like Wheaties and Cheerios, you know, you've eaten it all. You know you ate Count Chocula growing up, admit it. General Mills, out with 3rd quarter earnings this morning, coming in at $0.79 excluding items, missing analysts' expectations of $0.88 per share.</p><p>As consumers cut costs, food makers are cutting unprofitable businesses. So to that end, I'm stunned. Did you -- Jenna, Jenna cannot believe it. General Mills says it will no longer make, excuse me for a moment, Pillsbury frozen dinner rolls. They're gone, folks.</p><p>I -- Charles Payne is speechless.</p><p>For more on this I'm enjoined by Jennifer Niemela of the St. Paul Business Journal and Erin Smith, an analyst with the Argus Research Company. We're all stunned and shocked today.</p><p>Good evening, (INAUDIBLE) our way, but first Pillsbury dough rolls are no longer going to be available.</p><p>Erin, let's start with the numbers here. They missed but they also guided higher for the year. They're upping their guidance. I find that interesting. What do you pick out of this report?</p><p>ERIN SMITH, ARGUS RESEARCH COMPANY ANALYST: Well, they actually mentioned that cost inflation is supposed to improve in the next -- not bit high at next quarter, and I think that's a big benefit. And our estimates for the 3rd quarter is actually below consensus so they actually came in just a little bit below our estimates. We expected the 4th quarter would be a little bit stronger.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jennifer, last week General Mills announced it will no longer make, as I said, these Pillsbury frozen dinner rolls and they've actually decided to sell the frozen dough portion of its bakeries and food service. So they're shedding this part of it. Why? Why has the company decided to drop this part of their business?</p><p>JENNIFER NIEMELA, ST. PAUL BUSINESS JOURNAL REPORTER: Well, when I talked to General Mills they mentioned that they're really trying to focus on some of their strengths and like a lot of food companies, they are trying to trim out some of the less profitable parts of their business.</p><p>So those are the reasons that they gave me. And yes, they sold it to a company called Pennant Foods. They sold four of their factories, shed about 60 positions. So they are focusing on cutting their costs right now.</p><p>CLAMAN: Erin, what impact, do you think, the sale will have on General Mills' future? I thought it was so iconic. I can't let go of this. I.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I do like their Pillsbury rolls.</p><p>CLAMAN: It's dinner -- exactly.</p><p>SMITH: But at the same time, Pillsbury division has been -- hasn't been performing as well as some of their other divisions. Cereals been very strong, yogurt and soup. So I can understand. I think long term this is a good strategy to try to revitalize that -- the Pillsbury brand over the past year. And it's probably -- I assumed that it hasn't been doing as well.</p><p>CLAMAN: But Jennifer, we've got to get to the stronger dollar aspect of this because clearly a strong dollar hurts a global company that has an international footprint. Right now we're looking at a dollar that seems to be doing well. General Mills operates in about 100 different companies. Does this hurt them going forward? They must not think it's going to really pressure them because they're upping the guidance for the full year.</p><p>NIEMELA: Right. Well, they have been focusing a lot on cutting their costs. And here in the twin cities, they have decreased their work force by about 2 percent so I think going forward they're pretty optimistic.</p><p>The CEO also mentioned that while commodity prices have been up, he does expect those to go down once the recession ends. So I think that they're optimistic going forward and that makes sense.</p><p>CLAMAN: Erin, everybody says go for consumer staple companies and healthcare because those are the two things people won't cut back on. These earnings indicate that even if people continue to buy these products, costs are higher. We don't know where commodities are going. It's obviously a real challenge to operate a company like this.</p><p>Is it all about the management and how smart they are as far as organic growth is concerned? And specifically, cuts in the way they operate?</p><p>SMITH: I think that's very important and I also think if you look at the company's brand and if they have leading brands, what kind of types of products? General Mills have a very strong portfolio of affordable brands for consumers. General mixes, soup and cereals. So you have to look at what they're offering.</p><p>CLAMAN: And Jennifer, we spoke about how General Mills is cutting costs by selling some of those less profitable brands. How many have cut costs, say for example, by laying employees off and what does General Mills employment situation look like?</p><p>NIEMELA: Well, here in the twin cities we have seen -- actually some of our larger companies including Cargill, another big food company here, have actually increased their work force over the past year. But General Mills has decreased their -- over 2008 they decreased by about 1.8 percent. Their employment here. So they are focusing on cutting their costs.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jennifer and Erin.</p><p>NIEMELA: In that way as well.</p><p>CLAMAN: We're going to wrap it there. Once again General Mills, missing estimates but upping their guidance for the full year numbers.</p><p>We thank you very much for coming in. We've actually got some breaking news.</p><p>Connell, what do you have for us?</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Liz, we talked about the Coke story. You may have heard us talk about the fact that this deal had been rejected by the Chinese government for Coke to buy a juice company in China for $2.5 billion.</p><p>Well, the company itself has actually come out with some comments here in the last few minutes crossing on the wire from Coca-Cola. They're saying they're not going to pursue this. This Huiyuan deal, that's the name of the company, in China, the juice company. They're not going to pursue it after the government had rejected it.</p><p>So they're not going to press this anymore. They said they were disappointed about the rejection that came out of the Chinese government, but they rejected -- they, I should say, they respect the decision and they're going to focus on growing existing brands in China with a long-term view of the Chinese market.</p><p>So, again, Coca-Cola after being rejected by the Chinese government for an attempt to $2.5 billion acquisition of a major juice company in China now says that's it. we respect your decision, we're not going to pursue it any further.</p><p>Interesting story. We'll continue to follow it and all the political ramifications, all the rest of it throughout the day. But right now it is time for \"Charles' Choice.\" It's down to Charles Payne in the studio.</p><p>What do you have, Charles?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks, Connell. Well, you know, first, no more dinner rolls and now Coke being knocked down in China, bad news. But I'm going to stick with this China thing, Connell, because two of the three stocks I'm watching are actually based in China.</p><p>The first is Focus Media. That was the tease that Jenna Lee gave you. I've got to tell you, folks, someone just opened some biscuits in the background. The stock has won some pretty good support right around the $5 area so I like it on the downside.</p><p>Listen, Wall Street expects this company to earn $1.48 in the fiscal '09 and it's trading at $5.90. If it traded at ten times book, I mean the stock would be somewhere right around here so this is really one of these stocks that has a lot of room to the upside. A little on the downside. Nevertheless, I consider it a high-risk play, although yesterday my high-risk play is still soft, which is up 25 percent. A 15 percent after the open.</p><p>OK. A little risky in my opinion is NetEase. It's another Chinese plate. It's a Web portal, offers online communities and e-commerce services, a lot of games. One of the things we're starting to see here with this stock is look at that trend. Upbrilled (ph), nice here, looks really, really great. On the cusp of a major, major break out. I've mentioned this stock several times in the past. I think you want to have exposure to China. This is one of my top three plays in China along with Baidu and Sohu.</p><p>And finally, Simon Property Group. This is my contrarian play of the day, if you will. We were short to stock at Wall Street strategies, WStreet.com, for a long time. And indeed it came down but it was really tough. It didn't come down and it showed a lot of resolve if you will.</p><p>The stock is on a verge of a major breakout here. I like this -- use 29 and 1/2 if you do this stock as an idea -- as a stop-loss. And I have an exclusive pick. Go to FOXBusiness.com/MoneyforBreakfast. It's a controversial company.</p><p>Coming up, folks, we're going to see which of your favorite brands have the strength to carry their companies through the downturn. And a border war is brewing. It can cost you and our economy billions of dollars. Details just ahead when we come back with more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>CLAMAN: This morning the Obama administration is preparing to send more federal agents to the Mexican border in a move to stop the flow of drugs and rash of kidnappings that is plaguing the Mexican border. This comes as the Obama administration not only copes with the drug war, but now possibly a trade war as well.</p><p>Folks, trade wars only exacerbated the Great Depression but is this all mean? And Mexico says, well, if you do that, we're going to impose tariffs on U.S. imports and produce and products, such as, and we're just getting this information because before we weren't sure what the products where, sunglasses, toilet paper, pet food and soy sauce.</p><p>I think Christmas trees were thrown in there as well.</p><p>This move is on the heels of Washington banning Mexican trucks from pretty much free access of the U.S. roads which Mexico says violate NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p><p>Drugs, tariffs, kidnappings, and that's all after we, the United States, gave Mexico $10 billion in aid.</p><p>Boy, what do we make of all of this? For more now I'm joined by Todd Spencer. He's the executive vice president of the Owner, Operator Independent Drivers Association. And Jim Roberts, a research fellow with the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>Welcome to you both.</p><p>Jim, what exactly did the U.S. remove, take away? And how is Mexico retaliating?</p><p>JIM ROBERTS, HERITAGE FOUNDATION RESEARCH FELLOW: Well, you know, this is one trade dispute where, to pardon the express, the rubber is really meeting the road. To judge the Obama administration by their rhetoric, you would think that they understand that the only way to increase prosperity for Americans and grow our economy is to expand trade opportunities, not contract them.</p><p>They understand that protectionism in the 1930s made the depression worst. And yet we have to judge them by their actions. And so far their actions have been to cave in to protectionists on the left, big labor, first in the stimulus package with the Buy America provisions, now in this omnibus bill, they've killed a pilot program with Mexico by defunding it, that had -- had allowed the Mexican government to put off filing this action that they have a legal right to do under NAFTA...</p><p>CLAMAN: OK.</p><p>ROBERTS: . to put tariffs on some of our products.</p><p>CLAMAN: Somebody who feels completely different about this is Tom Spencer.</p><p>Todd, how does the elimination of this program, which, in essence if I understand it correctly, allowed Mexican 18-wheelers unfettered access back and forth across the border to the U.S. delivering all kinds of goods? How does this benefit you, the U.S. trucker and more valuable than the challenges and the costs of the tariffs?</p><p>TODD SPENCER, OWNER OPERATOR INDEPENDENT DRIVERS ASSOC.: Liz, it's amazing their comments, the rhetoric coming from the other side on this issue. The arbitration panel that looked at this issue, several years ago said the U.S. was totally within its rights to establish safety systems and insists on safety systems that would assure safety on our highways.</p><p>Those systems have not been in place, they have not -- they are simply not functional. This feigned outrage about protectionism is simply rhetoric. This is not a new issue. Congress, both sides of Congress have been outraged, concerned about the prospect of an unequal playing field in terms of safety and security all the way back to 2001.</p><p>They've insisted our system was being put in place. They haven't been put in place. And it would be foolhardy, idiotic for us to open our highways any other way.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jim, why do I -- Jim, why do I want Mexican truck drivers if they're not insured, if it hasn't had the proper safeguards attached to this program? Why do I want them on the road here in America? We've got enough problems of our own.</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, you wouldn't want drivers like that on our roads but those aren't the drivers that have been participating in this program. In fact, they have had a better safety records than our own companies. These drivers are well trained and you want them because American consumers are paying $400 more per year in products imported from Mexico because of this additional uploading and reloading and warehouses within the 25-mile limit of the border.</p><p>That's just adding costs to American consumers just to featherbed some jobs for the teamsters and improve teamster dues, but it's hurting the American consumer and it's hurting our relations with Mexico and our economy.</p><p>CLAMAN: Todd, is it all about the teamsters flexing their muscle?</p><p>SPENCER: Not in the least. The overwhelming majority, 90 percent of truckers are small business entities, people that own 10 or fewer trucks. These are the people that are actually on the frontlines economically. They're on the frontlines for highway safety and they're the ones that actually are being disadvantaged by this unleveled playing field and actually risks at the border.</p><p>How many segments are we going to talk about how crazy, how lawless it is on that side? And we're going to say.</p><p>CLAMAN: But you understand, Todd -- you understand that any kind of tariffs that are imposed now which is what the Mexicans are doing for our goods, we get a little bit of a trade war going here, at a time when -- our economy is rough, hard you, sort of justify that with what the boobs (ph) are.</p><p>SPENCER: That makes no sense whatsoever. Mexico has benefited so much from trade with the U.S. I mean, they'd be cutting off their nose to spite their face.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK.</p><p>SPENCER: . to do something idiotic like that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jim, let me give you the last word here. Mexico gets $10 billion in aid from us. They're a mess. The State Department is encouraging people not to travel to Mexico right now because of the drug wars. And now this?</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, certainly parts of northern Mexico are dangerous but other parts of Mexico are if you take precautions but I would say this trucking program would have improved and will improve border security because there are fewer opportunities for drugs and cash to move south and empty trucks if the trucks are loaded. And so it seems to me that this makes more sense and always economically and with national security.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, the discussion and conversation will continue.</p><p>Todd and Jim, thank you for being a part of it right here on FOX. Thank you so much.</p><p>SPENCER: Thank you, Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: Now let's get over to Charles Payne. Charles, what do you have?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, Liz, Starbucks holds its annual shareholders meeting today in Seattle and it's one of the many brands battling this downward economy. And it's clearly been hurt in an annual core brand power ranking. So last year Starbucks ranked number 10 out of 20 and this year's survey, it slipped down to 214.</p><p>With a look at who's the king of the brand world, I'm joined by Jim Gregory, the CEO of CoreBrand, and Matt McCall, the president of the Penn Financial Group.</p><p>Jim, I want to start with you. I just mentioned Starbucks a minute ago. Obviously the economy has had an impact but has the company made a lot of mistakes as well?</p><p>JIM GREGORY, COREBRAND CEO: Certainly. You know, it's important to understand that the brand is -- might be doing well, but the underlying financial fundamentals are not more important than the brand.</p><p>PAYNE: I don't get what that means, though.</p><p>GREGORY: I'm sorry. I said that incorrectly, but the brand is very important but the underlying financial fundamentals are more important than the brands, so even though the brand is quite strong, it's not more important than the company getting out of whack, so to speak.</p><p>PAYNE: Let's start now with your top five. We're going to start with the number five on your brand rankings. Campbell Soup. What makes this so good?</p><p>GREGORY: It's a great brand. When you have a brand that stands for one thing, for nourishment for so many decades and mm-hmm good concept is so clear in everyone's mind, you know that it's a really highly focused food company. And they are really focused on three major areas, simple mills, baked snacks and healthy beverages.</p><p>And so that's a very complex company simplified.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, Matt, it's interesting because Peter Lindt (ph) said buy what you know. And obviously everybody knows Campbell Soup but there is somewhat of a disconnect between a great brand and a great investment.</p><p>What do you think about Campbell as an investment?</p><p>MATT MCCALL, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP PRESIDENT: I really don't like his investment. It's gotten crushed. It hit a five-year low just recently, and it's not really growth story. You won't be looking grow stocks now. And I think they've really gotten hurt by private label. People are shopping at Wal-Mart, getting their groceries there. They're going to go for the private label brand versus the Campbell brand.</p><p>PAYNE: Wal-Mart just said they're going to actually increase that strategy.</p><p>Jim, let's go to number four, Hershey Foods. Why is this a premiere brand?</p><p>GREGORY: Well, first of all, it's one of the original companies that we're involved in corporate social responsibility. The voting shares of the company are controlled by the Hershey trust and that's for the benefit of the Milton Hershey School for Disadvantaged Children. So they do well by doing good and it's a great company. Again, very consistent brand over time.</p><p>Also, it's important to realize that they are no longer the king of candy. Mars has taken that with the acquisition of Wrigley's.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>GREGORY: So they're not quite as strong as they were.</p><p>PAYNE: So.</p><p>GREGORY: But they do have a great brand.</p><p>PAYNE: So Jim, let's go to the other end of the political correctness - - spectrum, if you will. Harley-Davidson, number three. Why is this still such a powerful brand?</p><p>GREGORY: Well, this is one of my favorite brands and it's done so well over time. When you think about Harley-Davidson in 1990 when we started our corporate branding index, they were near bankruptcy. They have improved consistently over time and they are -- have reached the pinnacle of our brand ranking of 1,200 companies.</p><p>So one of the concerns I have about Harley-Davidson is they are -- might be expanding too much. They have over 35 different models and it's almost what I call the GM syndrome. They want to be all things to all people. That's not the way that -- to continue to expand their brand.</p><p>PAYNE: And of course, Jim, too, household names Johnson &amp; Johnson number 2, and number one, Coca-Cola. What do you think? How come this is still such a powerful brand?</p><p>GREGORY: Well, Coca-cola has been the number one soft drink in the world, of course, and in our corporate branding index has been number one since 1997. They -- even in down markets, they continue to invest in the brands. They've launched Coca-Cola Zero this year as well as their open happiness advertising campaign.</p><p>They understand how to grow their brand even in a down market and that's quite impressive.</p><p>PAYNE: Matt, three -- everyone knows HOG, though, hit a high, 75 November of 2006. It's come straight down. Would you even consider buying the stock here?</p><p>MCCALL: I would not. And that's something where -- that was the dream for the middle class. The middle class is struggling right now so the last thing they'll do is going to be throwing $25,000 at a discretionary item such as a HOG.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, Johnson &amp; Johnson at number two on the list. It's a consistent player. They're probably out there looking for acquisitions right now. It's a core stock in a lot of folks' portfolio. It's been hit. OK, what do you think about it?</p><p>MCCALL: I love it. I ought to call my clients right now and this is more than just a consumer Johnson &amp; Johnson you see at the grocery story. The medical device, there's the pharmaceuticals, great diverse company and has some cash as well.</p><p>PAYNE: At least we got one buy out of you. Thanks a lot, Matt.</p><p>Jim, thank you very much. Really appreciate it.</p><p>Coming up, folks, we're going to into the pit and read some of the e- mails that you have been sending us about AIG. More MONEY FOR BREAKFAST when we return.</p><p>CLAMAN: I mean, we still cannot believe that General Mills is getting rid of the Pillsbury dinner rolls, the frozen rolls. We opened it. I was banging this thing like I was a monkey and then it popped open and freaked me out. But I think we should bronze this because they're not going to .</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: They're collector's item.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: It is.</p><p>LEE: Put that on eBay.</p><p>PAYNE: Actually you shouldn't have opened that one. You probably should have put it in a vault somewhere, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Put it on eBay.</p><p>LEE: I bet it were last in the universe.</p><p>PAYNE: But they're keeping their dinner rolls, I mean, the flaky biscuits.</p><p>CLAMAN: That's right. I mean if you grew up having the three can stew and the tuna casserole like we did, you know, every -- every other Tuesday, tuna casserole, you have to have the dinner rolls.</p><p>We have been asking you all morning long for your take on the bonus backlash over at AIG. Let's see what you have to say. We've been getting hundreds of e-mails.</p><p>David Medas (ph) says, quote, \"You should only get a bonus when produce above the job requirements.\" He says AIG executives failed to produce to meet their requirements of their contract goals but failed far below their goals nullifying any bonuses.</p><p>See, I like David. Because aren't there two sides to a contract? Why were AIG executives pay bonus when they lost money?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, I think one of the problems is we have not actually seen the contract themselves. That might be great if we could get a chance to see what those contracts were.</p><p>CLAMAN: I called a lot of lawyers last night, and they said Liz, got to see the contract</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: Let me see the contract. But good for you, David. I like that.</p><p>LEE: They're not alone, too. A lot of CEOs got paid on Wall Street that maybe didn't deserve it.</p><p>Next question, well anyways. Sean Webb says, \"I would like to know if all these politicians are going to give back the contributions they received from these Wall Street crooks.\"</p><p>CLAMAN: Good point.</p><p>LEE: I think, Charles, you have a list there.</p><p>PAYNE: God, are you kidding me? The list from the Center of Responsible Politics. I left it outside. Amazing. Chris Dodd at the top, $280,000.</p><p>CLAMAN: But Republicans also peppering this list as well.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: They were seated at the top 10. There were six Democrats and four Republicans. And by the way, they did a great job hedging themselves. They had all the presidential candidates.</p><p>Dook Barela (ph) of Riverside, California says, \"The AIG bonuses are unacceptable. Our congressional representatives have no excuse for overlooking this AIG bonus when they hadn't taken the time to read the stimulus bill before passing it nor our president for signing it.\"</p><p>Everyone, obviously, should have some outrage towards Congress. There's no doubt about. Another $30 billion a week ago.</p><p>CLAMAN: Henry Paulson shoved this thing -- Henry Paulson, George Bush and Congress shoved this.</p><p>PAYNE: But just a week ago, they got another 30 billion, Liz. Someone else has to take responsibility.</p><p>CLAMAN: We got another e-mail. Richard Suttmeier, he's a frequest guest. Hi, Richard (INAUDIBLE) from ValueEngine.com, saying, \"You can't break employment contracts after the fact. Our Ivy League bank regulatory geniuses who bought 80 percent of AIG on behalf of U.S. taxpayers lacked the common sense to void all employment agreements.\"</p><p>PAYNE: You know what, what it.</p><p>CLAMAN: Renegotiate, Richard. Not void.</p><p>PAYNE: A bankruptcy would have renegotiated it as well, too. But you know what, on that note, Richard, I'm glad you're watching. We can also use the tax code as a weapon. I think that's going to be a big mistake if we go that road.</p><p>CLAMAN: Gang, we love the comments. You can keep them coming. We're getting hundreds of them. Join the crowd here. Send us an e-mail at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@FOXbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@FOXbusiness.com</email> We'll share some of your thoughts in the next hour. It's three minutes until the top of the hour.</p><p>Coming up right after the break, we're talking live to lawmakers including Republican senator <person><nameText>Kay Bailey Hutchison </nameText></person>of Texas about what she and other lawmakers are doing about the handouts at AIG. We're serving up so much more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. Do not move. I mean you can go brush your teeth but other than that, stay with us.</p><p>CLAMAN: And good morning, everybody. Welcome to hour number two of this special edition of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. The \"AIG, America's Outrage.\" I'm Liz Claman. Alexis Glick is off today.</p><p>We're going to have much more. The growing anger, I mean, each day it's getting worse and worse here among both you the public and lawmakers over the AIG bonuses. This morning we are getting hundreds and hundreds of e-mails. Please we want to hear from you. Specifically, what is it that outrages you so much about this? Is it Congress not having put in stopgaps for these kinds of problems back in September when the first TARP was announced? Is it just being so angry at AIG? Who, where, what? E-mail us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email> and we'll share them a little later in the show. It's very cathartic when you sit down, you e-mail us and maybe we'll read yours and you'll feel better about the anger.</p><p>First, let's get a quick check of the U.S. futures. But, remember, yesterday, the market did wonderfully. Up triple digits for the Dow Jones Industrials. The Dow futures, right now, slightly weaker. S&amp;P, we were trying to make a good of the flat line here. Got down as far as down about 2 points. But now we're down 5.70. The Nasdaq futures down 3.75. Nasdaq had a great double digit gain yesterday.</p><p>But let me send it up to Connell McShane, he's at the Fox Business desk, for some breaking details.</p><p>The IBM deal that isn't yet a deal, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, not yet a deal. But while it's fun to talk about it, isn't it? This morning in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Liz, the possibility being brought up that IBM might buy Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash to do so. It would be about -- would literally be a 100 percent premium over where Sun closed yet. Both stocks, as you might expect, are moving in the pre-market as a result of this speculation.</p><p>Let's first go to IBM, which is down about 3 percent in pre-market trading. It's actually moved under $90 a share. $89.91 is the bid, as you see, on it there. Java, Sun Microsystems, you might also expect that to be higher. It is. Look at that, up to $8.25 a share. So you're talking about a 60 some odd percent gain in the shares of Sun Microsystems. Again, on the speculation this morning that IBM might be a buyer of Sun Microsystems and pay $6.5 billion in cash in order to buy Sun.</p><p>Now, just breaking as we speak and crossing the wires are some headlines out of the Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis. Crossing the wires from \"The Charlotte Observer,\" as a matter of fact. I have not had a lot of time to go over this because they're just crossing, so I'll read a few of them as you look at the B of A stock price.</p><p>Lewis saying that the bank could pay back $45 billion in TARP money, Liz, by late this year or early next year, depending on the economy. So Lewis talking about not taking more money from the government, but paying it back. He says, in addition to that, that the bank expects to be profitable in 2009, absent what he calls an unexpected meltdown. Unexpected meltdown, a quote from Ken Lewis.</p><p>Bank of America saying it could repay the TARP money now if it had to, if it were not maintaining higher than normal capital cushion amid some fragile economic conditions. So it's not able to do it because of that right now, but should be able to do it late this year or early next year, Liz. $45 billion that Bank of America took. The CEO says it will be able to pay it back and it will be profitable in 2009 unless things really go wrong.</p><p>CLAMAN: Fine. Yes, we'll take it. We'll take it.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, we will take it. Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: And that way you don't have to have Congress complaining about your bonuses.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, that's right.</p><p>CLAMAN: If you don't like that . . .</p><p>MCSHANE: Pay whatever you want as long as you don't take government money, right?</p><p>CLAMAN: Exactly. Connell, we'll see you later.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>CLAMAN: As I mentioned, we're taking a closer look at this hour at the outrage that has boiled over about AIG. So let's start with the latest news. Chairman and CEO of American International Group, Edward Liddy, will pull up that chair at a congressional witness table today to take the heat. I mean this could be a blow torch. They are literally going to bring in blow torches because they know the cameras will be on them. The lawmakers will be out there screaming about these bonuses.</p><p>And in the meantime, Congress and the White House are actually trying to find ways to strip bonus recipients of that money. The chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee proposed companies and individuals play a 90 percent plus tax on all retention awards and bonuses over $50,000. And in a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner suggested holding back the bonus amount from upcoming bailout funds for AIG. But the story continues.</p><p>Joining me now for more on Liddy's testimony today are two congressional members. Democratic Congressman Gary Peters of Michigan and Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. Both of them sit on the subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government Sponsored Enterprises, which is holding today's hearings.</p><p>So you both have skin in the game. You'll both be out there. I will start first with Michele Bachmann. And I like that you're both here. And I want to explain to our viewers, Michele is a tax litigation attorney. Gary has a masters in business administration and law degree. So you both understand what perhaps can and could not be done regarding these bonuses. But, Representative Bachmann, what do you hope to learn about AIG's use of federal funds regarding the bonuses and how all the money is being allocated?</p><p>REP. MICHELE BACHMANN, (R) MINNESOTA: Well, there's a number of questions that I think all the members of the committee will have. First of all will be, what is the exit strategy to get the American taxpayer out of AIG and out of these private businesses. We're only beginning to learn where all of the tax money has gone from AIG. At least $20 billion has gone to pay off foreign investors who've invested in AIG. I don't think the American taxpayers signed up to bail out foreign investors. This is an economic quagmire. We need to get the American taxpayer out of bailing out these failed businesses. This is $173 billion plus that we have invested. It's a black hole. I don't think that the American taxpayer should have to pony up any more money for a failed enterprise like AIG.</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Peters, a lot of times you get the American public huddled before the televisions like it's the landing on the moon for these things. Everybody wants to watch it. And all they see is a lot of bloviating. I'm interested to know if there will be fact finding on your behalf. What do you want to find out here?</p><p>REP. GARY PETERS, (D) MICHIGAN: Well, I hope there is fact finding. This should not just be a media circus. We've got a lot of information that we need to find out. Certainly about an exit strategy, which I think are very good questions.</p><p>And in terms of the bonus and compensation, which is the -- what everybody is talking about right now, I think we need to be thinking generally about compensation in these financial firms and looking at those compensation matrix and how those are determined. I think it's -- what is really outrageous to the American public now and myself as well is that you have individuals at AIG, the very individuals that contributed to AIG being brought to their knees, losing billions of dollars, and contributing to this financial mess, getting $160 million in bonuses. Basically these individuals failed and they failed in a spectacular fashion. How could they . . .</p><p>CLAMAN: I want that deal. I want that deal.</p><p>PETERS: How could they be rewarded? Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: I want to be able to fail and get paid so much money.</p><p>PETERS: How could they be awarded, Alexis (ph).</p><p>CLAMAN: Look, no matter what side of the aisle you're on, House Finance Committee Chairman Barney Frank struck a cord yesterday when he said we should approach the AIG situation from the standpoint of the government and the taxpayer being the owner of the company now. Let's listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BARNEY FRANK, HOUSE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I think the time has come to exercise our ownership rights. We own most of the company. And then say, as owner, you know, I'm not paying you the bonus. You didn't perform.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Bachmann, how much leverage does the government realistically have in retrieving these bonuses?</p><p>BACHMANN: Well, we have all the leverage in the world. We do own AIG. And that's exactly the problem. I don't want to have the American taxpayer owning private companies. That's when we get the government into extra constitutional business we have no business being in.</p><p>CLAMAN: But now that we do, now that we do, Representative Bachmann, can we retrieve the bonuses?</p><p>BACHMANN: Sure, we can do anything we want to do. But what we need to do is get out and stop pouring money down a black hole. Just like we should not have the Obama administration running Detroit with GN or Chrysler. This is what will happen. We'll see more of this the more government stays involved in private businesses. We will see more of these fiascos. Government was never designed to run private businesses. We need to get out and we need to return these businesses to the private hands or they need to fail. And we need to be prepared to accept that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Representative Peters, you're the one with the law degree. Is there some type of sort of clause that might enable this to get back the money? Or is this a red herring and do we need to look at what Representative Bachmann is talking about and, ooh, let me say it, let AIG fail? Everybody's so nervous about that and this so-called systemic risk.</p><p>PETERS: Well, first off, let me say that I've proposed a bill that I proposed yesterday that would use the tax code to recover that money for the taxpayers. This money is being paid out and to me the best approach right now would be to put a tax of roughly about 100 percent. That brings that money back to the taxpayers where it belongs.</p><p>It is a bill that only deals with situations where you have substantial investments of taxpayer money in a company. In this case, over $170 billion. And basically my approach is that there shouldn't be any bonuses paid out until the taxpayers are paid back first. After the taxpayers are paid back, the company is free to pay any bonuses they'd like and have any kind of compensation schedule, but they need to pay back the taxpayers first.</p><p>CLAMAN: I just love that.</p><p>BACHMANN: Liz?</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>BACHMANN: Liz?</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p>BACHMANN: The bigger question is, when will we get a pay back of the tranche of $173 billion. This was $165 million that was paid out in bonuses. What about the $173 billion that the taxpayers have already invested into AIG? When will we get paid that money back? It doesn't look like it will be any time soon. And let's not forget, it was the Obama stimulus bill that contains the clause that prohibits the federal government from bringing those bonuses back in. It was a clause slipped in by Chris Dodd.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, it was. Yes, it was.</p><p>BACHMANN: And we members of Congress, we were prevented from reading this bill because we didn't even have the bill online until after midnight. We had to debate at 9:00.</p><p>CLAMAN: And let me end on Representative Peters then. What about Chris Dodd slipping that in that actually allowed these bonuses to be given out? Quickly, if you could.</p><p>PETERS: Well, my understand is the deal's going forward. The bill it says forward (ph) that these bonuses cannot be paid. It wasn't backward looking. It was forward looking. It doesn't prohibit us from doing that now. Now we need to get a solution, bring that money back to the taxpayers and bring it back now.</p><p>BACHMANN: No, it actually does. It actually does (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, I can say this much. That Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, probably wanted something that allowed those bonuses to because he came from Wall Street and he has that mentality that, oh, you can't retain anybody on Wall Street unless you promise them millions in bonuses. Folks, and I'm talking to the viewers now, it is an unspoken word on Wall Street that you get paid $100,000 to $200,000 base salary, but then the promise of the bonus comes through. But usually, as I understand it, to both of you representatives, it's based on performance. And we know the performance with AIG was dismal.</p><p>PETERS: Right. Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: All right. Thanks to both of you, Congress members Gary Peters, Michele Bachmann. We'll be watching both of you today.</p><p>BACHMANN: Thanks so much, Liz. Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: You're welcome. We'll watch you on the hearing.</p><p>Washington isn't the only entity going after AIG. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo looking into taking legal action to try to find justice for you, the American taxpayer, who has kept the company afloat. With a closer look at Cuomo's case against AIG, I'm joined by Leslie Crocker Snyder, a retired New York state supreme court justice and an Manhattan district attorney candidate.</p><p>Nice to see you.</p><p>LESLIE CROCKER SNYDER, RETIRED NY STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: Nice to see you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, we just had all this storm (ph) and drong (ph) and yelling and talking of what can be done.</p><p>SNYDER: Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: You probably are somebody who knows. Can anything be done?</p><p>SNYDER: Well, there are all sorts of solutions that have been proposed, as we've just heard. And we also heard the political spin from each party, which I think we're going to hear a lot of, you know, criticizing the administration, not criticizing the administration.</p><p>CLAMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>SNYDER: My interest is really a legal one. We're all morally outraged. This is a terrible situation. But we have to balance that with the law. So right now we have Attorney General Cuomo, who is looking into whether or not there was any fraud involved in the original contracts.</p><p>CLAMAN: What would fraud look like? Tell us what we should be looking for.</p><p>SNYDER: Well, I guess it would be if people knew that they would never be able to pay out these bonuses because losses were occurring in the derivative section and basically they entered into this with some kind of fraudulent knowledge. It could be a number of things. But remember, basically we do have the rule of law. Contracts are sacrosanct unless there's something wrong with them.</p><p>So we have to look at the other solutions. Can we embarrass these people into not accepting the bonuses? That seems unlikely, but you never know.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, half of them are -- you know, a couple of them are gone and most of them are out in London and these are derivatives traders who probably are kind faceless. We haven't seen any names. Cuomo is trying to get the names.</p><p>SNYDER: Right. But we have to find a legal solution is my point. Maybe the clawback solution where we deduct the millions from the next payout would be a reasonable one. I like that because it seems as if it might have the cloak of law. So as much as we're outraged and we have to find a solution, we have to find a legal solution. And we can't lose sight of that. The public gets morally outraged, but we do operate in a rule of law.</p><p>CLAMAN: Absolutely. Well, in his letter to Congressman Barney Frank, Andrew Cuomo said it appears AIG had far more perhaps that was underneath the actual story, the meat of the issue, and so we perhaps might find more underneath there, but . . .</p><p>SNYDER: Cuomo's lawyers are great. They're going to conduct a terrific investigation. If there's fraud there or something that could undo the bonuses, they'll find it. But if there isn't, then we're going to have to look at, is this contract valid? Is there some other way to approach the situation?</p><p>CLAMAN: Now we don't want to do the old ripage (ph) of the contract. And here on your screen is the actual breakdown here. Top seven executives getting more than $4 million each. I like the 22 with more than $2 million. But the bottom one, 11 of these people who got at least $1 million are no longer at AIG. And you call them retention bonuses. This is a joke. It's an outrage. And it really, I think, hits the crux of the matter.</p><p>SNYDER: But we all feel that way. It's outrageous. And to see these people leave when they supposedly were being paid this to stay is even more outrageous. But at the same time, what I'm saying is, there is a legal solution here, we just don't know what it is yet. We're going to find that legal solution. You can't start tearing up valid contracts because then any time one side said, oh this is a bad contract by public policy. Let's just unilaterally rip it up.</p><p>CLAMAN: But if it says -- but if the contract says you have to perform a job, surely the job wasn't to put the company in the toilet.</p><p>SNYDER: I agree with that. So you have to look technically at that contract and find a way out of it. You can't just rip it up.</p><p>CLAMAN: Anybody have a copy? Anybody have a copy of these contracts? We'll take it.</p><p>SNYDER: We'll find a way, I am sure, whatever it is. It might be the clawback.</p><p>CLAMAN: Leslie Crocker Snyder, former New York state supreme justice, former prosecutor, I might add as well.</p><p>SNYDER: As well, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Tough, tough woman sitting next to me.</p><p>SNYDER: Oh, I've got a soft side, really, just not for AIG.</p><p>CLAMAN: I know. I don't think many Americans do. Thank you for coming in.</p><p>SNYDER: Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: We have some breaking news from \"The New York Post.\" AIG is trying to sell its 66-story headquarters in Manhattan for $100 million. The firm may also try and sell 72 Wall Street, that's the union which represents Dorman and Porters (ph). And that may be the potential buyer. \"The Post\" is owned by our parent company News Corp., but this goes back to Bear Stearns and the whole headquarters issue. What do you do with the building? They could sell it and make some money there.</p><p>SNYDER: Possibility.</p><p>CLAMAN: Then how do they run the business?</p><p>SNYDER: That's another question.</p><p>CLAMAN: Thank you, Leslie, very much.</p><p>Keep the e-mails coming folks, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com\">moneyforbreakfast@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>Coming up, major news on the tech front. If you're just waking up, we've got reports that IBM is ready to make a massive deal that could move the tech sector -- huge -- with a big name that was so hot during the dot-com go-go era.</p><p>And later on Fox Business, I'll have an exclusive interview with AutoNation President Mike Maroone. AutoNation preparing to make a major announcement today. It involves anyone buying a car from them. They are the nation's largest auto dealer. Wait till you hear this news, exclusively at 3:30 p.m. on a count down to the closing bell right here with me and the rest of the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Stay tuned. Much more coming up.</p><p>CLAMAN: So we've got some major tech headlines this morning. This is fun. Action here in the business world. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that IBM is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems. Yes, Java, big blue could pay $6.5 billion in cash. And then Oracle, the software giant, releasing earnings today after the bell. Fox Business' Shibani Joshi joining me now with more.</p><p>What do you want to start with? There's just so many good stories.</p><p>SHIBANI JOSHI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: I know, there's so much god stuff. It's great stuff.</p><p>Well, let's talk about this big merger going on today. IBM potentially buying Sun Microsystems in cash, $6.5 billion. Now, Sun Microsystems has been long called an acquisition target for many, many years. IBM, Dell, HP, all the names that are being throwing out there or have been thrown out there that could potentially be interested in the company. IBM apparently in the works of making a move out there. And you can see what the stock price of Sun is, about $5, and the deal would be actually double the stock price right now. IBM trying to become more of the Wal- Mart of the technology industry. The one-stop shop. The place that you go to for hardware and software. It's just so big . . .</p><p>CLAMAN: That's 100 percent premium for that price.</p><p>JOSHI: One hundred percent premium. But this stock price has been battered. And it's a $5 stock. And as you mentioned, it was the darling of the technology sector when the boom happened. No longer, though.</p><p>CLAMAN: Interesting. And let's go to Oracle.</p><p>JOSHI: Oracle. Great company. This -- the earnings are coming out after the close today. You know, this company's interesting because, look, there's no such thing as recession resistant in this industry, recession proof, but this company's very recession resistant in the fact a lot of their revenues and their sales are recurring. So they've locked in contracts. They have a licensed business. And basically they have recurring revenue coming in month after month after month.</p><p>CLAMAN: Keep this chart up. Keep this chart up. Everybody look at it right now. It's rare to see any 52-week chart where there isn't a massive drop off. Look at Oracle. Not necessarily at its 52-week highs, but it's not that far from it, at least halfway. And this -- I find that interesting. They're doing business properly in a tough climate.</p><p>JOSHI: Right. And that's because of this recurring revenue phenomenon that the company has. The company's also been doing some amazing cost cutting initiatives. Also been buying back stocks. So that's helped to stabilize earnings per share.</p><p>Overall, people expecting 32 cents a share. Probably going to come in line. Friedman Billings and Ramsey thinks it's going to come in a little bit under. But even still, this company is -- this is one of the companies you want to bet on to stay more stabilized in whatever is going to happen over the next six to nine months.</p><p>CLAMAN: I find it fascinating the Nasdaq had a great day yesterday.</p><p>JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Up double digits.</p><p>JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Is it tech stocks that will lead us out of this recession?</p><p>JOSHI: It's so hard to say because a lot of people say, yes, because these companies are cash rich, they're debt less or debt low. And they're innovating. You know want, it's so remarkable, and what I always talk about when I'm at the Nasdaq is, this is the stuff that you want to watch and pay attention to in these very volatile times. These companies are starting to play offense. We've got Microsoft, IBM, Cisco all making big announcements. They're coming out and investing just (ph) for the long term.</p><p>CLAMAN: Shibani Joshi is your woman when those numbers come out. Thank you very much.</p><p>JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Coming up, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas joining us live to talk about what lawmakers are doing to get money back from AIG. And that is now your money.</p><p>And California here he comes. President Obama heading to the golden state today. We'll tell you what's on tap there.</p><p>Much more MONEY FOR BREAKFAST on the way. We're so happy you're joining us this Tuesday morning -- Wednesday. Wednesday.</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Gavin Gray in London, standing in this week for Ashley Webster.</p><p>A check on the European markets so far. Let's start where, well, where it's best, I'm afraid. The only bit of green on the board. Frankfurt DAX up 17 points just over the 4,000 barrier there. That a rise of about 0.4 percent. To Paris. I'm afraid the CAC 40 has come down now. It did start the morning in positive territory. But down almost five points. And over to the FTSE, which only for a few moments went into green. It spent the rest of the day in red and it's currently there, down almost 30 points.</p><p>And a little bit about unemployment today. We've had the figures out. Unemployment up to over 2 million in the U.K. That's about 6.5 percent of the workforce. It was a step rise and one that's caused a bit of a shock over here.</p><p>Back to you, Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.</p><p>Good morning, once again, everyone. We're going to update you here on the AIG saga.</p><p>AIG's CEO Ed Liddy ready to face the music on Capitol Hill today. He'll likely be grilled about $165 million in bonuses paid to employees at the very unit that led to AIG's near collapse. Liddy has defended the bonuses, saying AIG was contractually obligated to pay them. In fact, in an op-ed piece in today's \"Washington Post,\" Liddy says, \"in America, when you owe people money, you pay them.\" Earlier on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST, we spoke with Representative Jim Himes, who had the chance to met with Liddy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM HIMES, (D) CONNECTICUT: Well, I had the opportunity to sit with Mr. Liddy in my office yesterday. And what I told him was, you know, it's not just important that the right thing happen, but that the right thing be seen to happen. So I said, you know, look, my experience is that 10 very smart lawyers in a room can make just about anything happen. So, please, get 10 lawyers in a room and figure out how to fix this. And if you can't do that, get these 73 people that are receiving these bonuses together in a conference room and say, folks, this is the time to stand up and do the right thing for your country. Give back the money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEE: Give back the money. The Treasury Department and several senators are looking at ways to get the money back from AIG or from the individual employees.</p><p>Well, the family of a Connecticut woman violently attacked by a chimpanzee is suing for $50 million in damages from the chimps owner. Lawyers for Charla Nash allege Sandra Herold, the chimp's owner, was liable for the attack as a result of her negligence and recklessness in caring for the ape. They claim Herold knew about the chimp's violent history and did not do enough to protect people.</p><p>All right. You're up-to-date here on the Fox Business Network. Coming up, we're going to see if prices for your groceries are falling with the latest Consumer Price Index number. That's next on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST coming up at 8:30 Eastern Time. We'll be right back.</p><p>CLAMAN: And happy Wednesday. Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Liz Claman. Alexis Glick is off today.</p><p>I want to take a quick look at the futures here. We've pretty much been languishing slightly below positive territory here. That would be negative, Liz. Dow Jones Industrials down 53 points. Those are the futures numbers. S&amp;P, which gives us a better sense of how the markets might open, showing some red on the screen, down 4.40. The Nasdaq down about 3. Remember, we're coming off a triple digit gain for the Dow Jones Industrials, which was a really strong move for the Nasdaq yesterday. And that was, what, five days out of six that we were moving higher.</p><p>We are awaiting the release of the February Consumer Price Index, the CPI. And analyst estimates, the all items CPI climbed by 0.4 percent last month. That would actually mark the second consecutive increase. Let's get the number right now.</p><p>MCSHANE: Al right, Liz, appreciate it.</p><p>And here comes the number coming down. And we'll see whether or not if we did get the increase or not. CPI up 0.4 percent. So there you have it, exactly what you would expect. Ex food and energy, up 0.2 percent. The consensus had been for a 0.1 percent gain on that particular metric there. So up 0.4 percent on the headline figure. Up 0.2 percent when you back out the so-called food and energy volatile prices there.</p><p>Now, the year-over-year increase, .2 percent. The consensus had been for that to be unchanged year-over-year, so it actually went up a little bit on that measure. And when you take out food and energy on a yearly basis, it was up 1.8 percent.</p><p>So that is the CPI figure there. As you see it, the only other thing that's coming out right now is the current account deficit, which is $132.8 billion, a little bit less than the consensus, $137 billion, that had been expected.</p><p>Now, a quick look at the markets to see how we are reacting to these figures. Liz showed you that the futures were down exactly as they are now, by 50-plus points on the Dow, and about 4 on the S&amp;P futures.</p><p>So, again, CPI going up, and that's exactly what we expected, Liz, with the consensus on the core rate. A little bit above -- I should say the consensus was a little below the actual number, which was .2 on the core.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>CLAMAN: And always important to point out that the Consumer Price Index is really -- for folks who don't understand the CPI -- it's basically inflation at the consumer level, for what you pay out there.</p><p>Joining me now with instant analysis of the February Consumer Price Index, Stephen Leeb, president of Leeb Capital Management, and Matt McCall, the president of Penn Financial Group.</p><p>Stephen, this number...</p><p>STEPHEN LEEB, PRESIDENT, LEEB CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Half full, half empty.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes, but why are we even looking at inflation right now? Should we be?</p><p>LEEB: Well, you know, I think, Liz, before we know it, we should be looking at it. I mean, this is an economy that I think once it recovers, and if we get this banking crisis under control, which I think we will one of these days, this recovery could be breathtaking, and it could lead very, very quickly to a lot of inflation.</p><p>CLAMAN: That is an interesting point.</p><p>Just as quickly as economists were caught flat-footed by this downturn, could they well be caught by an upturn?</p><p>MATT MCCALL, PRESIDENT, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP: Absolutely. And a lot of economists are talking about deflation right now. And I'm on the opposite side of the field.</p><p>I think inflation is going to be a major issue. When you're really spending $3 trillion, and you have to budget that, where's that money coming from?</p><p>You're going to have to raise rates, and it's going to lead to inflation. And at the end of the day, if you're not ready for this, and you don't have your portfolio set, you could really be caught like you just said, like economists were.</p><p>LEEB: Well, you know, Liz, if you look at some of the data that's coming, I mean, oil prices from $35 to nearly $50. And this economy down 6 percent. What's going to happen when we're growing by 2 percent?</p><p>Copper prices up 20 percent. I mean, you've had this tremendous rally in commodities, even before we've gotten off the tarmac in this economy. Imagine what happens when the world really starts to grow. There is going to be no natural resources.</p><p>CLAMAN: And what about this theory that we have printed so much money, that the value of the dollar will eventually go down and inflation will rear its head?</p><p>MCCALL: Absolutely. I mean, you have to play, if you're looking at stocks, what is going to -- how do you play a falling dollar? You look global. How do you play inflation? Gold kips (ph).</p><p>And I'm actually putting my money where my mouth is. I've been buying kips (ph) over the last couple months, I've been buying gold over the last couple of years, setting up for what could possibly be hyperinflation.</p><p>LEEB: I have no argument with him. I'd love to argue with him, but no...</p><p>CLAMAN: Fight him. Come on.</p><p>LEEB: I can't. No, I mean, kips (ph) and gold are probably our largest positions right now. I mean, it's not so much the dollar.</p><p>CLAMAN: Even though gold touched $1,000 a couple of weeks ago? And look at it now. It's down $10 at the moment to $906. Is this a buying opportunity?</p><p>LEEB: Yes, it is. I mean, can gold go to $850 or $800? Absolutely. But just look at gold the last eight years. What asset has finished every year in the last 8 higher than it was the year before?</p><p>CLAMAN: But let's go back to consumer prices. We do see a slight uptick, of course, of the core rate, which often sort of strips out the very volatile food and energy prices, although energy is not so volatile lately. But the consumer, how will he or she feel it out there?</p><p>MCCALL: I think they're going to feel -- going to the food, I mean, we all go to the grocery store every day. And when we see how the prices - - they have not come down.</p><p>Even though this economy has come down, our wages have come down, prices at the grocery store have not come down. Maybe we're buying the private label versus the brand name; however, those prices are still high. And once we see wheat prices, corn prices start picking back up again, as you spoke of earlier with the commodity prices, we're going to see even higher prices for the consumer.</p><p>CLAMAN: By the way, we got General Mills' numbers earlier this morning, and they actually missed estimates. But interestingly enough, they upped their full-year guidance, and commodity prices are down. They're still managing to make money. Something tells me that when they hiked those cereal prices -- remember that?</p><p>LEEB: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: ... or they made the boxes smaller but kept the price the same, they still have pricing power.</p><p>LEEB: Liz, what you have to understand, there are 2.3 billion people in China and India. These economies are still growing. So are the Middle Eastern economies.</p><p>At least half the world is still growing. And that half is the world that needs commodities in order to grow. They need evermore commodities.</p><p>In this country, we can grow without using additional commodities. Europe can grow without using additional commodities. But the engine of this world need commodities in order to grow.</p><p>MCCALL: And as the middle class grows, more food.</p><p>LEEB: Everything more. Moving up the food chain.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm not hearing either of you say buy equities. You're not saying that now.</p><p>LEEB: Well, I think buy selected equities.</p><p>CLAMAN: That are related to commodities?</p><p>LEEB: Well, that are related to inflation. I mean, you know, growth stocks that -- I think, you know, basically any company that came through 2008, which I think is kind of a microcosm for what to expect over the next five to 10 years, inflation, deflation, et cetera, is probably a good buy. Stocks like TEVA, for example, stocks like CVS.</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you own those?</p><p>LEEB: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: What about you?</p><p>MCCALL: I do. I like stocks here, but you have to be a stock picker. But I think the two areas that I'm looking at, one is market turns, emerging markets and commodities, both based on this commodity inflation play.</p><p>CLAMAN: Stephen, Matt, thanks to both of you.</p><p>LEEB: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: They're liking gold right now. What can I say? And copper.</p><p>Let me guess, you like palladium, too?</p><p>LEEB: Yes!</p><p>CLAMAN: I knew he liked palladium!</p><p>LEEB: And platinum.</p><p>CLAMAN: Nickel and zinc as well.</p><p>LEEB: We're compatriots. I didn't know him the first time I met you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: Coming up, we'll see if Apple's big iPhone update gave its stock a big boost with a look at the Fox 50.</p><p>And then in 90 seconds, Senator <person><nameText>Kay Bailey Hutchison </nameText></person>of Texas joining me live to talk about the growing outrage from lawmakers in Washington over the bonuses handed out by AIG. And what about her colleagues who took money from the troubled insurer?</p><p>A lot of answering that we are expecting here, but stay tuned. We've got much more than that on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>PAYNE: The Fox 50 returning to its winning ways yesterday. Our index gained 17 points to close at 584.</p><p>This morning, there is word of a posible merger in the index. IBM could buy Sun Microsystems.</p><p>For more, I'm joined by Matt McCall, the president of Penn Financial Group.</p><p>Let's start with Apple real quick, though.</p><p>The stock was up big time yesterday. It had been floating around. It looks like it's on the cusp of a major breakout through $100. Is it all about updating their software or is there more to it?</p><p>MCCALL: I think there's more to it. I mean, updating the software, the good news always gives Apple, you know, a bit of a bounce. People love hearing the new products coming out.</p><p>However, I think Apple is just a value at this level. If you're looking for growth plays, looking for something to play off the consumer turning around, Apple's the best play. I own the stock and think it's a great long-term...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: You got a target on it?</p><p>MCCALL: You know, I'm looking at about $120 is the next couple of months. If it breaks through -- like you just said, if it gets through that $100 level, it's going to take off. But it's been struggling there over the last few weeks.</p><p>PAYNE: IBM in the news in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning, perhaps buying Sun Micro $6.5 billion. Do you like the deal? IBM just down a little bit on that news.</p><p>MCCALL: I think it's a good deal. I think they're picking up on cheap -- I mean, Sun's down 71 percent over the last 12 months. Even though you're paying 100 percent premium, I think it's a nice play.</p><p>And you look at IBM stock over the last couple of years, it's one of the few big tech stocks that's held up very well. So it's one of those -- you know, the grandmother stock. Your grandmother can buy IBM and throw it in her basket.</p><p>PAYNE: Do you own any?</p><p>MCCALL: I do own some IBM, yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Really? Good. Good.</p><p>All right. We've got to talk about Coca-Cola. This is really interesting.</p><p>We've seen some saber rattling out of China with respect to holding out treasuries. We think something is going on here behind the scenes. Now they're rejecting a possible takeover of Coke, one of their largest fruit juice companies, $2.4 billion bid for high-end juice.</p><p>What do you make of this and what's the impact going to be on IBM?</p><p>MCCALL: I think eventually it's going to get through. I think this deal will eventually get through. Maybe not this company...</p><p>PAYNE: IBM's already said though -- I think they've said already this morning that they're not going to pursue it any more. I'm sorry, Coke.</p><p>MCCALL: Coke.</p><p>PAYNE: Obviously IBM's not going to pursue it.</p><p>MCCALL: They'll take a different angle. I think they want to get in China. They know the growth potential in China. They're going to get over there.</p><p>The one concern though with Coke, in looking at the way the stock has performed recently, it's gotten hit because of the dollar. I mean, the dollar has risen, and they're such a global company, but I think the U.S. dollar is going to fall in the next, let's say, 12 to 18 months. So this is a play on the falling U.S. dollar, it is a play on growth.</p><p>But as a stock, I don't know. And I think there's a lot more exciting plays out there right now.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, let's talk about something that's been really exciting recently, Bank of America. The chairman, he's really been on the offensive here recently. Now talking about possibly paying back TARP money this year.</p><p>A, do you believe him? And B, could this help the stock? It was edging up before we came on air. It was edging just a little bit higher.</p><p>MCCALL: I mean, how can you believe him? I mean, honestly, I don't believe a word out of anybody's mouth from Wall Street to the White House anymore. I think (INAUDIBLE) research. Buying Bank of America here, it's like throwing a dart. I mean, it's probably going to be one to make it out.</p><p>I'm much prefer...</p><p>PAYNE: You just said you want excitement. This is exciting.</p><p>MCCALL: It's exciting, but I also want to get some sleep at night as well. So I don't like it here. I like J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley. Those are the three that I'd be looking at. Not as exciting as a Bank of America or Citigroup, but a much better risk reward play.</p><p>PAYNE: Right, less risk. And...</p><p>MCCALL: And the reward is still high. I mean, I think you have a lot of upside on all three of those stocks.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks a lot, Matt. Really appreciate it.</p><p>MCCALL: Thanks, Charles.</p><p>(NEWSBREAK)</p><p>CLAMAN: Lawmakers are up in arms over the $165 million bonuses handed out to American International Group. And the head of the Senate Banking Committee, Chris Dodd of Connecticut, says he supports his colleagues' calls to recoup the taxpayer funds.</p><p>Dodd, though, has received nearly $300,000 over 20 years from the failed insurer. And folks, you know what? He's not alone. The list is legion, including both Republicans and Democrats who took money from AIG.</p><p>But here now to weigh in on the topic, Republican Senator <person><nameText>Kay Bailey Hutchison </nameText></person>of Texas.</p><p>Welcome, Senator. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON </nameText></person>(R), TEXAS: Thank you, liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, let me ask you, first, did you take any money from AIG in campaign contributions?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Liz, I don't know. I'm so sorry. I don't know. I have not even looked at my contribution list with regard to that.</p><p>CLAMAN: It's never come up? Really?</p><p>HUTCHISON: I have a very firm opinion about these bonuses.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p>HUTCHISON: You know, regardless of whether I have -- and we can certainly check that -- I think that what the executives are doing is outrageous. I think retention bonuses for people who have already left is just not acceptable to the American people.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm sure, because it's become such a hot-button issue here. We have received this morning alone hundreds and hundreds of e-mails.</p><p>What are your constituents telling you, Senator?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Oh, they're outraged. They're outraged by all of the big spending that scares people to death with the debt that we have and the deficits that we are accumulating.</p><p>They are outraged by these bailouts. Some are to big to fail, some are not. The bailout mania, I think, has just gone out of control, and that's what I'm hearing from my constituents.</p><p>And you know, Liz, there is more of a fear factor than I've known in my lifetime right now, because they see the problem, but they don't see a solution that is going to work. And that's what I'm hearing.</p><p>CLAMAN: These bonuses have everybody so riled up, Senator, as you know. But are we missing the bigger picture? And that is that when the TARP was pushed through initially, it just wasn't put in place where there were handcuffs that would prevent this kind of thing from happening, even though people demanded it.</p><p>Did Congress members read this closely enough? Why didn't they ensure that something would be put in that would prevent us down the road from facing this angst and anger?</p><p>HUTCHISON: I think that is a very legitimate criticism. I do.</p><p>Originally, Secretary Paulson asked for no strings at all, wanted $700 billion, and said that the global economy was going to crash if we didn't do it.</p><p>CLAMAN: I remember.</p><p>HUTCHISON: We didn't give him a no-strings-attached opening of the Treasury. We cut it to $350 billion.</p><p>We did put parameters around it. But clearly, we did not foresee all of the things that these people would do, like take trips, like give bonuses. We just thought that there would be a factor where all of these executives would come together like Americans come together to solve problems, and that they would do the right thing.</p><p>That was a mistaken assumption. However, now, Liz, we are not learning from that mistake, and we are continuing to throw money at problems without the necessary restraint and parameters put around it.</p><p>CLAMAN: Sure. Are you, Senator -- are you of the belief we can't let AIG go down because something horrible will happen?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Well, as I understand it, AIG has such a global impact because it is an insurer of last resort in so many areas. And that's why the original AIG bailout came from the Treasury, because Mr. Bernanke saw that as well.</p><p>Now we actually have put 80 percent of the company's capital on the line from American taxpayers, and I just think we've got to take a stronger control here. And we can't own 80 percent of a company and have executives taking bonuses for retention when they've already left.</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you think...</p><p>HUTCHISON: Let me say, too, Liz, I think you all talked about this earlier today. The contracts have already been breached. So to say this is a contractual obligation, when they have not met the performance standards that are in the contract, I think does bring into question that we would have the power to do more.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm absolutely with you on that. A contract, I absolutely believe, should be held up. But when the other side doesn't deliver what they promised, that's a problem.</p><p>An opinion article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" yesterday said this: \"The politicians prefer to talk about AIG's latest bonus payments because they deflect attention from Washington's failure to supervise AIG.\"</p><p>How do you respond to that, Senator?</p><p>HUTCHISON: I think it's valid. I think that the regulatory reform that is needed for AIG and for our financial institutions, and for the institutions that are doing all of these fancy derivatives that have been virtually unregulated, must be regulated in a responsible way. We don't want to go overboard, but we certainly know where the vacancies are in our regulatory system today, and we need to address that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Senator, one of your constituents just shot us an e-mail, wanted to get it to you. Neil Lewis in Granbury, Texas, says, \"Why are we outraged at the bonuses when we are supporting foreign banks to the tunes of tens of billions of dollars?\"</p><p>Now, just to clarify, foreigners have bought a lot of our debt. So this is perhaps a hairier, more complex issue. But do you have an answer for him?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Well, I think that it's correct to say that some of this stimulus or bailout money has gone to foreign banks. Part of it AIG. And that is an area that we need to look at, where this money is going, and have more strings on it so that we assure that our financial institutions are being shored up, but also that they're getting credit out there.</p><p>You say, what are my constituents saying? My constituents are saying they cannot get credit in the marketplace.</p><p>CLAMAN: Still, after all of that?</p><p>HUTCHISON: My small businesses, my medium-size businesses cannot get credit. My auto dealers cannot get credit. It is -- that's what we've got to address. And where all of this money is going from the bailout, into foreign coffers, I think is a legitimate question, of course.</p><p>CLAMAN: Last question. Quickly, do you think Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has a handle on this?</p><p>HUTCHISON: Well, I have to say that I don't see that he has come forward with a plan that can work. We don't see credit flowing.</p><p>I think that we made mistakes last fall, but we have not learned from those mistakes this spring. And I am very concerned that he is not on top of it, and that we have got to get a handle on the financial situation and the housing situation and stop all these stimulus packages until we correct that.</p><p>CLAMAN: Very sensible talking from you this morning, Senator. Thank you.</p><p>Senator <person><nameText>Kay Bailey Hutchison.</nameText></person></p><p>HUTCHISON: Thank you, Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: Any time.</p><p>Coming up, we have a look at \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>CLAMAN: And now it's time for \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>And that is people are still buzzing over AIG's bonus handouts. We've been getting your e-mails all morning long. We wanted to read a few more. Thank you so much for sending them.</p><p>Time to dig -- and so let's read some of these e-mails. We'll dig into the mail bag and see what everybody is talking about.</p><p>Glenn in Auburn, Alabama talks about AIG employees who are threatening to leave if they don't get their bonuses. Ah, yes. He says, \"These people caused the problems! So what if they leave? Good riddance!\"</p><p>PAYNE: Well, the point is, half of them are already gone.</p><p>CLAMAN: I know. They left with the money. See, they're smarter than we are.</p><p>LEE: Left with the money, yes.</p><p>Robert of Charleston, South Carolina, says, \"Almost anything the government or AIG does to address the utter audacity of this scandal will be hard to trust.\"</p><p>So that's the next kind of chapter of this problem, right?</p><p>CLAMAN: And remember, Fox Business will be carrying that at 10:00 a.m. Eastern today, the hearing on Capitol Hill.</p><p>PAYNE: By the way, guys, ,on that trust issue, how can private funds trust the government not to limit their profits if they go into this partnership on these toxic assets, considering the uproar? Because billions are going to be made on that if it's done right.</p><p>Bill Stevens of Jamestown, North Carolina, asks, \"Where was Timothy Geithner on this issue? Where was he when agreements were extended under his watch? I'll tell you what -- out to lunch -- like he is on all other economic issues.\"</p><p>CLAMAN: It was interesting. Did you just see Senator <person><nameText>Kay Bailey Hutchison? </nameText></person>She took a breath when I said does Tim Geithner have a handle on this? Granted, he's got to have a handle on a bunch of other issues, too. So it's very tough out there.</p><p>LEE: Yes, she did kind of...</p><p>PAYNE: But he's the number one guy. We need confidence in him, and obviously very few people have confidence.</p><p>CLAMAN: If he's there, you have got to have confidence in these people.</p><p>Keep the e-mails coming, folks, moneyforbreakfast @foxbusiness.com. It's very important that you e-mail us and let us know, because we are the one network who is letting your e-mails be, you know, read. And we understand how this feels.</p><p>But we've got to move this discussion forward. The dialogue has to move forward from, yes, we're totally annoyed, to what's going to happen?</p><p>LEE: And speaking of moving it forward, you have a big interview coming up on \"THE CLOSING BELL\" today.</p><p>CLAMAN: Mike Maroone of AutoNation. He's the president of the nation's largest auto dealer. They have a huge announcement, exclusively right here on Fox Business. It affects every single person who wants to buy any kind of car from these AutoNation dealers.</p><p>So stay tuned for that.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. Well, I'll definitely be watching.</p><p>CLAMAN: \"COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL,\" 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Thank you so much for joining us. We hope you have a great day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Hollywood is concerned about copyright abuse, especially abroad, while Marriott would like to make it harder for Airbnb to fight local hotel laws. IBM wants consumer online services to be more responsible for the content on their sites.</p><p>But they all see an opening as both Democrats and Republicans increasingly raise their own concerns about the power of the tech industry and the law. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 has helped Facebook, Google and YouTube grow into giants by holding only the people who post the billions of pieces of content on their services responsible for libel or other legal issues.</p><p>Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in a recent interview that Section 230 should be immediately \"revoked.\" Senators Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, are drafting bills that could increase the tech companies' liability. The Justice Department is conducting a review of the law.</p><p>\"People are either mad at tech companies and, legitimately in some cases, want to constrain their power for a lot of reasons,\" said Daphne Keller, a professor at Stanford Law School who used to be a lawyer for Google. \"Or companies are competing with tech companies and want to constrain their power for competitive reasons.</p><p>\"And a lot of those reasons are really complicated, but the easiest lever to hurt tech companiesthat a lot of people see is 230.\"</p><p>So far, the companies critical of the law have had mixed success with their lobbying. In 2018, Congress gave victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking. The law passed with support from companies like Disney, Oracle and IBM.</p><p>But the recent trade pact with Canada and Mexico contained Section 230-like protections, potentially locking in tech-friendly rules abroad.</p><p>Now critics of Section 230 are focused on pushing to keep similar language out of future trade pacts. A handout distributed by Disney's lobbyists last year warned Congress that trade deals with the provision would make it difficult for Congress to change the law in a way that improved the internet.</p><p>\"On an almost weekly basis,\" the handout said, \"additional concerns are being raised: illegal opioid sales, spread of terrorist propaganda, foreign government election meddling, spread of material and tools that help pedophiles connect.\"</p><p>Companies like Google and Facebook say that without Section 230 protections, building a business that gives individuals a platform for their content online would be impossible. They say it also shields online platforms from lawsuits when they police criminal or distasteful content.</p><p>Silicon Valley can employ significant resources to make its case. Google and Facebook spend millions a year on federal lobbying and are regular donors to outside policy groups. Their allies on Capitol Hill, like Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, have defended the law.</p><p>Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, an industry group whose members include Google and Facebook, said Section 230 was \"foundational to almost everything people do online.\"</p><p>\"It enables products and services that consumers love and rely upon every day,\" Mr. Beckerman said in a statement.</p><p>While criticism of Section 230 had mounted for years, the coalition of corporate interests questioning the value of the protections took root in late 2017 when Disney and 21st Century Fox backed the bill allowing lawsuits against web platforms for knowingly facilitating sex trafficking.</p><p>\"I had never seen them getting involved in any Section 230 issues before,\" said Jeff Kosseff, a lawyer who wrote a book about the law.</p><p>Now, hotel companies worry about Airbnb's use of Section 230 in lawsuits seeking to block local ordinances regulating home-sharing platforms. Judges have ruled against the company in many of those cases.</p><p>The Washington lobbying group that represents companies like Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt has backed a bill that would amend Section 230 so it didn't apply to home-rental services in many cases.</p><p>Airbnb declined to comment.</p><p>IBM, which like other enterprise software providers is trying to distance itself from businesses like Facebook, has supported adjusting Section 230 so that companies must take \"reasonable care\" to keep unlawful uses of their platforms in check. The proposal would apply to companies that not only hosted information but also made it available to the public. That means it would cover a consumer service like Instagram but not to a cloud computing provider like IBM.</p><p>The Motion Picture Association and the News Media Alliance, a group that lobbies for news organizations, have urged the Trump administration not to allow the protections in a future trade deal with Britain. The film group's concern is that it could make copyright enforcement more difficult. (The New York Times is a member of the News Media Alliance.)</p><p>Many of the consumer groups that have been critical of Section 230 don't share the companies' motivations. But they welcome the help from the companies, which have vast lobbying networks and the ability to get a meeting with the right aide at just the right time.</p><p>Gretchen Peters, who leads the Alliance to Counter Crime Online, a group critical of Section 230, said her small organization was spread thin. If \"somebody else, like the Disney folks or the hotel folks,\" set up a meeting, she said, \"I'll come along.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006922452</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4K-H5H1-JC85-N4BB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1010\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Their allies on Capitol Hill, like Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, have defended the law.</p><p>Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, an industry group whose members include Google and Facebook, said Section 230 was \u201cfoundational to almost everything people do online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt enables products and services that consumers love and rely upon every day,\u201d Mr. Beckerman said in a statement.</p><p>While criticism of Section 230 had mounted for years, the coalition of corporate interests questioning the value of the protections took root in late 2017 when Disney and 21st Century Fox backed the bill allowing lawsuits against web platforms for knowingly facilitating sex trafficking.</p><p>\u201cI had never seen them getting involved in any Section 230 issues before,\u201d said Jeff Kosseff, a lawyer who wrote a book about the law.</p><p>Now, hotel companies worry about Airbnb\u2019s use of Section 230 in lawsuits seeking to block local ordinances regulating home-sharing platforms. Judges have ruled against the company in many of those cases.</p><p>The Washington lobbying group that represents companies like Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt has backed a bill that would amend Section 230 so it didn\u2019t apply to home-rental services in many cases.</p><p>Airbnb declined to comment.</p><p>IBM, which like other enterprise software providers is trying to distance itself from businesses like Facebook, has supported adjusting Section 230 so that companies must take \u201creasonable care\u201d to keep unlawful uses of their platforms in check. The proposal would apply to companies that not only hosted information but also made it available to the public. That means it would cover a consumer service like Instagram but not to a cloud computing provider like IBM.</p><p>The Motion Picture Association and the News Media Alliance, a group that lobbies for news organizations, have urged the Trump administration not to allow the protections in a future trade deal with Britain. The film group\u2019s concern is that it could make copyright enforcement more difficult. (The New York Times is a member of the News Media Alliance.)</p><p>Many of the consumer groups that have been critical of Section 230 don\u2019t share the companies\u2019 motivations. But they welcome the help from the companies, which have vast lobbying networks and the ability to get a meeting with the right aide at just the right time.</p><p>Gretchen Peters, who leads the Alliance to Counter Crime Online, a group critical of Section 230, said her small organization was spread thin. If \u201csomebody else, like the Disney folks or the hotel folks,\u201d set up a meeting, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll come along.\u201d</p><p>PHOTOS: Joseph R.

The consulting giant and IBM rival recently reported strong fourth-quarter results, boosted by $6.5 billion worth of new bookings. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect IBM to report quarterly EPS of $2.75 on revenue of $24.13 billion, up from $2.40 on sales of $23.57 billion the company reported in the year-ago period. Analysts are also hoping to see evidence of top-line sales growth, but only at a rate of about 3%. \"We think IBM had a reasonable, though far from spectacular, September quarter,\" wrote BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman in a recent note. Bachman holds an outperform on the stock. \"As we look to the December quarter, we believe IBM will have improving growth rates in hardware and the potential for better growth rates in services.

Amazon Web Services has a cluster of data centres in Bahrain and the UAE.</p><p>Oracle already opened its first data centre in the UAE last year in Abu Dhabi and plans to open one more data centre in the UAE, likely in Dubai, and two in Saudi Arabia this year while Microsoft opened its data centres in Dubai and Abu Dhabi last year.</p><p>Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, has already invested in one data centre in the UAE while SAP opened its data centres in UAE and Saudi Arabia last year.</p><p>The only big player left is Google.</p><p>Big cloud providers need to have local data centres to cater to governments, financial and banking sectors for data residency regulations and that is why big players have opened data centres in the region.</p><p>Hossam Seif El-Din, Vice-President for Enterprise and Commercial at IBM Middle East and Africa, told TechRadar Middle East, that IBM has been offering cloud managed services to organisations across various sectors, globally and in the region, through its data centres globally but due to data residency issues, &amp;#x201C;we found it is important to have local data centres to target banking and government clients for mission-critical applications and data&amp;#x201D;.</p><p>Moreover, he said that only 20% of the companies have moved to the cloud and believe that it is the right time to move to the cloud.</p><p>&amp;#x201C;We see a huge growth opportunity as 80% of the workloads still sit on on-premises.&amp;#xA0; We not only provide IaaS, PaaS and SaaS but also manage on their behalf.&amp;#xA0; The data centres will deliver data backup and protection services for customers,&amp;#x201D; he said.</p><p>In the case of a network failure or downtime, he said that data and workloads hosted in the data centres will be recovered instantly and available for use in real-time.</p><p>Equinix to open Oman data centre in June next year as digitisation gains traction<br/>Huawei has no intention to be a data centre colocation operator<br/>Oracle sees more UAE governments moving to the cloud platform<br/>Microsoft is witnessing a strong uptake for its data centres in UAE<br/>UAE public cloud market to grow 35% this year</p><p>According to an International Data Centre (IDC ) report, the average cost of downtime is $250,000 per hour across all industries and organisational sizes.</p><p>&amp;#xA0;When asked whether IBM is planning to open more data centres in the region, El-Din said: &amp;#x201C;no comments&amp;#x201D;.</p><p>According to IDC, the public cloud market in the UAE is expected to grow by 35% to $406m in 2020 compared to $299m last year and two-thirds of the organisations will approach the cloud through a hybrid model.</p><p>The research firm is seeing a decline in on-premise [non-cloud] spending and a lot of spending is moving to the cloud as a subscription-based model to cut costs.</p><p>Manish Ranjan, research firm International Data Corporation&amp;#x2019;s program manager for software and cloud in the Middle East, Africa, and Turkey, said that looking at the Middle East in isolation, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are the biggest spenders on the public cloud services, with growth rates exceeding the market average.</p><p>&amp;#x201C;There are a lot of opportunities for the cloud in the region and Saudi Arabia is the right place for any cloud provider looking to tap into them.

The company has announced a bunch of improvements to its IBM Blockchain Platform, which offers a suite of developer tools to build decentralized solutions. Among other things, the platform will now support third-party cloud providers like AWS (Amazon Web Services). 'To support clients as they work to accelerate solutions that rely on blockchain, IBM is making the Blockchain Platform something a wide range of clients can implement \u2014 whether on the IBM Cloud, on another preferred cloud environment such as AWS, or locally using on-premises data centers,' the announcement reads. </p><p>The news comes days after IBM completed[1] the acquisition of cloud firm Red Hat for $34 billion. 'IBM is already seeing a wide range of scenarios and use cases embrace what we are calling the power of 'anywhere,'' wrote IBM VP of blockchain, Jerry Cuomo. 'Blockchain Platform for AWS is designed to enable clients to deploy distributed peers on the AWS Cloud.' For this occasion, IBM has prepared a deliberately 'inspirational' (and awfully hackneyed) promo video to show off its updated set of blockchain software solutions. It is also offering $500 in credits for anyone interested in trying out a demo.[embedded content]In addition to expanded support for cloud services, IBM is also rolling out a separate Cloud Private offering specifically designed to ensure compliance with new regulations like GDPR[2]. Unlike its standard offering, Cloud Private promises 'custom-managed networks' with more 'flexibility' and 'greater control' over data.Big tech invades blockchainIBM is hardly the only technology giant taking aim at the blockchain market. Recently, Google[3], Amazon, and Microsoft[4] have all launched similar cloud solutions for blockchain development. Not so long ago, Cuomo took to the company blog to announce[5] IBM has joined an effort to create 'decentrlaizedcross-blockchain registry that brings permissioned and permissionless blockchains together through a directory of blockchain networks' - basically a blockchain equivalent of the 'Yellow Pages.' Indeed, IBM has involved itself in a bevy of decentralized tech projects (like education[6], food tracking[7], and Ethereum-powered payments[8]); unfortunately, the company has remained tight-lipped about the technical specifics. Hopefully, its enterprise blockchain offerings and implementations are better thought out than its application patents[9].

The company claims its customers include agencies in all U.S. state governments, top U.S. universities and consumer goods, pharmaceutical and market-research companies.</p><p>''With this acquisition, we are extending our capabilities around a new level of analytics that not only provides clients with greater insight _ but true foresight,'' Ambuj Goyal, general manager of IBM's Information Management group, said in a statement.</p><p>The deal is expected to close later this year, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. SPSS has more than 1,200 employees in 60 countries. The company had $303US million in sales last year and $36 million in profit.</p><p>The acquisition fits with IBM's strategy of strengthening its software and services divisions as a critical part of a makeover over the past decade.</p><p>IBM has spent more than $20 billion since 2003 on more than 80 acquisitions. Fifty of those acquisitions have been software companies.</p><p>One result of the transformation is that IBM, a company known for its mainframes and other computers that have powered back offices for decades, is less reliant now on hardware. Having sold off its personal computer and printing businesses, IBM makes most of its money off services and software.</p><p>In the latest quarter _ the three months ended June 30 _ IBM's software division contributed 43 per cent of IBM's overall pretax profit. Expanding its reliance on software is one reason the Armonk, N.Y.-based company is able to keep improving profits even as sales fall because of the economy. IBM recently raised its latest 2009 profit forecast to $9.70 per share, from $9.20 per share.</p><p>Separately, IBM also has acquired Ounce Labs Inc., a privately held software company in Waltham, Mass., for an undisclosed amount. IBM said the company makes software that helps businesses reduce the risk and costs associated with security and compliance concerns.</p><p>Beefing up the software division was a key reason IBM explored buying Sun Microsystems Inc., a superstar of the dot-com era that struggled with inconsistent financial results for nearly a decade.</p><p>The Java technology that Sun invented is a key ingredient of the Internet, and IBM's $7 billion offer for Sun was fuelled in part by a desire to have more control over the software's development. The deal collapsed in a dispute over price and other terms.</p><p>Oracle Corp. ultimately agreed to buy Sun for $7.4 billion in cash in a surprise twist in the takeover saga. The bidding was one of the first signs that cash-rich tech companies were willing to open their wallets again despite the recession.</p><p>Another big tech deal recently was data-storage specialist EMC Corp.'s $2.1 billion pickup of a company called Data Domain Inc., whose technology helps companies cut the amount of information that gets stored multiple times. EMC had been in a fierce bidding contest with rival NetApp Inc. for control of Data Domain.</p><p>SPSS shares on Tuesday jumped $14.27, or 41 per cent, to $49.36. IBM shares fell 73 cents to $116US.90. on the New York Stock Exchange</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20090728CPCPB3054</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W88-SX01-2R6R-540D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>July 28, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The company claims its customers include agencies in all U.S. state governments, top U.S. universities and consumer goods, pharmaceutical and market-research companies.</p><p>\"With this acquisition, we are extending our capabilities around a new level of analytics that not only provides clients with greater insight but true foresight,\" Ambuj Goyal, general manager of IBM's Information Management group, said in a statement.</p><p>The deal is expected to close later this year, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. SPSS has more than 1,200 employees in 60 countries. The company had $303 million in sales last year and $36 million in profit.</p><p>The acquisition fits with IBM's strategy of strengthening its software and services divisions as a critical part of a makeover over the past decade.</p><p>IBM has spent more than $20 billion since 2003 on more than 80 acquisitions. Fifty of those acquisitions have been software companies.</p><p>One result of the transformation is that IBM, a company known for its mainframes and other computers that have powered back offices for decades, is less reliant now on hardware. Having sold off its personal computer and printing businesses, IBM makes most of its money off services and software.</p><p>In the latest quarter the three months ended June 30 IBM's software division contributed 43 percent of IBM's overall pretax profit. Expanding its reliance on software is one reason the Armonk, N.Y.-based company is able to keep improving profits even as sales fall because of the economy. IBM recently raised its latest 2009 profit forecast to $9.70 per share, from $9.20 per share.</p><p>Separately, IBM also has acquired Ounce Labs Inc., a privately held software company in Waltham, Mass., for an undisclosed amount. IBM said the company makes software that helps businesses reduce the risk and costs associated with security and compliance concerns.</p><p>Beefing up the software division was a key reason IBM explored buying Sun Microsystems Inc., a superstar of the dot-com era that struggled with inconsistent financial results for nearly a decade.</p><p>The Java technology that Sun invented is a key ingredient of the Internet, and IBM's $7 billion offer for Sun was fueled in part by a desire to have more control over the software's development. The deal collapsed in a dispute over price and other terms.</p><p>Oracle Corp. ultimately agreed to buy Sun for $7.4 billion in cash in a surprise twist in the takeover saga. The bidding was one of the first signs that cash-rich tech companies were willing to open their wallets again despite the recession.</p><p>Another big tech deal recently was data-storage specialist EMC Corp.'s $2.1 billion pickup of a company called Data Domain Inc., whose technology helps companies cut the amount of information that gets stored multiple times. EMC had been in a fierce bidding contest with rival NetApp Inc. for control of Data Domain.</p><p>SPSS shares on Tuesday jumped $14.36, or 41 percent, to $49.45. IBM shares closed 35 cents lower at $117.28.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APONL-US IBM SPSS Acquisition</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APONL2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W87-GPX1-2PFT-82S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147876</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><timeReceived>9:14 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>July 28, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The company claims its customers include agencies in all U.S. state governments, top U.S. universities and consumer goods, pharmaceutical and market-research companies.</p><p>\"With this acquisition, we are extending our capabilities around a new level of analytics that not only provides clients with greater insight but true foresight,\" Ambuj Goyal, general manager of IBM's Information Management group, said in a statement.</p><p>The deal is expected to close later this year, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. SPSS has more than 1,200 employees in 60 countries. The company had $303 million in sales last year and $36 million in profit.</p><p>The acquisition fits with IBM's strategy of strengthening its software and services divisions as a critical part of a makeover over the past decade.</p><p>IBM has spent more than $20 billion since 2003 on more than 80 acquisitions. Fifty of those acquisitions have been software companies.</p><p>One result of the transformation is that IBM, a company known for its mainframes and other computers that have powered back offices for decades, is less reliant now on hardware. Having sold off its personal computer and printing businesses, IBM makes most of its money off services and software.</p><p>In the latest quarter the three months ended June 30 IBM's software division contributed 43 percent of IBM's overall pretax profit. Expanding its reliance on software is one reason the Armonk, N.Y.-based company is able to keep improving profits even as sales fall because of the economy. IBM recently raised its latest 2009 profit forecast to $9.70 per share, from $9.20 per share.</p><p>Separately, IBM also has acquired Ounce Labs Inc., a privately held software company in Waltham, Mass., for an undisclosed amount. IBM said the company makes software that helps businesses reduce the risk and costs associated with security and compliance concerns.</p><p>Beefing up the software division was a key reason IBM explored buying Sun Microsystems Inc., a superstar of the dot-com era that struggled with inconsistent financial results for nearly a decade.</p><p>The Java technology that Sun invented is a key ingredient of the Internet, and IBM's $7 billion offer for Sun was fueled in part by a desire to have more control over the software's development. The deal collapsed in a dispute over price and other terms.</p><p>Oracle Corp. ultimately agreed to buy Sun for $7.4 billion in cash in a surprise twist in the takeover saga. The bidding was one of the first signs that cash-rich tech companies were willing to open their wallets again despite the recession.</p><p>Another big tech deal recently was data-storage specialist EMC Corp.'s $2.1 billion pickup of a company called Data Domain Inc., whose technology helps companies cut the amount of information that gets stored multiple times. EMC had been in a fierce bidding contest with rival NetApp Inc. for control of Data Domain.</p><p>SPSS shares on Tuesday jumped $14.36, or 41 percent, to $49.45. IBM shares closed 35 cents lower at $117.28.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APNE-US IBM SPSS Acquisition, 6th Ld-Writethru</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W87-GHW1-2PBV-B0FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>July 28, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The company claims its customers include agencies in all U.S. state governments, top U.S. universities and consumer goods, pharmaceutical and market-research companies.</p><p>\"With this acquisition, we are extending our capabilities around a new level of analytics that not only provides clients with greater insight but true foresight,\" Ambuj Goyal, general manager of IBM's Information Management group, said in a statement.</p><p>The deal is expected to close later this year, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. SPSS has more than 1,200 employees in 60 countries. The company had $303 million in sales last year and $36 million in profit.</p><p>The acquisition fits with IBM's strategy of strengthening its software and services divisions as a critical part of a makeover over the past decade.</p><p>IBM has spent more than $20 billion since 2003 on more than 80 acquisitions. Fifty of those acquisitions have been software companies.</p><p>One result of the transformation is that IBM, a company known for its mainframes and other computers that have powered back offices for decades, is less reliant now on hardware. Having sold off its personal computer and printing businesses, IBM makes most of its money off services and software.</p><p>In the latest quarter the three months ended June 30 IBM's software division contributed 43 percent of IBM's overall pretax profit. Expanding its reliance on software is one reason the Armonk, N.Y.-based company is able to keep improving profits even as sales fall because of the economy. IBM recently raised its latest 2009 profit forecast to $9.70 per share, from $9.20 per share.</p><p>Separately, IBM also has acquired Ounce Labs Inc., a privately held software company in Waltham, Mass., for an undisclosed amount. IBM said the company makes software that helps businesses reduce the risk and costs associated with security and compliance concerns.</p><p>Beefing up the software division was a key reason IBM explored buying Sun Microsystems Inc., a superstar of the dot-com era that struggled with inconsistent financial results for nearly a decade.</p><p>The Java technology that Sun invented is a key ingredient of the Internet, and IBM's $7 billion offer for Sun was fueled in part by a desire to have more control over the software's development. The deal collapsed in a dispute over price and other terms.</p><p>Oracle Corp. ultimately agreed to buy Sun for $7.4 billion in cash in a surprise twist in the takeover saga. The bidding was one of the first signs that cash-rich tech companies were willing to open their wallets again despite the recession.</p><p>Another big tech deal recently was data-storage specialist EMC Corp.'s $2.1 billion pickup of a company called Data Domain Inc., whose technology helps companies cut the amount of information that gets stored multiple times. EMC had been in a fierce bidding contest with rival NetApp Inc. for control of Data Domain.</p><p>SPSS shares on Tuesday jumped $14.36, or 41 percent, to $49.45. IBM shares closed 35 cents lower at $117.28.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTNE-US IBM SPSS Acquisition</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W87-GM00-Y8TX-103Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><timeReceived>9:13 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press State &amp;

In his keynote, he took the opportunity to reassert his belief that \"hybrid cloud and AI are the two dominant forces driving digital transformation today.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unsurpisingly, many of the subsequent announcements at the conference hinged on hybrid cloud, enabled in large part by IBM's\u00a0$34 billion acquisition of Red Hat in 2018.</p><p>[ Can the cloud save you money? These companies say yes ]</p><p>Take the technical preview of IBM Cloud Satellite. This product \"extends cloud services to anywhere a client needs them, as-a-service, on-premises or at the edge,\" Krishna said in his keynote address. In other words, Cloud Satellite-which is based on Kubernetes-enables IBM customers to run and manage cloud workloads from a single pane of glass on IBM's public cloud, in their own data centers, or in edge computing locations.</p><p>The full cloud stack includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux and a federated Istio service mesh. Services such as Red Hat OpenShift, IBM's Cloudant database, and the IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery toolchain can all operate in these \"satellite\" locations, managed via a central dashboard for policy, configuration management, and network traffic control.</p><p>As IBM president and former Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst put it in his keynote, \"You need a common architecture that runs on all environments, not just a management plane that allows you to observe the chaos, but one which allows you to run anywhere.\"</p><p>Red Hat itself only recently announced the technical preview of OpenShift virtualization, allowing customers to ease the migration of VM-based workloads to Kubernetes by running them alongside containers to be managed as native Kubernetes objects in OpenShift.</p><p>This is reminiscent of the approach being taken by Google Cloud with its Anthos platform, which similarly uses a foundation of Kubernetes and containers to allow for greater workload portability under a single control plane, with identity, access management, and observability built-in.</p><p>New leadership, new vision</p><p>IBM shook up its leadership earlier this year following the retirement of CEO Virginia Rometty by naming Krishna-former senior vice president of cloud and cognitive software-as CEO, and Whitehurst as IBM president. Twelve-year Red Hat veteran Paul Cormier took over as CEO of Red Hat as part of the realignment.</p><p>Krishna initially laid out his vision in a LinkedIn post on his first day on the job last month. \"There's a unique window of opportunity for IBM and Red Hat to establish Linux, containers, and Kubernetes as the new standard. We can make Red Hat OpenShift the default choice for hybrid cloud in the same way that Red Hat Enterprise Linux is the default choice for the operating system,\" he wrote.</p><p>Building on this during his Think keynote, Krishna borrowed VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger's turn of phrase, when he talked about \"the four imperatives driving hybrid adoption\"-namely history, choice, physics, and law.</p><p>[ Also on InfoWorld: Kubernetes meets the real world: 3 success stories ]</p><p>History refers to the legacy systems most enterprises come saddled with, and which creates the need for a hybrid multicloud strategy. Choice refers to the desire of organizations to avoid getting locked into \"one company's innovation,\" as Krishna put it, and have the flexibility to move workloads from provider to provider as they see fit.</p><p>Physics refers to the physical limitations of present-day systems when it comes to organizations with unique latency needs. This creates a need for hybrid deployments for use cases such as autonomous vehicles or assembly robots on a factory floor.</p><p>Lastly, there is law-that is, regulatory and compliance needs-which require businesses to keep certain applications and data on premises.</p><p>AI and 5g get their due</p><p>Other announcements included Watson AIOps and a new set of edge and 5G options. In Watson AIOps, IBM is pursuing the holy grail for many IT leaders: to automate away basic IT tasks and address issues before they occur.</p><p>By bringing together metrics and alerts with unstructured data like logs and tickets, Watson's machine learning algorithms and natural language understanding can \"create a synthesized holistic problem report to identify and address the situation,\" vice president for Watson AIOps development, Jessica Rockwood, explained in a blog post.</p><p>The telco-targeted announcements hinged on the IBM Telco Network Cloud Manager, a loosely defined bundle of technology paired with a new IBM Services arm and partner network to help telecommunications companies roll out new 5G and edge-enabled products.</p><p>IBM also announced an Edge Application Manager, which promises AI-enabled insights and remote management for up to 10,000 edge nodes by a single administrator.</p><p>[ Also on InfoWorld: Artificial intelligence predictions for 2020 ]</p><p>\"IBM's new version of Edge Application Manager and introduction of Telco Cloud Manager is part of IBM's hybrid cloud strategy which is now extending through telcos to the edge,\" said Nick McQuire, SVP and head of enterprise research at CCS Insight said.</p><p>\"The move follows some important moves made by AWS, Microsoft, and Google Cloud into the telco space over the past 12 months,\" McQuire added. \"What we are seeing now is the convergence of the cloud, the network edge, and 5G all happening in real time and the big tech firms are now jockeying for position in this next big shift in the cloud market.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INFDLY-3541825</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INFDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YV3-PNN1-DY58-D3T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">169977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"915\"/><timeReceived>03:19 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Data Group, Inc.
