The front page of the Arab News, the pressure on the sun Rohani, the president of Iran. -- Hassan. This is something we have touched on actually quite often on this programme, the difficulties that Iran is facing and a lot of it is to do with President Trump pulling out of the nuclear deal and imposing sanctions. A lot of countries that want to note that agreement and trade with Iran, how difficult it is for them to do so. I must admit that until I read this piece this afternoon I was not aware that Rouhani, who of course had done a significant level of negotiation with Trump... With Barack Obama. With Barack Obama, or beg your pardon, Rouhani is now getting a significant amount of pushback in the Iranian parliament. If they do not like the answers, they send, they refer to the Iranian judiciary. That is probably the start of the and for Rouhani, so I think everyone needs to keep their eyes on this. Already, the economic Minister and the Labour Minister have gone in the last three or four weeks. It is partly a result of the Trump sanctions and again if you are Trump, you might be saying this is working. Well, Trump might want to be careful what he wishes for you because you might end up with an even more hardline Iranian leader to replace a relatively moderate one. Indeed, absolutely. Let's now move on to limbo, many discussing the warning from President Trump directed at Google, and then he broadened out to Facebook and Twitter, saying be careful. He also mentioned the word regulation. Give us your take on what he has to say. We not surprised to hear what he has to say, there is bias, there is bias in the media in general is something he has been talking about since before the election. This is classic Trump, it is what you call dead cat bounce and, at a great here at Paul Manafort, the overhit it Michael Cohen, to look at your potential impeachment, look over there, look at the fake news, look at media. -- don't look over there at Michael Cohen. I had a Google today and yes, CNN comes up, Wall Street Journal comes up, the New York Times comes up, the hated New York Times, to use the White House's words, however the reason they come up is because they are some of the best rated news websites in the world. His point was Breitbart News should be on there, Fox News should be on there. It is an argument I do not think it stands up to much. It is a diversion. It is a political diversion, but the real question is what it leads to, could it lead to regulation of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, given what we have learned about run-up to the 2016 presidential election? This is the thing about Trump, his desire to create a diversionary tactic, some of these big tech companies could be facing regulation. Whether or not a new Congress be on the November passes any of this, let's wait and see. Let's talk about the French President Emmanuel Macron has a lovely big majority in the French parliament and was swept into power, et cetera. But it would seem things are getting quite tricky for him now, his high-profile environment Minister has quit. Yeah, so this is his Energy Minister, Nicolas Hulot.

A word on the dancing is yellow fantastic. You love that? Politicians dancing, politicians holding animals, fantastic. Kissing babies. Is in babies, we all for it. Loving it. The front page of the Arab News, the pressure on the sun Rohani, the president of Iran. -- Hassan. This is something we have touched on actually quite often on this programme, the difficulties that Iran is facing and a lot of it is to do with President Trump pulling out of the nuclear deal and imposing sanctions. A lot of countries that want to note that agreement and trade with Iran, how difficult it is for them to do so. I must admit that until I read this piece this afternoon I was not aware that Rouhani, who of course had done a significant level of negotiation with Trump... With Barack Obama. With Barack Obama, or beg your pardon, Rouhani is now getting a significant amount of pushback in the Iranian parliament. If they do not like the answers, they send, they refer to the Iranian judiciary. That is probably the start of the and for Rouhani, so I think everyone needs to keep their eyes on this. Already, the economic Minister and the Labour Minister have gone in the last three or four weeks. It is partly a result of the Trump sanctions and again if you are Trump, you might be saying this is working. Well, Trump might want to be careful what he wishes for you because you might end up with an even more hardline Iranian leader to replace a relatively moderate one. Indeed, absolutely. Let's now move on to limbo, many discussing the warning from President Trump directed at Google, and then he broadened out to Facebook and Twitter, saying be careful. He also mentioned the word regulation. Give us your take on what he has to say.

So at a tense time when everyone is wondering exactly what is going on, I think the best thing we can do is keep an eye on the situation. Nearly 90 ferry passengers have been injured in Japan when the high speed boat they were travelling on collided with an object in the water - thought to be a whale. The Japanese Coast Guard said five people were seriously injured in the accident which occurred just before the ferry was due to arrive on Sado island, following a short trip from the mainland. </p><p>It is believed the boat collided with a whale, as both humpbacks and minkes are often found in the area. Internet users should have greater control over personal data to ensure their own safety online. It's part of a proposal to change the way big tech companies are regulated. It follows a report from The House of Lords Communications Committee which says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our Business Correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had viewed graphic images about self harm online. Molly's father has said he believes social media was partly to blame for her death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online, and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nation state, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in the Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies, but if we think they need to do things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications Committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the Committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering the digital world, but no one body has complete oversight, so the Lords recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protections given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There's also a call for a classification framework, similar to that for films. The Government is currently working on its own plans to more strictly regulate web companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about, but they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harms. Rob Young, BBC News. More than 200 works of art belonging to the singer George Michael will go on auction and exhibition in London this week. The performer, who died in 2016, had a huge personal collection including works by Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst. Estimates on the paintings being auctioned at Christies range from #400 to #1.5 million - with the money raised going to charity. Now it's time for a look at the weather with Alina Jenkins. Hello. There is some turbulent weather in the forecast. The weekend and next week. Some of us have seen snow. In the form of showers, some sunshine in between. Showers blowing across on strong Northwest or westerly winds. Showers will tend to fade as the day wears on and our eyes turned to the Southwest in our next Atlantic system arriving for this evening and overnight. The rest of the weekend, it is going to stay windy. It will feel quite cold especially into northern parts of England. Some rain and further snow, but also some spells and sunshine. So this evening, cloud and rain pushing its way north and eastwards. Much of England and Wales, some hills not across parts of Wales and also snow arriving late in the night across parts of Northern Ireland in western Scotland. The head, clear skies. It will be a cold and frosty night across much of Scotland, down into northern England and maybe into the North Midlands as well. We have got cloud and rain, it will be somewhat milder temperatures here staying well above freezing. Through tomorrow morning, a band of rain starts to slowly clearly eastwards. Meanwhile what is happening further west Ace snow arriving into Northern Ireland, western Scotland and down into parts of northern England. We have still got those strong winds as well. Very unsettled start to the day across many western parts of Scotland. We couldn't see a couple of centimetres, even at lower levels. It will be slightly slushy, but over the tops of the hills up as much as five or six cm. A mixture of rain, sleet and snow across northern England. The rain of clear light across much of the Midlands, Wales and central and southern England. Here sunshine for the morning as the rain starts to clear away. Snow starts to move its way eastwards and becomes a little bit more showering through the afternoon. Still a very unsettled and windy afternoon. The best of the sunshine across central and southern parts of England and into Wales. Could see temperatures up to ten or 11 Celsius, but just for a five Celsius further north. And on the strength of the wind and</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-c3a713aaf32045c88e253b66f8adcc65</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKS-P8W1-DY08-30B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

We're always going to be focused on the mission that Congress has given us. We have the tools to carry it out, we have the independence, which we think is essential to be able to do our jobs in a nonpolitical way. And, you know, we at the Fed are absolutely committed to that mission and nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do. </p><p>So, for now, it appears more rate increases are on the horizon, even if the pace is not predetermined, as the Fed tries to ensure the economic expansion continues and that inflation remains in check. The shelf flurry, BBC News, outside the Federal reserve in Washington. Paul Kavanagh is CEO of Patronus Partners. -- Michelle Fleury. Give us your reaction to what Girona Powell had to say. We all expected the rate rise, but what about his comments? He was dammed if he did, dammed if he didn't. I don't think the stock market was going to react positively last night, the trend is down at the moment and the market is fretting about economic growth globally around the world and that's why we are seeing declining prices. Last night he put his rates up, but he didn't talk about 2019 and 2020 in the sort of terms with the caution one would want to see with the said being combo to give. He talked about data points, he talked about the data points -- the Fed being combative. He didn't prejudge. That's what he should say. The market was hoping he would be more accommodated. -- accommodative. That's why we have the sell-off this morning. Is your glass half full or half empty when it comes to the outlook for the US economy? When we stand back and look at 2018, the balance sheet of the US Fed topped out in March this year, that's when they drew down on the balance sheet a bit. It was noticeable how economic growth particularly around the emerging economies fell off almost immediately that happened and that's really accelerated in the second half of this year. The question was, will it pull down the US economy? We've seen weakness across Europe but the US economy, which has been fired up this year, 3% and forecast of 2.5% next year, is going well but there's indicative signs at the moment the US economy is coming under pressure from the rest of the world. When you say under pressure, does that mean recession in 2020, which is what some are predicting. No, but what we're saying is 2019 and 2020 look more likely to underperform. My suspicion is while he was talking about two rate rises next year, it's going to become more accommodative text year. Paul, thanks very much, nice to see you. Let's stay in Washington, because the city's top prosecutor, the District of Columbia Attorney General, is suing Facebook. Karl Racine says the social media giant failed to protect the privacy of its users and deceived them about who had access to their data. It's the first major US move to punish Facebook over the scandal involving the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which was able to access personal data from tens of millions of users. On Wednesday the New York Times reported that Facebook had also done deals with some 150 companies, including Amazon, Netflix and Spotify, giving them access to users' detailed personal information. Gabe Dance from the paper told the BBC the company is heading for a lot more trouble with regulators over its use of personal data, which is central to its business model. There's a good chance that British lawmakers could put a stop to it in a certain respect. There's the opportunity for the US Federal government to put a stop to it. Facebook under a consent agreement or practices in 2011 that were misleading to its users. It seems there is potential here for that agreement to have been violated, and that could lead to further regulations and fines here. Europe clearly has put in place the GDPR redactions, so I don't think Facebook is going to do it on its own. I don't think Facebook's partner companies are going to do it on their own, although we have seen some device makers, including Apple, certainly try to distance themselves from Facebook. So it certainly appears the onus is on governments both here and the United States and abroad to rain in these big tech companies. Let's go to Asia now, and news that Renault boss Carlos Ghosn may soon be out of jail, after a Tokyo court decided not to extend his detention.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YL-66bcedd7834c49e8988b4241747c76a3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V0W-1P11-JBH6-C424-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400425</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

It's the first major US move to punish Facebook over the scandal involving the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which was able to access personal data from tens of millions of users. On Wednesday the New York Times reported that Facebook had also done deals with some 150 companies, including Amazon, Netflix and Spotify, giving them access to users' detailed personal information. Gabe Dance from the paper told the BBC the company is heading for a lot more trouble with regulators over its use of personal data, which is central to its business model.

It seems there is potential here for that agreement to have been violated, and that could lead to further regulations and fines here. Europe clearly has put in place the GDPR redactions, so I don't think Facebook is going to do it on its own. I don't think Facebook's partner companies are going to do it on their own, although we have seen some device makers, including Apple, certainly try to distance themselves from Facebook.

Karl Racine says the social media giant failed to protect the privacy of its users and deceived them about who had access to their data. It's the first major US move to punish Facebook over the scandal involving the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which was able to access personal data from tens of millions of users. On Wednesday the New York Times reported that Facebook had also done deals with some 150 companies, including Amazon, Netflix and Spotify, giving them access to users' detailed personal information. Gabe Dance from the paper told the BBC the company is heading for a lot more trouble with regulators over its use of personal data, which is central to its business model. There's a good chance that British lawmakers could put a stop to it in a certain respect. There's the opportunity for the US Federal government to put a stop to it. Facebook under a consent agreement or practices in 2011 that were misleading to its users. It seems there is potential here for that agreement to have been violated, and that could lead to further regulations and fines here. Europe clearly has put in place the GDPR redactions, so I don't think Facebook is going to do it on its own. I don't think Facebook's partner companies are going to do it on their own, although we have seen some device makers, including Apple, certainly try to distance themselves from Facebook.

We all expected the rate rise, but what about his comments? He was dammed if he did, dammed if he didn't. I don't think the stock market was going to react positively last night, the trend is down at the moment and the market is fretting about economic growth globally around the world and that's why we are seeing declining prices. Last night he put his rates up, but he didn't talk about 2019 and 2020 in the sort of terms with the caution one would want to see with the said being combo to give. He talked about data points, he talked about the data points -- the Fed being combative. He didn't prejudge. That's what he should say. The market was hoping he would be more accommodated. -- accommodative. That's why we have the sell-off this morning. Is your glass half full or half empty when it comes to the outlook for the US economy? When we stand back and look at 2018, the balance sheet of the US Fed topped out in March this year, that's when they drew down on the balance sheet a bit. It was noticeable how economic growth particularly around the emerging economies fell off almost immediately that happened and that's really accelerated in the second half of this year. The question was, will it pull down the US economy? We've seen weakness across Europe but the US economy, which has been fired up this year, 3% and forecast of 2.5% next year, is going well but there's indicative signs at the moment the US economy is coming under pressure from the rest of the world. When you say under pressure, does that mean recession in 2020, which is what some are predicting. No, but what we're saying is 2019 and 2020 look more likely to underperform. My suspicion is while he was talking about two rate rises next year, it's going to become more accommodative text year. Paul, thanks very much, nice to see you. Let's stay in Washington, because the city's top prosecutor, the District of Columbia Attorney General, is suing Facebook. Karl Racine says the social media giant failed to protect the privacy of its users and deceived them about who had access to their data. It's the first major US move to punish Facebook over the scandal involving the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which was able to access personal data from tens of millions of users. On Wednesday the New York Times reported that Facebook had also done deals with some 150 companies, including Amazon, Netflix and Spotify, giving them access to users' detailed personal information. Gabe Dance from the paper told the BBC the company is heading for a lot more trouble with regulators over its use of personal data, which is central to its business model. There's a good chance that British lawmakers could put a stop to it in a certain respect. There's the opportunity for the US Federal government to put a stop to it. Facebook under a consent agreement or practices in 2011 that were misleading to its users. It seems there is potential here for that agreement to have been violated, and that could lead to further regulations and fines here. Europe clearly has put in place the GDPR redactions, so I don't think Facebook is going to do it on its own. I don't think Facebook's partner companies are going to do it on their own, although we have seen some device makers, including Apple, certainly try to distance themselves from Facebook. So it certainly appears the onus is on governments both here and the United States and abroad to rain in these big tech companies.

Now let's brief you on some other business stories. Facebook suffered a bomb threat this morning at it's Menlo Park headquarters near San Francisco. The threat prompted authorities to evacuate a building. But after a sweep of the structure there was no word of any explosives found. Both Facebook and police said everyone was safe. A day after Urjit Patel's surprise exit as the head of the Reserve Bank of India, Shaktikanta Das has been appointed as the new boss of the central bank. Mr Patel's resignation triggered a selloff in the rupee on concerns that moves by Narendra Modi's government are threatening the banking regulator's independence. China's music streaming company Tencent Music has reportedly raised over $1 billion in its US initial public offering. That's according to Reuters. If confirmed, the music arm of gaming and social network giant has been valued at over $21 billion, defying a bout of market volatility with flotations. Now, we did tell you this was going to take place. Executives of big tech companies have spent parts of 2018 testifying in front of US lawmakers in Washington DC. Google was the latest, talking to lawmakers about their policies regarding alleged political bias, tracking and expanding in to China. The BBC's North American technology reporter Dave Lee breaks it down. If you \"idiot\" under images, a picture of Donald Trump comes up. Sunday petard's goal when coming to this, try to claim that Google was not too powered all on the Internet. Do you believe it is biased, yes or no? No, not in our approach. Ted Lu had this suggestion for people who want to change their results. If you want positive search results, you do positive things. If you don't want negative search results, don't do negative things. As well as those concerned about bias, many on the committee were asking Google about how it uses personal darter, in particular, how Google tracks allocation. Does Google, through the stone, know that I have moved here and moved over to the left? It is either yes or no. Not by default. There may be a Google service that you have opted in to use... So Google knows that I am moving over there. Is not a trick question! As is often the case, whenever somebody suggest it is a simple yes or no answer, it is a lot more complicated than that. There was one question on China that he could have been perhaps bit more upfront in answering. Will you rule out lose -- lodging a tool for surveillance and censorship in China while you are CEO of Google? Congressmen, I commit to engaging one of the things that is important to us as a company, we have stated mission of providing users with information. I think overall he came out pretty well from this hearing, there were no heavy punches that knocked him off his stride. But there is cross party support for more regulation as we go into 2019. That is Dave Lee, based in San Francisco for us.

That is, for many, a step in the right direction they feel. See how we go from here. In the meantime, you may wonder where he has been, we have always said he is an absolute star, but now it would seem it is official because you are looking very serious, but we are talking about your star that he received in the Philippines, tell us more!</p><p> LAUGHTER. Well, do you do what... He has got it. -- do you know what. I lost my connection for a few seconds there so I only heard the last part of what you said happened in Manila. It is an honour and working with Sally Bond doc, BBC World News team, made this walk of Fame star all possible. Thank you. -- Sally Bundock. If you have no idea what we are talking about, you have got to follow him and I tweeted it, you can see his star on the walk of Fame. Good to have you back. CUC and. -- see you soon. Now let's brief you on some other business stories. Facebook suffered a bomb threat this morning at it's Menlo Park headquarters near San Francisco. The threat prompted authorities to evacuate a building. But after a sweep of the structure there was no word of any explosives found. Both Facebook and police said everyone was safe. A day after Urjit Patel's surprise exit as the head of the Reserve Bank of India, Shaktikanta Das has been appointed as the new boss of the central bank. Mr Patel's resignation triggered a selloff in the rupee on concerns that moves by Narendra Modi's government are threatening the banking regulator's independence. China's music streaming company Tencent Music has reportedly raised over $1 billion in its US initial public offering. That's according to Reuters. If confirmed, the music arm of gaming and social network giant has been valued at over $21 billion, defying a bout of market volatility with flotations. Now, we did tell you this was going to take place. Executives of big tech companies have spent parts of 2018 testifying in front of US lawmakers in Washington DC. Google was the latest, talking to lawmakers about their policies regarding alleged political bias, tracking and expanding in to China. The BBC's North American technology reporter Dave Lee breaks it down. If you \"idiot\" under images, a picture of Donald Trump comes up. Sunday petard's goal when coming to this, try to claim that Google was not too powered all on the Internet. Do you believe it is biased, yes or no? No, not in our approach. Ted Lu had this suggestion for people who want to change their results. If you want positive search results, you do positive things. If you don't want negative search results, don't do negative things. As well as those concerned about bias, many on the committee were asking Google about how it uses personal darter, in particular, how Google tracks allocation. Does Google, through the stone, know that I have moved here and moved over to the left? It is either yes or no. Not by default. There may be a Google service that you have opted in to use... So Google knows that I am moving over there. Is not a trick question! As is often the case, whenever somebody suggest it is a simple yes or no answer, it is a lot more complicated than that. There was one question on China that he could have been perhaps bit more upfront in answering. Will you rule out lose -- lodging a tool for surveillance and censorship in China while you are CEO of Google? Congressmen, I commit to engaging one of the things that is important to us as a company, we have stated mission of providing users with information. I think overall he came out pretty well from this hearing, there were no heavy punches that knocked him off his stride. But there is cross party support for more regulation as we go into 2019. That is Dave Lee, based in San Francisco for us. That have a look at the markets one more time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NW-4093ff48267642e09b322433ce09c394</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY5-87P1-JBH6-C16K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

Now let's brief you on some other business stories. Facebook suffered a bomb threat this morning at it's Menlo Park headquarters near San Francisco. The threat prompted authorities to evacuate a building. But after a sweep of the structure there was no word of any explosives found. Both Facebook and police said everyone was safe. A day after Urjit Patel's surprise exit as the head of the Reserve Bank of India, Shaktikanta Das has been appointed as the new boss of the central bank. Mr Patel's resignation triggered a selloff in the rupee on concerns that moves by Narendra Modi's government are threatening the banking regulator's independence. China's music streaming company Tencent Music has reportedly raised over $1 billion in its US initial public offering. That's according to Reuters. If confirmed, the music arm of gaming and social network giant has been valued at over $21 billion, defying a bout of market volatility with flotations. Now, we did tell you this was going to take place. Executives of big tech companies have spent parts of 2018 testifying in front of US lawmakers in Washington DC. Google was the latest, talking to lawmakers about their policies regarding alleged political bias, tracking and expanding in to China. The BBC's North American technology reporter Dave Lee breaks it down. If you \"idiot\" under images, a picture of Donald Trump comes up. Sunday petard's goal when coming to this, try to claim that Google was not too powered all on the Internet. Do you believe it is biased, yes or no? No, not in our approach. Ted Lu had this suggestion for people who want to change their results. If you want positive search results, you do positive things. If you don't want negative search results, don't do negative things. As well as those concerned about bias, many on the committee were asking Google about how it uses personal darter, in particular, how Google tracks allocation. Does Google, through the stone, know that I have moved here and moved over to the left? It is either yes or no. Not by default. There may be a Google service that you have opted in to use... So Google knows that I am moving over there. Is not a trick question! As is often the case, whenever somebody suggest it is a simple yes or no answer, it is a lot more complicated than that. There was one question on China that he could have been perhaps bit more upfront in answering.

Congressmen, I commit to engaging one of the things that is important to us as a company, we have stated mission of providing users with information.

Debt charities are warning some of the poorest families in the country will be left relying on foodbanks over Christmas, because of universal credit. From today all new benefit claimants across the UK will be signed up to the programme, which looks to streamline the benefits system. But it hasn't been without controversy, with many universal credit claimants complaining of sanctions being imposed on them, which has temporarily reduced their payments.

Let's look at the Times's front-page. They are dominating, Facebookshares hit extremely hard, no surprise really? No, on this story probably has a lot of Lex to go. </p><p>There is a lot going to happen before we see the end of this. -- legs. What this story really focuses on is almost the landslide we saw when this news came out and obviously, we have these so-called stocks, Facebook, Is on, Google or Alphabet, as they are known, these companies have been so well known for so long, with very them. -- Amazon. Apart from Uber. little bad press coming out about Yeah, apart from Uber. We know that data is always a sticking point for any sort of social company, we know that when that has been compromised or used outside of anything it should be used for, there is a downside to the price. On the issue of cause for Facebookand Google, for example, in that group, and for Twitter and others, if the decision is made, they should be regulated, policed in some way, what impact will that have on the likes of Facebook? Also, some are asking the question about to what extent they want to be using these platforms at all if their data is being used, find out or sent out without their knowledge. Of course, Facebookis denying any wrongdoing, as are the other companies involved in this but it will be interesting to see how marks up about reacts to this, what he decides to do in terms of talking to politicians on both side of the Atlantic and that sort of thing. -- bbc.co.uk. Yeah, and I think that is what they have said they are going to do. -- Mark Zuckerberg. All of the big tech companies will be following this story really closely, because it has a knock-on effect, all these big companies get hit when there is any news around these big tech stocks. Now, the San Francisco Chronicle looking in detail of what actually happens, this self driving taxi on the road, testing condition but actually on the real road and a woman was not down and tragically, she died. This is no fault by Uber, but this is the problem with this technology, isn't it? Is very difficult to predict human behaviour. Absolutely, and the argument behind this would save look, this is computer code we are looking out. Algorithms. These algorithms, they are not the reactions of a computer, this is Hull computer will react in the face of a situation like this. The police and the officials who run this said that it was not at fault, the driver was not at fault, this would have happened, and an interesting line in this, this would have happened... Because the lady just came out in between two vehicles. Autonomous or human driving car, the exact same situation would have happened, so these Dougherty said. I do not think it is necessarily the end of the road for this kind of tech knowledge it because this is seen as the kind of future car travel especially. -- the authorities said. It is or is different when the name Uber is involved because there is such bad press around Uber, there is such bad perception. Because bbc.co.uk is testing all this is well. The perception of which is totally different to Uber. It is totally opposite, as you say. Looking at this innovation, as it were. What do you think? Do you feel safer with self driving cars on the road or not? It is like viewers have been saying, driverless car cannot drink, take drugs or use a mobile phone when it is driving. Can't be overtired. Can't be overtired. Changing the CD, and is anybody do that any more? All right, let's move on. Let's talk Brexit, James. I know you love this subject, you love talking Brexit. Other papers have this story too, and you know there is a difference of opinion as to what degree it is a breakthrough or not, but would you argue that this decision on the part of Michel Barnier and David Davis to agree on a transition bill, what happens after March, is good news for companies and businesses in terms of their planning?
