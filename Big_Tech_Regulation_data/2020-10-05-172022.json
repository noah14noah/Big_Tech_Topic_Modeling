there they're private other private platforms they are tailored a to push for a certain kind of engagement and so if we as a public can kind of investigate or regulate these spaces in line with our values as a society are we could find ourselves a lot of trouble arm but the real problem here is that we're not collecting the kinds of data arm that would help us craft effective legislation so good father earlier said you know he's happy that things like filters might come into place we have really good evidence that the current generation of filters don't work so I understand you're driven by data but Yeah but why should we trust our situation if it if you were to ask to 11 year-olds how they spent a summer afternoon one says all my friends in the would build a treehouse and other City spent 4 hours in the online rather via online game for night which would you think was healthier I think there's a balance I think it's seriously and you mean when you say you wouldn't let your child you knew one of them said I spent it after with my mates do know says I've been in a dark room playing for make no more distant third but obviously very obviously if that's the comparison you would prefer them to get some might indeed thought we know we know that the decade after decade especially in this country British youth are doing better long haul set of measures a ten-year-old a teenager today is half as likely to are one or two dry that I do understand that there are lots of variables a I just want it to be a the sense that we have that relationship online Yeah are in some way inferior or tilted problematic comparison to face is that is that is just a myth or use and await data to prove that now I mean with this kid is a classic case of trust but verify so you know if we think as a society we want to operate from a position of precaution that makes sense but we can just dust hands often say we've protected the children because we've done some intervention we actually need to measure whether or not it's worked and whether or not this ends and children being healthier Professor should skip Thank you very much indeed for joining us Thanks so much eye witnesses said Camilla Turner whose education editor at the Daily Telegraph which is actually at the moment running a duty of care campaign about children and the internet the UK who has a primary duty of care the pencil internet companies while aren't newspaper campaigners calling for that internet companies Tower and have a duty of care written to statutes that would give them a legal responsibility to protect its users against the harms that it could potentially cause them to the internet companies the onto the travel and it just entered the big tech companies own but it seems to me that would give them an awful lot of power to decide who gets to see what was harmful what's and morally right and You trust them to do that well what what what we're calling for us and if if the government were to get the tax companies duty of cash them we would outline exactly which harms we want them to guard against say is the way visit in there in that seat with a statue sat out just kind of things I mean there's a lot of panic about sexting for example young people I mean it is consensual sexting between boyfriend and girlfriend even if their 30s and 40s the problem with that or is that just that wee bit old-fashioned what is with the was the problem with Mali and is all it is already illegal to share indecent Images of a minor morally I am saying if you're 13 14 going out with injuries and the edge of the box but he's out these harmful to be with you think it is when it has had quite a great potential for harm because if there is pictures then shared online more widely in and he knows that I couldn't stand up on matching at the just that there's a lot of presumptions about I am wondering whether we over ramping up the harms when we compare the harms into broad categories say one harm could be the heart guarding children from sexual harassment sexual exploitation and grooming and sharing indecent images that could be one Broad category we want to guard and I'm saying that because that an awful lot of young people at the moment I think it there are lots of em companies were concerned about the criminalisation of just two things like sexting and but also Lesbos as the censorship question as well but OK young people the in many ways of kind of worrying about a week we have scared them off the streets playing outside people don't and on several is a really positive aspects of young people having that freedom to be sociable with each of their two experiments too risky things online I don't think anyone wants to curtail their freedoms of children the freedom

this stage we should ask yourself why information previously why they are so important wires despite them being grabbed something there is a privacy very important thing people care most about way is a very important thing is not being framed so far in a way that allow us to protect but the leader as they should so much so we have a debate about online companies 3 hours later the government it away data always yourself sharing our data to liberally are not really really but what would be wrong with simply getting back to some very basic principles about public good things we've discussed from Socrates just look to Kante soon golden rule and philosophy that arises from them why we need a new philosophy when it seems that some of the old guys an everyday women guys that were using to over to have given us a framework which is what you are calling for because those values are societal violence in the change was tired and our societies are changing and we are seeing new line is emerging to talk about this new principles knew we were feeling of sensitive to this something weekend stays we couldn't carry 20 years ago 30 years ago gender equality you talk to our current about gender equality he wouldn't have been listening at all quite the opposite sell us their annual issues emerging winning 12 of his understand I have not one but two Valley familiar part of this argument as we've heard it tonight is third major row between Liberty security and that doesn't appear to have changed and I'm still with lost Kong I think it As relevant as ever wider needing frost free to do with her where you write to the free market it added that the lock versus versus obs a point is that the framework in this kind of the conceptual understanding it's about being able to vote if you wish understand this dynamic within you can't lock would talk about previously Ali pretty something was about the fruits of your Labour objective things physical things again in his day we talk about it but ultimately what we've been talking about tonight is is that is the tension between whether you clamp down on Liberty to say safe or not I think it essentially we could do with people reading old philosophy never mind developing new stuff I'm ready Ulster of might be to get somewhere but just just kind of ship because there is a new shift in terms of how people perceive their rights the guardianship right he earns what I mean what what do you think the balances between the government and pestering big tech companies to took to have to protect thought he had anything that kind of work itself through so I think we have seen these days a good intentions in a very bad way of applied their good intentions so far as we need rules and regulations we need to put our two Deborah our feet on the ground what we're now and it's a fiery is to be to delegate the task of respecting for example human rights to ensure freedom of speech to ensure the right amount to censorship to private actors online service providers in this case and I think that's the right way of implementing this mortal but is it but I mean but I mean that but the shift that the with what we've been told is rather than OSCE fighting for our right to use the same we don't trust the private tech companies to get the government to do but the governor and the very people you have rights to protect yourself against their the ones I'm scared of his trees May's China inspired Kony and clamp down on the internet surely therefore it we don't want them to show swap from private to the government that is missing the point about what the rights are good old-fashioned moral philosophy again autonomy and very much so but that's not the point what we are learning is that we need a more inclusive discussion which all the doctors and some of his annual Aacta which were not table a decade ago need to ever see the table and discuss everything weekend though I have on this ring from the government the private doctors and back there there is a third point which civil society someone mention civic responsibilities we need to be able to build a discussion about that including 4 Jose Maria Rosario

thing to do because you end up in infraction in terms of Italian olive growers saying wait a minute it looks like we get ready we are not happy with that it does open some new choices and might sometimes not be a formal regulatory approach to can achieve equivalents in some other way if one think about Brexit is we became more empirical experimental we spread that will be very good develop things to different parts of the country I am now back in London in the heart of the city the engine of the British economy as financier see it but any programme on the future of Britain has to take very seriously what the City says It's the beating heart of global finance standing outside the Royal exchange where it all began in the 16th century founded by Sir Thomas Gresham 15 16 an open by Elizabeth the first when market traders first came together to do deals over the road is the bank of England during the referendum campaign much of the city was for remain faring Brexit would cost London its global League of late I have to say I've detected a shift and a new confidence that the city can continue to prosper now let's go inside the cafe of the Royal exchange to meet Gerrard lines he voted to leave even founded economists for Brexit I want to ask him can the city do well after we leave the EU might even be an opportunity for the city of London to do more for British business outside the capital is not just leaving the EU It's what you do once you've left them probably the most interesting and positive aspect for the city since referendums the fact that so many of the big tech companies decided to go ahead or continue with their large-scale investment in London because finance and technology becoming very intertwined and now there's a great recognition across the globe that outside of Silicon Valley London is becoming the tech centre but certainly when you look at it from a financial perspective London is already taking and will start on March the same terms of fintech now we need to continue to do that through regulatory environment and through know Brunel where we continue to attract skilled Labour from across the globe I think London is in a very positive position the way I would describe been in the EU was it was like walking the wrong way on an escalator this changing global economy with technology networks and globalisation so much growth coming from across the rest of world was in contrast to the EU which almost wanted to go the other way regulating controlling centralising away from the city in the broader economy you really think that there is the duty and responsibility post Brexit to give back something to some of those areas that voted leave to really change policy shift things in a direction in favour of non London UK I think we need to face the reality of the situation the UK is a very imbalanced economy that was highlighted at the time the global financial crisis the European Commission once every 3 years produces a detailed report of this 263 regions of the European Union 3 of the top 5 are in the South of England 4 of the top 10 in the South of England London and the south-east is probably the most competitive region by a long way off the whole of Western Europe and that's why they need the city in some respects at the same time as the Commission said the UK has a very petrol genius profile ie we have some very underperforming and poor performing regions Northern Ireland West Wales and the valleys Cornwell said I'll not say South Yorkshire we need to always get all the eyes right innovation which I think we do well on more infrastructure spending more investment and getting the incentives rights and the great thing about leaving the EU is that we have the ability to have an enabling environment that addresses the domestic Regional issue as well as positioning the UK global making this programme has made me more excited about the possibilities when I began in these Britain very adaptable country with a long history a outside the London bubble that does seem to be a real determination to get on with it Labour's Caroline Flint clearly thinks there's no time to lose a I'm not for one minute underestimating the challenges as we move forward in maybe 10 years or so before we can look back all honesty and see you how things have worked out but we can't wait 10 years to make the best of it I just hope that we can address small fundamentally the problems of our own making and how we resolve them because one thing for sure is that we leave the European Union we can't blame them any how much is possible once the UK leaves the EU Oliver Letwin says we shouldn't get their hopes up</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

but I really looked into that and the overwhelming discourse of management in the North and mocks story was that the mutual model was finished that the money was just sitting there and could be much better used if it was invested in the global market and the company was free of all constraints and the West this is quite so relevant to ask this institution lasted for 140 years without having profit maximisation as its motive when there was a dividend distributed and then when the profit motive took over it turned to and this is where I do have a lack Sympathy for the management if you look at how they've rewarded themselves I am you you could say that they pay they had quite a high regard for their own brief OK the squeezing point for me is which you accept very high profits if your workforce was well looked after what I'm looking at it as a sort of them historian really it is the way in which for example you talked about it the captain is and and all these things the way it in the end whatever the purpose of the original companies they become financialised them and then the profit motive becomes the dominant thing much more concerned with society was when the state constraints I have an innate suspicion of it because of the way that they have seen it work through time that whatever you do it always ends up in the pockets of the city right to be very difficult to get the balance I to the balance is conceivable but that has to have a representation of human interests the workforce from the locality in the corporate governance so that the owners and management

profits lack of accountability hope that the big tech companies themselves did that give you any pause to think that the the by Morris has just made the sun have always promises to be different it always turns out just the same has some truth to it world first I would like to apologise for being fearless I'm normally a pussy cat were now I think the giant tech companies GoogleFacebookAmazon they got a free pass for a number of years in their foot in it the gestation and they have been incredibly has been incredible concentration of power of course they are now being reined in they're being fined through Brussels and also you saw in Washington said there is the market is beginning to work and as the role of the state is also beginning to work here it technologies liberating phenomena can you have too much profit or all things being better for workers good conditions good regulation I really wouldn't matter no amount of noughts in your profit at the end of your P Nel went with be too many with you can absolutely have too much profit because you could be quite hazy monopoly you could have bought up all the competition I would never argue in terms of of profit maximisation unconstrained it must be within the framework of the law and with state in certain instances taking a view you take anything about the other person's argument more seriously or find did anything surprise you just give you pause for thought Yes certainly I'd like to apologise to my initial response is I wasn't as mirroring the non judgemental should be and I'm just learning this is my first experience of doing this it it makes me think that the engagement really is only just beginning about the reckoning on from the crash actually the reckoning we had in the last 40 years but I think the captors been given free rein to dominate and has acted in many ways of a very lucky way I like to talk to learn more about the role of educational institutions and other institutions in the development of technology and knowledge and and it is not exclusively a result but I definitely think that this feels like a conversation in his infancy not repetition of previous positions of I think the debate is changing 10 years after the crash we're now hearing phrases adopted By people in the city and in new York about profit with a purpose putting shareholder value of have everything oiks making it an exclusive criterion is wrong there has to be other aspects to the question about profit</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

well I'm not sure we need somebody who wanted to leave the European Union is necessarily very representative of the year the mainstream view inside the SNP having a look the the growth Commission report which were expecting in the cost of this morning will attempt to address the deficiencies in the economic case that was presented in 24 team but I still think that it will measure up to that me the that the the areas which is concentrating on economic growth from what we understand appears to rely on more foreign direct investment rather than no indigenous industrial growth on the question of tax there is a large public sector deficit in in the spring the Scottish public sector deficit as a share of GDP is 9% compared to the UK's having 2.4% so there is a substantial gap there and it is unlikely that a convincing case will be produced on how that will be addressed on the question of currency which was really was that the biggest challenge for the Yes campaign 2014 we understand that is proposed that term Sterling will be the currency unit for the next 10 years at the same time as Scotland has withdrawn from the from the state unit which will determine monetary policy so it seems to me to offer as far as the currency is concerned not more independence but actually less well in short term announced the point again miss Neal was making earlier on Yes he did for 10 years so just to have to have stability actually is Beverley open about staying pretty aligned in other ways as well economically with the rest of the UK then you gradually you set up structures an eye on of to some the Scottish bid people wounded but some supporters of independence around the UK that can sound like a sensible approach Yes but if you look at it from the year the Democratic perspective why would you be part of the currency area over which you no longer have any democratic say and it makes you a rule taker rather a rule maker to use the language which has been used again around Brexit I don't think that strengthen Scottish democracy I think that strengthens them the am the sovereign will of the Scottish people think it weakens it so so the best situation is the one we've got which is around a good deal of the devolved Scottish parliament within the UK where we get the benefits of being part of a big single market again in the context of the EU debate we and 4 times as many jobs are dependent on trade with the rest of the UK compared to with the rest of the EU so there is a huge level of economic and monetary integration between Scotland and the rest of the UK which is one of the reasons why it just doesn't make any sense to pull out of it Richard Hannon Thank you the time is 17 minutes to 9 It's the big data protection day we talked the information commissioner earlier he seemed to be trying to reassure small businesses about what the changes would mean what about us the consumers Victoria Fritz is here with more on that a yes does the other part of this equation as net the regulator says it is going to be monitoring the behaviour of the big tech firms the information commissioner told the programme it will be in part up to consumers to police businesses over compliance their droves it is the European commissioner for justice and consumer affairs she says consumers are aware of their new rights well we tried to explain to us citizens in the EU are lying GDP out this important for them and in fact that it gives them back to their hands and there will still that died and our door handle their own deed done to have it under control so if some people still are not out of that I hope that in the short term the course of time they The the understand this is a new area of them what value did consumers really place on their personal information do you think people care enough to take proactive steps to protect it that's the problem the value this is a very high had any Rob full year to organise such protection of privacy a fundamental right but at the same time our personal data became the money infect da-da-da goods which can be monetised so that's why we need people to understand that their privacy is being solved and and Euston monetised by

and I haven't talked to anyone having gone to the till at all some to be crazy but that could have happened for example 100 years ago a 100 years ago issuing a small village if you want your grocer could go there you could buy you could go out you could just put it on my bill Napier later because at that time the growth of new who knew exactly where you are and this is what happened today through technology is exactly what's happening to your smartphone all this might make a bit uneasy if there's no physical interaction between the customer in the shop how secure could it be is a subject that bedevils the whole future of electronic payments Susan Lundergan cyber security is a big risk in any kind of digital transaction in e-commerce and banks were moving into a digital world and what we can see is that hackers are very smart out there and it seems like the companies and regulators are always one step behind and it is a big ask the answer is to invest more in staying one step ahead technologies like blockchain there are harder to hack it will be a big part of the solution some hacking episodes of pasta based on digital technologies were security was almost non-existent companies and banks financial institutions are getting much much smarter savvier about how to encrypt transactions and how to build cyber defences but clearly it is a risk and we will have to continue to invest very heavily and fraud has been a problem throughout history with those coins really gold and silver well that check bounce does the signature on the credits slip match stats on the card in the new world we may move to biometric information a fingerprint or face recognition to verify the deal it's not a problem that what ever go away It's an evolution we struggle between legitimate economy and the fraudsters and dependence on sophisticated technology creates the possibility that the finance sector might face a big new challenge not just from start-up companies like TransferWise but from the big tech giants like Apple and Facebook already many people use Apple pay to buy goods Andrew Lowe I think that these large tech companies are perfectly positioned to be able to take advantage of their wide reach and consumer access to start offering financial services I would be surprised at all in fact in ways they may be already starting to do that simply by helping investors manage their portfolios we learn about stock prices and get an understanding of their ultimate investing landscape so just like the involved in driverless cars and package delivery and other kinds of services to consumers financial services is the next great undiscovered country for them this is what we've seen in industry after industry when the tech companies move then they force their competitors to adapt very quickly It's like a new predator moving into the jungle and tech companies have a great advantage they know as well it's back to the 19th century village where all the local shopkeepers understood which their customers paid on time and which spent all their money down the pub the tech giant's know a lot about our spending habits of course that raises another issue privacy can we trust big companies to handle data safely with some this may be a generational shift people under 30 are happy to share a lot of details of their life on FacebookInstagram and like they may be happy to give up some of their privacy in return for the convenience of easy payments that As the big tech companies to take advantage of another consumer affordable our inertia back to Shaun Haggerty abandoned behavioural economist will tell us that it's really hard to get somebody to act in move their money or two make financial decisions that are easily avoided Quique Ganesha agrees most people find finance very boring and that they would rather not Dutch finance if they could would rather not have to go and talk to the bank if they could they would rather that to have to think of all these things which are quite complex so in general people want to make an active effort</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

of GCHQ until last year as an hour Radio Monte but <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is an agenda when it comes to China what what what is the but the kind of calm dispassionate view of of what needs to be done about Weiwei in the longer term what are your rights and Gordon described very well and there is a bigger picture here leaving aside the arrest which seems to be about Iran sanctions and possibly about trade or on cybersecurity at and my worry is that there is a sort of hysteria growing at the moment about Chinese technology in general and a while in particular which is driven by all sorts of things but not by understanding the technology or the possible threat and we do need a calmer and more dispassionate approach year and Gordon described the cell which we set up it was vetted by GCHQ staff are experts but funded by our way but vetted by by the intelligence services overseen by the National cyber security Centre they publish an annual report and their job is to look at what is actually being put into UK networks of BT and others and see what the risk is whether it's safe and check for these sort of alleged backdoors really worth saying that at no point has this this body ever reported a backdoor militias intervention I think what it has said he's been very critical for always general posture on cybersecurity not taking seriously enough for a poor engineering and we all know what that leads to these vulnerabilities but that is incompetence rather than malice due trust to sell to be able to keep abreast of things into the longer term in other words we can we be confident that if the cell says Yeah this is OK that it is Yes I think the cell has been very critical of its most recent report that it's Bhatti's oversight workings so it's it's the NCSC doing its job I think that's a much better option the ill-informed extremes of well we just allow any Chinese company in into anything everywhere one extreme or we just try to ban everything Chinese bearing in mind that not all technology is essentially manufactured in China these days anyway whatever the brand name on it there is a particular issue with 5 G chosen Yes 5 G is different in engineering terms from 4G there is more processing more data the edge of the network locally to to you the user it doesn't all go back to the centre to the core where it can be more easily overseen so there are different issues and as Gordon mentioned the review going on here led by the part responsible DCMS and and CSE about what security we want and there are all these various solutions one one might be saying we don't want to put all our eggs in one company and one Chinese companies basket and have been the possibility of of total control them there will certainly be restrictions on what they have access to if they are given access a so there are various ways of making of managing the risk factor you will never get it done percent right but the idea is as God the point that we can cut ourselves off from all Chinese technology in the future which is not just going to be the cheapest it has been in the past but in many areas the best is is frankly crazy well that's interesting let it come I'll give it a bit about Facebook we've got a couple moment because of obviously Facebook very much on people's minds at the moment report on Buzzfeed that an impostor account was used on Facebook to drum up support for a migrant caravan that that was very much involved in the mid-term elections in in the United States Sam the the social media company saying is deactivated the account refusing to provide any information obviously MPs here have concerns about Facebook and Anna and trying to take action against Facebook it all what we got to do about Facebook in your view I think in the end it will come down to regulation because as the emails came out this week in the press and reminded everybody here this isn't a kind of fluffy charity Providing free services It's very hard-headed international business and and of these big tech companies are essentially the world's biggest global advertisers that's where they make their billions so in return for the service that you find useful they take your data and and as these emails show they squeezed every drop of profit out of it and the incentive to make a profit out of your data are far greater than incentives to protect your privacy is faced with a threat to democracy potentially Yes I think it is if it isn't controlled and regulated and frankly some Facebook executives have conceded that it needs regulation but these big companies particularly where the monopolies can't frankly reform themselves they will have to come from outside the EU was already talking about doing it and I am sure others will follow home Thank you very much its three-minute to aid sent time for the weather with Stav the near side then buy them suffer Thank you very much good morning tea words a bit of a wild start to the day got

she also worked at Skype and Apple and Elizabeth Linder founder and CEO of the conversation conversational century which the global advisory movement she's previously worked at Facebook morning to you both morning before we get to this specific ideas in runner for has peace and Eileen Burbidge 80 is the case that these firms are already embedded in our lives but never more so than now post lockdown in the middle of the lockdown now absolutely agree on one thing that was emphasised in Aceh is that what we've seen is these companies are providing essential services when everybody has then isolating Holm's all working remotely and simply in keeping to their bubbles we do need products and services that can be provided digitally and through technology and and that's never been more true and then today we also probably means they are more powerful than ever before and it is extraordinary to think that these 5 5 companies we know as the fangs FacebookAppleAmazonNetflixGoogle has run for House says they control more wealth and power than eat Thai economy of France Yeah no that's absolutely true their market power it is incredibly dominant any it's going to continue to grow it comes from how we know some people are referring to this as a 4th industrial revolution which is being digitally led and tech-enabled and it does come from the fact that these companies are providing services that are being consumed at a record pace this by virtue of that though we're seeing that consumers and businesses alike are finding these services to be valued but we're saying earlier providing essential services providing bespoke services customised experiences and to benefit as customers in an enlarged OK but they're their dominance Elizabeth Linder mean some people might conclude from that they ought to be broken up but these calls for for a digital tax are are growing D care did do you understand why they are growing because of the sheer wealth and also the fact they also mobile they can be headquartered in one place and have their profits another well certainly I think the first piece to look at is the way that that the free market itself is starting to take on the tech companies we see all over the News today our advertisers coming together to essentially punished some of the big platforms for decisions they have made I'm content take-down policy and so there is a particular Facebook in particular absolutely but of course you know what is really missing I think in that essay on reimagining the future is if we're going to look at the impact of tackle one of the biggest names one of the biggest stars of the cupboard 19 World has been zero and it's then these companies that previously most of us had not heard of but fundamentally change our lives and I actually have a clip time and connections back into our lives and really meaningful and and powerful way and I think it's worth this we think about your series run reimagining the future it's worthwhile really thinking about the impact that technology has had to make this walk down a small company it's not an argument is it for not taxing of the Giants more heavily I think it's an argument on the competition he said I think it's it's it's a common thread in critiques of the big tech companies to say they don't have any competition by the rise of video conferencing has force big companies to double down against that threat a smaller companies coming in for a large piece of their market share so there is no complacency here in the market Eileen Burbidge it date does feel that in recent years a lot of the good the gloss that used to be on the tech companies has come off whether it is in relation to hate speech or or politics that that there is a desire for them to be responsible and yet there's a frustration with that with that with the lack of means to to make them do that I think that's true but I also think that that's warranted that's reasonable as as companies to grow in power already dominates it's right that we should be paying attention and that regulators policy makers and consumers like ourselves are thinking about unintended consequences and making sure that these companies are behaving largely and in a way that they were intended and just to say on the tax point I largely I agree with much of the Aceh and and the importance of having a think about this because I do agree that the the wealth divide is increasing that we are seeing</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

dictates the humdrum reality so many people these days addicted to their phones or losing their privacy and abusing people online don't even actually know so overall a force for good all for it all to discuss that I'm joined in the studio by Steve Hilton your nerve of course of the director of strategy for David Cameron he lives in California now hosts Fox news show called the next revolution and we're also joined by Leslie Berlin whose the author of a forthcoming book in Britain called troublemakers Silicon Valley's coming-of-age good morning to you both see him Nick while it's good to be here now let's leave first of all do you believe that Silicon Valley is not just creating these corporate giants but it is really transforming society and if so for good or ill I do think that Silicon Valley when you get it out has been a force through the day then we can build their bad that has come in its wake the concerns around privacy in Incan inequality concentration of power these are very very real thing sound when you looked so in Alli you look at the answers that we perhaps me out of the rally in terms of and access to information access to and close people's ability to transmit information think about something like the Arab spring the importance of cellphones in developing economies the biotech revolution our this can be and pass to be put on to the good side of the ledger when talking about Silicon Valley for good or evil and yet Steve Hilton I come here and of course the dangerous the hugest a wide-eyed always creations in the increasingly the stories that emerge from this place on negative for the companies here that's right I think it's interesting that you have got a trend developing in the us which I think even more negative attitude towards these big tech companies then you have been talking about in the European context in the programme and I think part of that is the concentration of power but there's just mentioned I think it's also some of the negative social effects but above all is this and I think this arrogance that the you feel from a lot of people who as ever Williams was saying as others on the show was saying entered into this with good intentions they want to solve problems many of the tech companies he really are solving big big problems we heard about the impossible burger earlier that was a fun story but actually there's a really important environmental a problem there being addressed which is the amount of land and water resources that are taken up by food grown to feed animals we got a rising global population that's a really big problem being solved by the company but what you're seeing in America is an argument that some of these big companies like Google or Facebook to powerful need to be broken up they need to be regulated like utilities because we rely on them so much that's a new trend the danger there's leave for these companies is this isn't it which people may take for granted the miracle of this instant communication of social media and so on and may increasingly focus on the things people talk about and I think this isn't really for the good of us all the planet It's your corporate profit line and there's always the danger that that exact same I'm gas makes this type of innovation possible and sailing can be swept into a form of hearing and it is very eerie pointing and I think that part of what we're seeing now is and in addition to this what the West sees us brightening concentration of power in these companies and the right sees this summer but platforms for perhaps the Liberal ideology that is not something they would want communicating on all sides coming against these companies I said at the time is long past when Silicon Valley with seen as a so this scrappy underdogs kind of fighting the be quite operations or not something Steve that means that some have even suggested that the real answer to Donald Trump is President Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook they have any certainly behaving like that even including a trip to Iowa classic pit-stop on any presidential journey earlier in the year and none I have no idea whether that's his values

who are not in the European Union such that you effectively can create your own circle rule creation and your own and your own trade conditions now I think that's probably too optimistic if we think about the world as it exists there's to live with that the regulatory soup prizes the economy big enough to export their rules beyond their own borders just by share market sites so you want to sell to them you converge that's the European Union and the US China is China's going to become one that is probably not there yet so for the UK going forward it's probably going to have to choose slightly who want to align itself with certain specific areas it might be able to the trailblazer if if if it's targeted and and think it through otherwise it's probably don't have to choose in reality we are going to stay within the EU's geography in its regulatory gravity field for quite a long while no matter the deal we have with the European Union search service Uber is so what you're saying is no matter what the final outcome is let's say we were to take what people call the WTO option centre we would still find ourselves like a kind of planet in orbit around these other bigger planets forced to assess take account of what they were doing and essentially to shape our own rules to suit them and absolutely end and the EU is probably one of the most successful exporter its own rules so just give a few examples when it comes to chemicals policy The China is following suit with with with the EU's approach as his career there is one example that the Americans really don't like but when it comes to making whisky if you want to sell in the EU you have two aged in barrels for 3 years and the USA they can do it quicker if you're called whisky and the USA can do it quicker but the reason they really dislike is that Russia had taken on board this rule as well as Israel that I was talking earlier about how a summer and has hinted that some of the major changes taking place out of place in the world economy anyway you got as far as talking about the rise of China and I imagine there's also in terms of the kinds of goods that will be traded or the kinds of services will be created in it in the new technological world if we were by one mechanism or another to stay in the European Union how will the EU's own trade position have to be developed as a consequence of those changes I would describe as described the biggest change is a change from a kind of rule based global economy to one of strategic competition where big country's are competing for control of economic growth for control of resources and access to resources and controlled the rules of the game and what what China is doing is investing hundreds of billions of dollars of of government and state funding to building these huge infrastructure routes that give it control of resources and permitted to to continue on its economic growth and that means that that the world economy itself is is is shifting it It's much more difficult for a country on its own to compete in next set of rules so if Britain does stay within the European Union at least it gets a bigger place in their strategic competition but that said the European Union itself needs to recognise that their new world of strategic competition at the moment the two big tech giants in the world Aly Baba from China and Google from the United States the both competing to hire quite often European engineers but it's quite important that Europe does not yet have a tech giant because that is the economy of the future the control of data the control of artificial intelligence and the ability to use those to generate growth are gonna be one of the terrains in which the new strategic competition takes place and are we in Britain helpful towards creation of the possible creation of such a giant such a position absolutely I mean Britain and some other European countries have been very good at generating small start-ups and technology space start-ups which almost immediately bought by Google and other tech giants either in the United States or now increasingly it is China that is looking in to do that I think what Europe's going to need to do is take a strategic view on this and stop thinking deal by deal and start thinking what does the tenure planned apply her case that's so that the situation would face this evening we were to stay in the European Union Let's talk a bit about influence in the world and political influence that Sam at the UK long had a key strategy I remember telling Blair talking about John major talk about be at the heart of Europe Moss somehow dodging the bits of Europe we what we did like why do we have that strategy why was that what we wanted to do I think the theory behind it was that in this in this sort of global world with these big powers to have sovereignty and the and in this sense I understand sovereignty is being the ability to change the wind that the to respect the winds but

but could a ruinous in a sea of irrelevance and decline those words of the former Prime Minister Tony Blair in the forward to a new report for is Institute for global change called technology for the many advocates a series of new policy approaches it comes a time when the US secretary of state is warning of the prospect of global change of an altogether more alarming source another proxy war in the middle East Saudi Arabia and Iran battle for influence this time in Lebanon Tony Blair executive chairman of the Institute for global change joins us in the studio morning to you and people may be surprised to hear you talk about this subject of technology at all I think the Brexit was his obsession his absorption why why now why this report frenzied on the brakes another sad and remain completely opposed to Brexit but if we do we don't do this the revolution in technology has not been matched by revolution in public policy making and anxiety I have is that that this new wave of technological change AI automation big data is gonna change the way we live we we work we think how we operate as a society and it is essential for our country to be able to access opportunities to mitigate its its risks so what this report does is set out of comprehensive plan as to what the government should do in terms of public policy in order to make sure that we do access those opportunities and and do it in a way that allows the country to make progress by the way I also think that if you show people you can chart a way through all of this change with some optimism that takes away some of the feelings of alienation I think gave rise to breaks now there are two sides it seems to be in this report is what government can do Let's begin with the first what government does as it were positively the infrastructure programme you recommend to get high-speed broadband and paying for education and training throughout people's lives whenever they need it rather as it were just waiting for them to actually attend some institution this is a lot more money you want the government spent Yes I think relation to infrastructure if you got no option if you want to be ahead in today's well you've got to make that 45 GMT structure with universal coverage priority what we suggest on the on the training and skills is you give up trucks a front of funding that is then repaid over time linked to ability to pay I think you require huge change in the way we look at technology in relation to the health service in respect of education in respect of government as a whole and we also suggest that you need at a specific government Apartment governed digital technology staff and run completely different from traditional government Obama now the other side of it it seems to me in this report is a tougher message about what you call the big tech platforms she mean the Facebooks Twitters the Googles and so on it which seems to be advocating regulation and tax you talk about new public interest obligations on these companies do you mean effectively that left to themselves they will not do what's in the public interest I think whether they do that or not their size and the scale of their impact is such that night I think don't go quite as far as some people do say you should regard them as like public utilities but I think public interest obligations are going to be a necessary part of the debate you can debate what those are but I think the first principle to broach is the notion that when you have these and platforms the dark and frankly more powerful than anything we've seen in the corporate sphere for a very long time and they do it impacts so many different parts of our life there's got to be some semblance of public interest the go alongside their market position just one specific the economy front cover this week suggest to him that social media is a threat to democracy you see them in that light you want to regulate them to make sure they're not well I think I think there is a serious point here which is the interplay between social media conventional media is often creating a situation in which is very hard to have a proper democratic discourse if there are a whole lot of manipulated or fake News stories that are surrounding the public debate so</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

offences has not in South Wales been a wrongful arrest it which is legal case continues as does South Wales police use of facial recognition the forces soon to trial is on cameras mounted officers uniforms and as we've already heard the Metropolitan police are now set to include it in their Arsenal of law enforcement tools that's worrying to University of Essex academic Peter fussy who monitored the Met's trials and says accuracy was an issue on at least one of the days when he observed there were 42 occasions where the computer issued an alert that an individual walking past Cameron was on a watchlist on 8 of those occasions can say with absolute confidence the computer was right on 8 of those times the computer should learn human said the alert was credible that individual was apprehended in stray their identity was checked and to correct matchplay town of 40 take now that's not to say all the others were wrong for instance for individuals lost in the crowd we don't know there were times where and offices in the van said somebody wasn't credible match they could have been 3 never write the them tiny team overnight but you can say with certainty I had 42 were absolutely correct or watchmaker that to see a higher figure you Yes it seemed surprisingly low given claims of and technology providers and a lot of the face that put into the technology assistant commissioner Nick F grave defended the Met's decision to go ahead we feel confident we are now in a position where we've got a strong legal mandate a really robust set of operating principles and Broad support from the public to use it so we feel now is the time to start to make operational deployments I think even if there's one arrest we would otherwise have made of violence or serious criminal but wanted either while about the court that success I anticipate more than one but every single one of those is making the city just a bit safer and that's entirely the purpose of this new technology to help us help officers be more effective at bearing down on serious and violent offenders home office says it fully supports these police files which says have helped identify locate and arrest suspects in more than 50 cases were wouldn't otherwise have been possible they also point out that officers time not spent searching for people can be spent elsewhere throughout the programme we've been hearing about the watchlists that are essential to these facial recognition systems sometimes they come from police databases sometimes private companies CCTV but privacy campaigners worry that because of social media we are now providing a treasure trove of facial photos of ourselves And patchy early is a researcher for Amnesty international they been alarmed by recent news reports a private companies scraping people's photos on social media sites with apparently nothing to stop them but it is a wild West at the minute we have an utter lack of regulation and a lot to lose in this space within mean that the rise of such Super tech giants when they hauled this much information on individuals there's very little you I can do to stop are images being part of a database if we even know that they are being used on such databases in the first place and I think that feeling of helplessness he harbours an individual is really concerning that they will grow in the big tech companies many of them have called for state regulation but at the same time their licensing though fish recognition products that they continue to sell them News them and develop them even if you don't end up on a watchlist your photo posted online could be used to train facial recognition systems to get better at spotting faces previously kind of images uploaded say 10 15 years ago we had no idea of the emerging technologies that would come about in the next decade to me it's a mess issue of consent it is very difficult to contact the individuals on that database for consent understandably but also know that there's a huge ethical concerns around how could anyone nor that the image was used to train systems and saw one and honesty are not alone in their bleak view of the legal regime most people we spoke to this programme believe the current regulation urgently needs to be either clarified or replaced entirely there are now calls for a temporary halt to facial recognition use especially in public areas while the rules sorted out several US cities already banned in public places including San Francisco home of Silicon Valley supporters of a moratorium

sufficient Labour party in the end the day is going to half to make ground now it's made a bit of ground and further ground at the expense of the Democrats among remain voters all well and good but of course Labour party spent Most of the last week not talking about Brexit but trying to persuade voters on the leave side of the argument to come the Labour party on the basis of its domestic agenda the truth is that the polls suggest that this is not having any cuts for tall Labour share of the vote among leave voters a Grand total of 14% is exactly the same now as it was a week ago and that's another clear message from the polls equally for Liberal Democrats another absolutely clear message a lot of them think that they can forge ahead by taking away remain voters and the Conservatives well I have to say the polls suggest but so far gained their strategy is not doing much good there was this is Johnny began a bit of a Twitter sensation over the weekend he gave an interview in which she said the chance of a Labour majority was when you give us the words will want to use I remain virtually approximately zero made a crucial word her Labour majority I'm not saying Jeremy Corbyn's chances become Prime Minister 0 am saying his chances of doing so with the majority of virtues we should have to remember the crucial thing about this election is there for us so far as Brexit is concerned is its lead is clearly a binary choice either we get a Conservative majority and in the wake of that majority Boris Johnson will be able to pursue Breck's long lines who proposes at the moment that is the direction in which the polls quite firmly pointing or perhaps we get a hung parliament and given that Labour Liberal Democrats the SNP and the Greens and Plaid Cymru are apparently all on the same page and wanting to have a second referendum then presumably that is what would happen in the wake of a hung parliament and although the Tories the moment enjoy a comfortable 13 point lead in the polls one crucial thing we now don't know is how far the Tory lead has increased simply as a result of the fact that the Brexit party is now standing down and half the country and for the Tories are doing are gaining more votes and seats they are going to win anyway it won't it it won't make much difference Professor John Curtice plenty still to come Thank you the time 18 minutes 9 big tech it was once glamorous everyone wanted to go to Silicon Valley now those times seem a long time ago it is often regarded as poisonous were becoming increasingly aware of how the industry is reached a position of unhealthy dominance commercially but also about psychologically run for power has written a book called Dame be evil the case against big tech she is facing financial times columnist Matt paper as well as on CNN as well as she sends your morning tea pair did to come we start with the commercial dominance first one get off the and psychological stuff in a moment that the part of the case against big Tech's simply there are too few companies to pass from Islamic absolutely in my understanding figures I came across from researching his book is that about 80% of corporate value is now living in 10% of companies and most of them and a handful of big Silicon Valley firms the to know about GoogleFacebookAmazon and mean these these companies are really like the 19th century railroading they go where they build they build the track they are everything on the track that period of course in US history led to a big break up an entirely new way of thinking about anti-trust I think maybe a tipping point there with Elizabeth Warren as president will see ID you know she is she's down the ball but Interestingly I actually see some bipartisan agreement in terms of regulating big tech Democrats typically care as laboured as here about compressing corporate power making sure the big companies don't control to Maj but Republicans are worried about small business and about the local ecosystem in one of the fascinating things about these firms is that they're supposed to be great innovators right that's the mythology they come and go Raja's and invent great things well most of these companies actually invented one or two great things about 20 years ago many of them taxpayer funded of course taxpayers didn't get their kind of that that's another conversation but now you have black sounds where nobody wants to start up something in these fields can go into Because all the deed which is the real oil of this kind of surveillance capitalism practice practice but big tech firms it's not been ring-fenced already the problem there were two problems number one the politicians are got to buy lobbyist on behalf of these come indeed number to Frank he didn't always understand well and that's crucial and there again I see so many parallels to post 2008's financial crisis no I covered that my last book was all about that and you go into Washington and you see these lobbyists come in and big tech is now the number one alarming but in terms of GoogleAmazon and is the biggest lobbyists in Washington there are also over in Brussels trying to control things I'm sure Londoners well</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

club's training ground the paper's editorial argues that the complete lack of openly gay footballers is caused by bigotry is still rife in the game and calls on clubs to kick out home phone big players now the Gunners now 13 minutes to 9 how we used the immense potential of virtual reality the intense sensory experience can immerse you in a different world thanks to a headset the Stanford Professor Jeremy Valence and believes that VR is far more psychologically powerful than any other medium he's written a book called experience on demand what virtual reality is how it works and what it can do for those who haven't and virtual reality imagine that instead of watching from the outside Europe inside the movie the scene response your body so when you walk forward objects get bigger if you train heads some towards someone their voice give Flower everything response your body it's 3 cities saw every look there's things going on there's not only side but there's a specialised sounds sounds move across two years and sometimes there is even virtual touch were you can feel vibrations on your hands end and sent as well so it's more like sensory experience where you feel as a view inside the simulation and is that the future of movies the example you used then in what other areas within the next 10 years might we all experience the are part of our daily lives rather than something we search out so I've been doing for rallies and elite 99 is and what I've seen in the last 20 years is for the last 3 years there's now in the United States at least 15 million of these systems out there in the UK there's millions as well this is new for us so it's it we have never had millions of millions of people inside a virtual reality for some people for example Ireland thought had Veli it is going more slowly than anticipated so some of the big technology companies they thought it was gonna be in every single living room this year or next year and moving a little bit slower than that but this upcoming year you can see it in movie theatres where you get to go into our kids and fuel It's like there are athletes were using it to train and that's not just for the professionals are now down to the younger school levels well there are employees that get to communicate instead of having face-to-face conference get to see an avatar each other and have these virtual meetings there's lots of applications that are coming I think we are still a few years before in every single home but the multi sensory part of it what is the effect on that what does it do to us if we have a virtual reality experience as opposed to feeling strongly about something after we read a book or after we watch a film basically the summer a lot of research when you do a virtual reality experience the brain tends to treat that experience as if it were real also not perfectly that is if it's an actual sprint every single time but one of the guidelines I asked listeners to thing About is if you're doing a virtual reality think of it not as immediate experience is that when you're watching TV because removing the body and the motor cortex of the brain becomes activated we tend to treat these experiences a lot more realistically than a typical media experience so it is more powerful our research has shown that if you have a virtual reality experience for example you learn about climate change and an intense way you're experiencing first-hand and you're walking through floods in Europe actually feeling your body what the future will be like compared to climate change that experience is going to change your motivation to care about climate change to volunteer towards climate change is more powerful sprinter changes not just about his mind at and equally you could use the same technology fit the bill could nude to to immerse people in in an experience that is not for the public good perhaps even in what feels like to take life of course if you use your to give people experiences that are designed to make them feel worse about themselves or even feel worse for others there's no theoretical reason why that would also change behaviour which is why we should be regulated control notices that we think is the inevitable consequence United States the us Supreme court has ruled that with virtual reality is free speech I very recently thrown event at Stanford University where we had a number of people from the government we had the number one and number two people from most of the big tech companies in Silicon Valley and I wasn't asking for government regulation what I was hoping is that we can come up with a set of guidelines where companies can come together and said given that the media is so different than other media and the effects are so powerful can we agree as a community that as technology and research and academic and government community are the standards of things that you might not be located doing PR but you couldn't

and I mean it's interesting look at the context of Brexit I had a story about the car industry and the Dutch investment and actually we want sector we want to increase investment your customers have pulled us we prefer us to invest this is not about this and as of Watts's your base cos you're running costs are too high not you're not you're kept the not capital schemes this is how much you pay people how much you're charging customers to our yet well if you look at our are based costs and prices I know we've got the third lowest prices in the country after we have delivered this plan they would still be the third lowest prices and I think no one sings It's very important to be clear in this plan we reduced debt in this plan not your are investors have taken no dividends tall last year this year or next year for the following 5 years is de minimis dividends is all about investing for the needs of our previous set of Thames water the Australian this meant McCoy took about 4 billion \u00a3 in dividends over the previous 10 years before the current ownership you are you just basically recouping with higher costs well I am reducing different prices which is of what is putting its finger on the think reducing debt is something which we want to do and after the customer should have to pay for their if McIlroy's take dividends but our customers are shopping for our customers are actually helping us to invest on the priorities that they have asked us it's about improving network improving services and dealing with the challenges of climate change and growth that really concern them do you think this determination as politically motivated because we have the threat of nationalisation at the under under a Labour government also Michael Gove has been very very strong honest do you think of what has followed is not being an independent regulator I don't think that that will actually end your as Rachel said we are in the middle of a process and we need to really work together I want to understand the basis of of sports critique but when I listen to the political environment when I speak to MPs the Mayor of London etc is all about you need to invest more and this plan is about making that investment Thank you very much Steve Robertson chief executive of Thames water I think Dominic its 9 minutes tonight it was inspiring it wasn't a secret it was just more Market research says as Facebook about the revelation that it had been paying teenagers to install an app on their phone which were recalled everything they did with if it was sent or received over the internet including their own private messages some it is evidence that Facebook can't be trusted with people's data Caroline brothers is chief executive of the chemical brothers inject some data education consultancy company was the first chief data officer for a large organisation Nato network rail welcome to you Thank you what about the Facebook defence that it was clear what people were doing they were downloading an app it Tolbert what it was doing they do it voluntarily if they were young they had a parent concerned as well I think it's interesting situation because I haven't actually seen Facebook terms and conditions for this particular incident but you look at terms and conditions what's happening regularly I've seen terms and conditions for 40 pages long and I think we've all got to happen just clicking on them because we don't really want to spend all our time reading through all the information the companies have seen a really ethically aware about this kind of thing provide summaries of what they would do all the give a details actually schools through rather than give you all the details one of the complaints made about big tech firms that they get all data for free even if they were actually paying for is reserving two teenagers know more about how you live your life from in favour which is fantastic but I'm a parent myself I think we put it in a different context if somebody walked up to me in the street and said please can I follow your children around can I watch everything they do listen to every single conversation and in return I will give you 20 dollars as a parent I'm pretty sure my answer would have been no and in this particular instance that's what those parents accepted was what happened to their children to the answer more consumer awareness different ethical code for companies like Facebook legislation I think it's both scything for organisations like Facebook or companies like them the need to be very very clear with their customers with stakeholders on what they are using the data follow and as consumers I promote a lunchtime promoting higher awareness of what is happening to your data you don't get services for free you are actually paying for a service with your data or in this case at the moment Facebook paid them to be able to have access to our data as long as you're doing it in good conscience and you know what you're getting yourself into then that's fine too transaction what's to worry about some might say didn't actually want Brenda's get in with top whatever what they want their regime</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

and silver well that check bounce does the signature on the credits slip match stats on the card in the new world we may move to biometric information a fingerprint or face recognition to verify the deal it's not a problem that what ever go away It's an evolution we struggle between legitimate economy and the fraudsters and dependence on sophisticated technology creates the possibility that the finance sector might face a big new challenge not just from start-up companies like TransferWise but from the big tech giants like Apple and Facebook already many people use Apple pay to buy goods and low I think that these large tech companies are perfectly positioned to be able to take advantage of their wide reach and consumer access to start offering financial services I would be surprised at all in fact in ways they may be already starting to do that simply by helping investors manage their portfolios we learn about stock prices and get an understanding of their ultimate investing landscape so just like the involved in driverless cars and package delivery and other kinds of services to consumers financial services is the next great undiscovered country for them this is what we've seen in industry after industry when the tech companies move then they force their competitors to adapt very quickly It's like a new predator moving into the jungle and tech companies have a great advantage they know as well it's back to the 19th century village where all the local shopkeepers understood which their customers paid on time and which spent all their money down the pub the tech giant's know a lot about our spending habits of course that raises another issue privacy can we trust big companies to handle it safely with some of this may be a generation Shift people under 30 are happy to share a lot of details of life on FacebookInstagram and the like they may be happy to give up some of their privacy in return for the convenience of easy payments that allows the big tech companies to take advantage of another consumer affordable are inertia back to Shaun Haggerty abandoned behavioural economist will tell us that it's really hard to get somebody to act in move their money or two make financial decisions that are easily avoid it Quique Ganesha agrees most people find finance very boring and said they would rather that Dutch finance if they could they would rather not have to go and talk to the bank if they could they would rather not have to think of all these things which are quite complex so in general people want to make an active effort into trying to find a new payment service a new bank account a new way to transfer money and that's the reason why for example and zone or Ali Babar can be very successful in this space because it already owned plants the or do on the customer journey you already do things with them Ali Baba is a Chinese tech company that operates a bit like Amazon It's already set up an internet bank and recently made a bid for money grounds a cross border payments service and Amazon is itself moving into lending business the tech giants have a great advantage over their rivals and finance information and slowly they are expanding their operations into the financial sector but because of regulation they may not offer the services on their own the brand name you see may be that of a tech titan but the infrastructure behind it may come from traditional bank the finance sector might find itself in the role of the service supplier competing to help tech companies deal with customer directly does not become a role that earned huge profits Derek voice shook I think a lot of the profits will go away with a genuine way of this into mediation in financial industry through technology through online platforms for lending for saving for investment advice David Pitt Watson of the London business school thinks the prospect of a low profit future should make the sector go back to first principles typically we haven't thought about the finance industry from the point of view of what is its purpose in the first place what we've said is let anyone go out there and compete and markets will end up with a good solution and look markets often do end up with very very good solutions but you need to be awfully careful in those situations where the incentives are wrong and where you have this asymmetrical information because they don't end up necessarily giving the customer the better deal and that's what looks like what happened in finance it is possible that the industry might have left it too late to change Quique Ganesha had taken in the energy there would be a bit like what happened in advertising 10 or 15 years ago you had some very very large</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

problem Rana with politicians trying to shrink the size of the financial sector is that is something that ever gonna be the top of the agenda politicians he decided he wanted Orwell is a great point I mean I think the situation the US is arguably even worse because we allowed Salmond political lobbying and the amount of money the poor in Washington from wall Street are just stunning and in fact their arrival on by the tech sector and as judge points out these tech platform firms are themselves becoming monopolists extracting round accelerate and in the case of the US Congress has largely borne out by the large political lobbying groups the in many cases they even buy up the academics and experts that inform the public about these topics sell it is a deeply entrenched problem It's taken 4 years to get here I think it will take a long time to get to the place I do Think Josh that our political system is kind of addicted to financialisation after all after the 2008 crash we saw corporate tax receipts fall off a cliff and government have to go into this round of borrowing and cutting in order to make the books balanced think politicians the government can actually take on financialisation or rather the risks of doing so too big for the I think the dependency has developed between governments and the financial sector partially around this conception that we have a limited amount of spending power worries about the budget deficit and the austerity narrative in reality the way you get sustainable economic growth is by investing directing finance and public spending into innovation into those areas of the economy that will create long-term growth for that you need a specific kind of finance new patient finance sometimes you need more risky versions of finance and actually the public sector for example state investment banks tend to be better at creating a kind of finance and the private sector which is much better coming in at once it's clear the profits to be made sort of venture capital models say in the UK we don't have a state investment bank we're quite unusual economy not having that and with that Brexit meaning that the EU funding might be leaving us some interesting debates happening about maybe creating one in UK how did we get here in your view what happened to our economy to lead to the point where so much of it is financialised I think the key turning point was the mid 19 70s and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates way had essentially restricted capital flowing across borders and that allowed regulators and central banks that have control over finance and where it flowed in the economy so we used to have what is called credit guidance policy where banks would actually be told by central banks you must lend against this sector use it was exports manufacturing strategic industries and actually credit flowing into mortgages or financial assets was repressed it was described by economists as financial repression in very negative terms but actually that period from 19 50s to the 70s Lewis fewer financial crises was less debt was high levels of employment that has been since so really that was the key change in the 19 70s why should anyone care about what the bankers getting up to it is easy to buy a house you can get on with your life why should you care well you know the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis I point out that we are bailed those guys out there you know that was are tax money went to bailing out these bankers and it could have been put to many more productive uses of only a handful of them had suffered any serious consequences I think that's something that has resulted in some of the poorest politics we see now so we should ask Caroline well I think we should care and mean because we might not be able to buy a house or even if we do in our house our kids might not be able to buyer house in an economy where so much growth is dependent on ever increasing house prices driven by a banking system which mainly lends against property that is not sustainable economic system and it's not one that will produce great said even if we feel comfortable the likelihood is it will come back to bite our children and run DC this all exploding any time soon you know I'll give us a damning statistic first of all there's more debt out there in the world with more debt than there was before the 2008 crisis but looking at the financial markets relative to the real economy financial markets are now 4 times the size of global GDP that's crazy they become the tail that wags the dog and when that happens history shows that you're very likely a financial crisis and ultimately recession in the next episode will be hearing more about the companies that have benefited from financialisation And in the trillion-dollar companies will be asking if the tube the weather should be broken</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

shows perhaps the power of these platforms so move on now to find light which is it leads to this amazing bit of research from Nikita Argo while from University of Oxford and co-author of a study called what Facebook goes down ethical and legal considerations for the demise of big tech obviously we're talking about the the way that big Tech's a big part of our lives and some of us are reliant on it including businesses Nikita Mark Zuckerberg was up before Congress summer as well the CEO of AppleAmazon and Google all part of this and just hearing which will be talked about there's been some discussion us about possibly breaking Facebook up into smaller pieces but I've not heard anyone talking about what actually happened if it closed altogether what made you think about the demise of Facebook your research Yeah so we treat this as a thought experiment and through that to experiment and try to understand what impact the spec cars and our society so Yeah we ask a question you know what would happen if Facebook went away and our analysis led us to as you see in the paper a kind of picture of a company that is so systemically important in our society whether we want it or not that breaking up might not be the only thing we can do that if it all and instead we might need to start thinking of them as more infrastructural goods public utilities need to be regulated in that way yet these ideas are generated quite a lot of attention in the media some newspapers rated up with headline suggesting that Facebook was too big to fail which obviously allude to the the banking crisis I know you didn't like the headline digital and why it is important to you that this is not your conclusion most important to emphasise that too big to fail is a public statement It's not saying that these companies in our case Facebook granted as many the big banks are too big to fail and therefore should be protected at all costs what we are saying is that we need to acknowledge this systemic and and interconnectedness and scale of these companies and think of ways to mitigate the fallout where the company to fail to act in an addition to find ways to and heard it to prevent companies are becoming bigger and that for these these consequences of failure is becoming more catastrophic Yes Shane and obviously Facebook is way more than social network now was and how deeply embedded is in modern society not only in the Western world around the world clearly Facebook is trying to access different markets for example in India it it tried to sort of Bella some of the gate by a little bit like in the West Google us for many people a gateway to the internet as the primary way you access the internet through Google search engine and Facebook I wanted to do something similar work kind of had a portal that was that was free and it it meant free internet access for poor communities in India have rebelled and through Facebook out and now Facebook trying again to a partnership with local operator called Geo again in Africa it's doing something something similar were trying to sow Bennett suffers as the gateway and and so yes I think for this community you could argue Facebook but to disappear completely Yes mate he reduced access to the internet in the West you know we're all pretty reliant on WhatsApp their other messaging services bee Gees but it would be it would be pretty uncomfortable or what some might disappear tomorrow having said that I think there are other companies that that may be more and better infrastructure go show how powerful all these companies become exposed what go across all the stories talked about this week is the way that these companies have built up to be such a high status in our lives now kind of the regulation is only starting to have to potentially catch up with them very sadly that is all we have time for this week Thank you to all my guests if you like to hear a longer version of this programme you can find on

was Hannah Sander and now the weather tonight a band of rain will push northwards across the UK company by unseasonably strong winds over Northern Ireland and western Britain as storm Ellen tracks close by rain will become increasingly confined to Northern Scotland later with skies clearing behind tomorrow after a dry and bright start showery rain and strengthening winds will return across the West eastern parts will stay largely fine and warm but it will be breezy in the south-east may see the odd sharp shower as well Friday will be another unseasonably windy day with the risk of gales in the West there'll be sunny spells and a scattering of blustery showers for most with some longer spells of rain for a time in the north and West turning cooler for the weekend with further

been the vulnerability Kevin Manila's things I don't think the burden should be on the consumer to worry about security and privacy Isla my view of this is where the kind of wild West right now a lot of that like probably we were with packaged food in 19 fifties 19 60s where you don't really know what the manufacturers doing and has manufactured the book but this is the solution to that problem was to start putting ingredient labels on things and have that be regulated right and then once you give for consumers transparent reliable information they can make choices about whether or not they want to buy things as they start making choices about whether or not they want to buy things manufacturers become a lot more responsible magically because they can't so if it is a challenge there when when you can buy things in a global market place over the internet the regulator's job he's certainly got my new much harder well I am very pro regulation of private security and I think that the the symbol of this wild West but we live in right now is this this and use a licence agreement have to tell a lie every time you use a new product which is just read the terms and conditions if you do look at them they're written by lawyers basically make sure the company doesn't get sued so when you talk about private security internal things question we should ask is do you trust Google you trust Facebook do you trust Amazon and I think most people listening to this programme will be like no 3 titles would put up if you have a microphone in your home that is listening to everything saying are aware they may be they may be able if they really wanted to do it and any your mind in your and Jews alike agreement that you read very thoroughly before you check the box saying read it probably says they can their minds I think it should be it should be very explicit what is being captured Was not being captured what is being done with that it's not being done with that they get caught doing inappropriate things with these things the penalties have to be very busy because we're catching them on wine 1000 occasions we have to make sure that any live there really any time in world history when we should understand we really can't trust these big tech giants with the information It's now Caro's work for Rolls-Royce you worried about the engines and security in the ability to get into them so and clearly operating securely in the context of be working is it is absolutely critical for our organisation we are highly regulated markets to be working some of the most challenging markets from a security perspective we are also an organisation that a lot of people look Catton are interested in seeing if I can use so tactile is a highly sophisticated customers so we take it we take a profoundly seriously have got much time as because I'm interested in this is how it affects the Labour market and whether it requires more skilled from people or fewer skilled last word to you Kevin you as the inventor of the the name internet of things have you thought about the big society it well or all technology helps the human race thrive we have more people than ever before are living longer but lives than ever before and that's that enabled by technology and the internet of things is just the latest technology is going to lay enable more people live longer more fulfilling lives and I think Labour the Labour question is is part of that I am I'm a radical I don't believe people should have to have jobs I think would be great if we could eliminate the need for jobs and people spend more time with the families of painting painting or writing poems and and insists it is ever since agriculture was invented we have had this very sort of notion that most of the suspects spend most of our waking lives like working for somebody else doing something we don't want to be doing and if we can replace that with automation that great as long as we do something like universal basic income that make sure that everybody can still survive so However very interesting future ahead of us because we are that automate away a lot of work and we need to get used to the idea that is not actually a bad thing that's a good point at which to end this conversation we need to leave that my guests Kevin Ashton you just turned the man who coined the term internet of things a also reverse

should be approached be I think I think the Europeans when they began this dad privacy GDPR which is obviously very familiar in the UK another summit which Americans was beginnings step of recognising that individuals have a right to their privacy rights to their dad and rate to how that that is utilised for commercial purposes the way that was implemented in and you can click on your accept cookies you down doesn't really move the needle much I think legislatures around the world need to kind of go back to square one and just like they did at the beginning of the 21st and 20th century in creating a category called the trust and Mark Wright had to be invented legislatively and then regulate it somehow new framework for big tech Yes and that requires a lot of effort and will require significant energy and and Matt just briefly then the idea that break them up it is it is really not gonna solve these systemic issues I mean that's just nonsense we have these problems but for me this is not an issue of data are these weird I know I will tell Key questions is a question of power and the Senate hearing where merchants won never put early recording of a merchant saying am I as restricting from selling their products at a D-Day issue that's just power Mark Zuckerberg said you know I didn't allow my competitors at festival Facebook tools that's just power to break these guys knew break their power we have a competitive market this is really awesome all we know about this for a little relief for 100 years you know they you know look at this you and I and others say identical garbage otherwise I wouldn't say I am not saying what you are but break them up to 20 pm if you're not proud so complicated and data this is about how we know this is about power I watch the hearing Ray heard merchants talking about how they get getting colour all the time I talk to small business people were cut out all the time about power mass is that I would be Matt star Zachary caramel Thank you both very much listen to that Professor Scott Galloway and Scott disagreement there But I just wonder if anything concrete going to come out of this hearing we will see a push for more regulation and move seen a tweet tonight from President Trump if Congress does not bring fairness to big tech which they should have done years ago I will do it myself with executive orders yellow would be difficult this is gonna be DOJ era to see action and I think good yards that the there is likely a case filed against Google in the fall a lot of what happens the other 3 as a function of whose elected but there is definitely a movement for word that a lot of these problems would in fact be solved wanting was uncovered in Europe in your town the discussion is that of if Facebook for example broken into 3 minutes the ideas of what those units in order to get advertising might in fact say we are going to ensure that there's no content that depresses teens maybe put educating her identity verification as a means of differentiating the service and right now these companies really don't have the impetus to differentiate their services on protection for teens or concern for the Commonwealth has when your monopoly there is little reason to do anything the delay and hard to escape so I do think that one of your guests points competition would likely suffer a lot of these problems and very briefly you talk about the result of the election if there is a President Joe Biden what difference might that make well here comes any trust Elizabeth Warren Michael has a seat in cabinet I think did the Democratic side of the house would would very much surer Democratic president would be likely to pursue I think any trust against 3 other for most likely regulation of the app store without for because Hogan Howe again many trusts unlocks value doesn't hit it would be harder to understand how you break about all but there's there's gonna be is something I think is deafening happen It's this is a question of scale and be bigger scale and by administration Professor Scott Galloway thanks very much a day after the prime minister said there were signs that Europe was experiencing a second wave of the Cove a pandemic the government has been in talks with the devolved administrations about possibly crossing more countries of the safe to visit list Spain was the first country to have a two week quarantine reimposed on arriving or returning travellers today one of those returnees the transport Secretary Grant Shapps arrived back from his coat tails Spanish holiday to explain why the government has decided on its course of action was simply had to act and not to act would be a dereliction of duty and people rightly would set a course why you might not active why I got this information on doing anything about it we had to act when we did the figures since of show why that this

product as a thing that they use are expected to interact with Laura needed and they haven't got your opinion on this the I'm putting out there's a cynical body that is done deliberately but not under liberally it means that our agreement is pretty much irrelevant well I do take your point crowd because sometimes it does see you in the way in which some of these provisions in terms and conditions and documents are presented that it almost seems like evasive manoeuvres in terms of trying to track down specific parts of information and privacy says so for example I totally take prisoners quaint now agree with that that they do fall between a rock and a hard place and that they have all the information they have to provide what happens information who is being shared with the purposes the safeguards and one but at the same time they need to make it clear and accessible and legible to the ordinary user and even tailor it for example for users their children at the same time it's Just so interesting how for even small to their huge big tech firms how easily accessible certain information on how very inaccessible other piece of information can be said for instance even with some of the big tech companies won't name names but it it is quite interesting how for example if you want to exercise their rights if you finish if you want to make a complaint getting access to that particular person that particular department can be notoriously difficult and for some say smallish medium companies in all these obligations and all these compliance requirements have become very onerous and quite expensive they start to automate these things start to use a system whereby they are taking out press now because it's saving costs at the same time meeting compliance but at the same time it can be incredibly difficult for you to get a response if you are an individual who has a complaint are what I should really get going about whether we should be caring about the data protection since the dying who what why is it important why why should we care about it we can about because of how much did you put out there we put so much data out there about ourselves consciously and unconsciously and if you look at the Genesis of the law if fathers human rights laws say you look at where the special categories of Deidre things like health religion sexual orientation and lifestyle it's about characteristics about ourselves that we can change and potentially having those characteristics having a detrimental affect on us and I think the principle behind and protection are and privacy is laudable and just not sure that the GDPR as the right piece of legislation to do up for as ReGen you been involved in the side of regulating this sort of thing what you say about this is a we got it anywhere near right I think but two things I think it is a very complicated piece of legislation but it's a very complicated area and it's like saying the world will not send a rocket to the moon why isn't really simple well is not really simple and I think the technology is complex but the other thing I would say about this area of legislation his when you look at something like the the GDPR which is our current new regulation is not a done deal it is not a final frontier Here's the GDPR this is where tens what actually has been created as a mechanism to move forward to keep changing to keep developing during the day absolutely and what we have seen as well the way the courts have dealt with this has been a willingness by the court to actually push the law forward so we think that a case called cut stay her which was a gentleman who wanted his name taken of search results his case went through he succeeded that brought a huge change was based on a statue on statutory law legislation but the court pushed it forward to take on a new dimension site think it does look at the laws it is static thing you say was Ich takers has it protesters there was a development that people had something if they got something embarrassing or awkward are unhappy in their their past they have it removed from search engines were not discovered by search engines depending on the public interest in keeping their so I'm sorry cloud the weather in a murky past you like to have taken away I can't give you an the guarantee that that will be OK with a dodgy programmes are presented as a and as the Alex's easier for large companies to cope with these regulations and also to keep ahead of them but it would be for smaller companies generally yes I mean it in so far as each company only needs Yes one named data protection officer for instance obviously your company to people that Ins fully half your company is working on that

I have an innate suspicion of it because of the way that they have seen it work through time that whatever you do it always ends up in the pockets of the city right sale would be very difficult to get the balance I and the balance is conceivable but that has to have a representation of human interests the workforce in the locality in the corporate governance so that the owners and management of sport people other than the shareholders one point he challenged Morris quite fiercely she said you mention technology once but then the same time one big arguments keep having that excess profits lack of accountability hope that the big tech companies themselves did that give you any pause to think that the the point Morris has just made the sun have always promises to be different it always turns out just the same has some truth to it well first time like to apologise for being fierce I'm normally a pussy cat were now I think the giant tech companies GoogleFacebookAmazon they got a free pass for a number of years and that further in the gestation and they have been incredibly has been incredible concentration of power of course they are now being reined in they're being fined through Brussels and also you saw in Washington so there is the market is beginning to work and has the role of the state is also beginning to work here it technology is liberating phenomena can you have too much profit or all things being better for workers good conditions good regulation I really wouldn't matter there were men of noughts in your profit at the end of your he knelt with would be too many with you can absolutely have too much profit because you could be quite hazy monopoly you could have bought up all the competition I would never argue in terms of have profit maximisation unconstrained it must be within the framework of the law and with the state in certain instances taking a view you take anything about the other person's argument more seriously or find did anything surprise you just give you pause for thought minds Yes certainly I like to apologise to my initial response is I wasn't as mirroring the non judgemental should be and I'm just learning this is my first experience of doing this it it makes me think that the engagement really is only just beginning about the reckoning on from the crash actually the reckoning we have seen over the last 40 years I think the captors be given free rein to dominate and has acted in many ways a very ugly way I like to talk to learn more about the wall of educational institutions and other institutions in the development of technology and knowledge and and it is not exclusively a result but I definitely think that this feels like a conversation in his infancy not repetition of previous position with I think the debate is changing 10 years after the crash we're now hearing phrases adopted by people in the city and in new York about profit with a purpose putting shareholder value of have everything Boycs making it an exclusive criterion is wrong there has to be other aspects to the question about profit what better self doubts the are bits of Varane positions the cliff edge of what we think of when they come up we feel just that little bit of a clenching you feel when you're in a debate you know you're not on your Most certain ground got a life of self doubt so this is how our Howard is the big question was dominated by life is how good News is the domination of Capt without retreating to States centralisation but essentially how my life has been and then looking at ways in which the natural sociability goodness of people leads them to come together and how to create what I call incentives to virtue rather than incentives to Vicente one of the key issues to emerge from this conversation is if one was interested in reducing the profit motive from its highest Walt to one among many other medications which include purpose goodness skill and excellent that had his that represented in the structure of the firm had was that represented in the reward structure the have peace of mind clearly after the crash we had to have a debate about financial capitalism and the

anyone Brexit time where you actually want to deal with the rest of us absolutely would rather have withdrawal agreement bucket if you like I could describe as a basket of market basket I think of neglect and vegetables from the garden good it all in it together so it's much easier implementation process so it's it's it's smooth flow but if for some reason that is the case the keys to have all that the critical bit of legislation in place so that nothing legally falls off a cliff we are seeing all the preparedness in practical terms in terms of in flights and medicines all those activities Calais saying they went from the practicalities coming together of the everyone it is going to work in their inner could be a coherent way together because nobody wants to see both our side of the water or indeed on the other a any kind of blockages said those things all seem to become one of the frustrations I've had over the last 6 9 months is that businesses particularly Erm have been chatting saying we don't know what to do and the government has been very slow to share what has been a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes and now suddenly it's all coming out is great but I think there's been frustration which hopefully will now ease last season we're woefully underprepared for a no deal Brexit everyone can see that the EU can see that as well one of the reasons are negotiating positions been so weak and it's It's unbelievably incompetent way the whole thing's been handled Andrew Ledson and a Hunt have said that there is going to have to be an extension just because of the sheer weight of legislation that goes through I think the key piece of legislation is the withdrawal agreement implementation Bell is one of the politically legally and constitutionally one of the most important bills we'll ever have to look at in Parliament because it will give forced to withdrawal agreement including things like the transition period which by the way says we will be under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice for the entire transition but do we really think colleagues like Bill cash and other Brexiteers will just allow that to sail through without amendments that bill will be like a Christmas tree with my board ball after ball of amendment hanging off from Brexiteers so the idea that they will get it through in 5 minutes is for the birds he around St Athan them and he agrees with me is as a brolly now an urgent order on grounds that it is in fact February have a look what should be the talking point tomorrow the publication of a long-awaited select committee report into fake news and the use of our personal data by political campaigns even more pressure on the big tech companies since that got underway on a number of France at Caroline what this report that said this is the and and Damian Collins is indeed a lot of work on this he is the chairman of the culture media and sport select committee has been looking at this for over a year now and basically we get a clue as to his game in this because he raped and did an article for the Telegraph this morning where he talks about the irresponsible nature of social media and the fact that there is nothing really we can do at the moment to bring him to book to make sure they're not putting misleading content on their websites which people then pick up as as as being fact now what's also interesting about this report is actually as part of this his interim report which was at out over the summer one of the things he was really keen to look at was about these threat to democracy that this fake news was having and he really wants to see much more of an investigation done into that and whether or not there were any interferences into any of our electoral events over the last couple of years and of course that comes from what happened in America the murder inquiry said very very topical but the main focus of the support we think is going to be an organ be back having in independent regulator underpinned by some kind of code of ethics which we can have teeth to say to these social media companies actually you can't get away with this if you do try and do this he will face fines he will face penalties Sydney also been doing some work on reforming elect Law and transparency in political campaigning got an all party parliamentary groups seeking to clarify party funding E in the light of that's a tall order how far you go of we haven't quite established yet but we're in the process we've we are what we want to do is launch an inquiry into transparency campaign finance and also transparency in the illicit use and harvesting of personal data and I think we've got wild West out there at the moment It's really worrying situation you've got the national crime agency looking into Arron banks the source of his funding 9 million \u00a3 given to leave dot EU Ukip the biggest political donation in history we don't know the source of the you got Cambridge Analytica in they've got leave dot EU and vote leave both being fined by the electoral Commission frankly fines they received art in the cost of doing business so we've got we've got a toothless watchdog and we've got an explosion of the use of technology army of Russian bots being used to affect the debate on</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

proximity to each other for a substantial period of time that design by digital wing of the NHS was being piloted on the Isle of Wight but now it's been abandoned in favour of a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google there was an onslaught from Lib Dem peers starting with Lord Clement Jones I hope the Minister understand the anger at the government and the NHS 6 exes sheer incompetence he didn't approve of what he called the government's go it alone policy the time the government just accepted the fact we can't develop are now and go straight to adopt even available

Bethel concentrated on expressing gratitude but they say a profound thanks to those at NHS facts NHS digital and others who have worked so hard on the NHS app they've made phenomenal progress and their hard work is hugely appreciated another Lib Dem Lord Strasburger felt heads should roll all I must say this fiasco will have to face consequences which ministers will have the decency to stop trying to dodge and Lord vessel didn't think anyone needed to apologise I cannot disguise from the noble Lord how complex and challenging the issues are that we face in this area there are challenges that the sum the best governments in the world are wrestling with and they are ones that have not been overcome in many territories I'm extremely proud of our achievements to date and look forward to further achievement in the future he told peers that failed at had cost 11.8 million \u00a3 so far Labour's Lord Browne said he too couldn't understand why they had to be a new tracing app in the first place this said the business case or use case continues to require a different design the implementations that exist already the health minister said there were a number of challenges the most profound one is our need to use technology to tackle local outbreaks and without that local information but knowing where the new cases have originated it is very difficult for the government to achieve that task and we look forward to working with Apple to try and define the use case around that the Conservative Lord Duncan was until recently a business Minister I've listened to the remarks

nations of the United Kingdom Ethel said he was aware of the other Nations were looking at their own options but he hoped they all adopt the same solution Labour's lady Wheeler complained that the government should have involved local authorities in tracing system can the government should reassure the house that they make sure councils now have the necessary powers they are calling for us to be able to fully respond to a local outbreak hotspots the Minister agree that local councils were pivotal the Conservative former culture Secretary Lady Morgan focused on the involvement of Apple in new tracing system she wondered if this had led to a broad reflection in government are being influenced all big tech companies in savings spheres of our lives and the need has prompted immediate desire for proper regulation of these companies now to be brought to bear Lord Bethel said the UK had benefitted from partnerships with big business However it is undoubtedly the case that the government has its own agenda and it is important that we work closely to champion the needs of the British public and that is where most of our biggest interests lie a crossbench or independent peer Lord Patel had a broader question can the Minister say what the government pets to manage if there's a substantial include a pay increase in new infections app I with the Irish times Lord Bethel said

surprising went to companies Facebook and Google control nearly 60% of global online advertising revenues was a duopoly healthy for journalism and local democracy he asked Jeremy Wright himself replied this time and told the shadow culture secretary that this was one of the most serious problems facing his department he will understand what I want to do is understand this issue properly before I start to set out any decisions tall and frankly it is one of those issues where I believe cross-party discussions are useful I hope we'll be able to have those discussions together perhaps season life rather than on Twitter Tom Watson like many MPs is and enthusiastic user of Twitter social media tool Mr. Watson said he appreciated the Jeremy Wright was new in the job but he'd been hoping for more reassurance Nyunt the go government as a whole is either unwilling or unable to deal with the market dominance of the big tech giants on this side of the house we believe these companies are running rings round government's legislators and regulators there was no better example of Batty's said than the chief executive of Facebook<person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>cowardly refusing to appear before the Commons committee inquiry into fake news so does the Secretary of State agree with me but the time is now right for new single powerful regulator to take on the big tech giants and address this huge imbalance of market power Jeremy Wright replied that whatever actions the government took had to be properly thought through the chair reasons but support they will be substantially attacked he knows that Secondly I hope very much that they were an example to the world how to do this and it will only be so if we thought through properly designed them carefully so that they are robust under scrutiny he has my reassurance that is exactly the process I intend to engage Jeremy Wright is known as the legal Eagle he was attorney general before the reshuffle he has much less Experience in digital matters of fact but critics may wish to highlight in the coming weeks and months Rachel burn now during that session the new culture secretary also gave a warning that the law could be changed to force developers to ensure new housing developments have high-speed internet connections he made his comments after Labour's Caroline Flint highlighted the scale of the problem in her Don Valley constituency nearly a third of my constituency over 30 towns and villages have very slow access or no access to all teachers call me about the car Mark homework night young people buying new housing debate on a new housing development find they're not connected onto fibre broadband this is an acceptable I hope the Secretary of State and he's new position will take some time to speak to myself and other MPs across the house who feel that their communities are being let down Jeremy Wright said she was right first of all people are coming to expect that they will have good quality broadband connections and they have a right to expect that because there are many areas of activity need to be carried out now online and the second point she makes around new builds it is important we don't build new houses without decent quality broadband connections or the capacity to make that and she will understand that I want to look carefully at what measures the government might be able to take up to and including legislative measures if necessary culture Secretary Jeremy Wright you're listening to today in Parliament on BBC Radio 4 with me Sean Curran now don't forget you can keep up with what's happening at Westminster by subscribing to our podcast you can also download and listen to the programme on Radio 4 website still to come MPs are just back from a break but some are already worried about when the next one will be particularly as one of the newspaper said a pithy headline this is peak at Christmas is cancelled but first there was a dispatch box debut for Geoffrey Cox this morning who was appointed attorney general last July Mr. Cox is thought to be one of the richest MPs in the Commons on account of his outside earnings as a barrister he received a welcome cheer from his Conservative colleagues Labour's Nick Thomas Symonds wondered if he was fully behind the drive to introduce transparency into tax havens an essential part of our action against economic crime is tough action internationally including a public register of beneficial ownership of companies based in the overseas territories in may this year the Commons approved plans to make the British overseas territories such as the Cayman Islands reveal who owns the companies that are registered there the change came after the government backed down rather than risk losing a vote on the tax havens Mr. Thomas Symonds harked back to Mr. Cox's contributions to the debate when he was still a backbench MP the its any

leaving people to their own devices tends to lead to more growth on the sinister thing a reality growth people isn't it means more intervention more restriction on people's minds the economic growth it is Germany speaking good thing I think something else which not you is that often the most capitalist fordham of balls countries countries also very pleasant places to be a year he never have clean water but the reason cos they've got clean out the reason they got clean water is that people everyone various foreign ministry said actually we shouldn't have unfettered growth we should also think about things like the quality of life for the quality of what the policy of water which you think you understood in those all doom And of people calling for regulation delighted there are some regulations but completing our rivers and all I can think at least one important or remove the that's a lot of it is that would free market the don't really very much you're a bit of legislation kings of a borrowing as from the talk was States and the waiver free market is huge interventions like um hard time come that the time country planning act which excludes which means that 90 % of Britons live on only 10 % of the land in Britain it's the nimbyism that that involves has caused immense suffering timber to took an awful lot of people that's the real problem on the legislation mucking but I sense that what you're doing really is that we don't really need to have a conversation about the good life for the good society this is this is a way of smuggling in a form of elitism if we simply allow free markets to do what they do in a comic grows to do what it calls the we will end up in a better place in things a little boring about these kind of philosophical question just like growth on to the would go I I I disagree entirely I think we need to argue but the good life I think the problem is on the subject of nimbyism the that um nimbyism that has created the green belts and stone and and crowd as all and towns and cities in this country has created enormous suffering it is against the good life people's good people cry I know I know her family close to me where they've got 3 a black kids who live in a tiny room let all flat and the smallest of them who was in a cot actually about that drain the courts but they can't become for freedom we have done cos we can't straighten his legs it right that's a real suffering and mountains and I think that debate but the good life really needs to be had to the disaster that many preserving natural beauty is essential to I think is an immense social good thing it's time for the we don't have nearly enough speed to having people at the door when a bomb but Peter the Dutch side to think about Spot actually Arkansas is made up with very flat very large rectangular industrial subsidised farms there are very many that's the wrong they said people are campaigning to know whether the accused of the news of know that that the the we don't have nearly enough beds look like post and packed and I think we should have very many more life has a packed omission been near towns and suburban areas where ordinary people can go in and showing them and another and another on a box attached and will as a Catholic islands islands the anyone in a you one bit we can design but with carparks it hatched you can always find a bit not seminary exactly the country said has been widely in Honolulu if you like lovely countryside but nobody there which is what you're talking about them go and buy a huge tract of countryside and enjoy it the plenty people live in the countryside the question is do you not think any the is worth preserving on less seats at what's happened is like the displaced socialist desire to cut it is he's a brilliant inquest of people in need but not with many other concerns about the possible disadvantages shall we see the country Gen I think would would your tumour preserving the countryside you mean what we have now which is the nationalization of land use and because of the power of lobby groups at the council for the protection of rural England the vast majority of people have been hemmed into towns and cities and they don't see any countryside for most parts on the consent and towns and cities actually was green people ordinary people Sienna lives are it are choosing to live a hard on the brakes as twice in the immigrate towns and cities enabling me to touch snow the were ridiculous idea I mean you didn't have to a smaller proportion of people in Italy and Ireland live in urban areas because they don't have the the los imported green belts and we've had since he and 2nd world war about 60 % of people honestly a much bigger lovely countryside by the way they look for countryside you don't have to exclude people from somewhere in order to be a default which we Border Farid be pretty as it happens the people bang on about preserving the countryside he never was depopulated like

leaving people to their own devices tends to lead to more growth on the sinister thing a reality growth people isn't it means more intervention more restriction on people's minds the economic growth it is Germany speaking good thing I think something else which not you is that often the most capitalist fordham of balls countries countries also very pleasant places to be a year he never have clean water but the reason cos they've got clean out the reason they got clean water is that people everyone various foreign ministry said actually we shouldn't have unfettered growth we should also think about things like the quality of life for the quality of what the policy of water which you think you understood in those all doom And of people calling for regulation delighted there are some regulations but completing our rivers and all I can think at least one important or remove the that's a lot of it is that would free market the don't really very much you're a bit of legislation kings of a borrowing as from the talk was States and the waiver free market is huge interventions like um hard time come that the time country planning act which excludes which means that 90 % of Britons live on only 10 % of the land in Britain it's the nimbyism that that involves has caused immense suffering timber to took an awful lot of people that's the real problem on the legislation mucking but I sense that what you're doing really is that we don't really need to have a conversation about the good life for the good society this is this is a way of smuggling in a form of elitism if we simply allow free markets to do what they do in a comic grows to do what it calls the we will end up in a better place in things a little boring about these kind of philosophical question just like growth on to the would go I I I disagree entirely I think we need to argue but the good life I think the problem is on the subject of nimbyism the that um nimbyism that has created the green belts and stone and and crowd as all and towns and cities in this country has created enormous suffering it is against the good life people's good people cry I know I know her family close to me where they've got 3 a black kids who live in a tiny room let all flat and the smallest of them who was in a cot actually about that drain the courts but they can't become for freedom we have done cos we can't straighten his legs it right that's a real suffering and mountains and I think that debate but the good life really needs to be had to the disaster that many preserving natural beauty is essential to I think is an immense social good thing it's time for the we don't have nearly enough speed to having people at the door when a bomb but Peter the Dutch side to think about Spot actually Arkansas is made up with very flat very large rectangular industrial subsidised farms there are very many that's the wrong they said people are campaigning to know whether the accused of the news of know that that the the we don't have nearly enough beds look like post and packed and I think we should have very many more life has a packed omission been near towns and suburban areas where ordinary people can go in and showing them and another and another on a box attached and will as a Catholic islands islands the anyone in a you one bit we can design but with carparks it hatched you can always find a bit not seminary exactly the country said has been widely in Honolulu if you like lovely countryside but nobody there which is what you're talking about them go and buy a huge tract of countryside and enjoy it the plenty people live in the countryside the question is do you not think any the is worth preserving on less seats at what's happened is like the displaced socialist desire to cut it is he's a brilliant inquest of people in need but not with many other concerns about the possible disadvantages shall we see the country Gen I think would would your tumour preserving the countryside you mean what we have now which is the nationalization of land use and because of the power of lobby groups at the council for the protection of rural England the vast majority of people have been hemmed into towns and cities and they don't see any countryside for most parts on the consent and towns and cities actually was green people ordinary people Sienna lives are it are choosing to live a hard on the brakes as twice in the immigrate towns and cities enabling me to touch snow the were ridiculous idea I mean you didn't have to a smaller proportion of people in Italy and Ireland live in urban areas because they don't have the the los imported green belts and we've had since he and 2nd world war about 60 % of people honestly a much bigger lovely countryside by the way they look for countryside you don't have to exclude people from somewhere in order to be a default which we Border Farid be pretty as it happens the people bang on about preserving the countryside he never was depopulated like this we are ruling the countryside the pro right now with killing 8 but what about your care of your moral consensus into the sinn Fein stained big tech countryside analogy it's been a year and

advertising during the EU referendum campaign the interim report was due to be published on Sunday but on Friday it was leaked by the former chief of the vote leave campaign Dominic Cummings who refused to appear before the committee the report talks of a democratic crisis founded on the manipulation of personal data with the relentless targeting of hyper partisan views to influence voting one illustration that came in a series of Facebook adverts from vote leave and be leave campaigns targeted voters during the days before the referendum but any supply to the committee by the social

disgraced former Bishop who was later convicted of being a serial paedophile have been detailed the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse in letters written between 90 93 and 2001 the Prince

at the inquiry Prince Charles expressed his deep regret insisting ball had deceived him our correspondent Jon Donnison reports Peter ball was a powerful figure within the Church of England for decades but in 2015 the former bishop of Luis and also Gloucester was jailed for sexually abusing teenagers and young men 12 years earlier he had been cautioned by police and resigned his position the inquiry

between Prince Charles on ball in the 19 nineties at that time he says he was unaware the former Bishop had been cautioned for gross indecency Fiona scolding QC senior counsel to the inquiry read out extracts of a letter that Prince Charles wrote to ball in February 1995 I wish I could do more I feel so desperately strongly about the monstrous wrongs that have been done to you and the way you've been treated Prince Charles went on to tell ball that the public perception of the former Bishop was based entirely on lies invention speculation and sensation in a letter from 1997 Prince Charles appeared to accuse one of Ball's detractors of being a ghastly man and threatened to see him off the inquiry also heard about a house that the Prince's Duchy estate had bought or rented the ball and his brother after his resignation as Bishop the Prince wrote to ball 1996 regarding the house again his words were read by Fiona scolding QC I prayed the Duchy will be able to find something suitable for you both in due course I long to see they've settled somewhere that's the issue and give you peace and tranquillity and not too far from here so you can come over on more easily in a letter submitted to the inquiry today Prince Charles admitted here occasionally sent ball and his brother small gifts of money</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

about this is unethical because although we might find it rather politically frightening this these are the this is the business model of Silicon Valley and is the business model of Facebook this targeting is not some sort of abuse of the system this is what this is the this is how they work this is what they do now course it has been a long-standing goal of marketing for 130 years said trying get closer and closer and closer to particular consumer groups and profile them evermore my new ways and of course this takes things another stage further but I think that there been in this direction for a while exactly but that's the that's the West as the incompatibility problem more we say one thing to use that to sell Prowse's holidays and cars and stuff but these boots are being used increasingly to sell politics too and I think is absolutely right it is to see the modern big tech firms as the descendants of of advertisers rather than tech firms really the that that's that's their business model is about keeping people hooked in is often about exploiting emotions because emotions what worked in advertising but politics becomes too emotional and too much about sticking messaging stops being a sort of calm rational debate we'll need to have with zero and to pick up on that because are one thing that we do have coming in in a couple of weeks time is a new European law which is known as the GDPR the general data and regulation and what I would like to say is the the the young this law was drafted in 2012 by the European Union and it was targeting X expressly the big internet platforms like Facebook and the type of behaviour that but we've just been hearing described by Jamie and well the the use of predictive analytics use of data profiling and excess Citigroup excessive use of these techniques by these companies was targeted by the EU and there were some particular red flags that were held up during processing a law are and these red flags were things like the Austrian lawyer Max Schrems who went to court and won against Facebook the young Edward Snowden revelations by Edward Snowden of of mass surveillance and that was what this law was designed to target and these red flags would have helped us to predict a situation like this coming IQ and Jamie find some reassurance and yet apps actually Yes I mean the GDPR which will be hearing a lot about in the next couple of weeks and everyone the Really boring but it turns out to be really important I think is going to put the brakes on it will see are all big companies find work arounds of course we will see how well its import less say in the book this law which will cause inconvenience to some especially small companies does have to be Strictly enforced because we're not talking about now talking about the next 10 years with producing more data all the time the album isn't getting smarter it is important to us now there are a lot of paradoxes around here on Belgian a good band if Iter we split 7 years ago was 7 years ago the internet was being praised widely praised for its liberate true potential end of the clip here this is the BBC two programme just reminders of the heady days of the Arab spring this year the Arab world erupted as a generation of young people no longer prepared to suffer in silence rose up against a heated despots their country me is Jonty we can but the way these revolutions began court the world off-guard the weapons the activists of the so called Arab spring when guns and bombs the internet and mobile for the first time in history a world changing events were recorded power by our man and woman on the Street charge you will mean they are we having social media representatives from saviour of democracy now but now you're hearing this much more critical the good News as well possibly a corrupter of democracy the erosion of democracy said well I wasn't in that clip used the word the weapons of this revolution because now we hear about Facebook been weaponised and someone said its units it said that the Arab spring had a big influence over the alleged Russian information warfare techniques of of of of trying to subvert democracy or destabilised Moxey using social media because the Arab spring demonstrated how much can be achieved with so little now that is in some ways while destabilising phenomenon but it's true that if you look back at the books being published in the years running up to 2010 said there were books like glacier keys here comes everybody or free</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata
