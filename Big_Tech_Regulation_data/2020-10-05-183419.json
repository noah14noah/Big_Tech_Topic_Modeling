Artificial intelligence, the rise of bitcoin and the changing nature of global tax are critical issues. What are the key pieces of information relevant to anyone working in a large corporate organisation? Global tax will continue to evolve  International tax avoidance has captured the public imagination, and regulators are also beginning to act, as the recent European Commission ruling on Apple in Ireland, and Australia\u2019s proposed digital tax ably demonstrate.  According to David Bradbury, the rules that govern international taxation, or cross-border taxation, have been in place for around 100 years, and it\u2019s time they were updated and addressed. </p><p> David is the Head of the Tax Policy and Statistics Division at the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration at the OECD. He is among key global leaders focused on what is known as base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).  In 2013, the OECD began building a community of countries concerned about BEPS, which is a strategy multinational corporations use to avoid taxes.  \u201cFor some people this is about the big tech giants,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, to be honest, the issue is broader than that because digitalisation is not just about a handful of companies, it\u2019s a process that is changing the way most companies operate.\u201d  To address BEPS, a consensus was reached among the 44 OECD and G20 countries and in 2015 the OECD published the BEPS project, which outlined strategies and identified risks as part of a 15 point action plan.  \u201cWe now have 114 members operating a forum on the basis of consensus,\u201d he said. \u201cPrior to the BEPS project, no such forum existed.\u201d  Bradbury said that there is a groundswell of public opinion urging governments to ensure that just as an individual goes to work and pays taxes, so too does a multi-national company also pay its tax liability.  David Bradbury is speaking at WCOA 2018 on November 6 at 11:00am as part of the session \u2018Global Tax Leaks, Tweaks, BEPS and Bots\u2019 Taking the next steps with artificial intelligence  According to Natalie Nguyen, the profession is set to undergo a transformation as businesses scale faster and automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks.  Natalie is chief executive of AI firm Hyper Anna, an AI-powered data analysis tool used by many of Australia\u2019s largest financial institutions. Using AI, she said, will see accountants move from spending their days generating and maintaining reports to a workplace where the focus will be on improved customer service and compliance reporting.  \u201cIf we\u2019re looking ahead two years, we see accounting roles will be more focused on planning, risk management, capital management and performance monitoring,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will spend less time doing all the manual tasks and a lot more time interpreting the information and understanding what it means for the business.  Natalie also said that communication is going to be a key skill for accountants in the future. Interpreting what the raw numbers mean and communicating that to business leaders is going to be vital, as will having a good grasp of the business landscape.  Increasingly, she said, an accountants role will be less of a technical expert and more of a trusted advisor.  Natalie Nguyen is speaking at WCOA 2018 on November 7 at 11.15am in the session titled \u2018AI for Finance \u2013 Faster Data, Insight and Agility\u2019. Understanding Cryptocurrencies  Professor Niall Ferguson, historian, commentator and the author of 15 books, including The Ascent of Money and The House of Rothschild, recently gave a seminar to the Bank of England on the 2008 financial crisis and the reactions to it that reverberate to this day.  As part of his presentation, Niall mentioned that bitcoin is part of the major challenges ahead for the current fiat-based currency system. \u201cThe novelties, the things that will really matter ten years hence are still relatively small in scale,\u201d he told the Bank of England. \u201cWhether its bitcoin or cryptocurrency generally or the massive revolution in online payments that is being achieved by the big Chinese tech companies, that\u2019s the financial system of the future, and it is still small enough not to be systemically important in 2018.\u201d  He also noted that regulation is coming for crypto-currencies, and observed that \u201cwhen there is no regulation, then the rogues are very quickly on the scene.\u201d  Professor Niall Ferguson is presenting a keynote at WCOA 2018 on November 6 at 10:15am. He will be speaking on the topic of \u2018Financial upheavals challenging global economic order\u2019. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN962823920181105</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNB-W551-DXCW-D3TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 5, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Frank[1] The New Yorker published an article yesterday - 'The Terrifying Potential of the 5G Network.'[2] In 2018, Robert Spalding's job as senior director for strategic planning at the National Security Council included studying ways to insure that 5G can be made secure from cyberattacks. He seemed more than qualified for the job. In his interview with The New Yorker, he provides intricate details of why we should all be freaking out over 5G regardless of who installs it. </p><p>His warnings also go beyond cybersecurity risks:'What is existential to democracy is allowing totalitarian regimes\u2014or any government\u2014full knowledge of everything you do at all times,' he said. 'Because the tendency is always going to be to want to regulate how you think, how you act, what you do.' More from Spalding:'I wasn't looking at this from a policy perspective,' he said. 'It was about the physics, about what was possible.' Even before the introduction of 5G networks, hackers have breached the control center of a municipal dam system, stopped an Internet-connected car as it travelled down an interstate, and sabotaged home appliances. Ransomware, malware, crypto-jacking, identity theft, and data breaches have become so common that more Americans are afraid of cybercrime[3] than they are of becoming a victim of violent crime.Uh-huh. This has been reported many times[4] before by many sources.Adding more devices to the online universe is destined to create more opportunities for disruption. '5G is not just for refrigerators,' Spalding said. 'It's farm implements, it's airplanes, it's all kinds of different things that can actually kill people or that allow someone to reach into the network and direct those things to do what they want them to do. It's a completely different threat that we've never experienced before.'So the 'Race for 5G' is for 'all kinds of different things that can actually kill people' and Spalding isn't the only one to say so. Fabulous.'It was meant to be a nationwide network,' Spalding told me, not a nationalized one. 'They could build this network and then sell bandwidth to their retail customers. That was one idea, but it was never that the government would own the network. It was always about, How do we get industry to actually secure the system?'Many other articles and at least one book[5] have been written about how the American government and telecom regulators[6] seem to have no right to ask the Telecom Industry to do much of anything. Telecom expert, Bruce Kushnick[7] has written A LOT about that. Even before Spalding began working on his report, the telecom companies were rolling out what they were calling their new 5G services in test markets around the country. Activist Post has reported about 5G 'rollouts'[8] before. Many Americans have been fighting this[9] in their communities. (See also 1[10], 2,[11] 3,[12] 4,[13] 5[14], 6[15], 7[16], 8[17], 9[18], 10[19]) Last summer, New Yorkers[20] reported becoming sick after 5G was installed. Their pets were sick too. Some were putting their homes up for sale. Last year, the first 5G court case was won[21] in England but not after it had been installed, people became sick, and some women delivered stillborn babies.As the Clemson University professor Thomas Hazlett told me, 'This is just the transitional part. You have various experiments, you do trial in the market, and various deployments take place that lay a pathway to something that will be truly distinguishable from the old systems.'It sounds like Professor Hazlett is saying that telecom companies are allowed to perform various experiments on the American people - regardless of the risks. Unfortunately, experiments on the American people aren't new and the apologies[22] always seem to be too little, too late.In the meantime, the carriers jockeyed for position. A lawsuit brought by Sprint and T-Mobile, which was settled[23] on Monday, claimed that A.T. ...'s 5GE service, where 'E' stands for 'evolution,' was just 4G by another name.Just part of the experiment Spalding describes more greed-driven behavior by the Telecom Industry and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Ajit Pai, which seems to have led to Spalding being canned from his job. The 'Race for 5G' then continued without his interference. Huawei, a Chinese manufacturer, is currently the global leader in 5G technology and has been accused by many sources of being a conduit to Chinese intelligence.In an op-ed in the Washington Post[24], the Republican senators Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, and John Cornyn, of Texas, characterized the company, which is funded with subsidies from the Chinese government, as a Trojan horse that could 'give China effective control of the digital commanding heights.' [] The Times of London[25] reported that the C.I.A. has evidence that Huawei has taken money from the P.L.A., as well as from branches of the Chinese intelligence service. Australia, Japan, and New Zealand have joined with the United States in banning Huawei hardware from their networks. So far, though, the Trump Administration's campaign to shut out Huawei is finding limited traction.Freaking out yet?Huawei equipment is cheaper than its Western rivals and, in the estimation of researchers at the Defensive Innovation Board (DIB), which advises the Secretary of Defense on new technologies, in many cases, it is superior.I feel sick. Regardless, banning Huawei won't secure the networks[26] anyway.Even in the absence of Huawei equipment, systems still may rely on software developed in China, and software can be reprogrammed remotely by malicious actors. And every device connected to the fifth-generation Internet will likely remain susceptible to hacking.FCC chairman Ajit Pai recently announced that the commission will block[27] another Chinese company, China Telecom, from operating in the U.S. due to security concerns. Even so, the 'Race for 5G' is still on[28] despite the fact that it 'can actually kill people.' That's because the FCC (See 1[29], 2[30], 3[31], 4[32], 5[33], 6[34]) and seemingly even Trump are still determined to win this insane race[35] even while The FCC is being investigated for collusion[36] with the Telecom Industry[37] and lawsuits have also been filed against them regarding forced 5G installation (See 1[38], 2[39])In October, Trump signed a memorandum on 'Developing a Sustainable Spectrum Strategy for America's Future.' A few weeks later, the F.C.C. auctioned off new swaths of the electromagnetic radio spectrum. (There was another auction last month, with more scheduled for later this year.) Opening up new spectrum is crucial to achieving the super-fast speeds promised by 5G.The New Yorker finally mentions worldwide opposition due to health risks from 5G.Deploying millions of wireless relays so close to one another and, therefore, to our bodies has elicited its own concerns. Two years ago, a hundred and eighty scientists and doctors from thirty-six countries appealed to the European Union for a moratorium on 5G[40] adoption until the effects of the expected increase in low-level radiation were studied. In February, Senator Richard Blumenthal[41], a Democrat from Connecticut, took both the F.C.C. and F.D.A. to task for pushing ahead with 5G without assessing its health risks. 'We're kind of flying blind here,' he concluded.Flying deaf, dumb, blind and sweaty[42]! There's research[43] that has proven 5G is harmful[44]. [embedded content] \ufeff There's also that previously 'unthinkable surveillance potential[45]' offered by 5G:A system built on millions of cell relays, antennas, and sensors also offers previously unthinkable surveillance potential. Telecom companies already sell location data to marketers, and law enforcement has used similar data to track protesters. 5G will catalogue exactly where someone has come from, where they are going, and what they are doing. Paired with facial recognition and artificial intelligence, the data streams and location capabilities of 5G will make anonymity a historical artifact. In China, which has installed three hundred and fifty thousand 5G relays\u2014about ten times more than the United States\u2014enhanced geolocation, coupled with an expansive network of surveillance cameras, each equipped with facial-recognition technology, has enabled authorities to track and subordinate the country's eleven million Uighur Muslims. According to the Times[46], 'the practice makes China a pioneer in applying next-generation technology to watch its people, potentially ushering in a new era of automated racism.'So anywhere 5G is installed, automated racism is possible. Wow - as if systemic and institutional racism isn't enough. [embedded content] [embedded content] [embedded content] Concerned yet? The U.S. Day of Action Against 5G[47] is on May 15.

But on this occasion, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that May is absolutely right.</p><p>Not that newsroom decisions are easy. Every day, journalists make snap choices under enormous pressure. It is easy to run a news desk as a spectator, but much harder when major events are breaking.</p><p>The advent of alternative sources of news, notably via social media platforms, has complicated matters further, as journalists consider what details to exclude from their own coverage, even though they are widely available elsewhere.</p><p>But then, it has always been thus - only the scale and the sense of immediacy has change.</p><p>Likewise, it has been the case for a long time that many of those who commit terrorist atrocities in the name of some sort of \"cause\" have a very clear idea of the narrative they want to create - and to see distributed.</p><p>A few years ago, this would be evident in the video recordings made by Islamist suicide bombers before they carried out their attacks. In the case of Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in 2011, it was a lengthy manifesto which sought to justify his murders. The same was true of Ted Kaczynski, the \"Unabomber\", whose bombing campaign in the US lasted nearly 20 years.</p><p>Now, however, terrorists have the ability - thanks to technological \"advances\" - to film their crimes as they happen, streaming them in real time to audiences around the world. In the case of the Christchurch attacks, video and online manifesto were in circulation even before the horror had ended.</p><p>Still, the whole point of journalism is to be the filter; to analyse and bring order, clarity. That does not mean avoiding difficult issues, or preventing the world from knowing about appalling crimes, or the bleak realities of war. But it should mean we do not project or amplify precisely those narratives that killers and terrorists - or indeed any who seek to exercise power over others, violently or not - have formed for themselves.</p><p>By showing the video taken by Brenton Tarrant of his bloody assault - even if edited to exclude the worst elements - some parts of the media in this country and elsewhere have done precisely as he would have wished.</p><p> A mass murder, presented through the murderer's eyes, like something from a computer game. By turns horrifying, glorifying and somehow sanitising the deaths of 49 innocent people. </p><p>The Mirror</p><p>has acknowledged that it erred; perhaps others (including</p><p>MailOnline</p><p> and</p><p>The Sun</p><p>) will do the same in due course. Earlier, though, </p><p>The Sun </p><p>was happy to defend its position.</p><p>Of course, there are big questions to be asked of the major social media companies as well. It is partly via the platforms they provide that people are being radicalised, that hate is being fostered and that violent imagery and even murder is being circulated. This cannot be the price we accept for the internet's many virtues.</p><p>No wonder the regulatory vultures are circling over the big tech firms. They must do better.</p><p>Nevertheless, failings by the likes of Facebook or YouTube cannot be an excuse for the media to avoid exercising proper ethical judgements.</p><p>It should be abundantly clear that publishing footage taken by a terrorist as he embarks on a mass murder spree is the wrong thing to do: insensitive, gratuitous, unnecessary and likely to promote more violence.</p><p>It does not, despite protestations to the contrary, shed light - rather, it suggests we are prepared to succumb to the darkness.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-52622722</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN2-FC01-JCJY-G38C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"650\"/><timeReceived>3:34 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 15, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

When I met him in Brussels recently, Buttarelli checked off the barriers to entry for a startup: It needs to first outbid the likes of Amazon.com Inc., Facebook and others for engineering talent; then sell its product through an app store probably run by Google or Apple Inc.; and finally compete against big players with established networks and huge cash piles. And even it clears all these hurdles, it's still vulnerable to being taken out.</p><p> There's a connection between this dominance of Big Tech - which is proven by the decline in venture-capital financing for upstarts, as my colleague Noah Smith has written - and harm to consumers. The EU view is that the \"free\" price tag of social media and apps is no t a public good if it's underpinned by a business model that hoovers up data from users without consent. And if the profits from that are spent on blocking competition, there's less chance of a market-based alternative. Google and Facebook rebut this view, insisting that a disruptive rival could unseat them anytime. But regulators have given up waiting for one.</p><p> The recipe for fixing things, according to Buttarelli, is threefold. He wants more competition through antitrust enforcement, more data protection through GDPR, and more fairness and transparency for customers from the tech giants themselves.</p><p> None of this would destroy Facebook or Google. GDPR is estimated to have inflicted a negative impact of 2 to 3 percent on the two companies' total ad revenues, according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post. The running total of EU antitrust fines against Google is about 6.7 billion euros ($7.5 billion), while the company's yearly sales are more than $100 billion. Still, Eric Leandri, co-founder of French search engine Qwant, says he's confident that recent fines against Google on competition and data-privacy grounds - which the U.S. firm is appealing - will have had a chilling impact.</p><p> Defenders of the Silicon Valley faith will grumble about mission creep in Brussels. It's certainly true that regulators need to be careful not to muddy the waters with inconsistent or unclear regulation. The recent German competition ruling against Facebook uses data privacy as its main argument, but without a prior ruling on GDPR infringement. That's a potential problem because it's hard to separate the need to enforce user privacy with the need to safeguard competition. Indeed, both things might be in conflict one day, says Ariel Ezrachi, a competition specialist at Oxford University. Imagine the right to keep your data private under one law alongside the need to share your data in a competitive market under another.</p><p> Another thing not covered in Buttarelli's plan is where investment comes from. It was no surprise when Sweden's music-streaming giant Spotify Technology SA decided to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange last year. If Europe fails to unify its fragmented capital markets, especially after Brexit, the fruits of Buttarelli's labor will end up in America regardless.</p><p>           Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnis      t       covering Brussels.    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-4134173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897DA0115D0A6 NWBKMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VH4-XDK1-DXVP-V12F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"598\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The MetroWest Daily News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

According to an updated regulatory filing[1] disclosed Monday, Nutanix is pricing its shares in the range of $11 to $13. At the high-end of the range, that would give the infrastructure company a market cap of $1.8 billion \u2014 slightly lower than the $2 billion-plus reported valuation it fetched two years ago in its Series E funding. That's not an encouraging sign for a company that initially filed to go public in December 2015. Nutanix has repeatedly delayed its IPO for the past 9 months, and\u00a0took a $75 million loan in May, which caused some concerns[2]\u00a0around the company's financials. </p><p>The price range could still change.\u00a0Depending on investor interest, Nutanix could price it at a higher or lower point as it gets closer to the actual IPO. Also, it could be strategically pricing it at a lower point in hopes of a larger first-day pop. Still,\u00a0given the fact that 2016 has been one of the weakest tech IPO markets ever, Nutanix's lower-than-anticipated price range would be a disappointment to many tech investors looking for a bounce.\u00a0 Nutanix is best-known for its computer storage technology called \"hyperconverged,\" which makes it easier and cheaper for companies to run their servers. Since its founding in 2009, Nutanix has raised $318 million so far. Here's a quick rundown of some of its most important numbers: - Full year revenue (ended July 2016): $444.9 million, up 84% year-over-year - Billings: $637 million, up 106% year-over-year - Operating loss: $165 million, up 40% year-over-year (but slowing from 2015's 51% growth) - Net loss: $168.5 million (Nutanix has never been profitable) - Operating cash flow: $3.6 million (turned operating cash flow positive for the first time this year) Nutanix declined to comment on this story.NOW WATCH: Samsung now says it's too dangerous to even turn on your Galaxy Note 7[3]See Also: The CFA exam is

The sense of a system rigged to benefit the owners of capital at the expense of workers is profound. In 2016 a survey found that more than half of young Americans no longer support capitalism. This loss of faith is dangerous, but is also warranted. Today's capitalism does have a real problem, just not the one that protectionists and populists like to talk about. Life has become far too comfortable for some firms in the old economy, while, in the new economy, tech firms have rapidly built market power. A revolution is indeed needed\u2014one that unleashes competition, forcing down abnormally high profits today and ensuring that innovation can thrive tomorrow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Countries have acted to fuel competition before. At the start of the 20th century America broke up monopolies in railways and energy. After the second world war West Germany put the creation of competitive markets at the centre of its nation-building project. The establishment of the European single market, a project championed by Margaret Thatcher, prised open stale domestic markets to dynamic foreign firms. Ronald Reagan fostered competition across much of the American economy.</p><p>A similar transformation is needed today. Since 1997 market concentration has risen in two-thirds of American industries. A tenth of the economy is made up of industries in which four firms control more than two-thirds of the market. In a healthy economy you would expect profits to be competed down, but the free cashflow of companies is 76% above its 50-year average, relative to GDP. In Europe the trend is similar, if less extreme. The average market share of the biggest four firms in each industry has risen by three percentage points since 2000. On both continents, dominant firms have become harder to dislodge.</p><p>Incumbents scoff at the idea that they have it easy. However consolidated markets become domestically, they argue, globalisation keeps heating the furnace of competition. But in industries that are less exposed to trade, firms are making huge returns. We calculate the global pool of abnormal profits to be $660bn, more than two-thirds of which is made in America, one-third of that in technology firms (see Special report). </p><p>Not all these rents are obvious. Google and Facebook provide popular services at no cost to consumers. But through their grip on advertising, they subtly push up the costs of other firms. Several old-economy industries with high prices and fat profits lurk beneath the surface of commerce: credit cards, pharmaceutical distribution and credit-checking. When the public deals with oligopolists more directly, the problem is clearer. America's sheltered airlines charge more than European peers and deliver worse service. Cable-TV firms are notorious for high prices: the average pay-TV customer in America is estimated to spend 44% more today than in 2011. In some cases public ire opens the door to newcomers, such as Netflix. Too often, however, it does not. Stockmarkets value even consumer-friendly entrants such as Netflix and Amazon as if they too will become monopolies.</p><p>Rising market power helps solve several economic puzzles. Despite low interest rates, firms have reinvested a stingy share of their bumper profits. This could be because barriers to competition keep out even well-funded newcomers. Next, since the turn of the millennium, and particularly in America, labour's share of GDP has been falling. Monopolistic prices may have allowed powerful firms to eat away at the purchasing power of wages. The labour share has fallen fastest in industries with growing concentration. A third puzzle is that the number of new entrants has been falling and productivity growth has been weak. This may also be explained by a lack of competitive pressure to innovate.</p><p>Some argue that the solution to capital's excesses is to beef up labour. Elizabeth Warren, a possible American presidential candidate, wants to put more workers on boards. Britain's Labour Party promises compulsory employee share-ownership. And almost everyone on the left wants to reinvigorate the declining power of unions (see Briefing). There is a role for trade unions in a modern economy. But a return to 1960s-style capitalism, in which bloated oligopolies earn fat margins but dole cash out to workers under the threat of strikes is something to be avoided. Tolerating abnormal profits so long as they are distributed in a way that satisfies those with power is a recipe for cronyism. Favoured insiders might do well\u2014witness the gap between coddled workers and neglected outsiders in Italy. But an economy composed of cosy incumbents will eventually see a collapse in innovation and hence a stagnation in living standards.</p><p>Far better to get rid of rents themselves. Market power should be attacked in three ways. First, data and intellectual-property regimes should be used to fuel innovation, not protect incumbents. That means liberating individual users of tech services to take their information elsewhere. It also entails requiring big platforms to license anonymised bulk data to rivals. Patents should be rarer, shorter and easier to challenge in court.</p><p>Second, governments should tear down barriers to entry, such as non-compete clauses, occupational licensing requirements and complex regulations written by industry lobbyists. More than 20% of American workers must hold licences in order to do their jobs, up from just 5% in 1950.</p><p>Third, antitrust laws must be made fit for the 21st century. There is nothing wrong with trustbusters' remit to promote consumer welfare. But regulators need to pay more attention to the overall competitive health of markets and to returns on capital. America's regulators should have more powers, as Britain's do, to investigate markets that are becoming dysfunctional. Big tech firms should find it much harder to neutralise potential long-term rivals, as Facebook did when it acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.</p><p>These changes will not solve every ill. But if they drove profits in America to historically normal levels, and private-sector workers got the benefits, real wages would rise by 6%. Consumers would have greater choice. Productivity would rise. That might not halt the rise of populism. But a competition revolution would do much to restore the public's faith in capitalism. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-3H7KU53</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRG-KFR1-DY2R-201K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1075\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

At one point in his 2500-word post...</p><p>On December 30 last year, Andrew Bosworth, a key lieutenant to Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg, sent an extraordinary memo to the social media company\u2019s staff, laying out its rationale in refusing to be an arbiter of truth.    At one point in his 2500-word post, Bosworth posed the question: \u201cSo was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected?\u201d    \u201cI think the answer is yes,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut not for the reasons anyone thinks. He didn\u2019t get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica. He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I\u2019ve ever seen from any advertiser. Period.\u201d    Others would beg to differ. Part of the reason Trump was able to run such an effective digital campaign was that detailed Facebook data on tens of millions of users was harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy working for Trump, which allowed the micro-targeting of thousands of variants of campaign ads \u2013 often misleading \u2013 to tiny cohorts of the electorate deemed receptive.    Facebook was subsequently hit with a $US5 billion penalty by the US Federal Trade Commission for \u201cdeceiving\u201d users about its ability to keep their personal information private. Some members of the commission thought even that record settlement was inadequate, because, as one said, it \u201cimposes no meaningful changes to the company\u2019s structure or financial incentives, which led to these violations. Nor does it include any restrictions on the company\u2019s mass surveillance or advertising tactics.\u201d    Nor did it address the bigger question of Facebook\u2019s hands-off approach when it comes to policing what appears on its platform. Bosworth\u2019s memo did address that issue, though, by way of tortured metaphor.    \u201cI find myself thinking of the Lord of the Rings at this moment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSpecifically when Frodo offers the ring to Galadrial [sic] and she imagines using the power righteously, at first, but knows it will eventually corrupt her.    \u201cAs tempting as it is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome [of the 2020 United States presidential election], I am confident we must never do that or we will become that which we fear.\u201d    At best, Boswell\u2019s memo, which was promptly leaked to The New York Times , amounted to a meek retreat from the notion of defending a discernible, objective truth. Instead, Facebook would defend freedom of expression \u2013 unmoored from considerations of truth or consequence.    In a swingeing opinion piece, Times technology writer Kara Swisher argued it was a cynical effort to dress up corporate amorality as a matter of principle.    \u201cFacebook\u2019s plans, moves that were signalled in Mr Bosworth\u2019s ruminations,\u201d she wrote, \u201cboil down to one basic idea: Dear consumer ensnared in our digital panopticon, you might want to fashion a homemade shiv right about now because you are on your own in this prison of hate speech and dangerous lies we built.\u201d    The clear takeout was that, as far as those who led Facebook were concerned, the work of separating fact from fiction, reality from conspiracy theory, real news from fake, basically fell to individual users.    There is abundant evidence many users have trouble doing that. But if Facebook carries out the threat it made on Monday \u2013 that it will remove news entirely from its Australian operations if the Morrison government pushes ahead with a mandatory code for it to pay publishers \u2013 it will become even more difficult for Australian users. The tech giant will continue to host fake news and conspiracy theories, but it will dispense with real news from major publishers.    The proposal, drafted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, would force Facebook and the other tech giant, Google, to pay Australian media organisations for content that appears on their sites. The government has foreshadowed legislation to force digital platforms to negotiate a price for what they publish.    This prospect has mightily displeased the digital behemoths. Google recently began running pop-ups warning users that \u201cthe way Aussies use Google is at risk\u201d and \u201ctheir search experience will be hurt by new regulation.\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s jeopardising the future of journalism in Australia, because if that content is not paid for, then it undermines the ability of those businesses to pay journalists and actually to invest in quality content.\u201d   But Monday\u2019s media release from Facebook, under the bland heading \u201cAn Update About Changes to Facebook\u2019s Services in Australia\u201d, escalated things dramatically.    In it, Will Easton, managing director of Facebook Australia and New Zealand, claimed the proposed regulation \u201cmisunderstands the dynamics of the internet and will do damage to the very news organisations the government is trying to protect\u201d.    \u201cAssuming this draft code becomes law, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he wrote.    \u201cWhen crafting this new legislation, the commission overseeing the process ignored important facts, most critically the relationship between the news media and social media and which one benefits most from the other.\u201d    Easton said it is the media companies that gain the greater benefit. He argued \u2013 and it\u2019s true \u2013 that Facebook, like Google, does not make much of its revenue from news searches.    He also noted media organisations voluntarily posted news on the site and said that over the first five months of 2020, \u201cWe sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook\u2019s News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge \u2013 additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\u201d    But those estimates are beside the point, as far as the ACCC and the government are concerned. Their focus is the fact that before the advent of digital platforms, news organisations \u2013 radio, TV and print \u2013 subsidised newsgathering through ad revenue. Now that the digital platforms are taking an ever-growing share of that revenue, many media organisations are in dire straits financially. In the past decade, thousands of Australian journalists have lost their jobs, even before the pandemic shuttered dozens of newsrooms across the country. Coverage has become concentrated, with important aspects of politics and public life unreported. While the big companies shrink, smaller outlets are going bust.    Meanwhile, the tech giants are growing quickly. Google Australia took in $4.3 billion from Australian advertisers last year, while Facebook earned $674 million. In reporting those numbers, The Australian Financial Review noted that because both companies structure their activities as \u201cresellers\u201d, they successfully minimised their profits and paid little tax: about $100 million and $17 million, respectively.    The ACCC\u2019s digital platforms report, completed last June, which set the stage for this attempt to claw back money for local media, shows just how these companies have become ubiquitous in our daily lives.    \u201cEach month, approximately 19.2 million Australians use Google Search, 17.3 million access Facebook,\u201d the report said. It also reported 17.6 million Australians watch YouTube, which is owned by Google, while 11.2 million access the Facebook-owned Instagram.    The amount of time spent on Google or Facebook platforms dwarfs the amount of time spent on other websites or apps, the ACCC said, the result being that \u201cthese platforms occupy a key position for businesses looking to reach Australian consumers\u201d.    \u201cGoogle, and to a lesser extent Facebook, are able to effectively act as gatekeepers, and to influence and potentially enter multiple markets reliant on attracting online customers.\u201d    The two big platforms had become \u201cunavoidable trading partners\u201d for Australian media, the commission found.    \u201cThe ACCC therefore considers that Google has significant bargaining power in its dealings with these media businesses \u2026 [and] Facebook has substantial bargaining power in its dealings with news media businesses.\u201d    It is this \u201cgross power imbalance\u201d, says Katharine Kemp, senior lecturer in law at the University of New South Wales and an expert in competition law and data privacy, that has to be fixed.    \u201cIt is creating not just an injustice for the news businesses, but it\u2019s actually jeopardising the future of journalism in Australia, because if that content is not paid for, then it undermines the ability of those businesses to pay journalists and actually to invest in quality content.\u201d    The ACCC determined the tech giants would be required to negotiate compensation for the news they use. And if no mutually satisfactory agreement were possible, all parties would go to arbitration.    For a while, both giants had engaged fairly productively with a number of media companies, including Schwartz Media, publisher of The Saturday Paper , but negotiations with the bigger companies, particularly News Corp, reached a stalemate. Facing a mandatory code if they could not make a deal, Google was first to push back publicly, soon followed by Facebook\u2019s more dramatic threat to pull out of the Australian news market entirely.    \u201cFacebook is packing up all its toys and saying, \u2018If you won\u2019t let us have our way, we\u2019ll stop publishers from sharing news on Facebook feeds, full stop,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Kemp.    This has happened before. Five years ago, Spain did something similar to what is being contemplated in Australia, and Google News promptly shut down its Spanish operation.    The consequence of that, according to studies, was that overall news consumption fell by 20 per cent. Overwhelmingly, it was smaller publishers that suffered, while large publishers saw little reduction in traffic.    The big publishers in this country are no doubt aware of this precedent, which suggests there may be more than one reason for their intransigence in negotiations: not only would they gain more revenue as a result of Google and Facebook being forced to deal, but they would also damage upstart competitors.    Given the Spanish precedent, and the fact \u201csnippet taxes\u201d remain a bone of contention between the tech giants and other European nations, such a response may have been expected. The possibility Australia could set a precedent for other countries is a serious risk.    Mike Cannon-Brookes, the billionaire co-founder of the Australian tech company Atlassian, noted that Facebook\u2019s threat to remove Australian news content was \u201cthe only logical move for Facebook to make\u201d.    Yet the ACCC seemed to have been taken by surprise. A media release quoted commission chair Rod Sims blandly reiterating that \u201cthe draft media bargaining code aims to ensure Australian news businesses, including independent, community and regional media, can get a seat at the table for fair negotiations with Facebook and Google\u201d.    \u201cAs the ACCC and the Government work to finalise the draft legislation, we hope all parties will engage in constructive discussions,\u201d Sims said in the statement.    But it would seem the reality \u2013 with the tech giants and the big Australian media players both digging in \u2013 has moved well past that.    It fell to a former head of the ACCC, Professor Allan Fels, to suggest a way in which Australia could muscle up against the threat.    \u201cIf all fails,\u201d Fels told The Saturday Paper , \u201cthe government could impose a tax on digital revenue, a 10 per cent tax. The government carries that weapon in its back pocket.\u201d    But such a move would bring other problems. For a start, a tax would not result in money flowing directly to media companies; instead, it would go to the government, which would then have to redistribute accordingly.    And it would likely result in a big international fight, involving not only corporate players but also, quite likely, the US government.    Michael Dirkis, professor of tax law at the University of Sydney, says digital revenue taxes have been widely debated as a way of mitigating big tech\u2019s capacity to shift profits around the world, avoiding tax as they go.    The reason Google, Facebook and others pay so little tax in Australia is that \u201cthey are advertising into Australia, but the contracts for all that advertising [are] usually entered into offshore\u201d, says Dirkis.    \u201cWhat tends to happen is they have local agents that are out there, going to businesses selling advertising, and \u2026 you wind up entering into a contract in Singapore.\u201d    Such profit-shifting is a huge problem for many nations trying to pin down the tech giants. One mooted solution is to levy a tax not on their profits but on their revenue.    The European Union is strongly disposed towards such measures. Last year, France legislated a 3 per cent tax for digital companies with revenues of more than \u20ac25 million in France and \u20ac750 million worldwide. That is, it specifically targeted the giant companies, all of which are US-based.    Even before the legislation comes into force, says Dirkis, the Trump administration has declared it anti-competitive and imposed \u201ca whole range of tariffs\u201d, including on French Champagne.    Dirkis doesn\u2019t think the digital services tax idea will ever fly. He also suspects the politics of this fight could get very difficult for our conservative government, if push comes to shove.    After all, ideologically the Liberal Party is the party of free enterprise and competition. And essentially this comes down to some companies outcompeting others, as a consequence of technological change.    \u201cThe extent to which the government will carry its own caucus, I suppose, is an issue,\u201d says Dirkis.    The stalled negotiations appear to be the result of an intractable problem: the irresistible force of the tech giants meeting the immovable object of Australia\u2019s big media players and their political agents.    And the outcome looks like it will be bad news. Figuratively and literally.      This article was first published in the print edition of The Saturday Paper on Sep 5, 2020 as \" \".

Here's a look at the top five issues SOPA activists should focus on next: <br/>Stop the Trans Pacific Partnership: After the historic collapse of SOPA, the content industry has claimed it wants to shy away from anymore excessive legislation that could potentially censor the Internet. Instead, it has turned its attention to the international stage. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, better known as TPP, is the latest multilateral trade agreement carrying abusive copyright provisions that the United States, on behalf of Hollywood and major copyright-holding interests, is forcing onto citizens of other countries. <br/> Unfortunately, the treaty is being negotiated in complete secrecy and with no democratic oversight, so we don't even know exactly what these countries have been debating. Fortunately, drafts of the agreement have leaked, and it's at least clear TPP would force countries to drastically lengthen their copyright terms, restrict fair use, institute digital locks to keep people from sharing information, and place greater burdens on websites hosting content. You can read a detailed explanation[4] here. This infographic shows how TPP[5] will affect countries around the world. <br/> Please go to our action center[6] to tell your representative in Congress to demand transparency surrounding TPP negotiations. <br/>Demand Patent Reform: Recently, our broken patent system has proven to be one of the biggest threats to innovation online. Big tech companies have been locked in billion dollar legal patent wars that do nothing for the consumer. Last year, Google and Apple spent more on patent suits[7] than they did research and development. Meanwhile, untold numbers of patent lawsuits (and even mere threats of suits) involve patent trolls, those who sue start-ups for vague patents that can destroy their business before it gets started. <br/><br/>Luckily, people are starting to notice. Noted Appeals Court Judge Richard Posner called the patent system 'chaos' and said there are too many patents in America[8], as he dismissed a prominent case involving Apple and Motorola. The SHIELD Act, written Rep. Peter DeFazio, along with co-sponsor Rep. Jason Chaffetz, would help put an end to a lot of the problems[9] we've been noting for years now. Tell your congressional representative to support real patent reform so the tech industry can thrive. <br/> EFF has set up a webpage called defendinnovation.org[10] where we lay out possible reforms for the patent system. You can leave you own comment about how the patent system has affected you and sign our petition, which we plan on taking to Congress along with a list of reforms. <br/>Reforming Draconian Computer Crime Law: The Internet has been in mourning this week as one of its true innovators and pioneers, Aaron Swartz, took his own life at the age 26. He was, of course, an early developer of the RSS specification, Creative Commons, Reddit, and a multitude of other projects. Notably, the SOPA protests likely would not have happened without him. He founded Demand Progress, one of the groups which organized the blackout. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://activistpost.net/privacywar.htmlAt\">http://activistpost.net/privacywar.htmlAt</url> the time of his death, Aaron was facing a relentless and unjust prosecution under the outdated and draconian Computer Fraud and Abuse Act[11] for the supposed 'crime' using MIT's computer network to download millions of academic articles from the online archive JSTOR[12], allegedly without \"authorization.\"<br/> For that, he faced 13 felony counts[13] (pdf), which carried the possibility of decades in prison and crippling fines. His case would have gone to trial in April. <br/> EFF, along with a multitude of other groups, have taken a bill written by Rep. Zoe Lofgren and written the first draft [14]of what we hope will become known as 'Aaron's Law'   which will go a long ways in preventing a similar situation from happening to a freedom fighter like Aaron again.<br/> You can take action and email your members of Congress to tell them to support reform of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act here[15]. <br/>Stop the new Internet Surveillance Law: There are rumors that the Obama Administration will propose a far-reaching new Internet surveillance law, dramatically expanding the the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which forces forcing telephone companies to build a wiretap-friendly backdoors into all their technology but not social networks and other web-based communications services. <br/> The White House and the FBI have not released what is in the proposed legislation, but one report states the FBI wants to require[16] Internet companies, like Google, Facebook, and Twitter to build the same type of backdoors for real-time government surveillance. This not only poses a threat to privacy, but Internet security and innovation as well. We need to tell Congress this is unacceptable before it's too late. <br/>Protect Cell Phone Location Data: Cell phone location data is some of the most sensitive data one can possibly send out. Your cell phone sends a signal back to cell phone towers every seven seconds; that data, mapped out over days or weeks, can show \"an intimate portrait of a person's familial and professional associations, political and religious beliefs, even health status,\" as the New York Times put it[17]. <br/> The government made a staggering 1.3 million requests for that sort of data last year[18]   and the government believes they can get it without a warrant. The GPS Act, a bill introduced by Sen. Ron Wyden would force law enforcement to get a warrant for this data, just like the Fourth Amendment should require. <br/> Meanwhile, app developers have also been sucking up users' location information, many times without the user being aware of that collection. It paints just as intimate a picture of people's lives as government tracking does. To that end, Sen. Al Franken has introduced a bill to restrict[19] and regulate the practice so users are better informed and protected when giving this type of information to private companies. In addition, EFF has also written a Mobile Privacy Bill of Rights[20], serving as a best practices guide that developers should follow when writing applications for cell phones.<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://hidemyass.com/vpn/r1869/Enter\">http://hidemyass.com/vpn/r1869/Enter</url> Your Email To Receive Our Daily Newsletter Close[21] BE THE CHANGE!

A MacArthur \"genius\" award recipient for her earlier work building prosthetics, including a hand that responded to sensor signals similar to those put out by the brain, Matsuoka is a polymath. She has studied computer science, electrical engineering, neuroscience, robotics, and mechanical engineering, and she combines elements of each to rethink the relationships humans can have with technology. In 2009, while she was director of the Neurobiotics Laboratory at the University of Washington, Google tapped Matsuoka to help build Google X, its experimental lab. Nest recruited her in 2010 to build its smart software. The company was acquired by Google in 2014. Now Matsuoka is ready for her next challenge. In March she left Nest and made plans to join Twitter after taking some time off. \"With the combination of technology and neuroscience,\" she says, \"there are so many things we can achieve.\" And with artificial intelligence becoming integral to everything from health care to social media feeds, you can think of Matsuoka as one of the future's chief architects.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-JESSI HEMPEL</emphasis></p><h>THE DIGITAL DIVIDEYael MaguireThe Internet via Laser</h><p>AGE <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">40</emphasis></p><p>ROLE <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Engineering director</emphasis></p><p>COMPANY <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook Connectivity Lab</emphasis></p><p>Inside a lab at Facebook, Yael Maguire is constructing lasers, satellites, and solar-powered drones. It's part of an effort to build hardware that can deliver the Internet to the many places on Earth that don't have it. There is a certain full-circle elegance to the fact that Maguire is leading this effort: He spent the first two years of his Facebook career helping the company design the computers, networking gear, and data centers that underpin its online empire. Now he has been charged with delivering those computational riches to vast swaths of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The company wants to \"connect the unconnected,\" Maguire says.

And they've developed new techniques capable of rapidly analyzing all this digital information. When I was at Google, that's what I did. I analyzed data. At YouTube, this helped us discover that the site could generate revenue without annoying users if we showed ads that could be skipped after a few seconds-a basic formula that the company still uses to make billions of dollars.</p><p>Today I work for Hampton Creek, a San Francisco startup that's using plant proteins to rebuild food. We've already used proteins from the Canadian yellow pea and an American variety of sorghum to build a better mayo and a better cookie. Now we're compiling a database of all known plant proteins-one day it could span 18 billion of them. Thanks to many of the same software tools and techniques I used at Google, we can mine this data to model the creation of new foods. Our biologists have already cataloged and analyzed thousands of proteins, running about 30 biochemical and even culinary tests on each of them. By expanding this catalog and folding in data describing how some of the proteins interact, we can identify combinations likely to produce enjoyable foods and pinpoint what will give us the right tastes, textures, and colors. Then we'll focus our lab efforts accordingly.</p><p>Uber is using data to optimize transportation. Airbnb is using it to streamline lodging. New startups are using it for everything from housecleaning to fashion. We're using data to make healthy food that's delicious and affordable. This kind of data science started with online giants like Google.

But now Xiaomi is the largest handset manufacturer in China and the third-largest in the world. And it's clear that the company is more than just an Apple clone; it's a true mashup artist borrowing strategies from a hodgepodge of tech titans to create a business model perfectly suited to emerging markets.</p><p>Xiaomi's handset designs were \"inspired\" by the iPhone, its OS is a highly customized version of Android, and, like Amazon, it sells hardware at cost to win long-term customers. Its community management strategy is downright Reddit-esque: Volunteer moderators scour Xiaomi message boards, bringing worthy ideas to the company's attention. And its rapid release schedule borrows from the lean startup philosophy: The company distributes a new version of its OS every week, often incorporating features that users have suggested. One of Barra's favorite examples: Xiaomi made the flashlight app accessible from the home screen after a teenager complained that his drunken fumbling awoke his parents.</p><p>This isn't a gimmick. As Xiaomi pushes into India, it's hiring local engineers to build apps and customize the OS-then it will adjust based on customers' reactions. \"We have a very tight and fast feedback loop,\" Barra says. That gives Xiaomi a real advantage in the global mobile industry. Maybe it's time other companies started copying it.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-JASON TANZ</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">136%</emphasis><br/>Increase in Xiaomi's share of the Chinese smartphone market between 2013 and 2014</p><h>ENTERTAINMENTCindy Holland vs. Roy PriceOriginal Content Face-Off</h><p>Web TV is finally getting interesting as rivals Netflix and Amazon duke it out.

The ability to place sensors everywhere and process the volume of data they produce, coupled with advances in computer vision, makes it possible to create better immersive environments and believable layers of digital images on top of the physical world. We saw this last year with Oculus Rift and this year with Microsoft's Project HoloLens. Ever since Google led a $542 million investment, everyone's waiting to see if Magic Leap will be the best yet: This secretive startup is the brainchild of Rony Abovitz, who claims to be using a different technology to achieve its effects.</p><p>He believes that one of the early uses of Magic Leap will be games. Eventually, though, the tech will infuse itself into every experience, he says. \"Imagine you are walking in China and all the billboards are in English and at the restaurants, as the people are talking to you, there are live subtitles,\" he says. \"You don't even realize you are in a computer.\" A biomedical engineer by training, Abovitz was heavily influenced by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Star Wars</emphasis> and has said the surgical arms his first startup produced were like bringing the movie's droids to life. In 2013 he sold the company, Mako Surgical, for $1.65 billion and turned his attention to Magic Leap. Now he must make good on the concept videos he has sent whizzing around the web.

Closed instead of open, self-contained rather than connected. Enter Tomer Kagan, cofounder and CEO of Quixey, a five-year-old startup that's using a technology called deep linking to make the stuff that happens inside apps as interconnected as the web. The thought is that this will unlock apps' true potential. Instead of searching for pages, Quixey's engine hunts for actions. Search \"Thai food\" in the Quixey app, for example, and it will deliver links that go straight to the screen in another app, like OpenTable, where you can make a restaurant reservation or order ingredients. \"How do you do that on Google?\" Kagan asks. To be fair, Google is hard at work on this problem too, and for good reason. The desktop web has become secondary to mobile apps; computing happens out in the world, not just in your seat. A link needs to do more than connect you to information-it needs to connect you to action.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-MARCUS WOHLSEN</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How Deep Linking Works</emphasis></p><p>Startups like Quixey, URX, and Vurb use deep linking to make apps as interconnected as the web.

She came with real tech cred: Previously, the MIT-trained mechanical engineer was in charge of new business development at Google.</p><p>Smith's mandate is broad. Her team advises the president on significant tech topics like patent reform, privacy issues, and net neutrality, as well as the regulatory reform that could allow entrepreneurs with good ideas to advance them more quickly. She promotes and encourages top talent to join the United States Digital Service, which places teams of tech experts on gnarly problems like fixing HealthCare.gov. \"If we're the country that makes Amazon and Facebook and Twitter, why can't the federal government have websites and digital services that are awesome?\" she asks.</p><p>Smith's legacy, however, may come from a new effort called TechHire, which she hopes will funnel more women and people of color into tech jobs. \"How do we scrub everyone into the future of our country?\" she asks. Smith is trying, by working with community colleges and companies from a slew of cities to help train a more diverse workforce.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-JESSI HEMPEL</emphasis></p><h>ECOMMERCELucy PengTeaching China's Shoppers How to Spend</h><p>ROLE <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEO</emphasis></p><p>COMPANY <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ant Financial</emphasis></p><p>China's emerging middle class has billions to spend. But few have access to banks or much trust in online retail, which traps their purchasing power under a mattress. Ant Financial-a spinoff of the retail colossus Alibaba-is changing that cautiousness.</p><p>Run by Alibaba cofounder Lucy Peng, the division began as an outgrowth of Alipay, the company's version of PayPal. Since then, it has expanded to include a money-market fund, a peer-to-peer lending service, and a micro-loan program. The company is also developing Sesame Credit, which will assign credit scores based on Alibaba customer data, making it easier for hundreds of millions of Chinese to get loans.</p><p>Alibaba clearly hopes that all these services will make Chinese consumers more comfortable spending money on its platform. But Erik Gordon, a business school professor at the University of Michigan, says the company is also introducing them to modern commerce in general. \"Chinese consumers aren't used to trusting somebody they don't know,\" he says. But Ant Financial gets them used to that idea. That's huge for China's social fabric-and, perhaps, for any American company salivating over the prospect of tapping into the Chinese market.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-JASON TANZ</emphasis></p><h>THE GENDER GAPTracy ChouQuantifying Silicon Valley's Diversity Issue</h><p>AGE <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">27</emphasis></p><p>ROLE <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Software engineer</emphasis></p><p>COMPANY <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pinterest</emphasis></p><p>In 2013, Tracy Chou attended a convention of female technologists where people were, as they often do, bemoaning the lack of women in the field. Being a software engineer, Chou decided to look at the data to see just how bad the problem really was. Unfortunately there was no data. \"When we're building new products for the web, we always track everything and A/B test everything,\" she says. \"But with workforce demographics there was no baseline.\"</p><p>Chou made this point in a post last year on Medium in which she invited companies to report the number of female engineers they employ in a spreadsheet she posted on the coder social network GitHub. First the smaller startups reported. (Ad-tech startup Adzerk: one of five engineers!) Then larger startups like Etsy (19 of 149), Dropbox (26 of 275), and Airbnb (18 of 143) joined in. To date more than 200 tech companies have self-reported, putting pressure on the larger, more established companies to do the same. Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have since released diversity reports. The numbers are bad, but that's not the point. Chou has laid a foundation for measuring and improving the situation.</p><p>Her activism may be gaining her attention, but Chou's passion is coding. At Pinterest she played a big role in engineering a rewrite of the social network's website and launching its mobile site.

Last year the Facebook security guru persuaded his employer to share the security code he wrote for the company with everybody and anybody. Called osquery, it can help people who aren't security experts figure out if someone has been monkeying with their computers. You use it to ask the computer science equivalent of the pointed questions a doctor might ask during your annual physical. And osquery is open source, so anyone can download the software, and anyone can help make it better. Since Arpaia posted the code, developers from companies like Box, Heroku, and Yelp have all added to it. Arpaia estimates that some 38 companies are using osquery to keep themselves safe, and all of them can share what they know.</p><p>That in turn makes Facebook safer, and now the social network wants to release even more of its security tools. Google and Etsy have done the same thing. It's a mini-revolution in the war against hackers: The guys who are getting hacked are freely sharing the code that protects them-they don't care if it makes money, they only care if it works. So for Arpaia, the first rule of security has flipped. \"It's no longer sustainable for security teams to live in their walled gardens and keep all their information to themselves,\" Arpaia says. \"That's why we release things like osquery.\" Sharing. It's the new security.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-ROBERT MCMILLAN</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">36</emphasis><br/>The number of developers who have contributed to the osquery software.</p><h>VIRTUAL REALITYSaschka UnseldA Visionary for Immersive Film</h><p>AGE <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">38</emphasis></p><p>ROLE <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Creative director, Story Studio</emphasis></p><p>COMPANY <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oculus</emphasis></p><p>If Saschka Unseld succeeds at his new job, going to the movies will soon involve going <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">into</emphasis> the movies. As the creative director at Oculus' new filmmaking venture, Story Studio, Unseld is leading the charge in defining cinema for a virtual reality world. Luckily, he's got the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to do it. He joined the company last summer after a six-year stint at Pixar, where he pioneered new visual techniques for his dazzling short, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Blue Umbrella</emphasis>. Now his team is developing an ambitious slate of five bite-size animated films that evoke different moods, from joy (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Henry</emphasis>, a comedy about a hedgehog in love with balloons) to tension (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bullfighter</emphasis>, the tale of a toreador in the ring). Along the way, the Story Studio team hopes to glean wisdom both artistic and procedural-not only about what triggers emotional responses in VR but even <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">how</emphasis> people watch a movie when they're surrounded by it-and then share their findings with other VR filmmakers to extend the cinematic landscape. But while there are seemingly innumerable mysteries of the new platform, it turns out that inducing empathy in VR is surprisingly easy-and that ease might demand restraint from filmmakers. \"Some people are very emotionally sensitive to these experiences,\" Unseld says. \"There's a big responsibility on your shoulders of not overstepping a boundary. You could traumatize people if you overdo it.\" We're glad he's thinking that way; it's a lot harder to cover your eyes with your hands when you've got a headset on.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-ANGELA WATERCUTTER</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5</emphasis><br/>The number of VR film experiences Oculus Story Studio is working on.</p><h>CONTAINERIZATIONSolomon HykesFlexible Flier</h><p>AGE <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">31</emphasis></p><p>ROLE <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Founder</emphasis></p><p>COMPANY <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Docker</emphasis></p><p>That Google search engine running on your phone is actually running on machines in data centers around the globe. Same goes for Amazon and Facebook and Twitter and-well, all popular apps. But that's a complicated and difficult operation. And making sure the data center boxes don't burn unnecessary energy and money is even trickier. That's where a technology called Docker comes in. Cooked up by developer Solomon Hykes and based on a principle called containerization, Docker is a simple and ultraefficient mechanism for running software across as many as tens of thousands of servers. It gives businesses an easier way to break up their software into standardized chunks, like shipping containers, which can easily move from machine to machine as needed. But the really cool thing is that those chunks can be any size, wedging themselves into nooks and crannies, taking advantage of unused memory or processing power, maximizing capacity. \"The individual machine becomes less important,\" Hykes says. \"The collection is what matters.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-CADE METZ</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">100,000</emphasis><br/>The number of apps that currently use Docker.</p><p>Dean worked on an early neural net that could recognize cats in YouTube videos.</p><h>DEEP LEARNINGJeff DeanBig Brain on Campus</h><p>AGE <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">46</emphasis></p><p>ROLE <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Senior fellow, Research group</emphasis></p><p>COMPANY <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis></p><p>As a senior in college 25 years ago, Jeff Dean built an artificial brain. Using what was considered a supercomputer at the time, he created a system that could analyze information and even learn. Trouble was, the assemblage didn't have enough mental muscle. \"We just trained it on toy problems,\" he says of his neural network. \"The computational power wasn't all that great.\"</p><p>Today things are different. As one of Google's earliest hires, Dean-now a senior fellow and one of the company's most important engineers-helped create software that could store and process data across thousands of machines. With names like Bigtable and MapReduce, these epic tools were the secret weapons that enabled Google's search engine to instantly serve hundreds of millions of people across the globe. Based on the research that Google later published, other companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Yahoo began using similar tools. And now, drawing on many of the same ideas that allow programs to juggle data across thousands of machines, people like Dean can finally construct high-power neural networks that work.</p><p>Dean and his colleagues have built massive neural nets that can reliably identify the voice commands you bark into Android phones or recognize the faces in images you post to the Google+ social network. Humans, Dean says, \"have lots and lots of these neurons, and they're all trained to pick up on different types of patterns.\" The computer \"neurons\" pick up on patterns too. Result: Crazy-complicated systems that do very interesting things.</p><p>Google is not alone. At Microsoft similar tech underpins a new Skype tool that instantly translates from one language to another. Such miracles are powered by so-called deep learning, a particular breed of neural network. In the years to come, Dean says, it will remake far more than just Skype. If computers in the cloud can learn, so can the computers inside other machines. Think self-driving cars. And sentient robots.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-CADE METZ</emphasis></p><h>MONEYJohn &amp; Patrick CollisonE-Z Commerce</h><p>AGES <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">24/26</emphasis></p><p>ROLE <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cofounders</emphasis></p><p>COMPANY <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stripe</emphasis></p><p>John and Patrick Collison are startup prodigies. The brothers are good coders, yes, but their success in today's saturated startup market is especially impressive: The Collisons have, in five short years, put Stripe at the center of the Valley's most vigorous crosscurrents. With just a few lines of code, Stripe lets app makers send and receive money of all kinds to and from places of all kinds. Its software powers ecommerce for dozens of companies, from Lyft and Instacart to Twitter and Facebook. Along with credit cards, Stripe handles bitcoin, Apple Pay, and Alipay-China's massive online-payment provider. As the Collisons see it, this is a system that should have been built into the web in the first place. Says Patrick: \"It's part of the promise of what the Internet should enable but hasn't.\" We'll be sure to pass along his complaint to Tim Berners-Lee.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-MARCUS WOHLSEN</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pay Anything</emphasis></p><p>Stripe offers developers access to the financial system without exposing them to its creaky infrastructure and bureaucracy.

The social media startup has built a massive user base of mostly teens, who use it to exchange millions of disappearing pictures and videos and compile strings of images and videos called Stories. You can think of Snapchat as the future of both messaging and video, posing a significant threat to Facebook and Google. Khan's hiring suggests that Snapchat-valued at $15 billion-may be expanding its business with an eye toward going public before long.</p><p>Khan is a data cruncher with a knack for identifying big trends. When he arrived at Credit Suisse in 2011, he brought relationships with Asian contacts, including Alibaba's CFO. He has advised on more than $45 billion in financial transactions, including IPOs for Weibo, King (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Candy Crush</emphasis>!), and Groupon. Before decamping to Snapchat, he took the lead on Alibaba's $25 billion initial public offering last September. It was the biggest IPO of all time and marked the arrival of a global rival for American Internet behemoths like Amazon and Google. At Snapchat, where Khan reports directly to founder Evan Spiegel, the pair recently secured $200 million in new funding. The investor?

But for patients, they are often painful, difficult, and costly. If Tina Nova has her way, the procedure could be replaced by a simple blood test.</p><p>Last summer Nova joined Illumina, which makes fast, inexpensive gene-sequencing machines. (Illumina machines actually perform a huge chunk of the world's gene sequencing.) Now, thanks to Nova, Illumina is developing research products it says could one day help diagnose and treat cancer.</p><p>These tests will analyze the mutations of a particular tumor and, more powerfully, track those mutations as they change over time. Doctors would obtain the samples with a traditional biopsy or, ideally, a blood test. \"Sometimes a sample may not be from where the cancer even is. You may have missed it,\" Nova says. \"So the fact that you could look at blood and monitor the patient frequently puts us in a different position than before.\" Then clinicians could pair a patient with the drug most likely to be effective.</p><p>Working with partners AstraZeneca and Sanofi, Illumina hopes to create a library of sorts that would allow doctors to base treatments on a combination of factors like genetic signatures and biomarkers. \"You can't just make products in isolation,\" says Nova, who has helped launch four biotech companies. \"It's not just about putting new science out into the world. It's thinking about who's going to use it and how it helps patients.\" Eventually (maybe) that research could lead to the least invasive diagnostic of all-a urine sample.

They impact every one of those firms' users, which explains why Koh, with five years on the bench in San Jose, has garnered so much attention: Her strongly worded and sometimes irreverent judgments have inspired memes and listicles.

Before Google, Dugan was the director of Darpa, the Department of Defense agency that helped bring us stealth jets and GPS. Her specialty is directing brilliant teams on two-year projects that seem on the edge of impossible. With fewer than 100 employees, she runs an army of about 1,000 contract researchers who are working on nearly a dozen projects. Some are secret, but the ones we've seen are exciting. There's Project Ara, the modular smartphone you snap together, Lego-like. Another: Tango, a tablet that maps your environs in 3-D. ATAP isn't as grandiose as its more famous R&amp;D sibling, Google X. It still aims for the moon, but first it makes sure it has the rockets on hand.

Minasan, konnichiwa!</p><p>I would like to thank Japan's Financial Services Agency for the opportunity to participate in this session focused on the important topic of our future in the digital age.</p><p>Opportunities and Risks in Financial Innovation</p><p>It is appropriate that we are launching our discussion in Fukuoka. Why? Because Fukuoka is Japan's start-up city. In each of the last three years more companies have been started in Fukuoka than nearly anywhere else in Japan.</p><p>And here in Japan and in Asia more broadly is where both the peril and promise of fintech have revealed themselves.</p><p>It is in Asia where innovations in digital payments and verification systems first became mainstream.</p><p>But it is also in Asia where we first saw the darker side of fintech, with concerns for consumer protection and privacy concerns bubbling to the surface years ago.</p><p>Asia, like the rest of the world, is facing a defining moment: How to manage the risks of fintech without suffocating innovation; how to keep up with rapid fintech innovation, while making sure consumers and investors feel secure in their investments.</p><p>Technology always has, and always will, spur innovation in finance. The question is whether these innovations will benefit all, or only a select few. If handled correctly, fintech can cut the cost of utilizing financial tools and enable millions to fulfill their aspirations of building a better life.</p><p>That is why I believe it is our shared responsibility to create a safe, sound, sustainable and inclusive financial system, protected from criminal abuse.</p><p>The Bali Fintech Agenda</p><p>How can the IMF help with such an enormous task? Last year, at the request of our membership, the IMF and the World Bank developed the Bali Fintech Agenda. This agenda identifies twelve priorities that countries and other international organizations should focus on in the fintech space.</p><p>We then surveyed our members about these elements and 96 countries participated.</p><p>Our findings will be released in a new joint IMF-World Bank paper coming later this month and this afternoon I would like to share with you a few highlights. A sneak peak, if you will.</p><p>First, countries overwhelmingly see fintech as transformative for financial inclusion. They recognize that inclusion plays a key role in promoting growth, opening access for poor and rural communities through lower costs, and facilitating women's participation in the formal economy.</p><p>Indeed, as IMF research shows, fintech has helped to close the inclusion gender gap in some countries, but not everywhere.</p><p>Gaps in access to technology are one explanation, but even when access is equal, there appears to be lower usage by women. For example, in Egypt, Ethiopia, and India, men are 20 percentage points more likely than women to have their own phone; in Bangladesh, men are 22 percentage points more likely than women to have a mobile money account.</p><p>Women also tend to use digital services less than men, at least in some countries, possibly due to social norms, or issues related to affordability and financial literacy. That is why we believe increasing financial literacy can play a key role in generating higher gender participation in every economy.</p><p>Second, countries are asking for greater international cooperation in fintech:</p><p>- Nearly 80% mentioned cybersecurity as their most important priority;</p><p>- Around 60% listed anti-money laundering legal and regulatory frameworks;</p><p>- Another 40% cited payment systems including across borders.</p><p>I should note that these issues are already being discussed in the various international forums in which IMF staff participates, but countries want to see swifter progress.</p><p>For example, crypto-assets have been in use for several years, but even among the countries of the G20, there is no consensus on their regulatory treatment.</p><p>The same is true about another issue discussed in our review market concentration.</p><p>A significant disruption to the financial landscape is likely to come from the big tech firms, who will use their enormous customer bases and deep pockets to offer financial products based on big data and artificial intelligence.</p><p>These developments hold out the promise of accelerating inclusion and modernizing financial markets, but raise, in addition to privacy issues, competition and market concentration concerns, both of which could lead to vulnerabilities in the financial system.</p><p>China's technology industry is a prime example of this trade-off between benefits and challenges. Over the last five years, technology growth in China has been extremely successful and allowed millions of new entrants to benefit from access to financial products and the creation of high-quality jobs. But it has also led to two firms controlling more than 90% of the mobile payments market.</p><p>This presents a unique systemic challenge to financial stability and efficiency, and one I hope we can touch on during the G20, and address in a cooperative and consistent fashion</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>So, let me conclude. Everyone here, and many around the world, recognize that it is critical to continue the international dialogue on fintech. It is not as easy as it seems.</p><p>Integrating different national approaches to crypto-assets, non-bank fintech intermediaries, and the governance of data is crucial if we are to harness fintech's potential to promote greater financial inclusion and development. Yet at the same time, we have to find a way to preserve financial stability and integrity, protect consumers, and increase financial literacy.</p><p>Here, we can draw inspiration from the famous Japanese proverb: Walk across the stone bridge only after you have tested its strength.</p><p>We will cross the bridge, together, into the fintech future. But we will only do so once we are confident that bridge is safe and secure.</p><p>Events like the one organized today are a critical part of this process. I congratulate our hosts and the Government of Japan for taking on this important initiative. The IMF is proud to be your partner.</p><p>Thank you very much. Domo Arigato!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122987937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W96-2GN1-DYTH-G0RP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1046\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 8, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Last week I was away on a much needed break from work, and yes, I am very refreshed. Not as much as I\u2019d like, but I\u2019ll take what I can get. Alexander covered for me on the newsletter with an interesting conversation about Facebook\u2019s foray into Nigeria. Y\u2019all noticed, yes?    Anyway, Alex is one of all the brilliant writers/analysts at TechCabal, and among other things, he currently writes two steady weekly columns; The BackEnd , and FactSheet . They both have tons of useful insights, and you should totally check them out.    Today\u2019s conversation borders around ease of doing business for startups and small businesses. And starts with one funny question:    What are evil forces in the African business context?    Well, a lot, and not so much, but specifically; policies, infrastructure, laws, and other ease of doing business markers. This term was coined by entrepreneur and investor Dr. Ola Brown  in a conversation with TechCabal. These \u201cevil forces\u201d are mostly government makings; negligence or misguided interference. This leads to the next ?????    What is the best way to engage with the government fruitfully?   Catch up on older episodes of The Next Wave  newsletter, subscribe, and let\u2019s try to answer this question with the example of a North African country that we all know by now.                                    WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING                                  Code and the law              April, 2012 \u2013 The scene is California, in the courthouse of 67-year-old District Judge William Alsup. Google and Oracle have come before his lordship armed with legal munition, and slugging it out over lines of code, and  copyright infringement.    In a heavily technical case, Judge Alsup eventually dismissed Oracle\u2019s plea that Google had ripped it off. The good judge navigated the case because he knew more than enough code to get by.    \u201cI couldn\u2019t have told you the first thing about Java before this trial. But, I have done and still do a lot of programming myself in other languages. I have written blocks of code like rangeCheck a hundred times or more. I could do it. You could do it. It is so simple.\u201d    [READ: THE JUDGE\u2019S CODE ]    This is a very fascinating narrative, and one of my favourite tech stories of all time. But most importantly, the manner which it blew up with a few contortions over the years points out how out of touch the law literally is with tech and innovations. So out of touch that a coding judge that has done a bit of Java homework becomes a global tech celebrity.    It is very easy to berate African  policymakers, and while not exonerating them on the other hand, technology around the world is evolving faster than laws can keep up with. Regulators are still not sure what to make of Uber and AirBnB, among a host of others. In America and across Europe, when regulators face off with big tech companies in hearings, these things become painfully obvious.    In the homefront    Regardless of how much of a problem this is on a global scale, it is no news that it is greatly amplified in the African context.     [READ: The Next Wave: Regulatory mixed bags ]    The government insists players do not keep them abreast of developments across board, and these tech and innovation communities across Africa swear the government is tone deaf and not interested in making anything of dialogue. And even though this is the current impasse, multiple examples have shown the latter to be true(er).    [READ: In Nigeria, NITDA yet to implement key recommendations to support startups ]    What to do?    As no innovation ecosystem can thrive without active positive government participation and involvement, there has to be a way to fix things. Or at least attempt to.    The potter\u2019s wheel    Startup Acts have become popular over the past few years with Tunisia\u2019s leading the way in April 2018. It was a framework for how African governments should interact with and support tech ecosystems.  Among other things, some of its more important provisions, according to MENAbytes , are:    \u201c Exemption for startups from corporate taxes for  up to eight years, special custom procedures, exemption from capital gains tax on investments made in startups, up to one year of time off from their current jobs (for both private and public sector employees), and salary for up to three founders during the first year of operations.\u201d    Senegal followed in December 2019, and 10 more African countries are reportedly working to enact theirs.    How has the journey been for Tunisia?   Well, two years after, the startup ecosystem is brimming with positive testimonies , and of course some lessons.                                                             Regardless, it is important to note that a startup act is basically a mold for proper regularisation, and not a panacea for all the startup ails on the continent; it\u2019s just a start.    Tunisia was a good lead, but it cannot be a boilerplate for every African country. For the North African country, it served as an accelerant for a fledgeling tech and startup ecosystem. And some of the Act\u2019s finest points like government-backed funding and salaries for founders may not be feasible for poorer economies, and not be useful for more developed ecosystems.    But for a startup act, the journey is as important as the destination: Tunisia\u2019s two-year period to actually implementing the act is as important as the act itself.    To finally exorcise these evil forces, there has to be a period where African government(s) actually understand the workings of tech and innovation, and create favourable conditions and laws to support them.                                 FROM THE CABAL                                     Will GPT-3 take your  job?           There has been much ado about Open AI\u2019s powerful language model. And as with every new AI, like clockwork, most of this panic has been around job security.    But seriously, will it really render you obsolete? Short answer? It depends. Long answer? There are more important things to worry about. In this article , Kay Ugwuede contextualises this subject in Africa.    An exclusive West African Disney deal. FilmOne entertainment recently became the exclusive distributors of all Disney movies in Anglophone West Africa, and this makes them the sole supplier to 63 cinema locations and 25,800 seats in the region.   Beyond profit and regional dominance, Alexander Onukwue explains the workings and risks of this deal.                                   THE CRYSTAL BALL                                \u201c Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, a lot of traditional offline options are no longer on the table as a large portion of the recruitment industry has had to quickly embrace technology or lose business.  Technology will be crucial for job seekers looking to access training and work opportunities and for employers to fill their vacancies quickly and cost-effectively.    Moving forward, businesses looking to rebound from the pandemic will be focused on building a qualified and productive workforce while being mindful of cost. There will be an increased use of objective data points to assess candidates\u2019 abilities and reduce the occurence of  hiring errors. Such data points are best accessed through skills and personality testing which is affordable and scalable if companies leverage technology.    As the search for improved workplace productivity moves Africa away from non-transparent hiring, to democratic access to talent and opportunity, technology will be crucial in its capacity to match candidates purely based on skills, competencies and fit . \u201c     \u2013 Hilda Kragha, CEO, Jobberman.   Every week, we will ask our readers, stakeholders, and operators in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem what they think the new normal will look like, and will share their thoughts here.

TC Insights                               Symbiosis     \u201cEverytime we have gotten an investment it was because there was an investor in the room who fully understood our sector and the regulatory framework guiding it,\u201d Tolu Ene (not real name), a health tech entrepreneur said during an interview with  TechCabal.     Ene and other entrepreneurs in Nigeria highlighted the opaque policy environment as a major hindrance to funding during interviews with TechCabal about the state of health tech . Investors were being careful to invest in the sector because they couldn\u2019t clearly anticipate what the government would do.                                                     Bad or opaque government policies have consequences for entrepreneurs including tech founders. Not only do innovators and entrepreneurs avoid countries or cities where policies are unfavourable, investors also close their wallets. Entrepreneurship cannot thrive without a healthy relationship with the government and investment. Investors usually go where entrepreneurs thrive and the latter can only thrive where the government lets them.    One good example of entrepreneurs going where the government lets them thrive is Rwanda. In 2015, the government approved the Smart Rwanda 2020 Master Plan with a goal to develop a vibrant technology industry and position itself as a regional hub. Using figures from Partech, about $76 million has been invested in Rwandan startups since the plan was approved.    \u201cI get to live here on an ICT residency, was able to incorporate my company within 24 hours, and had my first office space in a government-sponsored tech  lab,\u201d Barrett Nash, co-founder of ride-hailing startup SafeMotos, explained in an interview highlighting  Rwanda\u2019s commitment to helping technology entrepreneurs thrive. \u201cFor me, Rwanda is the test kitchen of Africa; it\u2019s a laboratory-like environment that reduces friction points so that startups can learn faster,\u201d Nash further stated.    With their startup acts, countries such as Tunisia are also gradually becoming startup-friendly going by testimonies by entrepreneurs. But friendly government policies aren\u2019t only great for entrepreneurs, they send a signal to investors that a country is open for business.

We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic, and economic downturn, has only accelerated the evolution of healthcare ecosystems. As we move forward, organizations can consider ways to use healthcare ecosystems to improve patient experience and health, while reducing total costs.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ecosystems create powerful forces that can reshape and disrupt industries. In healthcare, they have the potential to deliver a personalized and integrated experience to consumers, enhance provider productivity, engage formal and informal caregivers, and improve outcomes and affordability. We define an ecosystem as a set of capabilities and services that integrate value chain participants (customers, suppliers, and platform and service providers) through a common commercial model and virtual data backbone (enabled by seamless data capture, management, and exchange) to create improved and efficient consumer and stakeholder experiences, and to solve significant pain points or inefficiencies.</p><p>Healthcare has shifted away from its post-World War II focus on contagious disease and workplace accidents, which necessitated episodic interventions. Today, the primary goal is preventing and effectively managing chronic conditions. However, as we have shown, productivity in healthcare is lagging other services industries as these goals shift. New technologies promise care that is available nearby or at home, supports continuous self and autonomous care, and reduces friction costs between supporting stakeholders. These shifts create an imperative for stakeholders to move toward an ecosystem-based model of care enabled by five key industry forces driving technological innovation:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Longstanding industry inefficiencies are leading to affordability, outcome, and quality challenges, and poor consumer experience.

From 2014 to 2018, there have been more than 580 healthcare technology deals in the United States, each more than $10 million, for a total of more than $83 billion in value. They have been disproportionately focused on three main categories: patient engagement, data and analytics, and new care models.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Technology giants are locked in a trillion-dollar battle to win share in the public cloud and to retain consumer \"mindshare\" and engagement. As a result, they are investing billions of R&amp;D dollars into their platforms to create services easily usable by a range of customers and for a range of applications (for example, predictive analytics) that accelerate innovation. Additionally, certain partnerships or acquisitions, whether between pharmacy providers or health systems and technology companies, reflect increased integration, as well as rising concerns around patient privacy. Healthcare incumbents and new entrants have a huge opportunity to tap into this innovation to gain market share while improving the cost and quality of healthcare.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Proposed regulatory changes offer the potential for more integrated data sharing, and greater transparency for consumers. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) are making changes to promote data sharing between healthcare organizations.

One example is Disney. Its robust ecosystem allows each component to positively reinforce the other. Disney launched its first movie in 1937, its first television series in 1954, and, by 2019, the streaming service Disney+. Its theme parks, such as Disney World, reinforce the brands of characters, allowing children and families to have engaging in-person experiences. Those children also ask for Disney toys, Disney apparel, and Disney games, creating a self-reinforcing experience within the ecosystem enabled by the control of a scarce resource-content-and the underlying data and analytics to best deliver it.</p><p>The healthcare ecosystems of the future, like other ecosystems, will be centered on the consumer, in this case the patient. The capabilities and services that form the healthcare ecosystems of the future (illustrated in Exhibit 1) will include, but are not limited to:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>modalities of traditional care: direct care and pharmaceuticals administered by providers, across traditional sites of care</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>home and self-care: patient engagement, self- and virtual care, remote monitoring, and traditional care that can increasingly be delivered near or in the home</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>social care: social and community networks related to a patient's holistic health focused on community elements of unmet social needs</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>daily life activities: patient actions and habits enabling wellness and health, including fitness and nutrition</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>financing support: operations and financial infrastructure supporting industry care events, including payment and financing solutions</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Each of these capabilities and services contribute to the underlying data backbone and advanced analytics technologies. These capabilities maintain data integrity and enable insights from the ecosystem. These layers are further outlined in section 2.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Healthcare Systems and Services/Our Insights/The next wave of healthcare innovation/png-healthcare-ecosystems-exhibit-1-v2.png\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>The healthcare ecosystems of the future will likely be defined by the needs of different patient populations and their associated effective care journeys (including beyond care itself). The consumer-oriented nature of these ecosystems also will increase the number of healthcare touchpoints, with the goal of modifying patient behavior and improving outcomes.</p><p>On one end of the spectrum, healthcare ecosystems will emerge to address the needs of healthy patients, who have less consistent medical challenges, but often set personal wellness goals. These patients will likely experience a more digital ecosystem, where patient data and insights are consumed in a highly personalized and meaningful way, such as with wearable devices. Only a small percentage of the touchpoints would be in modalities of traditional care.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, healthcare ecosystems will emerge to address the needs of patients who have multiple complex chronic conditions. For these patients, especially the Medicare and Medicaid dually eligible population, coordination between providers and services delivered virtually and in-person at or near the home becomes critical to the end-to-end experience. Technology components of these ecosystems will often be leveraged to enhance the in-person experience and support the care team. This team includes informal caregivers, such as the adult children of elderly patients who may play an increasingly important (and technology-enabled) role. Healthcare startups are already experimenting with this model in a targeted way.</p><p>Although patient segments help organize how we think about care journeys and the ecosystems required to support them, the services provided along these journeys will be tailored to the specific needs of each patient. Below we imagine a tailored patient journey for John, a financially constrained patient with multiple chronic conditions, and the healthcare ecosystem that supports him.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Healthcare Systems and Services/Our Insights/The next wave of healthcare innovation/png-healthcare-ecosystems-exhibit-2-vf.png\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>Section</p><h>What are the component layers that will form future healthcare ecosystems?</h><p>Ecosystems are built on three layers: infrastructure, intelligence, and engagement. The infrastructure layer is foundational, composed of effective data capture, curation, management, storage, and interoperability to create a common data set upon which the ecosystem can operate. Built on top of the infrastructure layer is the intelligence layer, which converts data elements to consumable and actionable insights. Finally, bringing an ecosystem to life also requires a robust engagement layer, enabled by the infrastructure and intelligence layers, to effectively curate an end-to-end experience for suppliers who provide services and offerings to patients. Components of these layers can be built, bought, partnered, or vended by ecosystem curators and participants.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The infrastructure layer requires data liquidity</emphasis></h><p>Data liquidity-the ability to access, ingest, and manipulate standardized data sets-is required for the infrastructure layer to serve as the foundation for all insights and decisions made in the ecosystem. This data liquidity enables the ecosystem to create value and removes silos by allowing stakeholders to operate off the same data sets with increased coordination.</p><p>Similar increases in data liquidity in other industries, specifically consumer banking, have altered competitive landscapes. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) messaging system, created in 1973 to transmit financial data, was a game-changer in introducing industry-wide standards. The result is an improved customer experience and added consumer choice.</p><p>Increased data liquidity enables stakeholders to access a complete longitudinal patient record, consisting of patient-generated data, provider-generated data, health and wellness data, financial data, and social data. As standards are established and cloud services continue to proliferate, this data will be easier to access, consume, and integrate. Patients will still be owners of this data and will be required to grant stakeholders permission. While balancing privacy, stakeholders will have to ensure that they are building in the appropriate safeguards and that the ecosystem will provide clear value-added benefits before patients are willing to make the trade-off.</p><p>In healthcare, data liquidity will likely enable more coordinated care and accelerate innovation. Open application programming interfaces (APIs) built for liquid data can provide access to patient records, support electronic data exchange for care transitions, and enable the integration of new data sets, including and beyond claims, clinical, pharmacy, financial, and social data. For example, Medicare-participating hospitals could automatically send HIPAA-compliant electronic notifications to in-network post-acute care providers and other stakeholders when a patient's status is updated. As ecosystems evolve, tangible concerns and risks about the manipulation and ownership of patient, consumer, and provider data will arise for participants. Preserving individual privacy and trust is critical to the functioning of ecosystems. Reforms and regulations are beginning to address this challenge, with likely more to come.</p><p>Although the Department of Health and Human Services appears to be advancing data interoperability, evidenced by the CMS and ONC proposed rules around data interoperability, standard data formats, and APIs, the regulatory framework and mechanism of implementation of increased data liquidity will continue to evolve, because stakeholders, including patients, will demand it.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The intelligence layer requires advanced analytics</emphasis></h><p>Successfully converting data from the infrastructure layer into insights in the intelligence layer requires advanced analytics. Advanced analytics-including machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics-is critical to gain actionable insights to guide stakeholders across ecosystems. Data liquidity will enable advanced analytics in the intelligence layer and lead to more robust patient risk identification, clinical pathway development, and personalized and precision medicine.</p><p>In healthcare, advanced analytics allows stakeholders to use personalized and predictive insights to more effectively manage population health. Our 2011 research identified a $300 billion opportunity from data and analytics in US healthcare, yet only 10 to 20 percent of that was captured as of 2016. Despite this lag, advanced analytics is being applied to healthcare problems (for example, PathAI is leveraging machine learning to improve cancer diagnoses, Babylon Health is using AI to improve remote monitoring, and various pharmaceutical companies are developing breakthrough therapies enabled by AI).</p><p>Much of the innovation in this space could be driven by technology giants. Seventy percent of AI experts in the United States work for Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon, with 30 percent of all US AI patents related to healthcare. Google, for example, is developing its own AI/machine learning capabilities for disease detection. These capabilities will help healthcare incumbents and new entrants leverage robust healthcare-specific services that can be built, partnered for, or acquired.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The engagement layer requires shared digital platforms, compelling consumer experiences, and new payment models</emphasis></h><p>The engagement layer of the ecosystem is where end users interact with services that are in turn supported by underlying data sets from the infrastructure layer and insights from the intelligence layer. The engagement layer requires a shared digital platform where end users can access, through one principal channel, the curated set of services and offerings. Amazon is an example of a non-healthcare ecosystem that has enabled consumers to leverage a single digital platform for an entire spectrum of needs. In healthcare, these engagement offerings might include appointment scheduling, transportation assistance, daily health monitoring, and financial assistance.</p><p>In this layer, data liquidity and infrastructure will support advanced digital therapeutics and coordinated care across traditional and innovative care models that rely on up-to-date and comprehensive patient information.</p><p>To fully take advantage of this model in healthcare, industry behaviors will need to change. For example, provider practice changes include using the layer of intelligence to inform care decisions, leveraging innovative care delivery models and working across a care team at distributed sites, and capturing data from all relevant healthcare-related encounters. These changes will require payment model innovation to align provider and healthcare stakeholder incentives to change provider, payer, and patient behaviors.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The role of technology giants across healthcare ecosystems</emphasis></h><p>Technology giants-and the billions of R&amp;D dollars they are investing to create cross-industry capabilities-will influence the evolution of the healthcare ecosystem. The only question that remains is in what role.</p><p>At a minimum, they will supply the underlying capabilities across layers. In this world, healthcare incumbents would curate ecosystems and build on top of the big tech players' capabilities through industry-specific services augmenting their horizontal/cross-industry infrastructure, intelligence, and engagement capabilities. For example, technology giants are locked in a battle to win share in the public cloud, creating infrastructure that could give healthcare players massive computing power. Furthermore, as data becomes more liquid, these technology giants will be able to continue to scale this infrastructure, supplying the foundation healthcare stakeholders can build on to realize value through healthcare ecosystems, and win market share against traditional competitors. At the same time, healthcare stakeholders who partner with these technology giants will need to address key risks associated with these arrangements, including those related to privacy, security, and internet protocol (IP) management.</p><p>The largest technology players might build and curate their own ecosystems. They could go to market either directly to consumers or through a select set of industry-incumbent partnerships. In this world, healthcare profit pools would likely be disrupted, as these large technology giants disintermediate existing healthcare incumbents' relationships with their patients or empower incumbents who are partnering with them to gain share. For this scenario to emerge, the large technology players would likely need a series of regulatory changes (for example, increasing data interoperability) and be reasonably confident that the economics of disrupting the industry make more sense than enabling innovation within it, which typically involves lower risk.</p><p>Finally, although the battle for share between technology giants in the infrastructure and engagement layers is fairly mature, the intelligence layer is much less developed, leading to heightened competition for talent and investment in these cross-industry oriented capabilities. An illustration of the competitive dynamics between technology giants is provided in Exhibit 3.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Healthcare Systems and Services/Our Insights/The next wave of healthcare innovation/PNG-Healthcare-ecosystems-Exhibit-3.jpg\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>Section</p><h>How can healthcare stakeholders prepare for and act within healthcare ecosystems?</h><p>Despite the movement from some of healthcare's major players, many have not yet clearly articulated their ecosystem strategy. Nor are they set up with talent, operations, and technology that can fully realize value from either curating or participating in integrated, omni-site, patient-centered ecosystems.</p><p>Strategically, stakeholders need to decide whether they will act as curators or participants across the ecosystems that they touch. Stakeholders who wish to curate an ecosystem will need to ensure meaningful improvement in outcomes for a specific set of patients. This approach will require being clear on which industry-agnostic services they leverage and how they augment those services with healthcare-specific capabilities to create a differentiated ecosystem. Other stakeholders who want to provide point-solutions will need to ensure their value proposition is both competitively distinctive and compatible with a variety of ecosystems.</p><p>In addition, most stakeholders will need to make foundational upgrades across ecosystem layers, including:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology upgrades to leverage increasing data liquidity.</emphasis> Stakeholders must ensure that all created data is stored in a standard format and easily accessible. For many organizations, this upgrade will be accomplished by a transition to the cloud and the development and curation of data lakes. This approach also will enable the reconciliation of broader sets of data, including, for example, patient-generated and social/demographic data.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operating model upgrades to drive insights through data and analytics.</emphasis> By building and integrating APIs and services that increase data availability, stakeholders will enable advanced analytics and automation techniques, such as predictive models and decision engines. Increasing the types and quantities of data that can be used to drive decisions is critical for a robust healthcare intelligence layer.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data-first talent model upgrades to capture value.</emphasis> To effectively capture the value from the improved infrastructure and intelligence layers, organizations and participants can adopt new technologies that generate insights and change stakeholder behaviors based on these insights. These talent upgrades include, for example, teaching stakeholders how to use these insights to make decisions, and require change management and targeted re- or up-skilling.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">External and partner services upgrades to expand engagement.</emphasis> Enabling provider, patient, and other stakeholder engagement across the ecosystem will likely require an external-facing orientation focused on collaborations and partnerships in line with stakeholder needs, particularly in the engagement layer, but also to optimize infrastructure and intelligence.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Additionally, healthcare stakeholders will need to shift behaviors of healthcare participants across patients, providers, and other healthcare stakeholders to realize value from ecosystems. This shift requires curators and stakeholders to ensure adoption of new technologies, services, and capabilities in an already crowded space. Ecosystem curators and stakeholders offering point solutions therefore need to consider not only which technology and services they will provide, but also how those capabilities will sit within workflows and journeys, build on existing behaviors, and are linked to incentives.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Payers</emphasis></h><p>Payers, who have access to members and claims data and a core competency in understanding, adjusting to, and shaping regulation in a highly regulated industry, are well-positioned to act as curators of specific healthcare ecosystems. That said, payers likely have to actively position themselves for this role by curating an end-to-end experience for members and providers that can be improved upon over time, especially as the payer core value proposition begins to be \"unbundled.\" This would include individual point solutions that begin displacing core payer functions. Some payers are already integrating with pre- and post-acute care delivery systems and finding higher returns.</p><p>Curating an ecosystem requires a few steps:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Determine which ecosystem or sub-ecosystem to curate.</emphasis> Given the range of member needs and the ways in which patients engage with healthcare stakeholders, ecosystems must be customized to different types of care needs and journeys (for example, healthy individuals versus dual-eligible patients with multiple chronic conditions). Payers should decide which ecosystems they want to curate rather than simply participate in.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Build partnerships that will allow stakeholders to create a seamless experience for patients.</emphasis> Effectively curating an ecosystem requires the ability to create a seamless experience for patients. This requires an underlying data infrastructure that follows patients throughout their healthcare journey and enables interoperable transfer of data across healthcare stakeholders. It involves intelligence that turns that data into insights, and engagement capabilities that lead to stakeholder action. In many cases, the underlying technology required for each layer of future healthcare ecosystems already exists and is relatively mature. Therefore, payers may be able to curate ecosystems most efficiently if they partner with existing technology players and apply healthcare-specific talent and operating models to orient that technology. In this context, payers will need to effectively manage the risks of partnership, including security and privacy concerns.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrate patient and provider services into the ecosystem through contract, partnership, or acquisition on a use-case basis and with incentives in mind.</emphasis> Curating a successful ecosystem requires operating in an agile, patient-oriented way. Building the ecosystem on a use-case basis allows payers to gradually transition to these new ways of operating, while also ensuring a robust set of services that focus on the patient/patient-profile selected. For example, if a payer decides to focus on simple chronic patients, they may first decide to integrate services that enable remote monitoring for providers treating patients with diabetes. Additionally, payers can weigh investing in the capabilities required to build new payment models in order to best enable ecosystems. Given the increasing complexity of ecosystems and the requirement for stakeholders to work together to optimize the quality of care for patients, payers are likely to focus on payment models that effectively align incentives across ecosystem stakeholders.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Providers</emphasis></h><p>While provider systems have made significant capital investments, to date these investments have not delivered their expected productivity improvements. The evolution toward ecosystems presents an opportunity for these providers to increase their return on this invested capital. Leveraging historical-and potential future-investments to create a more longitudinal and personalized care experience could be a potential \"unlock\" for productivity. Additionally, the emergence of ecosystems may drive care delivery innovation as it enables providers to leverage a broader array of services for patients beyond responding to acute needs.</p><p>In an ecosystem-driven world, providers can either participate in an ecosystem curated by another stakeholder, as a professionalized deliverer of episodic or acute care, or they can curate a care-oriented ecosystem for certain populations across the care continuum. Providers are most likely to act as ecosystem curators for subsets of the population with intense, chronic needs; lower-need, healthier populations have less interaction with providers and are not likely to participate in an ecosystem curated by a provider.</p><p>The goal for <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">providers who choose to curate ecosystems</emphasis> would be to deliver a fully integrated experience, centered around the patient, and incorporating informal caregiver engagement. These care-oriented ecosystems will need to extend throughout the entire care continuum. Providers who wish to pursue this strategic path will need to do the following:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Develop a strategy for bringing together care experiences across the entire continuum (that is, seamlessly linking pre-acute, acute, and post-acute care). This kind of integrated network integrity likely requires deployment of a few critical enablers:     <list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Mechanisms that make scheduling and referrals processes more seamless and proactive. These mechanisms could include open scheduling, centralized referral recommendation tools, or care navigators who schedule follow-up appointments with emergency department patients upon discharge.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Integrated network strategy across all provider types and locations. This strategy ensures that affiliated physicians are able to practice at the facility that makes the most sense to the patient.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Creation of a network for high-needs patients. This network will fulfill all of the clinical needs of the selected patient segment, for example, focusing physician outreach/recruitment on specialties where patients are most likely to see an out-of-network provider.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Aligned provider incentives. Providers within the ecosystem of care must realize ecosystem-oriented payment arrangements or joint incentives, such as through joint venture arrangements.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Re-work the traditional concept of organization via \"service lines.\" A truly integrated experience will revolve around a patient's holistic needs. In the current system, patients transfer from one service line to another (for example, from radiology to oncology, to surgery, back to oncology, to social services). A team-based approach centered around the patient (for example, someone with a complex cancer diagnosis) will be more in line with an ecosystem view, but requires organizational, financial, and operational changes.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Integrate tools and care approaches that address non-clinical behaviors that influence health status, potentially through partnerships with other organizations (clinical care explains only about 15 percent of overall health outcomes).</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Deploy tools that help personalize the ecosystem experience for each individual patient. Data liquidity in the infrastructure layer and innovation in the engagement layer (for example, deployment of digital tools) will be particularly important to enable this personalized experience.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>For providers that make a strategic choice to be a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">participant</emphasis> in an ecosystem, it will be important to have a distinctive value proposition. This means, at minimum, providing high-value care for specific patient needs. To maintain this value proposition, providers may choose to act as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">specialty aggregators</emphasis> that bring together distinctive services for a specific specialty (for example, orthopedics) to support an ecosystem. Providers who pursue this strategic path will need to do the following:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>carefully consider which specialties or practice areas they will offer (for example, based on competition trends in those areas, long-term economic sustainability)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>ensure that there is a clear quality and affordability value proposition so that they have a \"right to play\" in various ecosystems curated by others</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>ensure that the infrastructure, intelligence, and engagement capabilities they have in place can easily integrate into others' ecosystems</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Healthcare services and technology players</emphasis></h><p>Healthcare systems and technology players vary widely in terms of services and offerings. These players vary both across function (providing services, data and analytics, consulting, and software and platforms) and topical domain (for example, payment integrity, revenue cycle management, care management). As we've noted in previous work, amid wide diversity of players in this segment, large-scale platform players could evolve to create frictionless markets for healthcare products and services.</p><p>This wide variation means that healthcare services and technology players are naturally positioned to participate in emerging healthcare ecosystems across different ecosystem layers:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>At the infrastructure layer: healthcare services and technology players (for example, health information exchanges and clinical information systems) currently provide data collection, transfer, and management capabilities. As the layer of infrastructure underpinning healthcare ecosystems matures-including through the entry of large technology giants-these healthcare services and technology players can realize value by building capabilities that require healthcare-specific expertise and domain knowledge to serve critical functions in enabling data sets.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>At the intelligence layer: healthcare services and technology players (payment integrity, revenue cycle management, population health, clinical decision support) currently play a critical role in converting underlying data to actionable insights for a variety of customers. With the evolution of healthcare ecosystems, the opportunities for intelligence functions will likely expand materially. As advanced analytics capabilities mature-including through healthcare agnostic technologies-healthcare services and technology players can build off these capabilities and data to develop healthcare-specific insights. These insights can be provided to the patient in an efficient and actionable way, while also improving the quality of care.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>At the engagement layer: healthcare services and technology players, including patient engagement, care and disease management, utilization management, and provider enablement, currently play a critical role in providing information to and changing behavior of healthcare stakeholders. As healthcare ecosystems evolve, the number and complexity of points of engagement will continue to expand. This expansion presents an opportunity for engagement organizations to leverage an increasing amount of data and actionable insights and create value through patient behavior and payer/provider behavior. These players will need to learn how they can best plug into broader healthcare ecosystems to drive adoption and engagement.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Most healthcare services and technology players will likely act as (one or many) point solutions plugging into and providing key functions within evolving healthcare ecosystems. Therefore, these players should maximize the number of situations/ecosystems where their capabilities can be deployed. Often, companies string solutions together within or across topical domains that may stretch beyond a single layer of the ecosystem. This action requires technical flexibility and APIs that interface with other ecosystem participants, especially in the core infrastructure and intelligence layers. Additionally, healthcare services and technology players could create modular solutions that facilitate adding capabilities to an ecosystem.</p><p>Finally, although less common than acting as point solutions, some healthcare services and technology players may be able to curate effective sub-ecosystems (centered on either a specific population, such as those with diabetes, or use case, such as payments). For example, a patient-engagement technology focused on a specific condition may believe that with given engagement levels with patients, it can curate an ecosystem for these patients directly. This approach would require players to bring in underlying data infrastructure and intelligence capabilities, and curate a complete or near-complete continuum of digital and physical services focused on diabetic patients.</p><p>Section</p><h>Conclusion</h><p>Ecosystems have proven to be a powerful force in reshaping and disrupting industries. Healthcare ecosystems have tremendous potential to do the same and could lead to improved health outcomes and affordability by delivering a personalized, intuitive, and integrated experience to patients. In addition, providers would be able to enhance productivity and engage with a broad set of caregivers.</p><p>As industry forces combine to drive the technological innovation that enables these ecosystems, we pose three questions:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>What is a clear strategic path (including strategy for leveraging cross-industry technology services and augmenting those services with healthcare-specific capabilities) that allows a company to benefit from the evolution of healthcare ecosystems?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Do healthcare industry stakeholders have the requisite technology capabilities, operating models, and talent required across the infrastructure, intelligence, and engagement layers of future healthcare ecosystems?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Do stakeholders have a structured framework to determine whether to build, partner, or acquire in closing any capability gaps? How does this framework consider what capabilities are truly differentiating and therefore should be owned?</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Answering these three questions could help healthcare incumbents and new entrants successfully realize the potential value at stake from the emergence of healthcare ecosystems by improving the healthcare experience, outcomes, and costs, ultimately benefiting patients and the public.</p><h>About the authors</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=CA24238872C7488B93A4520E8BFA1461&amp;_z=z\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shubham Singhal</emphasis></url> is a senior partner in McKinsey's Detroit office and the global leader of the Healthcare Systems and Services Practice.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=2A62806F5F0045E2B29E843287632FF4&amp;_z=z\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Basel Kayyali</emphasis></url> is a senior partner in the New Jersey office.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=F7B48E5C164049E5B77FF03B8F943E1B&amp;_z=z\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rob Levin</emphasis></url> is a partner in Boston office. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Zachary Greenberg</emphasis> is an associate partner in the Washington, DC, office.</p><p>The authors would also like to thank the team who contributed to this paper, including Greg Gilbert, Prashanth Reddy, Addie Fleron, Safia Ziani, Nicolette Tran, and Kush Das.</p><p>This article was edited by Elizabeth Newman, an executive editor in the Chicago office.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCKNSY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCKNSY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606J-HHD1-DXH6-F0KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470364</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5945\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 McKinsey &amp;

The endgame though is a corporate NHS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 1990s internal market introduced competition into the NHS. The NHS Plan 2000 rampedup outsourcing and public-private partnerships, and gave us the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">disastrous legacy</url> of private finance initiatives, or PFI.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Health and Social Care Act 2012 doubled private sector outsourcing to 8 per centof the budget. It also enabled foundation trust hospitals to make up to half their income from private patients. There is a thread running through: a narrative of marketisation and privatisation.</p><p>To read this week's pre-launch coverage of the NHS Long Term Plan, one would be forgiven for thinking it had laudable intentions \u00ad- until the politically expedient rhetoric is peeled away and the narrative revealed anew.</p><p>In the press release, the phrase \"out of hospital\" care was mentioned only in passing. However, the actual document devotes its entire first chapter to the 21st century transformation of the NHS into US-style integrated care systems.</p><p>Read more</p><p>NHS 10-year plan relies on raiding 'thousands' of staff from overseas</p><p>Building on the 2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">Five Year Forward View</url>, the Long Term Plan is being touted as a way to reverse the damaging competition of the Health and Social Care Act (HSCA). The creation of integrated care combined with devolution will supposedly join up primary, community and hospital services with social care. Integrated care is therefore partly about provision of \"care in the community\" in order to reduce costs.</p><p>However, plans to create networks of GP surgeries and chains of super hospitals - accompanied by closures of individual GP surgeries (7,500 surgeries are slated to be reduced to 1,500 networks) and planned closures at over 60 hospital trusts - pave the way for economies of scale and therefore corporate takeovers.</p><p>If you don't believe me then just have a look at the chains of nursing and residential homes run by private equity and hedge funds. The Dalton Review specifically stated that either private companies or NHS trusts could run these super hospital chains.</p><p>Integrated care systems (already being rolled out) could ultimately become integrated care organisations with a single provider responsible for regional health and social care. There is presently nothing to stop these multi-billion-pound, 10-year contracts from being won by a private health or insurance company. In other words, far from reversing privatisation, integrated care would consolidate privatisation.</p><p>The 3.5 per centaverage increase per year in funding for frontline services is welcome. However, it is still below the historical average for the NHS.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the funding issue is useful to the government for the way it frames the debate, and distracts from a discussion around privatisation. As I have previously written, the extra funding - announced as a 70th NHS birthday present - comes with strings attached related to the introduction of those US-style integrated care models.</p><p>Read more</p><p>To save the NHS, a drastic shift in public opinion is needed</p><p>Does the UK health service provide value for money?</p><p>Smokers admitted to hospital to face pressure to quit</p><p>The late Tim Evans - one of the arch-proponents of marketisation - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">once envisaged</url>-that the NHS would be just \"a kitemark attached to the institutions and activities of a system of purely private providers\". But it is true that the major pressures on healthcare costs come not from our ageing population, but from expensive drugs, new technologies and the catastrophic market experiment inside the NHS seeing which has tens of billions siphoned towards marketisation and privatisation.</p><p>NHS England Chief Executive Simon Stevens spent the best part of a decade as a senior executive at UnitedHealth - the largest private health and insurance corporation in the US. Previously as health advisor to Alan Milburn and then Tony Blair, Stevens was one of the architects of market expansion.</p><p>There is a term for it: corporate capture.The phrase was used to describe the effect of the revolving door between the financial industry and regulators before the 2008 financial crisis. Now there is corporate capture of health policy by big banks, private healthcare and insurance corporations, the big three management consultancies and the big four accountancy firms.</p><p>Meanwhile, digital health and big data could be the new gold rush. Silicon Valley and big tech want to crack open the NHS oyster and then expand globally. Unsurprisingly, the Long Term Plan devotes a section to digital healthcare. It also envisages the expansion of personal health budgets thus potentially enabling top-up co-payments for private health insurance.</p><p>The government spin centres on the prevention of heart disease, stroke and cancer. It also focuses on mental health, diabetes, smoking, alcohol and elderly care. Yet public health budgets have been slashed.</p><p>World class care is a tough ask after a decade of almost \u00a340bn of efficiency savings, mass service closures and bed-to-population ratios lower than Eastern Europe. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">There are 100,000 vacancies</url> across the NHS. The axing of the student nursing bursary and the redesign of the junior doctors' contract have served to only exacerbate these issues.</p><p>Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds</p><p>We are told that the Long Term Plan could save up to 500,000 lives over the coming decade. Yet shockingly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">120,000 excess deaths</url> have been linked to austerity since 2010. One study found that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">30,000 excess deaths</url> in 2015 alone were linked to cuts in health and social care.</p><p>This reminds us that health outcomes are correlated with socio-economic. Health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted yesterday about personal responsibility for health. This is health illiterate. In fact, health outcomes are directly correlated with socio-economic status.</p><p>Healthcare is not purely a clinical endeavour. If we want to genuinely improve the health of the nation then we not only require publicly funded, provided and owned universal healthcare. We also need to tackle climate change in order to dramatically curb air pollution, we should impose strong regulation on the food, alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical industries, and we must address inequality and the root causes of the mental health crisis.</p><p>Youssef </p><p>El-</p><p>Gingihy</p><p> is a GP in London and the author of '<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps</url>'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-50671779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V55-FPY1-F021-61DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1078\"/><timeReceived>8:31 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 9, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The endgame though is a corporate NHS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 1990s internal market introduced competition into the NHS. The NHS Plan 2000 rampedup outsourcing and public-private partnerships, and gave us the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">disastrous legacy</url> of private finance initiatives, or PFI.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Health and Social Care Act 2012 doubled private sector outsourcing to 8 per centof the budget. It also enabled foundation trust hospitals to make up to half their income from private patients. There is a thread running through: a narrative of marketisation and privatisation.</p><p>To read this week's pre-launch coverage of the NHS Long Term Plan, one would be forgiven for thinking it had laudable intentions \u00ad- until the politically expedient rhetoric is peeled away and the narrative revealed anew.</p><p>In the press release, the phrase \"out of hospital\" care was mentioned only in passing. However, the actual document devotes its entire first chapter to the 21st century transformation of the NHS into US-style integrated care systems.</p><p>Read more</p><p>NHS 10-year plan relies on raiding 'thousands' of staff from overseas</p><p>Building on the 2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">Five Year Forward View</url>, the Long Term Plan is being touted as a way to reverse the damaging competition of the Health and Social Care Act (HSCA). The creation of integrated care combined with devolution will supposedly join up primary, community and hospital services with social care. Integrated care is therefore partly about provision of \"care in the community\" in order to reduce costs.</p><p>However, plans to create networks of GP surgeries and chains of super hospitals - accompanied by closures of individual GP surgeries (7,500 surgeries are slated to be reduced to 1,500 networks) and planned closures at over 60 hospital trusts - pave the way for economies of scale and therefore corporate takeovers.</p><p>If you don't believe me then just have a look at the chains of nursing and residential homes run by private equity and hedge funds. The Dalton Review specifically stated that either private companies or NHS trusts could run these super hospital chains.</p><p>Integrated care systems (already being rolled out) could ultimately become integrated care organisations with a single provider responsible for regional health and social care. There is presently nothing to stop these multi-billion-pound, 10-year contracts from being won by a private health or insurance company. In other words, far from reversing privatisation, integrated care would consolidate privatisation.</p><p>The 3.5 per centaverage increase per year in funding for frontline services is welcome. However, it is still below the historical average for the NHS.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the funding issue is useful to the government for the way it frames the debate, and distracts from a discussion around privatisation. As I have previously written, the extra funding - announced as a 70th NHS birthday present - comes with strings attached related to the introduction of those US-style integrated care models.</p><p>Read more</p><p>To save the NHS, a drastic shift in public opinion is needed</p><p>Does the UK health service provide value for money?</p><p>Smokers admitted to hospital to face pressure to quit</p><p>The late Tim Evans - one of the arch-proponents of marketisation - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">once envisaged</url>-that the NHS would be just \"a kitemark attached to the institutions and activities of a system of purely private providers\". But it is true that the major pressures on healthcare costs come not from our ageing population, but from expensive drugs, new technologies and the catastrophic market experiment inside the NHS seeing which has tens of billions siphoned towards marketisation and privatisation.</p><p>NHS England Chief Executive Simon Stevens spent the best part of a decade as a senior executive at UnitedHealth - the largest private health and insurance corporation in the US. Previously as health advisor to Alan Milburn and then Tony Blair, Stevens was one of the architects of market expansion.</p><p>There is a term for it: corporate capture.The phrase was used to describe the effect of the revolving door between the financial industry and regulators before the 2008 financial crisis. Now there is corporate capture of health policy by big banks, private healthcare and insurance corporations, the big three management consultancies and the big four accountancy firms.</p><p>Meanwhile, digital health and big data could be the new gold rush. Silicon Valley and big tech want to crack open the NHS oyster and then expand globally. Unsurprisingly, the Long Term Plan devotes a section to digital healthcare. It also envisages the expansion of personal health budgets thus potentially enabling top-up co-payments for private health insurance.</p><p>The government spin centres on the prevention of heart disease, stroke and cancer. It also focuses on mental health, diabetes, smoking, alcohol and elderly care. Yet public health budgets have been slashed.</p><p>World class care is a tough ask after a decade of almost \u00a340bn of efficiency savings, mass service closures and bed-to-population ratios lower than Eastern Europe. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">There are 100,000 vacancies</url> across the NHS. The axing of the student nursing bursary and the redesign of the junior doctors' contract have served to only exacerbate these issues.</p><p>Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds</p><p>We are told that the Long Term Plan could save up to 500,000 lives over the coming decade. Yet shockingly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">120,000 excess deaths</url> have been linked to austerity since 2010. One study found that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">30,000 excess deaths</url> in 2015 alone were linked to cuts in health and social care.</p><p>This reminds us that health outcomes are correlated with socio-economic. Health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted yesterday about personal responsibility for health. This is health illiterate. In fact, health outcomes are directly correlated with socio-economic status.</p><p>Healthcare is not purely a clinical endeavour. If we want to genuinely improve the health of the nation then we not only require publicly funded, provided and owned universal healthcare. We also need to tackle climate change in order to dramatically curb air pollution, we should impose strong regulation on the food, alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical industries, and we must address inequality and the root causes of the mental health crisis.</p><p>Youssef </p><p>El-</p><p>Gingihy</p><p> is a GP in London and author of the new, updated edition of<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-funding-pfi-contracts-hospitals-debts-what-is-it-rbs-a7134881.html\">How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-50671779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V55-TCR1-JCJY-G279-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><timeReceived>8:31 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 9, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

ALEC's \"about\" page expands on that theme, explaining:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The American Legislative Exchange Council works to advance limited government, free markets, and federalism at the state level through a nonpartisan public-private partnership of America's state legislators, members of the private sector and the general public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALEC's stated philosophy and goals resonate with liberty-minded Americans, which, undoubtedly, is why many politically conservative state legislators and activist citizens look to it for leadership in rolling back the oppressive hand of Big Government. However, the well-funded and well-connected organization is alienating many of its erstwhile supporters by its support for dangerous trade pacts that threaten the sovereignty of the United States, as well as its efforts to promote a constitutional convention, which could result in the complete destruction of our already tattered and battered U.S. Constitution. That could spell the end of any hope to return to limited government, free markets, and responsible federalism.</p><p>Founded in 1973, ALEC has just celebrated its 40th anniversary and is experiencing both the joys of prominent national influence and the pains of harsh criticism. The organization can boast a membership that includes more than 2,000 state legislators and hundreds of corporations,'as well as dozens of think tanks, foundations, and non-profit organizations.</p><p>For the past several years ALEC has been under attack from a gaggle of leftwing organizations - Color of Change, Common Cause, People for the American Way, Progress Now, the Center for Media and Democracy, the Sierra Club - that claim the organization's corporate ties and corporate funding have put it in the pocket of big business. These and similar groups have lambasted ALEC for its model legislation opposing federal EPA regulations, gun control laws, \"green\" energy mandates, and \"climate change\" carbon taxes, and its support for laws supporting voter identification, \"Stand Your Ground\" protection, school choice, and privatization of public services. Major media outlets, such as the New York Times, Huffington Post, MSNBC, and CNN joined The Nation, Media Matters, and other radical-left detractors in attacking ALEC for these sins against the progressive gospel. The highly politicized shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 provided the key event that ALEC's critics could leverage to crack the organization's growing impact. Utilizing the media-created furor over the shooting, the left-wing activist groups launched a petition-pressure campaign that spotlighted ALEC's support for \"Stand Your Ground\" laws. The result was an exodus, as major corporations and legislators fled ALEC to avoid the controversy.</p><p>For many of ALEC's staunchest supporters, the attacks on the organization - and the liberal-left/progressive sources from which they usually emanate - only prove its bona fides as a defender of free enterprise and constitutional government. They should know better by now. The same alliance of left-wing activists and the liberal establishment media regularly confer legitimacy on false conservatives pseudo-conservatives and business lobbies that promote Big Government by attacking them for not being \"progressive\" enough. Examples abound: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Bob Dole, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Manufacturing Association, the American Medical Association - to name but a very small cohort. These politicians and organizations have excelled at co-opting the rhetoric of free markets and limited government, but often go in exactly the opposite direction. In the remainder of this article, we will examine several of the areas where we contend ALEC is following a similarly deceptive path.</p><p>Trading Away Sovereignty</p><p>At its Model Policies Annual Meeting 2013, ALEC members adopted a \"Resolution Supporting the Successful Negotiation of a Comprehensive and Commercially Meaningful Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).\" The summary of the resolution, provided on ALEC's website, states:</p><p>The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) Agreement has the potential to be the largest trade framework ever negotiated underscoring the importance of ensuring that it is a high standard, comprehensive agreement with strong intellectual property provisions. In keeping with the American Legislative Exchange Council's (ALEC's) support of the Jeffersonian principle of free markets and ALEC's past support of a wide variety of trade frameworks, this resolution supports the negotiation and final ratification of such an agreement.</p><p>Similarly, the organization has adopted a \"Resolution Urging Congress to Pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP).\" The resolution summary states:</p><p>Drawing on ALEC's guiding free market principles, this resolution calls on Congress to support negotiations for a high standard, comprehensive Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).... The TPP has the potential to become the benchmark against which future trade frameworks will be measured for years to come.</p><p>The TTIP's promoters portray it as a \"trade\" agreement between the United States and the 28 member states of the European Union, while the TPP advocates similarly claim they are merely working to expand trade between the United States and 11 Pacific partners: Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, and Japan. The trade engendered by these agreements, say the promoters, will bring prosperity to all, including millions of promised good-paying jobs. Regular readers of The New American are already well aware of the many dangers posed by the TTIP and the TPP, which are being pushed aggressively by the Obama administration and the usual globalist elites at the New York Times, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Brookings Institution, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Among the many articles we have published, in our print edition and online, are the comprehensive \"Secretly Trading Away Our Independence,\" from our May 20, 2013 print edition, and the entire special issue of our September 2, 2013 magazine devoted to the topic, \"How the Free Trade Agenda Is Knocking Down America\" (available as a free pdf download at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thenewamerican.com/files/TNA2917.pdf\">http://www.thenewamerican.com/files/TNA2917.pdf</url>).</p><p>One of the most important facts, if not the most important, to know about both the TTIP and TPP is that they would, if adopted, steadily strip away our national sovereignty, allowing the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations, as well as regional tribunals and regulatory bodies created by these agreements, to override our local, state, and federal laws. This feature alone makes them very subversive, revolutionary proposals that should be opposed by every elected or appointed official who has taken an oath to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" This is no longer a matter of theoretical speculation; as The New American has reported previously, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the WTO agreement have amply proved this. As a result of adopting both of those agreements, NAFTA and WTO rules and rulings increasingly trump our laws.</p><p>Liberty-minded Americans who truly believe in the rule of law and the form of limited government envisioned by our Founders should be working to remove our country from these freedom-destroying organizations, not subjecting us to even more of the same. Even if the agreements dealt only with \"trade\" issues, the structures and procedures they set in place would be pregnant with dangers because they initiate a developing, ongoing process that is a guarantee of \"mission creep,\" with an ever-expanding transnational bureaucracy claiming ever more power over our personal, local, state, and national affairs. Obama administration officials acknowledge that the TTIP/TPP agreements deal with agriculture, environment, labor, telecommunications, financial services, and much more. And documents that have been leaked thus far have revealed additional dangers, such as TPP draft proposals that would dramatically curtail free speech on the Internet.</p><p>Another disturbing feature of both the TTIP and TPP is the secrecy and intrigue that have become their hallmarks. The American people and their elected representatives in Congress have not been allowed access to the TTIP/TPP negotiation process, nor have they been allowed to see the draft text of the agreements. However, the Obama administration has given representatives of major corporations, labor unions, environmental organizations, and other NGO activist \"stakeholders\" official access to both the negotiation proceedings and the texts. Thus the TTIP and TPP have become a joint project of Big Government, Big Business, Big Labor, and Big Green (although the Big Labor/Big Green contingents pretend to oppose at least some features of the agreements). The secrecy of the TTIP/TPP process is, in and of itself, a huge red flag alerting all except the willfully blind that something is amiss. ALEC should find this aspect of TTIP/TPP thoroughly objectionable, since it has made a pointed commitment to transparency in government. A perusal of ALEC literature and the organization's \"model policies\" web page reveals numerous bills sponsored by ALEC devoted to transparency and criticizing officialdom for withholding information from citizens. The Transparency and Government Accountability Act, Local Government Transparency Act, and the Taxpayer Transparency Act are but three of many model bills crafted by ALEC demanding openness and access for citizens.</p><p>Yet still another strike against the TTIP and TPP is the explicit admissions by the top promoters that they intend these agreements to initiate an \"integration\" process that will continually \"widen\" (adding more nations) and \"deepen\" (adding more economic, political, and social issues) with time. This is the same widen ing-deepening integration process that has gradually transformed the Common Market \"trade\" bloc into the increasingly tyrannical EU leviathan ruled by central authorities in Brussels. And TTIP/TPP champions have repeatedly expressed their hopes of following the EU path toward centralized power. As of yet, ALEC has not explained how it can square its \"Limited Government, Free Markets, and Federalism\" philosophy with these TTIP/TPP flaws that are completely at variance with it.</p><p>Constitutional Malpractice</p><p>For many years ALEC has been a leading promoter of the idea that the U.S. Constitution must be amended to require a balanced budget. This, of course, appeals to conservatively minded legislators who recognize that continued liberal spendthrift policies are immoral and unsustainable, and lead our nation toward financial Armageddon. ALEC has used the Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) attraction to argue for an Article V Convention of the States, which constitutionalists (including the editors and writers of this magazine) contend is a dangerous gamble that risks the entire Constitution for an amendment that could not be relied on to rein in Washington, D.C.'s ravenous appetite for spending - even if the convention could be restricted to that one issue. The problem is that, ALEC's assurances to the contrary, once a constitutional convention is called, it becomes a power unto itself and there is no way to limit its power to amend, revise, or toss out and completely rewrite the Constitution. ALEC claims that fears of a \"runaway convention\" of this sort are misplaced, and they have published Article V: A Handbook for State Lawmakers to make their case for a constitutional convention (aka Article V convention)! They have also produced a \"Resolution for Limitations on Authority of Delegates to a 'Convention for Proposing Amendments' (Article V, United States of America Constitution).\" This resolution, says ALEC,\"will eliminate the possibility of a 'runaway convention,' the reason most often cited by scholars for their opposition to an Article V Convention. The resolution restricts delegates to work only on those amendments authorized in their legislative instructions and calls for the immediate recall of any delegate that works on an unauthorized amendment.\"</p><p>But in making this claim, ALEC is on very shaky ground. This is clear, first of all, from our nation's own history. Our first - and so far, only - constitutional convention, which took place in Philadelphia in 1787, was a \"runaway convention,\" despite restrictions on delegates similar to those advocated by ALEC. That gathering, in violation of its mandate, threw out the Articles of Confederation that it had been convened to amend, and drew up a completely new governing document. The fact that the product of that breach of trust turned out to be as sound and salutary as it has proved to be should not incite hope that a repeat of the same process would end so well.</p><p>James Madison, often referred to as the \"father\" of the Constitution, said the contemplation of another constitutional convention caused him to \"tremble\" due to the violent partisanship and \"insidious views\" so prevalent in his day. Have things so improved that we should be less concerned in our own day? Who but a fool or a knave would say so? Madison warned:</p><p>If a General Convention were to take place for the avowed and sole purpose of revising the Constitution, it would naturally consider itself as having a greater latitude than the Congress appointed to administer and support as well as to amend the system; it would consequently give greater agitation to the public mind; an election into it would be courted by the most violent partizans [sic] on both sides [and] would no doubt contain individuals of insidious views, who under the mask of seeking alterations popular in some parts but inadmissible in other parts of the Union might have a dangerous opportunity of sapping the very foundations of the fabric.</p><p>\"Under all these circumstances it seems scarcely to be presumeable [sic] that the deliberations of the body could be conducted in harmony, or terminate in the general good,\" he averred. \"Having witnessed the difficulties and dangers experienced by the first Convention which assembled under every propitious circumstance,\" Madison concluded, \"I should tremble for the result of a second meeting in the present temper of America, and under all the disadvantages I have mentioned.\"</p><p>Noted constitutional scholars of our own time from across the political spectrum - from liberal Supreme Court Justices Warren Burger and Arthur Goldberg to Professors Lawrence Tribe of Harvard and Gerald Gunther of Stanford (both liberals) to Professors Charles Rice of Notre Dame and Rex Lee of Brigham Young (both conservatives) - have echoed Madison, offering their learned opinions that a constitutional convention cannot be limited in its scope, either by Congress or state legislatures. We can say for certain that regardless of the out- come of such a convention there would be dissatisfied factions that would challenge the final product, causing a constitutional impasse and, most probably, sending the whole issue before the U.S. Supreme Court, which has hardly proven to be a staunch defender of limited government. The end result well could be that our U.S. Constitution, which ALEC claims to support, would become a dead letter if ALEC's \"free trade\" agenda were to come to fruition.</p><p>Government-Business Cronyism</p><p>Still another area of concern to ALEC's critics on both the Right and Left is the organization's support for \"public-private partnerships.\" ALEC's model legislation for states promotes a \"Public-Private Partnership (P3) Authority Act,\" the summary of which states:</p><p>This Act establishes a state Partnership Committee and an Office of Public-Private Partnerships to identify and establish public-private partnerships and approve qualified bidders, requests for proposals, and template contracts. The Act is designed to improve public operational efficiency and environmental performance, promote public safety, attract private investment in the state, and minimize governmental liabilities.</p><p>In this area, the supposedly \"conservative\" ALEC is perfectly in step with the \"progressive\" Obama administration, which has made public-private partnerships (P3) a centerpiece of its statist program. And many of ALEC's member corporations are also partners in Obama's Fedgov/Big Business \"Manufacturing Innovation\" consortiums and other P3 endeavors. Those favored corporate cronies include such well-known names as Boeing, General Electric, Microsoft, Caterpillar, Dow Chemical, ALCOA, and ExxonMobil. Hillary Clinton, while Obama's secretary of state, launched the administration's P3 Global Partnership Initiative, spreading hundreds billions of dollars in corporate welfare to the well-connected.</p><p>ALEC is in the forefront of spreading the P3 gospel at the state level, along with its progressive partner, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (USCC), which, like ALEC, talks a good game of \"free markets\" while actually promoting corporate subsidies and economic fascism. \"Fascism,\" writes Lew Rockwell, president of the genuinely free market-oriented Ludwig von Mises Institute, \"is the system of government that cartelizes the private sector, centrally plans the economy to subsidize producers, exalts the police state as the source of order, denies fundamental rights and liberties to individuals, and makes the executive state the unlimited master of society.\" And it is precisely this kind of cartelized, centrally planned, fascist economy that the ALEC/USCC/ Obama/corporate alliance is producing.</p><p>ALEC's corporate P3 members are well represented by:</p><p>Big Pharma (Abbott, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Genetech, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer);</p><p>Big Farm (Altria Group, Archer Daniels Midland, Kraft Food, J.R. Simplot, Monsanto);</p><p>Big Oil (Shell, BP, Peabody, Marathon, Texaco, Tenneco, Chevron, ExxonMobil);</p><p>Big Banking (Bank of America, Coldwell Banker, Wells Fargo, First Chicago NBD);</p><p>Big Gambling (Hollywood Casino Corp., Argosy Gaming Co., Boyd Gaming Corp., GTECH Corp.);</p><p>Big Media (Cox Communications, Comcast, the Wall Street Journal, News Corp., Thompson Reuters, Time Warner Cable);</p><p>Big Insurance (Blue Cross Blue Shield, Farmers Group, GEICO, Liberty Mutual, State Farm, Travelers);</p><p>Big Tech (Yahoo, Facebook, Google, AT&amp;T, eBay, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Sony);</p><p>Big Soda (Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group);</p><p>Big Liquor (Seagram &amp; Sons, Hiram Walker, Miller-Coors);</p><p>Big Box Stores (Best Buy, Home Depot, JC Penney, Lowe's);</p><p>Big Auto (Ford, GM, Toyota, Chrysler).</p><p>ALEC's critics on the Left erroneously cite these cozy corporate ties as evidence of the corruption inherent in \"free market\" capitalism. But the ALEC/Obama P3 \"partnerships\" are the antithesis of genuine free markets, in which entrepreneurs risk their own capital - not that of the captive taxpayers - to build businesses that provide goods and services consumers freely choose to purchase, not those determined for them by politicians and government planners.</p><p>ALEC may have started out well with the right intentions to promote free enterprise and limited constitutional government - and some of its proposals still do support those worthy efforts - but, as we have shown here, on some very fundamental issues the organization has drifted far from core beliefs proclaimed in its motto. ALEC members who truly adhere to constitutionalist and free market principles would do well to examine the organization more closely and either direct it back on course or cut ties with it, so as not to support harmful legislation and discredit the principles they profess to support.</p><h>SIDEBAR</h><p>THE SECRECY OF THE TTIP/TPP PROCESS IS, IN AND OF ITSELF, A HUGE RED FLAG ALERTING ALL EXCEPT THE WILLFULLY BLIND THAT SOMETHING IS AMISS.</p><h>SIDEBAR</h><p>Pol it f cal/corporate influence: Former Utah governor, EPA administrator, and HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt addresses ALEC's 2004 convention, under a banner of ALEC corporate sponsor ExxonMobil.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photographs</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-3310257451</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C85-7D11-F0HW-518Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3584\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2014 The New American</copyright><publicationName>The New American</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0885-6540</issn><volume>Vol. 30</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>May 5, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

ALEC's \"about\" page expands on that theme, explaining:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The American Legislative Exchange Council works to advance limited government, free markets, and federalism at the state level through a nonpartisan public-private partnership of America's state legislators, members of the private sector and the general public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALEC's stated philosophy and goals resonate with liberty-minded Americans, which, undoubtedly, is why many politically conservative state legislators and activist citizens look to it for leadership in rolling back the oppressive hand of Big Government. However, the well-funded and well-connected organization is alienating many of its erstwhile supporters by its support for dangerous trade pacts that threaten the sovereignty of the United States, as well as its efforts to promote a constitutional convention, which could result in the complete destruction of our already tattered and battered U.S. Constitution. That could spell the end of any hope to return to limited government, free markets, and responsible federalism.</p><p>Founded in 1973, ALEC has just celebrated its 40th anniversary and is experiencing both the joys of prominent national influence and the pains of harsh criticism. The organization can boast a membership that includes more than 2,000 state legislators and hundreds of corporations,'as well as dozens of think tanks, foundations, and non-profit organizations.</p><p>For the past several years ALEC has been under attack from a gaggle of leftwing organizations - Color of Change, Common Cause, People for the American Way, Progress Now, the Center for Media and Democracy, the Sierra Club - that claim the organization's corporate ties and corporate funding have put it in the pocket of big business. These and similar groups have lambasted ALEC for its model legislation opposing federal EPA regulations, gun control laws, \"green\" energy mandates, and \"climate change\" carbon taxes, and its support for laws supporting voter identification, \"Stand Your Ground\" protection, school choice, and privatization of public services. Major media outlets, such as the New York Times, Huffington Post, MSNBC, and CNN joined The Nation, Media Matters, and other radical-left detractors in attacking ALEC for these sins against the progressive gospel. The highly politicized shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 provided the key event that ALEC's critics could leverage to crack the organization's growing impact. Utilizing the media-created furor over the shooting, the left-wing activist groups launched a petition-pressure campaign that spotlighted ALEC's support for \"Stand Your Ground\" laws. The result was an exodus, as major corporations and legislators fled ALEC to avoid the controversy.</p><p>For many of ALEC's staunchest supporters, the attacks on the organization - and the liberal-left/progressive sources from which they usually emanate - only prove its bona fides as a defender of free enterprise and constitutional government. They should know better by now. The same alliance of left-wing activists and the liberal establishment media regularly confer legitimacy on false conservatives pseudo-conservatives and business lobbies that promote Big Government by attacking them for not being \"progressive\" enough. Examples abound: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Bob Dole, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Manufacturing Association, the American Medical Association - to name but a very small cohort. These politicians and organizations have excelled at co-opting the rhetoric of free markets and limited government, but often go in exactly the opposite direction. In the remainder of this article, we will examine several of the areas where we contend ALEC is following a similarly deceptive path.</p><p>Trading Away Sovereignty</p><p>At its Model Policies Annual Meeting 2013, ALEC members adopted a \"Resolution Supporting the Successful Negotiation of a Comprehensive and Commercially Meaningful Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).\" The summary of the resolution, provided on ALEC's website, states:</p><p>The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) Agreement has the potential to be the largest trade framework ever negotiated underscoring the importance of ensuring that it is a high standard, comprehensive agreement with strong intellectual property provisions. In keeping with the American Legislative Exchange Council's (ALEC's) support of the Jeffersonian principle of free markets and ALEC's past support of a wide variety of trade frameworks, this resolution supports the negotiation and final ratification of such an agreement.</p><p>Similarly, the organization has adopted a \"Resolution Urging Congress to Pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP).\" The resolution summary states:</p><p>Drawing on ALEC's guiding free market principles, this resolution calls on Congress to support negotiations for a high standard, comprehensive Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).... The TPP has the potential to become the benchmark against which future trade frameworks will be measured for years to come.</p><p>The TTIP's promoters portray it as a \"trade\" agreement between the United States and the 28 member states of the European Union, while the TPP advocates similarly claim they are merely working to expand trade between the United States and 11 Pacific partners: Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, and Japan. The trade engendered by these agreements, say the promoters, will bring prosperity to all, including millions of promised good-paying jobs. Regular readers of The New American are already well aware of the many dangers posed by the TTIP and the TPP, which are being pushed aggressively by the Obama administration and the usual globalist elites at the New York Times, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Brookings Institution, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Among the many articles we have published, in our print edition and online, are the comprehensive \"Secretly Trading Away Our Independence,\" from our May 20, 2013 print edition, and the entire special issue of our September 2, 2013 magazine devoted to the topic, \"How the Free Trade Agenda Is Knocking Down America\" (available as a free pdf download at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thenewamerican.com/files/TNA2917.pdf\">http://www.thenewamerican.com/files/TNA2917.pdf</url>).</p><p>One of the most important facts, if not the most important, to know about both the TTIP and TPP is that they would, if adopted, steadily strip away our national sovereignty, allowing the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations, as well as regional tribunals and regulatory bodies created by these agreements, to override our local, state, and federal laws. This feature alone makes them very subversive, revolutionary proposals that should be opposed by every elected or appointed official who has taken an oath to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" This is no longer a matter of theoretical speculation; as The New American has reported previously, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the WTO agreement have amply proved this. As a result of adopting both of those agreements, NAFTA and WTO rules and rulings increasingly trump our laws.</p><p>Liberty-minded Americans who truly believe in the rule of law and the form of limited government envisioned by our Founders should be working to remove our country from these freedom-destroying organizations, not subjecting us to even more of the same. Even if the agreements dealt only with \"trade\" issues, the structures and procedures they set in place would be pregnant with dangers because they initiate a developing, ongoing process that is a guarantee of \"mission creep,\" with an ever-expanding transnational bureaucracy claiming ever more power over our personal, local, state, and national affairs. Obama administration officials acknowledge that the TTIP/TPP agreements deal with agriculture, environment, labor, telecommunications, financial services, and much more. And documents that have been leaked thus far have revealed additional dangers, such as TPP draft proposals that would dramatically curtail free speech on the Internet.</p><p>Another disturbing feature of both the TTIP and TPP is the secrecy and intrigue that have become their hallmarks. The American people and their elected representatives in Congress have not been allowed access to the TTIP/TPP negotiation process, nor have they been allowed to see the draft text of the agreements. However, the Obama administration has given representatives of major corporations, labor unions, environmental organizations, and other NGO activist \"stakeholders\" official access to both the negotiation proceedings and the texts. Thus the TTIP and TPP have become a joint project of Big Government, Big Business, Big Labor, and Big Green (although the Big Labor/Big Green contingents pretend to oppose at least some features of the agreements). The secrecy of the TTIP/TPP process is, in and of itself, a huge red flag alerting all except the willfully blind that something is amiss. ALEC should find this aspect of TTIP/TPP thoroughly objectionable, since it has made a pointed commitment to transparency in government. A perusal of ALEC literature and the organization's \"model policies\" web page reveals numerous bills sponsored by ALEC devoted to transparency and criticizing officialdom for withholding information from citizens. The Transparency and Government Accountability Act, Local Government Transparency Act, and the Taxpayer Transparency Act are but three of many model bills crafted by ALEC demanding openness and access for citizens.</p><p>Yet still another strike against the TTIP and TPP is the explicit admissions by the top promoters that they intend these agreements to initiate an \"integration\" process that will continually \"widen\" (adding more nations) and \"deepen\" (adding more economic, political, and social issues) with time. This is the same widen ing-deepening integration process that has gradually transformed the Common Market \"trade\" bloc into the increasingly tyrannical EU leviathan ruled by central authorities in Brussels. And TTIP/TPP champions have repeatedly expressed their hopes of following the EU path toward centralized power. As of yet, ALEC has not explained how it can square its \"Limited Government, Free Markets, and Federalism\" philosophy with these TTIP/TPP flaws that are completely at variance with it.</p><p>Constitutional Malpractice</p><p>For many years ALEC has been a leading promoter of the idea that the U.S. Constitution must be amended to require a balanced budget. This, of course, appeals to conservatively minded legislators who recognize that continued liberal spendthrift policies are immoral and unsustainable, and lead our nation toward financial Armageddon. ALEC has used the Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) attraction to argue for an Article V Convention of the States, which constitutionalists (including the editors and writers of this magazine) contend is a dangerous gamble that risks the entire Constitution for an amendment that could not be relied on to rein in Washington, D.C.'s ravenous appetite for spending - even if the convention could be restricted to that one issue. The problem is that, ALEC's assurances to the contrary, once a constitutional convention is called, it becomes a power unto itself and there is no way to limit its power to amend, revise, or toss out and completely rewrite the Constitution. ALEC claims that fears of a \"runaway convention\" of this sort are misplaced, and they have published Article V: A Handbook for State Lawmakers to make their case for a constitutional convention (aka Article V convention)! They have also produced a \"Resolution for Limitations on Authority of Delegates to a 'Convention for Proposing Amendments' (Article V, United States of America Constitution).\" This resolution, says ALEC,\"will eliminate the possibility of a 'runaway convention,' the reason most often cited by scholars for their opposition to an Article V Convention. The resolution restricts delegates to work only on those amendments authorized in their legislative instructions and calls for the immediate recall of any delegate that works on an unauthorized amendment.\"</p><p>But in making this claim, ALEC is on very shaky ground. This is clear, first of all, from our nation's own history. Our first - and so far, only - constitutional convention, which took place in Philadelphia in 1787, was a \"runaway convention,\" despite restrictions on delegates similar to those advocated by ALEC. That gathering, in violation of its mandate, threw out the Articles of Confederation that it had been convened to amend, and drew up a completely new governing document. The fact that the product of that breach of trust turned out to be as sound and salutary as it has proved to be should not incite hope that a repeat of the same process would end so well.</p><p>James Madison, often referred to as the \"father\" of the Constitution, said the contemplation of another constitutional convention caused him to \"tremble\" due to the violent partisanship and \"insidious views\" so prevalent in his day. Have things so improved that we should be less concerned in our own day? Who but a fool or a knave would say so? Madison warned:</p><p>If a General Convention were to take place for the avowed and sole purpose of revising the Constitution, it would naturally consider itself as having a greater latitude than the Congress appointed to administer and support as well as to amend the system; it would consequently give greater agitation to the public mind; an election into it would be courted by the most violent partizans [sic] on both sides [and] would no doubt contain individuals of insidious views, who under the mask of seeking alterations popular in some parts but inadmissible in other parts of the Union might have a dangerous opportunity of sapping the very foundations of the fabric.</p><p>\"Under all these circumstances it seems scarcely to be presumeable [sic] that the deliberations of the body could be conducted in harmony, or terminate in the general good,\" he averred. \"Having witnessed the difficulties and dangers experienced by the first Convention which assembled under every propitious circumstance,\" Madison concluded, \"I should tremble for the result of a second meeting in the present temper of America, and under all the disadvantages I have mentioned.\"</p><p>Noted constitutional scholars of our own time from across the political spectrum - from liberal Supreme Court Justices Warren Burger and Arthur Goldberg to Professors Lawrence Tribe of Harvard and Gerald Gunther of Stanford (both liberals) to Professors Charles Rice of Notre Dame and Rex Lee of Brigham Young (both conservatives) - have echoed Madison, offering their learned opinions that a constitutional convention cannot be limited in its scope, either by Congress or state legislatures. We can say for certain that regardless of the out- come of such a convention there would be dissatisfied factions that would challenge the final product, causing a constitutional impasse and, most probably, sending the whole issue before the U.S. Supreme Court, which has hardly proven to be a staunch defender of limited government. The end result well could be that our U.S. Constitution, which ALEC claims to support, would become a dead letter if ALEC's \"free trade\" agenda were to come to fruition.</p><p>Government-Business Cronyism</p><p>Still another area of concern to ALEC's critics on both the Right and Left is the organization's support for \"public-private partnerships.\" ALEC's model legislation for states promotes a \"Public-Private Partnership (P3) Authority Act,\" the summary of which states:</p><p>This Act establishes a state Partnership Committee and an Office of Public-Private Partnerships to identify and establish public-private partnerships and approve qualified bidders, requests for proposals, and template contracts. The Act is designed to improve public operational efficiency and environmental performance, promote public safety, attract private investment in the state, and minimize governmental liabilities.</p><p>In this area, the supposedly \"conservative\" ALEC is perfectly in step with the \"progressive\" Obama administration, which has made public-private partnerships (P3) a centerpiece of its statist program. And many of ALEC's member corporations are also partners in Obama's Fedgov/Big Business \"Manufacturing Innovation\" consortiums and other P3 endeavors. Those favored corporate cronies include such well-known names as Boeing, General Electric, Microsoft, Caterpillar, Dow Chemical, ALCOA, and ExxonMobil. Hillary Clinton, while Obama's secretary of state, launched the administration's P3 Global Partnership Initiative, spreading hundreds billions of dollars in corporate welfare to the well-connected.</p><p>ALEC is in the forefront of spreading the P3 gospel at the state level, along with its progressive partner, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (USCC), which, like ALEC, talks a good game of \"free markets\" while actually promoting corporate subsidies and economic fascism. \"Fascism,\" writes Lew Rockwell, president of the genuinely free market-oriented Ludwig von Mises Institute, \"is the system of government that cartelizes the private sector, centrally plans the economy to subsidize producers, exalts the police state as the source of order, denies fundamental rights and liberties to individuals, and makes the executive state the unlimited master of society.\" And it is precisely this kind of cartelized, centrally planned, fascist economy that the ALEC/USCC/ Obama/corporate alliance is producing.</p><p>ALEC's corporate P3 members are well represented by:</p><p>Big Pharma (Abbott, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Genetech, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer);</p><p>Big Farm (Altria Group, Archer Daniels Midland, Kraft Food, J.R. Simplot, Monsanto);</p><p>Big Oil (Shell, BP, Peabody, Marathon, Texaco, Tenneco, Chevron, ExxonMobil);</p><p>Big Banking (Bank of America, Coldwell Banker, Wells Fargo, First Chicago NBD);</p><p>Big Gambling (Hollywood Casino Corp., Argosy Gaming Co., Boyd Gaming Corp., GTECH Corp.);</p><p>Big Media (Cox Communications, Comcast, the Wall Street Journal, News Corp., Thompson Reuters, Time Warner Cable);</p><p>Big Insurance (Blue Cross Blue Shield, Farmers Group, GEICO, Liberty Mutual, State Farm, Travelers);</p><p>Big Tech (Yahoo, Facebook, Google, AT&amp;T, eBay, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Sony);</p><p>Big Soda (Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group);</p><p>Big Liquor (Seagram &amp; Sons, Hiram Walker, Miller-Coors);</p><p>Big Box Stores (Best Buy, Home Depot, JC Penney, Lowe's);</p><p>Big Auto (Ford, GM, Toyota, Chrysler).</p><p>ALEC's critics on the Left erroneously cite these cozy corporate ties as evidence of the corruption inherent in \"free market\" capitalism. But the ALEC/Obama P3 \"partnerships\" are the antithesis of genuine free markets, in which entrepreneurs risk their own capital - not that of the captive taxpayers - to build businesses that provide goods and services consumers freely choose to purchase, not those determined for them by politicians and government planners.</p><p>ALEC may have started out well with the right intentions to promote free enterprise and limited constitutional government - and some of its proposals still do support those worthy efforts - but, as we have shown here, on some very fundamental issues the organization has drifted far from core beliefs proclaimed in its motto. ALEC members who truly adhere to constitutionalist and free market principles would do well to examine the organization more closely and either direct it back on course or cut ties with it, so as not to support harmful legislation and discredit the principles they profess to support.</p><p>THE SECRECY OF THE TTIP/TPP PROCESS IS, IN AND OF ITSELF, A HUGE RED FLAG ALERTING ALL EXCEPT THE WILLFULLY BLIND THAT SOMETHING IS AMISS.</p><p>Pol it f cal/corporate influence: Former Utah governor, EPA administrator, and HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt addresses ALEC's 2004 convention, under a banner of ALEC corporate sponsor ExxonMobil.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-1526381068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9J-VNP1-DY0W-40SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2014 The New American May 5, 2014</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 30</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>May 5, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

ALEC's \"about\" page expands on that theme, explaining:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The American Legislative Exchange Council works to advance limited government, free markets, and federalism at the state level through a nonpartisan public-private partnership of America's state legislators, members of the private sector and the general public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALEC's stated philosophy and goals resonate with liberty-minded Americans, which, undoubtedly, is why many politically conservative state legislators and activist citizens look to it for leadership in rolling back the oppressive hand of Big Government. However, the well-funded and well-connected organization is alienating many of its erstwhile supporters by its support for dangerous trade pacts that threaten the sovereignty of the United States, as well as its efforts to promote a constitutional convention, which could result in the complete destruction of our already tattered and battered U.S. Constitution. That could spell the end of any hope to return to limited government, free markets, and responsible federalism.</p><p>Founded in 1973, ALEC has just celebrated its 40th anniversary and is experiencing both the joys of prominent national influence and the pains of harsh criticism. The organization can boast a membership that includes more than 2,000 state legislators and hundreds of corporations,'as well as dozens of think tanks, foundations, and non-profit organizations.</p><p>For the past several years ALEC has been under attack from a gaggle of leftwing organizations - Color of Change, Common Cause, People for the American Way, Progress Now, the Center for Media and Democracy, the Sierra Club - that claim the organization's corporate ties and corporate funding have put it in the pocket of big business. These and similar groups have lambasted ALEC for its model legislation opposing federal EPA regulations, gun control laws, \"green\" energy mandates, and \"climate change\" carbon taxes, and its support for laws supporting voter identification, \"Stand Your Ground\" protection, school choice, and privatization of public services. Major media outlets, such as the New York Times, Huffington Post, MSNBC, and CNN joined The Nation, Media Matters, and other radical-left detractors in attacking ALEC for these sins against the progressive gospel. The highly politicized shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 provided the key event that ALEC's critics could leverage to crack the organization's growing impact. Utilizing the media-created furor over the shooting, the left-wing activist groups launched a petition-pressure campaign that spotlighted ALEC's support for \"Stand Your Ground\" laws. The result was an exodus, as major corporations and legislators fled ALEC to avoid the controversy.</p><p>For many of ALEC's staunchest supporters, the attacks on the organization - and the liberal-left/progressive sources from which they usually emanate - only prove its bona fides as a defender of free enterprise and constitutional government. They should know better by now. The same alliance of left-wing activists and the liberal establishment media regularly confer legitimacy on false conservatives pseudo-conservatives and business lobbies that promote Big Government by attacking them for not being \"progressive\" enough. Examples abound: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Bob Dole, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Manufacturing Association, the American Medical Association - to name but a very small cohort. These politicians and organizations have excelled at co-opting the rhetoric of free markets and limited government, but often go in exactly the opposite direction. In the remainder of this article, we will examine several of the areas where we contend ALEC is following a similarly deceptive path.</p><p>Trading Away Sovereignty</p><p>At its Model Policies Annual Meeting 2013, ALEC members adopted a \"Resolution Supporting the Successful Negotiation of a Comprehensive and Commercially Meaningful Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).\" The summary of the resolution, provided on ALEC's website, states:</p><p>The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) Agreement has the potential to be the largest trade framework ever negotiated underscoring the importance of ensuring that it is a high standard, comprehensive agreement with strong intellectual property provisions. In keeping with the American Legislative Exchange Council's (ALEC's) support of the Jeffersonian principle of free markets and ALEC's past support of a wide variety of trade frameworks, this resolution supports the negotiation and final ratification of such an agreement.</p><p>Similarly, the organization has adopted a \"Resolution Urging Congress to Pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP).\" The resolution summary states:</p><p>Drawing on ALEC's guiding free market principles, this resolution calls on Congress to support negotiations for a high standard, comprehensive Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).... The TPP has the potential to become the benchmark against which future trade frameworks will be measured for years to come.</p><p>The TTIP's promoters portray it as a \"trade\" agreement between the United States and the 28 member states of the European Union, while the TPP advocates similarly claim they are merely working to expand trade between the United States and 11 Pacific partners: Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, and Japan. The trade engendered by these agreements, say the promoters, will bring prosperity to all, including millions of promised good-paying jobs. Regular readers of The New American are already well aware of the many dangers posed by the TTIP and the TPP, which are being pushed aggressively by the Obama administration and the usual globalist elites at the New York Times, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Brookings Institution, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Among the many articles we have published, in our print edition and online, are the comprehensive \"Secretly Trading Away Our Independence,\" from our May 20, 2013 print edition, and the entire special issue of our September 2, 2013 magazine devoted to the topic, \"How the Free Trade Agenda Is Knocking Down America\" (available as a free pdf download at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thenewamerican.com/files/TNA2917.pdf\">http://www.thenewamerican.com/files/TNA2917.pdf</url>).</p><p>One of the most important facts, if not the most important, to know about both the TTIP and TPP is that they would, if adopted, steadily strip away our national sovereignty, allowing the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations, as well as regional tribunals and regulatory bodies created by these agreements, to override our local, state, and federal laws. This feature alone makes them very subversive, revolutionary proposals that should be opposed by every elected or appointed official who has taken an oath to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" This is no longer a matter of theoretical speculation; as The New American has reported previously, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the WTO agreement have amply proved this. As a result of adopting both of those agreements, NAFTA and WTO rules and rulings increasingly trump our laws.</p><p>Liberty-minded Americans who truly believe in the rule of law and the form of limited government envisioned by our Founders should be working to remove our country from these freedom-destroying organizations, not subjecting us to even more of the same. Even if the agreements dealt only with \"trade\" issues, the structures and procedures they set in place would be pregnant with dangers because they initiate a developing, ongoing process that is a guarantee of \"mission creep,\" with an ever-expanding transnational bureaucracy claiming ever more power over our personal, local, state, and national affairs. Obama administration officials acknowledge that the TTIP/TPP agreements deal with agriculture, environment, labor, telecommunications, financial services, and much more. And documents that have been leaked thus far have revealed additional dangers, such as TPP draft proposals that would dramatically curtail free speech on the Internet.</p><p>Another disturbing feature of both the TTIP and TPP is the secrecy and intrigue that have become their hallmarks. The American people and their elected representatives in Congress have not been allowed access to the TTIP/TPP negotiation process, nor have they been allowed to see the draft text of the agreements. However, the Obama administration has given representatives of major corporations, labor unions, environmental organizations, and other NGO activist \"stakeholders\" official access to both the negotiation proceedings and the texts. Thus the TTIP and TPP have become a joint project of Big Government, Big Business, Big Labor, and Big Green (although the Big Labor/Big Green contingents pretend to oppose at least some features of the agreements). The secrecy of the TTIP/TPP process is, in and of itself, a huge red flag alerting all except the willfully blind that something is amiss. ALEC should find this aspect of TTIP/TPP thoroughly objectionable, since it has made a pointed commitment to transparency in government. A perusal of ALEC literature and the organization's \"model policies\" web page reveals numerous bills sponsored by ALEC devoted to transparency and criticizing officialdom for withholding information from citizens. The Transparency and Government Accountability Act, Local Government Transparency Act, and the Taxpayer Transparency Act are but three of many model bills crafted by ALEC demanding openness and access for citizens.</p><p>Yet still another strike against the TTIP and TPP is the explicit admissions by the top promoters that they intend these agreements to initiate an \"integration\" process that will continually \"widen\" (adding more nations) and \"deepen\" (adding more economic, political, and social issues) with time. This is the same widen ing-deepening integration process that has gradually transformed the Common Market \"trade\" bloc into the increasingly tyrannical EU leviathan ruled by central authorities in Brussels. And TTIP/TPP champions have repeatedly expressed their hopes of following the EU path toward centralized power. As of yet, ALEC has not explained how it can square its \"Limited Government, Free Markets, and Federalism\" philosophy with these TTIP/TPP flaws that are completely at variance with it.</p><p>Constitutional Malpractice</p><p>For many years ALEC has been a leading promoter of the idea that the U.S. Constitution must be amended to require a balanced budget. This, of course, appeals to conservatively minded legislators who recognize that continued liberal spendthrift policies are immoral and unsustainable, and lead our nation toward financial Armageddon. ALEC has used the Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) attraction to argue for an Article V Convention of the States, which constitutionalists (including the editors and writers of this magazine) contend is a dangerous gamble that risks the entire Constitution for an amendment that could not be relied on to rein in Washington, D.C.'s ravenous appetite for spending - even if the convention could be restricted to that one issue. The problem is that, ALEC's assurances to the contrary, once a constitutional convention is called, it becomes a power unto itself and there is no way to limit its power to amend, revise, or toss out and completely rewrite the Constitution. ALEC claims that fears of a \"runaway convention\" of this sort are misplaced, and they have published Article V: A Handbook for State Lawmakers to make their case for a constitutional convention (aka Article V convention)! They have also produced a \"Resolution for Limitations on Authority of Delegates to a 'Convention for Proposing Amendments' (Article V, United States of America Constitution).\" This resolution, says ALEC,\"will eliminate the possibility of a 'runaway convention,' the reason most often cited by scholars for their opposition to an Article V Convention. The resolution restricts delegates to work only on those amendments authorized in their legislative instructions and calls for the immediate recall of any delegate that works on an unauthorized amendment.\"</p><p>But in making this claim, ALEC is on very shaky ground. This is clear, first of all, from our nation's own history. Our first - and so far, only - constitutional convention, which took place in Philadelphia in 1787, was a \"runaway convention,\" despite restrictions on delegates similar to those advocated by ALEC. That gathering, in violation of its mandate, threw out the Articles of Confederation that it had been convened to amend, and drew up a completely new governing document. The fact that the product of that breach of trust turned out to be as sound and salutary as it has proved to be should not incite hope that a repeat of the same process would end so well.</p><p>James Madison, often referred to as the \"father\" of the Constitution, said the contemplation of another constitutional convention caused him to \"tremble\" due to the violent partisanship and \"insidious views\" so prevalent in his day. Have things so improved that we should be less concerned in our own day? Who but a fool or a knave would say so? Madison warned:</p><p>If a General Convention were to take place for the avowed and sole purpose of revising the Constitution, it would naturally consider itself as having a greater latitude than the Congress appointed to administer and support as well as to amend the system; it would consequently give greater agitation to the public mind; an election into it would be courted by the most violent partizans [sic] on both sides [and] would no doubt contain individuals of insidious views, who under the mask of seeking alterations popular in some parts but inadmissible in other parts of the Union might have a dangerous opportunity of sapping the very foundations of the fabric.</p><p>\"Under all these circumstances it seems scarcely to be presumeable [sic] that the deliberations of the body could be conducted in harmony, or terminate in the general good,\" he averred. \"Having witnessed the difficulties and dangers experienced by the first Convention which assembled under every propitious circumstance,\" Madison concluded, \"I should tremble for the result of a second meeting in the present temper of America, and under all the disadvantages I have mentioned.\"</p><p>Noted constitutional scholars of our own time from across the political spectrum - from liberal Supreme Court Justices Warren Burger and Arthur Goldberg to Professors Lawrence Tribe of Harvard and Gerald Gunther of Stanford (both liberals) to Professors Charles Rice of Notre Dame and Rex Lee of Brigham Young (both conservatives) - have echoed Madison, offering their learned opinions that a constitutional convention cannot be limited in its scope, either by Congress or state legislatures. We can say for certain that regardless of the out- come of such a convention there would be dissatisfied factions that would challenge the final product, causing a constitutional impasse and, most probably, sending the whole issue before the U.S. Supreme Court, which has hardly proven to be a staunch defender of limited government. The end result well could be that our U.S. Constitution, which ALEC claims to support, would become a dead letter if ALEC's \"free trade\" agenda were to come to fruition.</p><p>Government-Business Cronyism</p><p>Still another area of concern to ALEC's critics on both the Right and Left is the organization's support for \"public-private partnerships.\" ALEC's model legislation for states promotes a \"Public-Private Partnership (P3) Authority Act,\" the summary of which states:</p><p>This Act establishes a state Partnership Committee and an Office of Public-Private Partnerships to identify and establish public-private partnerships and approve qualified bidders, requests for proposals, and template contracts. The Act is designed to improve public operational efficiency and environmental performance, promote public safety, attract private investment in the state, and minimize governmental liabilities.</p><p>In this area, the supposedly \"conservative\" ALEC is perfectly in step with the \"progressive\" Obama administration, which has made public-private partnerships (P3) a centerpiece of its statist program. And many of ALEC's member corporations are also partners in Obama's Fedgov/Big Business \"Manufacturing Innovation\" consortiums and other P3 endeavors. Those favored corporate cronies include such well-known names as Boeing, General Electric, Microsoft, Caterpillar, Dow Chemical, ALCOA, and ExxonMobil. Hillary Clinton, while Obama's secretary of state, launched the administration's P3 Global Partnership Initiative, spreading hundreds billions of dollars in corporate welfare to the well-connected.</p><p>ALEC is in the forefront of spreading the P3 gospel at the state level, along with its progressive partner, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (USCC), which, like ALEC, talks a good game of \"free markets\" while actually promoting corporate subsidies and economic fascism. \"Fascism,\" writes Lew Rockwell, president of the genuinely free market-oriented Ludwig von Mises Institute, \"is the system of government that cartelizes the private sector, centrally plans the economy to subsidize producers, exalts the police state as the source of order, denies fundamental rights and liberties to individuals, and makes the executive state the unlimited master of society.\" And it is precisely this kind of cartelized, centrally planned, fascist economy that the ALEC/USCC/ Obama/corporate alliance is producing.</p><p>ALEC's corporate P3 members are well represented by:</p><p>Big Pharma (Abbott, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Genetech, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer);</p><p>Big Farm (Altria Group, Archer Daniels Midland, Kraft Food, J.R. Simplot, Monsanto);</p><p>Big Oil (Shell, BP, Peabody, Marathon, Texaco, Tenneco, Chevron, ExxonMobil);</p><p>Big Banking (Bank of America, Coldwell Banker, Wells Fargo, First Chicago NBD);</p><p>Big Gambling (Hollywood Casino Corp., Argosy Gaming Co., Boyd Gaming Corp., GTECH Corp.);</p><p>Big Media (Cox Communications, Comcast, the Wall Street Journal, News Corp., Thompson Reuters, Time Warner Cable);</p><p>Big Insurance (Blue Cross Blue Shield, Farmers Group, GEICO, Liberty Mutual, State Farm, Travelers);</p><p>Big Tech (Yahoo, Facebook, Google, AT&amp;T, eBay, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Sony);</p><p>Big Soda (Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group);</p><p>Big Liquor (Seagram &amp; Sons, Hiram Walker, Miller-Coors);</p><p>Big Box Stores (Best Buy, Home Depot, JC Penney, Lowe's);</p><p>Big Auto (Ford, GM, Toyota, Chrysler).</p><p>ALEC's critics on the Left erroneously cite these cozy corporate ties as evidence of the corruption inherent in \"free market\" capitalism. But the ALEC/Obama P3 \"partnerships\" are the antithesis of genuine free markets, in which entrepreneurs risk their own capital - not that of the captive taxpayers - to build businesses that provide goods and services consumers freely choose to purchase, not those determined for them by politicians and government planners.</p><p>ALEC may have started out well with the right intentions to promote free enterprise and limited constitutional government - and some of its proposals still do support those worthy efforts - but, as we have shown here, on some very fundamental issues the organization has drifted far from core beliefs proclaimed in its motto. ALEC members who truly adhere to constitutionalist and free market principles would do well to examine the organization more closely and either direct it back on course or cut ties with it, so as not to support harmful legislation and discredit the principles they profess to support.</p><p>THE SECRECY OF THE TTIP/TPP PROCESS IS, IN AND OF ITSELF, A HUGE RED FLAG ALERTING ALL EXCEPT THE WILLFULLY BLIND THAT SOMETHING IS AMISS.</p><p>Pol it f cal/corporate influence: Former Utah governor, EPA administrator, and HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt addresses ALEC's 2004 convention, under a banner of ALEC corporate sponsor ExxonMobil.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-1526381068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCJ-3S61-JBHT-D0FY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2014 The New American May 5, 2014</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 30</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>May 5, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

ALEC's \"about\" page expands on that theme, explaining:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The American Legislative Exchange Council works to advance limited government, free markets, and federalism at the state level through a nonpartisan public-private partnership of America's state legislators, members of the private sector and the general public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALEC's stated philosophy and goals resonate with liberty-minded Americans, which, undoubtedly, is why many politically conservative state legislators and activist citizens look to it for leadership in rolling back the oppressive hand of Big Government. However, the well-funded and well-connected organization is alienating many of its erstwhile supporters by its support for dangerous trade pacts that threaten the sovereignty of the United States, as well as its efforts to promote a constitutional convention, which could result in the complete destruction of our already tattered and battered U.S. Constitution. That could spell the end of any hope to return to limited government, free markets, and responsible federalism.</p><p>Founded in 1973, ALEC has just celebrated its 40th anniversary and is experiencing both the joys of prominent national influence and the pains of harsh criticism. The organization can boast a membership that includes more than 2,000 state legislators and hundreds of corporations,'as well as dozens of think tanks, foundations, and non-profit organizations.</p><p>For the past several years ALEC has been under attack from a gaggle of leftwing organizations - Color of Change, Common Cause, People for the American Way, Progress Now, the Center for Media and Democracy, the Sierra Club - that claim the organization's corporate ties and corporate funding have put it in the pocket of big business. These and similar groups have lambasted ALEC for its model legislation opposing federal EPA regulations, gun control laws, \"green\" energy mandates, and \"climate change\" carbon taxes, and its support for laws supporting voter identification, \"Stand Your Ground\" protection, school choice, and privatization of public services. Major media outlets, such as the New York Times, Huffington Post, MSNBC, and CNN joined The Nation, Media Matters, and other radical-left detractors in attacking ALEC for these sins against the progressive gospel. The highly politicized shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 provided the key event that ALEC's critics could leverage to crack the organization's growing impact. Utilizing the media-created furor over the shooting, the left-wing activist groups launched a petition-pressure campaign that spotlighted ALEC's support for \"Stand Your Ground\" laws. The result was an exodus, as major corporations and legislators fled ALEC to avoid the controversy.</p><p>For many of ALEC's staunchest supporters, the attacks on the organization - and the liberal-left/progressive sources from which they usually emanate - only prove its bona fides as a defender of free enterprise and constitutional government. They should know better by now. The same alliance of left-wing activists and the liberal establishment media regularly confer legitimacy on false conservatives pseudo-conservatives and business lobbies that promote Big Government by attacking them for not being \"progressive\" enough. Examples abound: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Bob Dole, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Manufacturing Association, the American Medical Association - to name but a very small cohort. These politicians and organizations have excelled at co-opting the rhetoric of free markets and limited government, but often go in exactly the opposite direction. In the remainder of this article, we will examine several of the areas where we contend ALEC is following a similarly deceptive path.</p><p>Trading Away Sovereignty</p><p>At its Model Policies Annual Meeting 2013, ALEC members adopted a \"Resolution Supporting the Successful Negotiation of a Comprehensive and Commercially Meaningful Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).\" The summary of the resolution, provided on ALEC's website, states:</p><p>The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) Agreement has the potential to be the largest trade framework ever negotiated underscoring the importance of ensuring that it is a high standard, comprehensive agreement with strong intellectual property provisions. In keeping with the American Legislative Exchange Council's (ALEC's) support of the Jeffersonian principle of free markets and ALEC's past support of a wide variety of trade frameworks, this resolution supports the negotiation and final ratification of such an agreement.</p><p>Similarly, the organization has adopted a \"Resolution Urging Congress to Pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP).\" The resolution summary states:</p><p>Drawing on ALEC's guiding free market principles, this resolution calls on Congress to support negotiations for a high standard, comprehensive Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).... The TPP has the potential to become the benchmark against which future trade frameworks will be measured for years to come.</p><p>The TTIP's promoters portray it as a \"trade\" agreement between the United States and the 28 member states of the European Union, while the TPP advocates similarly claim they are merely working to expand trade between the United States and 11 Pacific partners: Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, and Japan. The trade engendered by these agreements, say the promoters, will bring prosperity to all, including millions of promised good-paying jobs. Regular readers of The New American are already well aware of the many dangers posed by the TTIP and the TPP, which are being pushed aggressively by the Obama administration and the usual globalist elites at the New York Times, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Brookings Institution, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Among the many articles we have published, in our print edition and online, are the comprehensive \"Secretly Trading Away Our Independence,\" from our May 20, 2013 print edition, and the entire special issue of our September 2, 2013 magazine devoted to the topic, \"How the Free Trade Agenda Is Knocking Down America\" (available as a free pdf download at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thenewamerican.com/files/TNA2917.pdf\">http://www.thenewamerican.com/files/TNA2917.pdf</url>).</p><p>One of the most important facts, if not the most important, to know about both the TTIP and TPP is that they would, if adopted, steadily strip away our national sovereignty, allowing the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations, as well as regional tribunals and regulatory bodies created by these agreements, to override our local, state, and federal laws. This feature alone makes them very subversive, revolutionary proposals that should be opposed by every elected or appointed official who has taken an oath to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" This is no longer a matter of theoretical speculation; as The New American has reported previously, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the WTO agreement have amply proved this. As a result of adopting both of those agreements, NAFTA and WTO rules and rulings increasingly trump our laws.</p><p>Liberty-minded Americans who truly believe in the rule of law and the form of limited government envisioned by our Founders should be working to remove our country from these freedom-destroying organizations, not subjecting us to even more of the same. Even if the agreements dealt only with \"trade\" issues, the structures and procedures they set in place would be pregnant with dangers because they initiate a developing, ongoing process that is a guarantee of \"mission creep,\" with an ever-expanding transnational bureaucracy claiming ever more power over our personal, local, state, and national affairs. Obama administration officials acknowledge that the TTIP/TPP agreements deal with agriculture, environment, labor, telecommunications, financial services, and much more. And documents that have been leaked thus far have revealed additional dangers, such as TPP draft proposals that would dramatically curtail free speech on the Internet.</p><p>Another disturbing feature of both the TTIP and TPP is the secrecy and intrigue that have become their hallmarks. The American people and their elected representatives in Congress have not been allowed access to the TTIP/TPP negotiation process, nor have they been allowed to see the draft text of the agreements. However, the Obama administration has given representatives of major corporations, labor unions, environmental organizations, and other NGO activist \"stakeholders\" official access to both the negotiation proceedings and the texts. Thus the TTIP and TPP have become a joint project of Big Government, Big Business, Big Labor, and Big Green (although the Big Labor/Big Green contingents pretend to oppose at least some features of the agreements). The secrecy of the TTIP/TPP process is, in and of itself, a huge red flag alerting all except the willfully blind that something is amiss. ALEC should find this aspect of TTIP/TPP thoroughly objectionable, since it has made a pointed commitment to transparency in government. A perusal of ALEC literature and the organization's \"model policies\" web page reveals numerous bills sponsored by ALEC devoted to transparency and criticizing officialdom for withholding information from citizens. The Transparency and Government Accountability Act, Local Government Transparency Act, and the Taxpayer Transparency Act are but three of many model bills crafted by ALEC demanding openness and access for citizens.</p><p>Yet still another strike against the TTIP and TPP is the explicit admissions by the top promoters that they intend these agreements to initiate an \"integration\" process that will continually \"widen\" (adding more nations) and \"deepen\" (adding more economic, political, and social issues) with time. This is the same widen ing-deepening integration process that has gradually transformed the Common Market \"trade\" bloc into the increasingly tyrannical EU leviathan ruled by central authorities in Brussels. And TTIP/TPP champions have repeatedly expressed their hopes of following the EU path toward centralized power. As of yet, ALEC has not explained how it can square its \"Limited Government, Free Markets, and Federalism\" philosophy with these TTIP/TPP flaws that are completely at variance with it.</p><p>Constitutional Malpractice</p><p>For many years ALEC has been a leading promoter of the idea that the U.S. Constitution must be amended to require a balanced budget. This, of course, appeals to conservatively minded legislators who recognize that continued liberal spendthrift policies are immoral and unsustainable, and lead our nation toward financial Armageddon. ALEC has used the Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) attraction to argue for an Article V Convention of the States, which constitutionalists (including the editors and writers of this magazine) contend is a dangerous gamble that risks the entire Constitution for an amendment that could not be relied on to rein in Washington, D.C.'s ravenous appetite for spending - even if the convention could be restricted to that one issue. The problem is that, ALEC's assurances to the contrary, once a constitutional convention is called, it becomes a power unto itself and there is no way to limit its power to amend, revise, or toss out and completely rewrite the Constitution. ALEC claims that fears of a \"runaway convention\" of this sort are misplaced, and they have published Article V: A Handbook for State Lawmakers to make their case for a constitutional convention (aka Article V convention)! They have also produced a \"Resolution for Limitations on Authority of Delegates to a 'Convention for Proposing Amendments' (Article V, United States of America Constitution).\" This resolution, says ALEC,\"will eliminate the possibility of a 'runaway convention,' the reason most often cited by scholars for their opposition to an Article V Convention. The resolution restricts delegates to work only on those amendments authorized in their legislative instructions and calls for the immediate recall of any delegate that works on an unauthorized amendment.\"</p><p>But in making this claim, ALEC is on very shaky ground. This is clear, first of all, from our nation's own history. Our first - and so far, only - constitutional convention, which took place in Philadelphia in 1787, was a \"runaway convention,\" despite restrictions on delegates similar to those advocated by ALEC. That gathering, in violation of its mandate, threw out the Articles of Confederation that it had been convened to amend, and drew up a completely new governing document. The fact that the product of that breach of trust turned out to be as sound and salutary as it has proved to be should not incite hope that a repeat of the same process would end so well.</p><p>James Madison, often referred to as the \"father\" of the Constitution, said the contemplation of another constitutional convention caused him to \"tremble\" due to the violent partisanship and \"insidious views\" so prevalent in his day. Have things so improved that we should be less concerned in our own day? Who but a fool or a knave would say so? Madison warned:</p><p>If a General Convention were to take place for the avowed and sole purpose of revising the Constitution, it would naturally consider itself as having a greater latitude than the Congress appointed to administer and support as well as to amend the system; it would consequently give greater agitation to the public mind; an election into it would be courted by the most violent partizans [sic] on both sides [and] would no doubt contain individuals of insidious views, who under the mask of seeking alterations popular in some parts but inadmissible in other parts of the Union might have a dangerous opportunity of sapping the very foundations of the fabric.</p><p>\"Under all these circumstances it seems scarcely to be presumeable [sic] that the deliberations of the body could be conducted in harmony, or terminate in the general good,\" he averred. \"Having witnessed the difficulties and dangers experienced by the first Convention which assembled under every propitious circumstance,\" Madison concluded, \"I should tremble for the result of a second meeting in the present temper of America, and under all the disadvantages I have mentioned.\"</p><p>Noted constitutional scholars of our own time from across the political spectrum - from liberal Supreme Court Justices Warren Burger and Arthur Goldberg to Professors Lawrence Tribe of Harvard and Gerald Gunther of Stanford (both liberals) to Professors Charles Rice of Notre Dame and Rex Lee of Brigham Young (both conservatives) - have echoed Madison, offering their learned opinions that a constitutional convention cannot be limited in its scope, either by Congress or state legislatures. We can say for certain that regardless of the out- come of such a convention there would be dissatisfied factions that would challenge the final product, causing a constitutional impasse and, most probably, sending the whole issue before the U.S. Supreme Court, which has hardly proven to be a staunch defender of limited government. The end result well could be that our U.S. Constitution, which ALEC claims to support, would become a dead letter if ALEC's \"free trade\" agenda were to come to fruition.</p><p>Government-Business Cronyism</p><p>Still another area of concern to ALEC's critics on both the Right and Left is the organization's support for \"public-private partnerships.\" ALEC's model legislation for states promotes a \"Public-Private Partnership (P3) Authority Act,\" the summary of which states:</p><p>This Act establishes a state Partnership Committee and an Office of Public-Private Partnerships to identify and establish public-private partnerships and approve qualified bidders, requests for proposals, and template contracts. The Act is designed to improve public operational efficiency and environmental performance, promote public safety, attract private investment in the state, and minimize governmental liabilities.</p><p>In this area, the supposedly \"conservative\" ALEC is perfectly in step with the \"progressive\" Obama administration, which has made public-private partnerships (P3) a centerpiece of its statist program. And many of ALEC's member corporations are also partners in Obama's Fedgov/Big Business \"Manufacturing Innovation\" consortiums and other P3 endeavors. Those favored corporate cronies include such well-known names as Boeing, General Electric, Microsoft, Caterpillar, Dow Chemical, ALCOA, and ExxonMobil. Hillary Clinton, while Obama's secretary of state, launched the administration's P3 Global Partnership Initiative, spreading hundreds billions of dollars in corporate welfare to the well-connected.</p><p>ALEC is in the forefront of spreading the P3 gospel at the state level, along with its progressive partner, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (USCC), which, like ALEC, talks a good game of \"free markets\" while actually promoting corporate subsidies and economic fascism. \"Fascism,\" writes Lew Rockwell, president of the genuinely free market-oriented Ludwig von Mises Institute, \"is the system of government that cartelizes the private sector, centrally plans the economy to subsidize producers, exalts the police state as the source of order, denies fundamental rights and liberties to individuals, and makes the executive state the unlimited master of society.\" And it is precisely this kind of cartelized, centrally planned, fascist economy that the ALEC/USCC/ Obama/corporate alliance is producing.</p><p>ALEC's corporate P3 members are well represented by:</p><p>Big Pharma (Abbott, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Genetech, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer);</p><p>Big Farm (Altria Group, Archer Daniels Midland, Kraft Food, J.R.

All killer, no filler indeed. - Robert J. Wiersema.</p><p>98</p><p>What Happened by Hillary Clinton (Simon &amp;; Schuster)</p><p>If you hate Hillary Clinton, you'll hate this book. It's a damn good read: funny at the right times, poignant at others, captivating and page-turning throughout. But most of all, it's a salve for those whose wounds from waking up on November 9, 2016 have yet to close. - Ashley Csanady( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/hillary-clintons-what-happened-is-a-salve-for-those-whose-wounds-have-yet-to-close\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/hillary-clintons-what-happened-is-a-salve-for-those-whose-wounds-have-yet-to-close</url> )</p><p>97</p><p>In the Cage by Kevin Hardcastle (Biblioasis)</p><p>In the Cage is a novel of toxic masculinity in a variety of forms, each more insidious than the last. And through Hardcastle's style - sentences plain and broken, glinting with moments of beauty even in the depths of violence and pain - we become part of Daniel's world, part of the very structure he fights against, inside the cage and out. - Robert J.

Its terrifying accounts of the toll too much work can take on the average 9-5er is enough to make you want to never leave the office late again. - Sadaf Ahsan( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/the-important-lessons-sundays-are-the-new-mondays\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/the-important-lessons-sundays-are-the-new-mondays</url> )</p><p>95</p><p>The Collapsing Empire by John Scalzi (Tor)</p><p>In the distant future, humanity lives in habitats scattered throughout the stars, connected by a series of hyperspace tunnels known as the Flow. Though entirely dependent upon it for survival, and while it forms the basis of vast interstellar monopolies and their resulting nobility, no one knows completely how the Flow works. But a few individuals know that it is about to stop working. - Paul Taunton( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/john-scalzis-the-collapsing-empire-sets-the-table-for-plenty-of-court-intrigue\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/john-scalzis-the-collapsing-empire-sets-the-table-for-plenty-of-court-intrigue</url> )</p><p>94</p><p>The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google by Scott Galloway (Portfolio)</p><p>Along with Franklin Foer's World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech, and Farhad Manjoo's columns on the \"Frightful Five\" in the New York Times, Galloway's book is an important read for citizens grappling with the effect of tech companies on both the evolving economy and our way of life. - Paul Taunton</p><p>93</p><p>All the Lives I Want: Essays About My Best Friends Who Happen to Be Famous Strangers by Alana Massey (Grand Central)</p><p>Alana Massey is many things, and in her debut collection of essays, she tries to capture the countless women in pop culture who have guided her throughout her many lives. Including hilarious and introspective analyses of everyone from Sylvia Plath to Fiona Apple to Britney Spears, Massey also brings her own stories to the forefront, touching on everything from mental illness to the sex industry, effectively marrying the personal and the popular. - Sadaf Ahsan</p><p>92</p><p>The Water Beetles by Michael Kaan (Goose Lane)</p><p>The Water Beetles is based on the experience of Michael Kaan's father during the Second Sino-Japanese War as it bled into the Second World War. Shortlisted for the Governor General's Literary Award, the novel moves from occupied Hong Kong to rural China and finally, to university in America, where Chung-Man Leung begins to understand what has happened to him and his family. - Paul Taunton</p><p>91</p><p>Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century by Jessica Bruder (Norton)</p><p>Since the Great Recession, the retiree dream of an RV lifestyle is now a necessity for many older citizens who can't afford to own a house or retire. Nomadland exposes the reality most of us don't see, while humanizing those who must rely on a modern-day version of riding the rails. - Paul Taunton</p><p>90</p><p>Future Home of the Living God by Louise Erdrich (HarperCollins)</p><p>Many of the dystopic works of art that have been considered so timely this past year were in fact produced or begun long prior. Erdrich started her novel in 2002 when things seemed already to be \"moving backward,\" before setting it aside for two intervening books (which won the National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award, respectively). But Future Home of the Living God, exploring reactionary dogma and the regulation of childbirth, arrives squarely in the zeitgeist of 2017. - Paul Taunton</p><p>89</p><p>The Golden House by Salman Rushdie (Knopf Canada)</p><p>The Golden House doesn't contain much of the author's signature magic realism, but it is a story about extreme wealth, which, let's face it, can be considered a type of magic. What we refer to as \"Mary Sue stories\" in fiction - where people live in impossible houses, where their life floats upon unspecified sources of income - exist in real life. In an odd reversal, the main characters in The Golden House reflect the kinds of people whose real lives are stranger than fiction. - Paul Taunton( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/salman-rushdies-the-golden-house-suggests-names-might-be-the-mother-of-reinvention\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/salman-rushdies-the-golden-house-suggests-names-might-be-the-mother-of-reinvention</url> )</p><p>88</p><p>The Vanity Fair Diaries by Tina Brown (Henry Holt)</p><p>This Oxford-educated British journalist took the helm of one of America's most influential magazines in her early 30s, helping set the tone for what she refers to as \"The Crazy Eighties,\" a time of decadent affluence when the world of print journalism was awash with cash. Her diaries are juicy, vulnerable and jolly good fun. - Sarah Sahagian( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/five-takeaways-from-the-vanity-fair-diaries-1983-1992\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/five-takeaways-from-the-vanity-fair-diaries-1983-1992</url> )</p><p>87</p><p>Mississippi Blood by Greg Iles (William Morrow)</p><p>The stunning conclusion of Iles's Natchez Burning trilogy, Mississippi Blood is a harrowing, disturbing examination of racial violence in the contemporary south in the guise of a pot-boiling thriller. While the storyline may occasionally be over-the-top, Iles's recent history of the role of racism in the American south - from the political assassinations of the 1960s to post-Katrina reconstruction - is the stuff of all-too-vivid nightmares. - Robert J. Wiersema</p><p>86</p><p>Earthly Remains by Donna Leon (Atlantic Monthly Press)</p><p>It's been 25 years since Commissario Guido Brunetti entered the world of crime fiction. And what an entrance it was. Leon knows her world intimately, yet never overloads the reader with research. She shows only the tip of her iceberg, confident in the richness that lurks underneath. The cast is small but memorable. The square miles she covers are few but exploding with life - at least where humans have yet to quash it. - Howard Shrier( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/donna-leon-takes-her-readers-deep-into-the-discontented-soul-of-a-detective-in-earthly-remains\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/donna-leon-takes-her-readers-deep-into-the-discontented-soul-of-a-detective-in-earthly-remains</url> )</p><p>85</p><p>The Spectacular Sisterhood of Superwomen: Awesome Female Characters from Comic Book History by Hope Nicholson (Quirk)</p><p>Imagine the daunting prospect of going through a museum that covers the history of women and feminism (or lack thereof) in comics. You don't know where to go, or where to start. The emergence of independent publishing and wider representation in webcomics? The soap opera stylings of the romance comics genre? The dichotomy of the all-powerful superheroes and stereotypical damsels-in-distress? Then a guide appears, and with a wink and a smile, says, \"Want a special tour? Follow me. Your guide is author Hope Nicholson, publisher of Winnipeg-based Bedside Press, and your personal tour culminates with The Spectacular Sisterhood of Superwomen. - April Flores( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/hope-nicholson-chronicles-the-female-comics-heroes-you-know-and-many-more-that-you-dont\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/hope-nicholson-chronicles-the-female-comics-heroes-you-know-and-many-more-that-you-dont</url> )</p><p>84</p><p>Sticky Fingers: The Life and Times of Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone Magazine by Joe Hagan (Knopf Canada)</p><p>When Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner approached Joe Hagan about a biography, Hagan took the job on the condition of independence. As is often the case when a mogul is profiled, Wenner's discomfort with the final product is the reader's gain. Fifty years after Rolling Stone was founded in San Francisco (and while it is up for sale for a fraction of its former worth), Sticky Fingers is a true legacy of the magazine, its creator and a host of the rock stars who've graced its covers over the decades. - Paul Taunton</p><p>83</p><p>Fugue States by Pasha Malla (Knopf Canada)</p><p>In Fugue States, Pasha Malla flips the tried-and-true story of the second generation immigrant discovering their family history and heritage through Kashmiri-Canadian Ash Dhar. Compelled to learn more about his recently deceased father's life, Ash instead sends along his stoner BFF Matt to do the discovering in his place, making for a thought-provoking and polarizing exploration of self-identity and masculinity. - Sadaf Ahsan</p><p>82</p><p>The Power by Naomi Alderman (Little, Brown)</p><p>The Power is unintentionally timely. It was written before #MeToo, before Harvey Weinstein and his sorry band of brothers seized public consciousness - but, of course, it could never not be timely. We've all played the game of idly wondering what the world would be like if its current power structure were reversed; this novel is a long, serious, and sometimes bleakly funny engagement with that question. - JC Sutcliffe( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/naomi-alderman-imagines-a-world-where-physical-power-dynamics-have-been-flipped\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/naomi-alderman-imagines-a-world-where-physical-power-dynamics-have-been-flipped</url> )</p><p>81</p><p>Arrival: The Story of CanLit by Nick Mount (House of Anansi)</p><p>Arrival is Mount's second book and, in many ways, he's the only one who could possibly have written the thing. By turns professor, editor, advocate and critic, Mount's voice is rarely absent from any meaningful discussion of Canadian literature. He's part and parcel of it, too, both taking and leaving jobs as acts of defiance when debates heat up. It's from these oscillating perspectives on CanLit - buzzing around and rooted within - that Mount documents our country's literary history, centred chiefly on Canada's mid-20th century boom. - Terra Arnone( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/nick-mounts-history-of-canlit-shows-us-how-we-got-here-and-asks-where-to\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/nick-mounts-history-of-canlit-shows-us-how-we-got-here-and-asks-where-to</url> )</p><p>80</p><p>White Tears by Hari Kunzru (Knopf)</p><p>The appropriation of black music by those who want to be \"authentic\" is the tip of the (vanilla) iceberg in Kunzru's fifth novel, which traces systematic racism by slipping back and forth from the present day to the late 1920s, when the Delta Blues were first recorded. What starts as a dark comedy focused on a \"hipster Jesus\" trust-fund kid and his hapless sidekick morphs into a horror novel designed to give American pop culture an existential shock. - Mike Doherty( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/hari-kunzrus-white-tears-is-more-than-just-literary-clickbait-using-music-to-define-racial-divide\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/hari-kunzrus-white-tears-is-more-than-just-literary-clickbait-using-music-to-define-racial-divide</url> )</p><p>79</p><p>Demi-Gods by Eliza Robertson (Hamish Hamilton)</p><p>Eliza Robertson captures something often ignored about the B.C. coast in Demi-Gods, her quiet, menacing first novel. There's a coldness to the place, an absence among all that splendour. Demi-Gods is an uncomfortable, propulsive and deeply enjoyable read. It has an air of coastal gothic to it, a sense of chaos barely restrained amid all the calm. - Richard Warnica( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/eliza-robertson-demi-gods\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/eliza-robertson-demi-gods</url> )</p><p>78</p><p>We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy by Ta-Nehisi Coates (One World)</p><p>Coates, #1 on the NP99 in 2015 for Between the World and Me, returns with the signature essays he wrote during Barack Obama's eight years as president, enhanced with new reflections. Past is prologue in this collection, and his voice remains indispensable. - Paul Taunton</p><p>77</p><p>The Mariner's Guide to Self-Sabotage by Bill Gaston (Douglas &amp;; McIntyre)</p><p>With stylistic command and heart-wrenching insight, Gaston has been a writer's writer for too long. This collection of stories continues the Victoria writer's chronicling the lonely and the outcast, individuals struggling for meaning and significance in a hostile, frequently surreal world. - Robert J. Wiersema</p><p>76</p><p>The Sun and Her Flowers by Rupi Kaur (Simon &amp;; Schuster)</p><p>Kaur self-published her first poetry anthology, milk and honey, on Amazon in 2014. The book spent 52 consecutive weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and has since sold over a million copies. Her follow-up, the sun and her flowers, is bound to come close if not exceed its predecessor's numbers - if the growth of her digital footprint has anything to do with it. Kaur has become not only a voice for the marginalized, but a social media commodity as well - and she is very well aware of it, readily capitalizing on all those likes and follows from a community that had never seen itself represented quite so loudly before. - Sadaf Ahsan( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/on-rupi-kaur-and-the-question-of-authenticity-in-the-age-of-social-media-artists\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/on-rupi-kaur-and-the-question-of-authenticity-in-the-age-of-social-media-artists</url> )</p><p>75</p><p>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking by Samin Nosrat, illustrated by Wendy MacNaughton (Simon &amp;; Schuster)</p><p>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat represents 17 years of culinary experience. Chef and writer Samin Nosrat arrived at her theory of the four elements of good cooking through practice, using it as a mnemonic device to guide her. Whereas cookbooks squarely centre on recipes, Nosrat designed Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat to \"give people independence\" - highlighting the science and techniques that underscore good cooking. This is a book that can help you decide what to cook, how to cook it and why. - Laura Brehaut( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/life/food/how-to-cook-without-recipes-master-these-four-elements-and-never-look-back\">http://nationalpost.com/life/food/how-to-cook-without-recipes-master-these-four-elements-and-never-look-back</url> ) !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

The new report \"Forging new frontiers: advanced technologies will revolutionize banking\"(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.temenos.com/insights/white-papers-reports/eiu-2020/\">https://www.temenos.com/insights/white-papers-reports/eiu-2020/</url>) highlights that COVID-19 is likely to accelerate the digital transformation of banks, which already face intense competition from payment players, Big Tech and e-commerce firms. </p><p>The report trends will be discussed on the webinar 'The Future of Digital Banking: Revolution Accelerated\"(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.temenos.com/events/expert-webinar-covid-19-and-digital-banking-revolution-accelerated/\">https://www.temenos.com/events/expert-webinar-covid-19-and-digital-banking-revolution-accelerated/</url>) on 25 June, with the CEO and Founder of Varo Money, the EIU and Temenos. </p><p>With COVID-19 accelerating the digitization of banking, 45% of banking respondents say their strategic response is to build a 'true digital ecosystem' and integrate their self-built digital services and third-party offerings. AI will undoubtedly play a key role in accelerating this digital shift. Over three-quarters (77%) of respondents agree that unlocking value from Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be a key differentiator between winning and losing banks. And improving user experience through greater personalization ranked highest (28%) among the most valuable uses for AI. </p><p>The focus is shifting towards enterprise agility with DevOps, which brings together software development and IT operations using modern cloud-based platforms. In fact, 84% of respondents agree that DevOps will drive transformation in core banking, while 81% of banking executives believe a multi-cloud strategy will become a regulatory pre-requisite. The primary focus of banks' technology investment is on cybersecurity (35%), followed by developing AI platforms such as digital advisors and voice assisted engagement channels (33%), and cloud-based technologies (27%). </p><p>Max Chuard, Chief Executive Officer, Temenos, said: </p><p>\"Banks were under huge pressure due to new competitors, ongoing regulation and slowing profit growth - these pressures have intensified as a result of the pandemic. The report highlights that senior banking executives believe that new technologies such as AI will have the greatest impact in banking in the coming years.

Trends toward digital banking, cloud and SaaS models will only become more pronounced - in the new normal, the need for modern banking technology will be greater than ever.\" </p><p>Pete Swabey, Editorial Director EMEA - Thought Leadership, The Economist Intelligence Unit, added: </p><p>\"Retail, corporate and private banks were already under pressure to deploy new technologies quickly and change their cultures in order to compete with big tech firms and payment players and deliver an engaging digital experience. Now, as digital banking surges as a result of the coronavirus crisis, this task is more pressing than ever.\" </p><p>About the survey </p><p>Now in its seventh year, the Economist Intelligence Unit report includes for the first time respondents from commercial and private banks, alongside retail banks. The EIU surveyed 305 global banking executives throughout February and March 2020 about the challenges banks are facing relating to the digitization of the sector, and the strategies they are deploying in response. Almost half of respondents (49%) were at C-Suite level. Respondents came from Europe (25%), North America (24%), Asia-Pacific (18%), Africa and the Middle East (16%), and Latin America (17%). </p><p>Source: Temenos </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INBNWS-0053719507</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INBNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6084-6TM1-DXMP-K211-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Contify Banking News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 9, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009C8R</classCode><className>TEMENOS GROUP AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>TEMN (SWX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>Authority of State Agencies</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Nzc4MzRFMzEwMEEwNDZEMTgzMjZFMjg1N0M2Q0FENTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFDOEJBNTMwMzE5NERBQjk4MUM3QjI0QjdCRTYyRTI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

AI will undoubtedly play a key role in accelerating this digital shift. Over three-quarters (77%) of respondents agree that unlocking value from Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be a key differentiator between winning and losing banks. And improving user experience through greater personalization ranked highest (28%) among the most valuable uses for AI.</p><p>The focus is shifting towards enterprise agility with DevOps, which brings together software development and IT operations using modern cloud-based platforms. In fact, 84% of respondents agree that DevOps will drive transformation in core banking, while 81% of banking executives believe a multi-cloud strategy will become a regulatory pre-requisite. The primary focus of banks' technology investment is on cybersecurity (35%), followed by developing AI platforms such as digital advisors and voice assisted engagement channels (33%), and cloud-based technologies (27%).</p><p>Max Chuard, Chief Executive Officer, Temenos, said: \"Banks were under huge pressure due to new competitors, ongoing regulation and slowing profit growth - these pressures have intensified as a result of the pandemic. The report highlights that senior banking executives believe that new technologies such as AI will have the greatest impact in banking in the coming years. As the digitization of banking continues, these new technologies can help banks fend off competitors and gain competitive advantage.</p><p>\"Temenos' cloud-advanced, AI technology and rich banking functionality can help banks deliver value to their customers in the immediate term and accelerate their digital transformation to build sustainable growth in the future. Trends toward digital banking, cloud and SaaS models will only become more pronounced - in the new normal, the need for modern banking technology will be greater than ever.\"</p><p>Pete Swabey, Editorial Director EMEA - Thought Leadership, The Economist Intelligence Unit, added: \"Retail, corporate and private banks were already under pressure to deploy new technologies quickly and change their cultures in order to compete with big tech firms and payment players and deliver an engaging digital experience. Now, as digital banking surges as a result of the coronavirus crisis, this task is more pressing than ever.\"</p><p>About the survey<br/>Now in its seventh year, the Economist Intelligence Unit report includes for the first time respondents from commercial and private banks, alongside retail banks. The EIU surveyed 305 global banking executives throughout February and March 2020 about the challenges banks are facing relating to the digitization of the sector, and the strategies they are deploying in response. Almost half of respondents (49%) were at C-Suite level. Respondents came from Europe (25%), North America (24%), Asia-Pacific (18%), Africa and the Middle East (16%), and Latin America (17%).</p><p>- Ends -</p><p>About Temenos<br/>Temenos AG (SIX: TEMN), headquartered in Geneva, is the world's leader in banking software, partnering with banks and other financial institutions to transform their businesses and stay ahead of a changing marketplace.

He is yelling out to his daughters, \"Don't move.\" That is what the photographer of this photo said. And then moments after this picture was taken, the house collapsed. That photographer helped get these girls to a hospital. Baby Tuqa survived but at last report, she was still in intensive care. Reham and Tuqa's mother and two other sisters also died in this airstrike along with Reham. And that is it for me Newsroom with Erica Hill starts right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ERICA HILL, CNN HOST: Hello, and thanks for joining me this hour. I'm Erica Hill, in today for Brooke Baldwin. The number of Democrats calling for impeachment growing today. And the man who would be in charge of those proceedings should they happen isn't wasting any time. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler just announcing he is going to court for the secret grand jury material in the Mueller report and he'll try to enforce a subpoena for former White House Counsel Don McGahn -- a key witness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This message though from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- she's not ready to call for impeachment outright. CNN's Manu Raju in fact asked her whether at this point, she's just trying to run out the clock.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): No, I'm not trying to run out the clock. Let's get sophisticated about this, okay. Okay, would I be --</p><p>MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: But how long will this court fight will it take?</p><p>PELOSI: We will proceed when we have what we need to proceed, not one day sooner. Their advocacy for impeachment only gives me leverage. I have no complaint with what they are doing. I'm willing to take whatever heat there is there to say when we -- when the decision will be made in a timely fashion. This isn't endless.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: And Manu Raju joins me now. So Manu -- Congress, of course, it's a leave for six weeks of summer vacation today. What more do we know about Chairman Nadler's strategy here?</p><p>RAJU: Well, very significant development just happened moments ago when the House Judiciary Committee announced they would move forward with a lawsuit to seek grand jury information related to the Mueller probe. But as part of this lawsuit, they are saying they need that information in order to decide whether or not to recommend articles of impeachment against the President of the United States.</p><p>They cite that directly in this lawsuit that's about to be filed in Federal Court and Jerry Nadler made it clear that this is a step, that they guess they consider whether or not to impeach this President. The Chairman of the committee has privately pushed for an impeachment inquiry for weeks. But Nancy Pelosi is not wanting to go down that route.</p><p>At the moment, it appears that, essentially what the committee is doing its investigation is essentially the same as an impeachment inquiry. Now, I asked Jerry Nadler about this. Is it the same thing, what you're doing right now -- to investigate the President, is it essentially the same as an impeachment inquiry? He said it essentially is with one difference.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAJU: Mr. Chairman, but you're saying there's no difference -- you're saying there's no difference between what you're doing now in an impeachment inquiry, correct?</p><p>REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): In effect. What I'm saying is that we are -- well, I suppose there is one difference which you could draw. I mean, if you said that an impeachment inquiry is when you're considering only impeachment. That's not what we're doing. We are investigating all of this and we are going to see what remedies we could recommend including the possibility of articles of impeachment, we're not limited to that. But that's very much the possibility as a result of what we're doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAJU: So they are saying the outcome could be the same, recommending formal articles of impeachment, even if they're not currently an impeachment inquiry, saying essentially the same.</p><p>And the interesting point here, Erica, the Speaker's office -- Speaker Pelosi's office signed off on that language that is in the lawsuit, saying that they need this information, because they have to decide whether or not to move forward on impeachment proceedings. So while she's not ready to formally open up the impeachment proceedings, she's at least green lighting that language that potentially could result in an impeachment proceeding -- Erica.</p><p>HILL: I want to be a fly on the wall for that discussion when they agreed on that. Manu, thank you.</p><p>RAJU: Thank you.</p><p>HILL: Speaker Pelosi, also taking care of another important task before Congress leaves for that summer hiatus, meeting face to face with freshman Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The two lawmakers have seemingly been feuding for weeks on a range of issues. So, were they able to come together? Here's the Speaker again today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PELOSI: I don't think there ever was any hatchet.</p><p>QUESTION: Well, she called you down, right, disrespectful?</p><p>PELOSI: Well, that's -- we're in the political arena. Let me just say this because I had some level of confidence and actually joy and seeing diversity in our caucus. I would never even say that it was a hatchet. But I do think that we sat down today. We had a good meeting and the Congresswoman is a very gracious member of Congress.</p><p>[14:05:04] PELOSI: So we've had a very positive conversation about our districts. and how we represent them, our country. I've always felt -- again, it's like you're in a family and a family, you have your differences. But you're still family.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: CNN national correspondent Jason Carroll also on Capitol Hill. So apparently, there was no hatchet that need to be buried. So we got that out of the way, Jason.</p><p>JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right.</p><p>HILL: Give us some more specifics though. What are you hearing about what the two discussed?</p><p>CARROLL: Well look, first of all, you know, you have Ocasio-Cortez and you have the Speaker both saying that things went well. I mean, so that's first off. Before this meeting even got underway, though, Erica. Ocasio-Cortez, made it very clear that she had a couple of goals. First and foremost, she wanted to make sure that there was this open line of communication between her office and the Speaker's office.</p><p>And given the sort of Rocky history that we've seen with these two, she wanted to make sure that they were on the same page when it comes to certain issues -- immigration and some other issues, as well.</p><p>And just a little earlier this afternoon, Ocasio-Cortez, who had been sort of dodging our cameras, post meeting, our cameras did catch up with her and this was her take on the meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I believe, I think the Speaker respects, you know, the time that we're coming together as a party and that unity and I'm looking forward to us getting back in September.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARROLL: So we are going to have to see what happens in the future. It's unclear if these two discussed some of the rocky history that they had had in the past. Pelosi, you heard her talking about families saying, it's important to have family but families bicker no difference in this case -- Erica.</p><p>HILL: Jason Carroll joining us from Capitol Hill today. Jason, thank you.</p><p>CNN political analyst Julian Zelizer is a historian and a professor at Princeton University. Great to have you with us.</p><p>So there's sort of a lot to parse through here. So somewhat mixed messages, I guess, to a point we could say, between what we're hearing from Chairman Nadler, what we're hearing from Speaker Pelosi. The fact though, that as Manu pointed out, they agreed to this language, as we know, in terms of moving forward with the courts. What do you make of all of this?</p><p>JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, we've been in this state since March, really, where there are ongoing investigations, Democrats talk about the possibility of impeachment, but it's not formal impeachment proceedings.</p><p>The two big differences today is one the use of the language, apparently with the sign off of the Speaker's office. And two, trying to get this grand jury information and really being more aggressive about getting what is unavailable to this committee. This is still not an impeachment proceeding.</p><p>HILL: Right.</p><p>ZELIZER: And so I think, what happens over break will really be important.</p><p>HILL: It's also interesting because as we're seeing the number of Democrats, right, who are saying, yes, let's go for impeachment. As we're seeing that number grow, it's also interesting that we heard from Jackie Speier, for example, who's been, you know, fairly outspoken when it comes to -- she said, \"Listen, we basically have until September, and then after that, we just have to move forward,\" almost throwing up her hands, it would seem. That's a far different message.</p><p>ZELIZER: Yes, and I think all legislators are looking at the clock. They're looking at the election season and they're worried about these coming together. Ultimately, it's about what the Speaker does. If the Speaker comes out and formally says, \"We are now going to look into this investigation,\" it will put all those moderate members on the spot. It will put pressure on them to make a decision. Until the Speaker is there, I think you're going to be in this in between. And it's still hard for Congressman Nadler to work without her support.</p><p>HILL: Moving into this phase, right, where now they're turning to the court and saying, we need this information because we have to decide, right, what we're going to do. Going to the courts can have a benefit. It can also drag things out, as we know. Now, in some ways, if you look at what the President has done, he successfully use the courts in many ways to sort of keep pushing oversight out of the way for him. And in many ways he's consolidating the power of the Presidency. Is he at the same time and your view, also diminishing the power of Congress and really diminishing this checks and balances system that we have?</p><p>ZELIZER: Absolutely. That's the way it works. Historically, Presidents try to grab more power, they flex their muscle in new ways, and the real issue is what Congress does. If Congress doesn't respond, we usually create new Presidents. And the next President is that much more powerful. That's a lot of what's at stake right now, many Democrats believe.</p><p>For example, if the President can obstruct justice, and Congress says we're not going to do anything about it, that becomes a new base. So we have seen an expansion of power under the President. And that's why the congressional response is what we're watching for.</p><p>HILL: I want to get your take on something else. Congressman Ilhan Omar, writing a piece in \"The New York Times\" or op-ed, which was titled, \"It is Not Enough to Condemn Trump's Racism.\" She talks a lot about her experience and what brought her to running for office, right, into ultimately being elected.</p><p>One of the things that stood out as she writes in part, \" ... the beauty of this country is not that our democracy is perfect. It's that embedded in our Constitution and Democratic institutions are the tools to make it better.\"</p><p>[14:10:06] HILL: Going on to say, \"The proudest moments in our history from the emancipation proclamation, to the Civil Rights movement, to the struggle against fascism, have come when we fight to protect and expand basic Democratic rights. Today, democracy is under attack once again.\"</p><p>This would seem to be a direct rebuke, obviously, of the President. Not just what he said about his racist tweets and what he's had to say about her and her faith, but also the fact that he's called her and fellow lawmakers un-American because they disagree with him, right?</p><p>But there are plenty of voters who like what she's doing, who elected her to office. So just give us a sense, and just remind us in history other moments were seemingly going against the President or the government has all of a sudden made you unpatriotic.</p><p>ZELIZER: Yes, it is an old tactic during the Cold War in the 1950s. This was often a tactic used against those who are pursuing anti- communists or pursuing communists and if you criticize the technique of a Senator Joe McCarthy, he would question your Americanness, he would question your patriotism. So it's a tactic we've seen before in the 1980s. We saw Republicans do it against Democrats who are opposing funding for anti-communist forces in Central America.</p><p>HILL: Ultimately, something changes though. What do you think? Is there something that changes that discussion in 2019?</p><p>ZELIZER: Well, over time, there's been more opposition to that kind of tactic. It's underhanded, it tries to squash genuine opposition. And ultimately, both parties need to understand, they will be out of power. And it's important to have mechanisms that allow for opposition and that might be protecting voting rights. But it also is the rhetoric we use and creating certain boundaries on how we talk about opponents and that's why a lot are troubled by hearing the President go after her as un-American rather than criticizing her policies and stance.</p><p>HILL: Julian, always appreciate your insight. Thank you.</p><p>ZELIZER: Thank you.</p><p>HILL: The debate countdown is on. So could this though be the last dance for some of the Democratic candidates. We will take a look at the top 10 and what they need to do to move forward. Plus disturbing new details in the case against Jeffrey Epstein. The investigation into his ties to the billionaire behind Victoria's Secret and the access it reportedly gave him two young women.</p><p>Plus, President Trump making it clear he's not happy about ASAP Rocky's legal situation in Sweden. And yet he said nothing about an American citizen wrongfully detained in his own country.</p><p>[14:12:25] HILL: The Commerce Department says this number is the most popular indicator of just how healthy the economy is in the U.S. And that number the GDP the Gross Domestic Product is at 2.1 percent, which is both good and bad news for the President. So let's get the bad news out of the way, 2.1 percent means the economy is growing at a slower rate than last quarter. The good news here 2.1 is better than what many economists expected. CNN's chief business correspondent Christine Romans has a look now at just why the economy's growth took a hit.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Erica, economic growth, slow just a little bit in the second quarter, a rate of 2.1 percent for economic growth. You can see that's less than the prior quarter 3.1 percent.</p><p>Part of that reason might be because so many companies were rushing at the beginning of the year to buy the goods they would need to build their inventories, knowing that they'd be more expensive later on because of the President's trade war because of higher tariffs and then of course that takes away a little bit of the business you would do in the following quarter.</p><p>But something interesting here, when you look at the fourth quarter of last year, that number was revised down. Something was a little bit weaker in the economy in the fourth quarter. And last summer, on the second quarter last year when there was that big 4.2 percent growth rate that the President was so proud of. That got revised down too to 3.5 percent.</p><p>So actually, the economy last year didn't hit the President's three percent target, certainly not the four, or five percent that he has said, his supercharged economy with tax cuts and regulation rollbacks would achieve. This is looking like a stable muddling through economy, not the supercharged gangbusters economy the President has promised.</p><p>HILL: Christine Romans, thank you. Let's turn now to the race for 2020. The CNN debates just a few days away and the candidates are counting down by touting their new policies and trying to sway voters.</p><p>Half the field is swinging through Iowa where the first caucuses will be held in 191 days. We are counting, don't worry, you don't have to. The other half making appearances at the National Urban League's annual conference in Indianapolis.</p><p>Senators Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg are among the speakers there this morning. Harris and Buttigieg both releasing big policy plans focused on the economy today. Harris's plan includes closing the wealth gap among black Americans by investing $60 billion in STEM education at historically black colleges and universities. While promoting the policy though, she was challenged on her record as a prosecutor and criticism that could surface during the debates. Here's her response.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Why do we only have to be on the outside on bended knee or trying to break down the doors?</p><p>[14:20:02] HARRIS: Shouldn't we also have a role on the inside where the decisions are being made in a way we can influence the change that must occur? I have the power to create one of the first re-entry initiatives in the United States. I didn't have to ask anybody permission to do it because I was running the office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: Mayor Pete Buttigieg also pushing his economic plan, which includes taking aim at big tech companies who are outsourcing their employees. But in a preview of what could be his debate strategy, he wasted no time going after President Trump in front of voters in Indiana.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D-IN), MAYOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My generation saw this country elect its first black President and then turn around and elect a racist to the White House and we had a call that what it is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: For a number of candidates, next week's debates just might be their last best chance to both boost support and most importantly to stay in the race.</p><p>CNN senior political writer and analysts Harry Enten is here. Okay, so you and Chris Cillizza are out with your most recent rankings. Where you're taking a look at, you know, the chances? This is a big deal next week, especially if they want to move on. You're looking at the top 10 with the best chances ...</p><p>HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL WRITER AND ANALYST: Yes.</p><p>HILL: ... of the nomination.</p><p>ENTEN: Correct.</p><p>HILL: Walk us through my friend.</p><p>ENTEN: Yes. So this is our bottom 5, or 6 through 10 and what we essentially see here is, you know, Andrew Yang, has his Yang gang, you know, he's been able to raise a lot of money from a lot of donors, but really got no words during the last debate. I almost forgot that he was there. We have Julian Castro, who actually did fairly well in the last debates, right?</p><p>He was able to make some sort of breakthrough get a lot of donors racist polling a little bit. I'm going to be very interested to see how he does on the debate stage with Joe Biden, perhaps bringing up their differences on immigration. Beto O'Rourke though, is someone who's been plummeting down and he's all the way down to eighth.</p><p>At one point he was at second in our rankings. Amy Klobuchar, she's up one that's more of an indication that O'Rourke has been falling. Can she make a breakthrough with more moderate voters that Biden's been clamoring so far holding on to? And Cory Booker holding steady at six, very interesting to see him versus Joe Biden go after criminal justice reform.</p><p>HILL: That's going to be quite a stage. Really quickly, before we move on to the next five. Beto O'Rourke dropping down one, he also is I understand that CNN has learned his team really taking a look at his debate performance last time around, which I'm guessing will influence what we see Wednesday.</p><p>ENTEN: Absolutely. I mean, Beto O'Rourke by any stretch of the imagination. We just didn't have a very good debate performance. You know, he was kind of lackluster boring, Castro really went after him. And that just came on top of the fact that he's just been falling, falling, falling ever since entering the race. He needs a real good debate performance, perhaps reverse that downward momentum.</p><p>HILL: So moving on to the top five.</p><p>ENTEN: Yes, moving out of it. The top five.</p><p>HILL: The top five.</p><p>ENTGEN: The top five. So we have at number five Pete Buttigieg who's basically been stable there. Look, if money won nominations, Pete Buttigieg would be well on his way, but he simply has been falling in the polls, only at about 5 percent in national average right now. Can he actually reach out and win some African American support? Let's see if he uses the bait to do that.</p><p>And number four, Bernie Sanders. Look, Bernie Sanders was the second candidate last time around. This time around, he's basically in a three way tie for second place with Harrison, Warren in the polls raising a lot of money. But again, he hasn't been able to build on that support, despite universal name ID.</p><p>Number three, Elizabeth Warren, very interested to see she and Bernie Sanders on the same debate stage. Are there going to be differences, or are they going to play nice? She's been having some poll momentum going up. Can she sustain that?</p><p>Kamala Harris, obviously, in the last debate, she had a real breakthrough moment. She rose up tremendously in the polls. But we've seen her recede a little bit since that debate. Can she use this debate against standing next to Joe Biden to perhaps reestablish that momentum?</p><p>And of course, finally, Joe Biden, he had such a poor debate last time. Can he get up on that debate stage? Can he be aggressive? We've seen him be more aggressive in recent days on criminal justice reform, on his record with both Harris and Booker. There's going to be a target on his back. Let's, let's see how he acts with that part.</p><p>HILL: A lot of things to look for. Two nights to check it out.</p><p>ENTEN: Two nights, you know, I love it. And only 191 days until Iowa. I'm counting down each day with a candle on a cake.</p><p>HILL: I knew you would do that.</p><p>ENTEN: That's me.</p><p>HILL: Harry Enten, happy weekend my friend.</p><p>ENTEN: You as well.</p><p>HILL: You enjoy your cake.</p><p>ENTEN: I will.</p><p>HILL: Be sure to watch the debates right here only on CNN. Two big nights as we mentioned, 10 candidates each night Tuesday, Wednesday, it all kicks off at 8:00 p.m. live from Detroit.</p><p>Community outrage today after I.C.E. agents violently smashed a car window so that they could arrest an undocumented immigrant. Well now we're learning a little bit more about that including that the man has been deported. Plus, we are close to learning more about just who else could be caught up in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. What documents tell us about this investigation into so called uncharged individuals.</p><p>[14:28:58] HILL: New details emerging in the case of alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. \"The New York Times\" outlining how Epstein leveraged his relationship with billionaire Leslie Wexner for more money and for alleged access to young aspiring models.</p><p>Wexner owns L Brands that's the parent company of Victoria's Secret and other retailers. He previously owned Epstein's New York City mansion L Brands has hired outside counsel to review its relationship with Epstein.</p><p>Meantime, a spokesperson for the company says, \"While Mr. Epstein served as Mr. Wexner's personal money manager for a period that ended nearly 12 years ago. We do not believe he was ever employed by nor serve as an authorized representative of the company.\"</p><p>Also knew, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have subpoenaed Jeffrey Epstein's longtime personal pilots. Testimony from the pilots along with flight-log data could be used by Federal Investigators to corroborate some of the claims that Epstein's accusers have made.</p><p>CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson and CNN reporter Kara Scannell join me now. So new day, new details, new questions here. We learned that federal prosecutors in a new filing are investigating so called uncharged individuals.

Details of arrests of people who were charged but not convicted or whose cases were dismissed \u2015 as well as juveniles or people who completed drug treatment programs or committed noncriminal offenses\u2015 aren't supposed to influence law enforcement in any way should police encounter those people again.But new court documents obtained by HuffPost[1]show that the New York City Police Department has been breaking that law for years, on a massive scale that has been previously unreported.According to the documents, the NYPD has digitally warehoused more than 6.9 million sealed arrest records of more than 3.5 million New Yorkers. Worse, every cop on the street has instant access to those records through their smartphones.The court documents are part of a 2018 class-action lawsuit against the NYPD. That lawsuit alleges the police department has violated the state law, which is supposed to protect people from being harassed by police based strictly on past interactions \u2014 a matter that primarily affects Black people and other people of color.The revelations are particularly explosive and damaging for the NYPD in light of the anti-racist protests that have occurred nationwide following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.Instead of destroying or returning arrest records to the accused if a case is terminated in their favor, as is required by law, the NYPD admitted it has kept millions of them. </p><p>The filing revealed that sealed records are housed inside the department's Domain Awareness System, or DAS, a vast system of databases developed by the police department and Microsoft that is installed on each officer's phone for easy access.According to the NYPD's court filing, the DAS 'can access a copy of each sealed arrest report that exists in the Crime Data Warehouse.' Instead of destroying or returning arrest recordsto the accused if a case is terminated in their favor, as is required by law, the NYPD admitted it has kept millions of them. It's a 'horrifying' admission, said Jenn Borchetta, an attorney from Bronx Defenders who represents the plaintiffs in the case.'The court already said the NYPD isn't allowed to use these documents and share them with its officers,' Borchetta said. 'Yet they're still sharing them and on a mass scale.'The NYPD's 'Crime Data Warehouse contained 6,908,699 sealed arrest reports containing the arrest information of 3,576,113 unique individuals, as of November 20, 2019,' according to the court filing.Experts believe this will be hard to defend in court. Hermann Walz, a criminal justice professor at John Jay College and former prosecutor in Brooklyn and Queens, told HuffPost, 'The law is clear. Sealed is sealed.''The black letter of the law seems to support the Bronx Defenders' case,' Walz said.The NYPD has defended its policy of maintaining these millions of records, claiming in a motion to dismiss the lawsuit that the sealed records law only meant to shield a person's information from 'stigma in employment, education, licensing, and insurance,' while still allowing law enforcement to access the records. A New York state judge rejected that argument from the NYPD in 2019, calling it 'strained' and 'without precedence.' The judge ruled[2] that any NYPD officer who wishes to access a sealed record must get a court order.The case is currently in the discovery phase and the plaintiffs are seeking more information from the NYPD on the sealed records.Borchetta, the Bronx Defenders attorney suing the department, says that the NYPD just doesn't want to follow the law. 'The NYPD is acting as if the law doesn't apply to them,' she said.The NYPD and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office declined to comment since the litigation is pending. A Troubling History Of Abuse In 1976, the New York state legislature passed a law[3] that says if a case 'is terminated in a person's favor or results in a non-criminal violation,' the records of the case shall be 'sealed' and any photographs or fingerprints destroyed or returned to the accused.When the law went into effect, the legislators were considering fingerprints and mug shots stored in manila folders in filing cabinets. They had little to no concept of computerized data. When it comes to this digitized content that the police are collecting, Walz said, 'Obviously the police are just doing what they want.''Here's the ultimate problem \u2015 The law is from 1976. I had a rotary phone then. The world has changed dramatically. The law needs to be updated,' he said.The NYPD has claimed it can maintain a fair process in which police and prosecutors responsibly share relevant sealed records from investigations to seek a criminal conviction. However, in 2018, the NYPD leaked sealed records to the New York Post[4] of Saheed Vassel, a man with a bipolar diagnosis, after police shot and killed him when he was spotted waving a metal pipe on a Brooklyn street.The month Vassell was killed, Bronx Defenders filed its lawsuit, claiming the NYPD is violating the sealing statute in the 1976 law. In the initial complaint[5], the plaintiffs estimated that between 2014 and 2016, the NYPD maintained hundreds of the thousands of sealed records \u2014 more than 80% of which involve Black and Latinx people. But this latest admission from the NYPD brings into focus how many millions of sealed records the department actually has in its possession.'Part of what's scary about the NYPD's use of these records is that they're being used in all different kinds of databases, crunched in algorithms,' Borchetta said, referencing the NYPD's statement in its filing that the sealed records can be accessed in the department's Domain Awareness System.'Someone can become a suspect simply by virtue of this data being in the system,' she said. 'They Can Do Whatever They Want' In April 2015, two men held up a livery car driver in the Bronx.Initially, the victim was unable to identify a suspect. But two weeks later, the victim was shown a second photo lineup of suspects. This time, the victim identified a 21-year-old man from the Bronx named R.C. (HuffPost has withheld the man's full name at his and his attorneys' request.)At the time of the robbery, R.C. was living upstate, and on that night, he was at a friend's house in Danbury, Connecticut. But in the early hours of May 21, while he was sleeping at his mother's house,the cops arrived to arrest him for robbery.Over the next year and half, R.C. traveled back and forth from upstate New York to the Bronx to attend court at least 10 times. He said he lost his job and that the frequent trips to court started 'making me feel like I'm a person that I'm not.' The people who are supposed to be protecting us, the same people who are arresting us, are the ones breaking laws.R.C. During discovery in R.C.'s case, the prosecutors for the Bronx DA's office revealed that police had used a photo from a sealed arrest record from a more than four-year-old case that the DA's office had declined to prosecute R.C. on. He told HuffPost that he thought the photo had been deleted because his lawyer in the previous case had made a point to request that those records be erased and he had received assurances that it had happened.In November 2016, the charges against R.C. were ultimately dropped. He said he felt relief and has since started to get his life back on track. However, according to the lawsuit, R.C. and his lawyers believe the NYPD is still keeping his sealed records, which could open the door to police yet again accessing them and targeting him as a suspect.'I guess the police, they can do whatever they want,' R.C. told HuffPost. 'The people who are supposed to be protecting us, the same people who are arresting us, are the ones breaking laws.' How Big Tech And Police Set Up A Vast Surveillance System The NYPD arrest records are part of a vast surveillance system for the nation's largest police department that is now used by police departments around the country and world. In 2012, Microsoft and the NYPD publicly announced[6] the creation of a Domain Awareness System, initially billed as a tool to fight terrorism \u2014 'a sophisticated law enforcement technology solution that aggregates and analyzes public safety data in real time.' The NYPD now refers[7] to the DAS as 'one of the world's largest networks of cameras, license plate readers, and radiological [sensors], designed to detect and prevent terrorist acts, but also of great value in criminal investigations.'Since unveiling the DAS, Microsoft and the NYPD have marketed the technology to other police departments around the country and the world. According to a report[8] from the Brennan Center for Justice, they have sold it to police departments in Brazil, Singapore, and Washington, D.C. This month, the Intercept[9] reported that the Atlanta Police Department has been using the DAS since 2019. Microsoft and the NYPD share the profits from these deals, with the NYPD getting 30%[10].The system's surveillance tools, particularly facial recognition, have been particularly controversial. Under pressure from employees, Microsoft and a handful of other companies recently declared they would no longer sell facial recognition technology to police unless there's a federal law regulating its use that is 'grounded in the protection of human rights.'Microsoft received plenty of positive media coverage for its pledge to stop selling facial recognition technology. However, cases like this lawsuit reinforce the idea that police are utilizing many different types of data \u2014like sealed records \u2014to create the most robust system to track people possible.Microsoft didn't respond to a request to comment for this story.The true extent of the NYPD's technological power should come into clearer focus soon under New York City's newly implemented POST Act[11] \u2014 or the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology Act \u2014 which mandates that the police department disclose to the city what technological tools it uses.But it may not shed more light on the NYPD's use of sealed records. The POST Act is focused on providing a mechanism for the police to share with the public what surveillance systems it is using, but the new law focuses on the systems themselves rather than what data those systems use.'So the fact that the NYPD's surveillance systems \u2014all of them \u2014 use sealed arrest information might not get captured by the reporting required under this law,' Borchettasaid.

Details of arrests of people who were charged but not convicted or whose cases were dismissed \u2015 as well as juveniles or people who completed drug treatment programs or committed noncriminal offenses  \u2015 aren\u2019t supposed to influence law enforcement in any way should police encounter those people again.      But new court documents obtained by HuffPost   show that the New York City Police Department has been breaking that law for years, on a massive scale that has been previously unreported.    According to the documents, the NYPD has digitally warehoused more than 6.9 million sealed arrest records of more than 3.5 million New Yorkers. Worse, every cop on the street has instant access to those records through their smartphones.    The court documents are part of a 2018 class-action lawsuit against the NYPD. That lawsuit alleges the police department has violated the state law, which is supposed to protect people from being harassed by police based strictly on past interactions \u2014 a matter that primarily affects Black people and other people of color.   The revelations are particularly explosive and damaging for the NYPD in light of the anti-racist protests that have occurred nationwide following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.    Instead of destroying or returning arrest records to the accused if a case is terminated in their favor, as is required by law, the NYPD admitted it has kept millions of them. The filing revealed that sealed records are housed inside the department\u2019s Domain Awareness System, or DAS, a vast system of databases developed by the police department and Microsoft that is installed on each officer\u2019s phone for easy access.   According to the NYPD\u2019s court filing, the DAS \u201ccan access a copy of each sealed arrest report that exists in the Crime Data Warehouse.\u201d   It\u2019s a \u201chorrifying\u201d admission, said Jenn Borchetta, an attorney from Bronx Defenders who represents the plaintiffs in the case.   \u201cThe court already said the NYPD isn\u2019t allowed to use these documents and share them with its officers,\u201d Borchetta said. \u201cYet they\u2019re still sharing them and on a mass scale.\u201d    The NYPD\u2019s \u201cCrime Data Warehouse contained 6,908,699 sealed arrest reports containing the arrest information of 3,576,113 unique individuals, as of November 20, 2019,\u201d according to the court filing.    Experts believe this will be hard to defend in court. Hermann Walz, a criminal justice professor at John Jay College and former prosecutor in Brooklyn and Queens, told HuffPost, \u201cThe law is clear. Sealed is sealed.\u201d   \u201cThe black letter of the law seems to support the Bronx Defenders\u2019 case,\u201d Walz said.    The NYPD has defended its policy of maintaining these millions of records, claiming in a motion to dismiss the lawsuit that the sealed records law only meant to shield a person\u2019s information from \u201cstigma in employment, education, licensing, and insurance,\u201d while still allowing law enforcement to access the records.   A New York state judge rejected that argument from the NYPD in 2019, calling it \u201cstrained\u201d and \u201cwithout precedence.\u201d The judge ruled that any NYPD officer who wishes to access a sealed record must get a court order.    The case is currently in the discovery phase and the plaintiffs are seeking more information from the NYPD on the sealed records.   Borchetta, the Bronx Defenders attorney suing the department, says that the NYPD just doesn\u2019t want to follow the law. \u201cThe NYPD is acting as if the law doesn\u2019t apply to them,\u201d she said.   The NYPD and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office declined to comment since the litigation is pending.  A Troubling History Of Abuse   In 1976, the New York state legislature passed a law that says if a case \u201cis terminated in a person\u2019s favor or results in a non-criminal violation,\u201d the records of the case shall be \u201csealed\u201d and any photographs or fingerprints destroyed or returned to the accused.    When the law went into effect, the legislators were considering fingerprints and mug shots stored in manila folders in filing cabinets. They had little to no concept of computerized data. When it comes to this digitized content that the police are collecting, Walz said, \u201cObviously the police are just doing what they want.\u201d   \u201cHere\u2019s the ultimate problem \u2015 The law is from 1976. I had a rotary phone then. The world has changed dramatically. The law needs to be updated,\u201d he said.   The NYPD has claimed it can maintain a fair process in which police and prosecutors responsibly share relevant sealed records from investigations to seek a criminal conviction. However, in 2018, the NYPD leaked sealed records to the New York Post of Saheed Vassel, a man with a bipolar diagnosis, after police shot and killed him when he was spotted waving a metal pipe on a Brooklyn street.    The month Vassell was killed, Bronx Defenders filed its lawsuit, claiming the NYPD is violating the sealing statute in the 1976 law. In the initial complaint , the plaintiffs estimated that between 2014 and 2016, the NYPD maintained hundreds of the thousands of sealed records \u2014 more than 80% of which involve Black and Latinx people. But this latest admission from the NYPD brings into focus how many millions of sealed records the department actually has in its possession.    \u201cPart of what\u2019s scary about the NYPD\u2019s use of these records is that they\u2019re being used in all different kinds of databases, crunched in algorithms,\u201d Borchetta said, referencing the NYPD\u2019s statement in its filing that the sealed records can be accessed in the department\u2019s Domain Awareness System.   \u201cSomeone can become a suspect simply by virtue of this data being in the system,\u201d she said.  \u2018They Can Do Whatever They Want\u2019  In April 2015, two men held up a livery car driver in the Bronx.    Initially, the victim was unable to identify a suspect. But two weeks later, the victim was shown a second photo lineup of suspects. This time, the victim identified a 21-year-old man from the Bronx named R.C. (HuffPost has withheld the man\u2019s full name at his and his attorneys\u2019 request.)   At the time of the robbery, R.C. was living upstate, and on that night, he was at a friend\u2019s house in Danbury, Connecticut. But in the early hours of May 21, while he was sleeping at his mother\u2019s house,   the cops arrived to arrest him for robbery.   Over the next year and half, R.C. traveled back and forth from upstate New York to the Bronx to attend court at least 10 times. He said he lost his job and that the frequent trips to court started \u201cmaking me feel like I\u2019m a person that I\u2019m not.\u201d    During discovery in R.C.\u2019s case, the prosecutors for the Bronx DA\u2019s office revealed that police had used a photo from a sealed arrest record from a more than four-year-old case that the DA\u2019s office had declined to prosecute R.C. on. He told HuffPost that he thought the photo had been deleted because his lawyer in the previous case had made a point to request that those records be erased and he had received assurances that it had happened.   In November 2016, the charges against R.C. were ultimately dropped. He said he felt relief and has since started to get his life back on track. However, according to the lawsuit, R.C. and his lawyers believe the NYPD is still keeping his sealed records, which could open the door to police yet again accessing them and targeting him as a suspect.   \u201cI guess the police, they can do whatever they want,\u201d R.C. told HuffPost. \u201cThe people who are supposed to be protecting us, the same people who are arresting us, are the ones breaking laws.\u201d  How Big Tech And Police Set Up A Vast Surveillance System  The NYPD arrest records are part of a vast surveillance system for the nation\u2019s largest police department that is now used by police departments around the country and world.   In 2012, Microsoft and the NYPD publicly announced the creation of a Domain Awareness System, initially billed as a tool to fight terrorism \u2014 \u201c a sophisticated law enforcement technology solution that aggregates and analyzes public safety data in real time .\u201d The NYPD now refers to the DAS as \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest networks of cameras, license plate readers, and radiological [sensors], designed to detect and prevent terrorist acts, but also of great value in criminal investigations.\u201d    Since unveiling the DAS, Microsoft and the NYPD have marketed the technology to other police departments around the country and the world. According to a report from the Brennan Center for Justice, they have sold it to police departments in Brazil, Singapore, and Washington, D.C. This month, the Intercept reported that the Atlanta Police Department has been using the DAS since 2019. Microsoft and the NYPD share the profits from these deals, with the NYPD getting 30% .   The system\u2019s surveillance tools, particularly facial recognition, have been particularly controversial. Under pressure from employees, Microsoft and a handful of other companies recently declared they would no longer sell facial recognition technology to police unless there\u2019s a federal law regulating its use that is \u201cgrounded in the protection of human rights.\u201d    Microsoft received plenty of positive media coverage for its pledge to stop selling facial recognition technology. However, cases like this lawsuit reinforce the idea that police are utilizing many different types of data \u2014 like sealed records \u2014 to create the most robust system to track people possible.   Microsoft didn\u2019t respond to a request to comment for this story.   The true extent of the NYPD\u2019s technological power should come into clearer focus soon under New York City\u2019s newly implemented POST Act \u2014 or the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology Act \u2014 which mandates that the police department disclose to the city what technological tools it uses.    But it may not shed more light on the NYPD\u2019s use of sealed records. The POST Act is focused on providing a mechanism for the police to share with the public what surveillance systems it is using, but the new law focuses on the systems themselves rather than what data those systems use.   \u201cSo the fact that the NYPD\u2019s surveillance systems \u2014 all of them \u2014 use sealed arrest information might not get captured by the reporting required under this law,\u201d Borchetta   said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42694607578</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-JPB1-JCSC-J3RC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Huffington Post Canada</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The piece says that the Adam Smith Institute, among others, have 'endorsed public spending increases to confront the coronavirus outbreak and state-funded investment to boost the recovery'.On the former point, this is totally unremarkable. There is a role for temporary state spending during the emergency stages of a pandemic. We have repeatedly said that the furlough scheme and business loans are sensible policies to maintain as much productive capacity as possible while swathes of the economy are closed. </p><p>In a call with the Observer I explained that all this spending is possible today because of the responsible reduction in public deficit spending over the last decade. For some reason this did not make it into the article.On the latter point about infrastructure spending, this is an absurd misrepresentation of my position and at no point does the story quote me supporting infrastructure spending. In fact, I made the point to the journalist in question that state-spending tends to be directed towards politically favoured projects rather than what is economically beneficial. That's why my colleague, Matt Kilcoyne, repeated our opposition to the wasteful white elephant HS2 project[1] in April.The article also quotes me backing the Bank of England's loose monetary policy and 'temporary and short-term[2]' support for Government borrowing. This is sensible during the crisis. But, as I made clear to the Observer, the Government extending their overdraft with the Bank of England, which they intend to repay by the end of the year, is not a long term solution. The Bank cannot, and knows it cannot, fund state spending indefinitely. It would be extremely inflationary if continued. There is still no magic money tree.This has been an extremely busy time for the ASI. We have been mentioned in the media thousands of times, released four major and timely reports, and written dozens of opinion pieces. We have pointed out the colossal extent of state failure during this crisis, especially when it comes to Public Health England's catastrophic approach to testing[3], the excessive focus on 'protecting the NHS[4]', and how centralised PPE procurement has been problematic[5].We have also been fervent advocates for a plan to reopen the economy when it is safe to do so[6] (as reported in The Guardian[7]). We have also released polling[8] that found three-quarters of respondents (72%) think that the Government should reduce taxes after the lockdown to try to increase economic growth and jobs. We have also been part of debates about privacy and contact tracing[9], freedom of speech[10], and much much more.Over the coming weeks and months we will have a huge challenge on our hands to reboot the economy. The ASI have been and always will be emphatic supporters of entrepreneurialism, reducing taxes and regulatory barriers to businesses large and small. The Observer buries the lead in the final sentence of their article:The four thinktanks continue to believe the Treasury should examine tax-cutting measures to promote innovation and entrepreneurial activity, saying that over the longer term, Whitehall was poor at allocating funds to the economy in the most effective way.We will have much more to say on this topic in the coming week. Don't you worry, we'll be setting the record straight.

Below is a transcript of the debate; we'll update it as the text becomes available.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Speakers: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii); Tom Steyer; Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.); Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); Former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Andrew Yang; Beto O'Rourke; Former HUD secretary Julian Castro, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.); Anderson Cooper, CNN host; Erin Burnett, CNN host; Marc Lacey, New York Times national editor          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">COOPER: And live from Otterbein University, just north of Columbus, Ohio, this is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and watching around the world, watching us on CNN, CNN International, CNN En Espanol, Cnn.com, thenewyorktimes.com, CNN's Facebook page, and listening on the Westwood One radio network, SiriusXM satellite radio, NPR, and the American Forces Network.</p><p>I'm Anderson Cooper moderating tonight's debate, along with CNN's Erin Burnett and New York Times national editor Mark Lacey. We are in Ohio tonight, because it's one of the most critical battleground states. Ohio has backed all but two presidential winners in every election since 1896.</p><p>BURNETT: The top 12 Democratic presidential candidates are at their positions behind the podiums. This is a record number of candidates for a presidential primary debate, so to accommodate the large group, there are no opening statements tonight.</p><p>LACEY: Before we begin, a reminder of the ground rules. You'll each receive 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 seconds for clarifications. Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates, as that will count against your time.</p><p>COOPER: And we remind our audience here in the Rike Center at Otterbein to be respectful so the candidates can hear the questions and each other. All right, let's begin.</p><p>Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support. Senator Warren, I want to start with you. You have said that there's already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn't it be the voters who determine the president's fate?</p><p>WARREN: Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. And I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry.</p><p>When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn't think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown, too, a fare-thee-well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry.</p><p>Now, that didn't happen. And look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the president of the United States.</p><p>Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump, but, understand, it's about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. You're all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any chance but to impeach President Trump? Please respond.</p><p>SANDERS: No, they don't. In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. It's not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller Report. I think that the House will find him guilty of - worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous.</p><p>And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a president of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward, by the way, not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.</p><p>COOPER: Vice President Biden, during the Clinton impeachment proceedings, you said, and I quote, \"The American people don't think that they've made a mistake by electing Bill Clinton, and we in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision.\" With the country now split, have Democrats been careful enough in pursuing the impeachment of President Trump?</p><p>BIDEN: Yes, they have. I said from the beginning that if, in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller Report, if they did that, they would have no choice - no choice - but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.</p><p>This president - and I agree with Bernie, Senator Sanders - is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that, in fact, he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that members of Congress have to be, in her words, fair to the president and give him a chance to exonerate himself. You've already said that based on everything you've seen, you would vote to remove him from office. Is that being fair to the president?</p><p>HARRIS: Well, it's just being observant, because he has committed crimes in plain sight. I mean, it's shocking, but he told us who he was. Maya Angelou told us years ago, listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time.</p><p>During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people. He's been selling out working people. He's been selling out our values. He's been selling out national security. And on this issue with Ukraine, he has been selling out our democracy.</p><p>Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must act.</p><p>But the reality of it is that I don't really think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. And he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence. And he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server. And there's been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Booker, you have said that President Trump's, quote, \"moral vandalism\" disqualifies him from being president. Can you be fair in an impeachment trial? Please respond.</p><p>BOOKER: So, first of all, we must be fair. We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office. This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship.</p><p>Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage. I understand the outrage that we all feel. But we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn't rip us apart.</p><p>Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that's what this nation needs, in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a senator, do my duty. This president has violated his. I will do mine.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator Booker.</p><p>Senator Klobuchar, you have - what do you say to those who fear that impeachment is a distraction from issues that impact people's day-to-day lives, health care, the economy, and could backfire on Democrats?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: We can do two things at once. That's our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests.</p><p>He has not been standing up for the workers of Ohio. He's not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa. And I take this even a step further. You know, when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he's digging up dirt on an opponent. That's illegal conduct. That's what he was doing. He didn't talk to him about the Russian invasion. He talked to him about that.</p><p>So I'm still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again. I'd like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again. And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again.</p><p>It doesn't make America great again. It makes Russia great again. And that is what this president has done. So whether it is workers' issues, whether it is farmers' issues, he has put his own private interests ...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: ... and I will not do that.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you. Secretary Castro, is impeachment a distraction?</p><p>CASTRO: Not at all. We can walk and chew gun at the same time. And all of us are out there every single day talking about what we're going to do to make sure that more people cross a graduation stage, that more families have great health care, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio, where Donald Trump has broken his promises, because Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.</p><p>Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller Report point out 10 different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is in ongoingly - in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power.</p><p>We have to impeach this president. And the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.</p><p>COOPER: Mayer Buttigieg, you have said that impeachment should be bipartisan. There's been, obviously, very little Republican support to date, yet Democrats are proceeding. Is that a mistake?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, it's a mistake on the part of Republicans, who enable the president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share.</p><p>Look, the president has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the president accountable, for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It's also about the presidency itself, because a president 10 years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.</p><p>But everyone on this stage, by definition, is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end. I want you to picture what it's going to be like, what it's actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president.</p><p>It starts out feeling like a happy thought; this particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over. But really think about where we'll be: vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process.</p><p>I'm running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Congresswoman Gabbard, you're the only sitting House member on this stage. How do you respond?</p><p>GABBARD: If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country. Unfortunately, this is what we're already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election. And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016.</p><p>The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House. And I think that it should continue to play its course out, to gather all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward.</p><p>If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Congresswoman.</p><p>Mr. Steyer, you've been calling for impeachment for two years. Does there need to be bipartisan support?</p><p>STEYER: Well, Anderson, this is my first time on this stage, so I just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent, and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But I also want to point out that Anderson's right. Two years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement, because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They're the voice that counts, and that's who I went to, the American people.</p><p>COOPER: Mr. Yang, do you think there's already enough evidence out there to impeach the president? Please respond.</p><p>YANG: I support impeachment, but we shouldn't have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016. We're standing in the great state of Ohio, the ultimate purple state, the ultimate bellwether state.</p><p>Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points? Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns. And we are not stopping there. How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio? Raise your hands.</p><p>It's not just you. Amazon alone is closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls, soaking up $20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes. These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected, the fourth industrial revolution. And that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office.</p><p>The fact is, Donald Trump, when we're talking about him, we are losing. We need to present a new vision, and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump.</p><p>COOPER: Congressman O'Rourke, on impeachment, please respond.</p><p>O'ROURKE: You know, I think about everyone who's ever served this country in uniform. We have two examples here on this stage tonight in Mayor Buttigieg and Congresswoman Gabbard, those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our Constitution. We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice.</p><p>And we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president's criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation, then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China, in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>O'ROURKE: If we do not hold him to account, if there is not justice, not only have we failed this moment, our Constitution and our country, but we have failed everyone who has sacrificed and laid their lives down on the line.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>O'ROURKE: And we cannot do that.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Congressman. The impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump's attempts to get political dirt from Ukraine on Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter. Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you.</p><p>Having said that, on Sunday, you announced that if you're president, no one in your family or associated with you will be involved in any foreign businesses. My question is, if it's not okay for a president's family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it okay for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden?</p><p>BIDEN: Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on.</p><p>And what I wanted to make a point about - and my son's statement speaks for itself. He spoke about it today. My son's statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office.</p><p>On the - look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions - three occasions - has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous.</p><p>Rudy Giuliani, the president, and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn't want me to be the candidate. He's going after me because he knows, if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.</p><p>(UNKNOWN): Anderson - Anderson ...</p><p>COOPER: Hold on, sorry, just to follow up. Mr. Vice President, as you said, your son, Hunter, today gave an interview, admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgement by serving on that board in Ukraine. Did you make a mistake by letting him? You were the point person on Ukraine at the time. You can answer.</p><p>BIDEN: Look, my son's statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything, so there would be no potential conflict.</p><p>My son made a judgment. I'm proud of the judgement he made. I'm proud of what he had to say. And let's focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focusing on.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, your response?</p><p>SANDERS: Let me make a point. I think that it is absolutely imperative we go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we're forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. We're forgetting about the existential threat of climate change. We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. So what we have got to do is end this corruption, set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way.</p><p>But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, thank you. Mark?</p><p>LACEY: We want to move now to the economy.</p><p>(UNKNOWN): May I get in, please?</p><p>LACEY: You've proposed some sweeping plans...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACEY: ... free public college...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN): It is wrong to move on.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you. We're going to -- Senator Warren.</p><p>(UNKNOWN): It is wrong to move on.</p><p>LACEY: Senator Warren, we've proposed -- you've proposed some sweeping plans, free public college, free universal childcare, eliminating most Americans' college debt. And you've said how you're going to pay for those plans. But you have not specified how you're going to pay for the most expensive plan, Medicare for all. Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?</p><p>WARREN: So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down. You know, the way I see this is, I have been out all around this country. I've done 140 town halls now, been to 27 states and Puerto Rico. Shoot, I've done 70,000 selfies, which must be the new measure of democracy.</p><p>And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. So I have talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter's been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I've talked to the young man who has MS.</p><p>And here's the thing about all of them. They all had great health insurance right at the beginning. But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.</p><p>Look, the way I see this, it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer, to think about the changes in your family if your mom has diabetes, or what it means for your life going forward if you've been diagnosed with MS. But what you shouldn't have to worry about is how you're going to pay for your health care after that.</p><p>LACEY: Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he's going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for all. You've endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?</p><p>WARREN: So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.</p><p>LACEY: Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been, quote, \"evasive\" about how she's going to pay for Medicare for all. What's your response?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.</p><p>No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is, we really can deliver health care for every American and move forward with the boldest, biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself.</p><p>But the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion-dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes-or-no question is Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare. We let you access it if you want to. And if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that, too. That is what most Americans want, Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your health care and for your family. And it can be delivered without an increase on the middle-class taxes.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mayor. Senator, your response?</p><p>WARREN: So, let's be clear. Whenever someone hears the term Medicare for all who want it, understand what that really means. It's Medicare for all who can afford it. And that's the problem we've got.</p><p>Medicare for all is the gold standard. It is the way we get health care coverage for every single American, including the family whose child has been diagnosed with cancer, including the person who's just gotten an MS diagnosis. That's how we make sure that everyone gets health care.</p><p>We can pay for this. I've laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families. And I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about.</p><p>I've been studying this, you know, for the biggest part of my life...</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Can the -- can the...</p><p>WARREN: ... why people go bankrupt.</p><p>LACEY: ... mayor respond?</p><p>WARREN: Sure.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I don't think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice. And the choice of Medicare for all who want it, which is affordable for everyone, because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that health care. It's just better than Medicare for all whether you want it or not.</p><p>And I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years, when we could achieve that same big, bold goal -- and once again, we have a president -- we're competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized, even more than now, after everything we've been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided. Why unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?</p><p>LACEY: Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. Senator Sanders?</p><p>WARREN: I'd like to be able to respond...</p><p>SANDERS: Well, as somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I said, let's be clear. Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone. Co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone. We're going to do better than the Canadians do, and that is what they have managed to do.</p><p>At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less -- substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, at least that's a straightforward answer, but there's a better way.</p><p>LACEY: Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up?</p><p>WARREN: So my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking, middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind millions of people who cannot. And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, \"Sorry, we're not covering your expensive cancer treatments, we're not covering your expensive treatments for MS.\"</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar...</p><p>WARREN: \"We're not covering what you need.\"</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.</p><p>I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning and that's have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies. That is what we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in our years.</p><p>And I'm tired of hearing, whenever I say these things, oh, it's Republican talking points. You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan that's going to do that. I think there is a better way that is bold, that will cover more people, and it's the one we should get behind.</p><p>LACEY: Senator Warren?</p><p>WARREN: You know, I didn't spend most of my time in Washington. I spent most of my time studying one basic question, and that is why hardworking people go broke. And one of the principal reasons for that is the cost of health care.</p><p>And back when I was studying it, two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance. The problem we've got right now is the overall cost of health care. And, look, you can try to spin this any way you want. I've spent my entire life on working on how America's middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back. I've put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part is that is we have got to stop...</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN: ... Americans from going bankrupt over health care costs.</p><p>LACEY: Senator Klobuchar, do you want to respond?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Yes, I do. And I appreciate Elizabeth's work. But, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done. And we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices.</p><p>But what really bothers me about this discussion, which we've had so many times, is that we don't talk about the things that I'm hearing about from regular Americans. That is long-term care. We are seeing -- I once called it a silver tsunami. The aging -- and then someone told me that was too negative, so I call it the silver surge -- the aging of the population.</p><p>We need to make easier to get long-term care insurance and strengthen Medicaid. In this state, the state of Ohio, that has been hit by the opioid epidemic, we need to take on those pharma companies and make them pay for the addictions that they have caused and the people that they have killed.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Those are the issues that I hear about when I'm in Toledo.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARRIS: I'd like to be...</p><p>LACEY: Let me -- let me bring you in here, Vice President, for your response. Are Senators Warren and Sanders being realistic about the difficulty of enacting their plans?</p><p>BIDEN: First of all, the plan we're hearing discussed is the Biden plan, the one I built forward. Build on Obamacare, add a public option. We can go into that. I can talk about that if you'd like.</p><p>But here's the deal. On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.</p><p>And we talk about how we're going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that, in fact, it will reduce costs. But for people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000, because the fact is they'll pay more in new taxes, 7.4 percent plus, or 5 percent, plus a 4 percent income tax. If you're making -- if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000. That is more than they will possibly save on this health care plan. We have a plan put forward that will work.</p><p>LACEY: Senator Sanders, do you want to respond to -- we were coming to you.</p><p>SANDERS: I get a little bit tired -- I must say -- of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel, 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt for one reason, they came down with cancer.</p><p>I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And if we don't have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator Sanders.</p><p>BIDEN: We can stand up to them.</p><p>LACEY: Senator Harris, your response?</p><p>HARRIS: This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And it's outrageous. There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive health care. And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die, because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.</p><p>Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women's bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>HARRIS: And let's talk about that.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>HARRIS: That is a significant health care issue in America today.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>BURNETT: I want to turn now to jobs. According to a recent study, about a quarter of American jobs could be lost to automation in just the next 10 years. Ohio is one of the states likely to be hardest hit.</p><p>Senator Sanders, you say your federal jobs guarantee is part of the answer to the threat from automation, but tens of millions of Americans could end up losing their jobs. Are you promising that you will have a job for every single one of those Americans?</p><p>SANDERS: Damn right we will. And I'll tell you why. If you look at what goes on in America today, we have an infrastructure which is collapsing. We could put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, airports, et cetera.</p><p>Furthermore -- and I hope we will discuss it at length tonight -- this planet faces the greatest threat in its history from climate change. And the Green New Deal that I have advocated will create up to 20 million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.</p><p>We need workers to do childcare. We need workers, great teachers to come in to school systems which don't have the teachers that we need right now. We need more doctors. We need more dentists. We need more carpenters. We need more sheet metal workers. And when we talk about making public colleges and universities tuition fee and cancelling student debt, we're going to give those people the opportunity to get those good jobs.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator Sanders, thank you. Mr. Yang, your main solution to job loss from automation is a universal basic income. Why is giving people $1,000 a month better than Sanders' plan to guaranteeing them a job?</p><p>YANG: I am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee, but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice. What are the jobs? Who manages you? What if you don't like your job? What if you're not good at your job?</p><p>The fact is, most Americans do not want to work for the federal government. And saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most Americans would embrace.</p><p>Also, Senator Sanders, the description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife, who's at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic. We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month. It actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities. It helps all Americans transition.</p><p>Because the fact is -- and you know this in Ohio -- if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources, you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants. When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy from our people, our families, and our communities up. It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do. This is the sort of positive vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace as a party.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator Booker, a federal jobs guarantee or $1,000 a month, are those the best solutions there? Please respond.</p><p>BOOKER: Well, first of all, I'm happy to get in finally. And I just want to say, as a great -- as a great New Jersian, Yogi Berra, said, \"I am having deja vu all over again.\"</p><p>I'm having deja vu all over again, first of all, because I saw this play in 2016's election. We are literally using Donald Trump's lies. And the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. He should not have to defend ourselves. And the only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump seeing that we're distracting from his malfeasance and selling out of his office.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'm having deja vu all over again. And I'm having deja vu all over again because we have another health care debate, and we're not talking about the clear and existential threat in America that we're in a state that has had two Planned Parenthoods close. We are seeing all over this country women's reproductive rights under attack. And God bless Kamala, but you know what? Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And men...</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you.</p><p>BOOKER: It is not just because women are our daughters and our friends and our wives. It's because women are people. And people deserve to control their own bodies.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator, thank you. We are going to get to that issue later on tonight.</p><p>Senator Warren, you wrote that blaming job loss on automation is, quote, \"a good story, except it's not really true.\" So should workers here in Ohio not be worried about losing their jobs to automation?</p><p>WARREN: So the data show that we have had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principal reason has been bad trade policy. The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who've been calling the shots on trade, giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line.</p><p>I have a plan to fix that, and it's accountable capitalism. It says, you want to have one of the giant corporations in America? Then, by golly, 40 percent of your board of directors should be elected by your employees. That will make a difference when a corporation decides, gee, we could save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, when there are people on the board in the boardroom saying, no, do you know what that does to our company, do you know what that does to our community, to what it does to our workers?</p><p>We also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need to restructure strength in this economy, and that's where it starts.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Secretary Castro, what's your response to Senator Warren's claim that automation is a good story, except it's not really true?</p><p>CASTRO: Well, I think -- I think what folks have said is that that is only part of the issue, right? You know, I believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation. I'm even willing to pilot something like UBI and to see how that would work.</p><p>But I think we need to focus on making sure that we spark job opportunity for people across this country. As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio, in the latest job data, Ohio is losing jobs under Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to Ohio and the industrial Midwest. I would invest in infrastructure to put people back to work. I would invest in a Green New Deal to unleash millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy.</p><p>I was in Newton, Iowa, a few weeks ago and I visited a place called TPI. Newton, Iowa, had a Maytag washing machine manufacturing facility, and then it closed down. TPI manufactures wind turbines. They're putting hundreds of people to work at decent-paying jobs and creating a better future for those families.</p><p>On top of that, let me just say this. We need to support working families. We need to invest in things like...</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</p><p>CASTRO: ... universal childcare, so that people can afford childcare instead of having to pay 20 percent of their income for it.</p><p>YANG: Senator Warren, I just need -- I just need to address this.</p><p>BURNETT: Go ahead, Mr. Yang.</p><p>YANG: Senator Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation. And they're smart. They see what's happening around them. Their Main Street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonalds, every grocery store, every CVS. Driving a truck is the most common job in 29 states, including this one; 3.5 million truck drivers in this country. And my friends in California are piloting self-driving trucks.</p><p>What is that going to mean for the 3.5 million truckers or the 7 million Americans who work in truck stops, motels, and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal? Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator Warren, respond, please.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN: So I understand that what we're all looking for is how we strengthen America's middle class. And actually, I think the thing closest to the universal basic income is Social Security. It's one of the reasons that I've put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add $200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now.</p><p>That $200 a month will lift nearly 5 million families out of poverty. And it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more. It also has a provision for your wife, for those who stay home to do caregiving for children or for seniors, and creates an opportunity for them to get credit on their Social Security.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you.</p><p>WARREN: So after a lifetime of hard work, people are entitled to retire with dignity.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren.</p><p>WARREN: I see this as an important question about just -- I want to understand the data on this.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator, thank you very much.</p><p>WARREN: And I want to make sure we're responding to make this work.</p><p>BURNETT: Your time is up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: I want to give Congresswoman Gabbard a chance to respond.</p><p>GABBARD: Thank you. You know, really what this is about is getting to the heart of the fear that is well founded. As people look to this automation revolution, they look to uncertainty. They don't know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives.</p><p>And I agree with my friend, Andrew Yang. I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see.</p><p>This has to do with bad trade deals that we've seen in the past that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families. Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the American people. I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that. The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have but is intrinsic to who we all are as Americans, whatever we choose to do with our lives, and we can't forget that.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you very much.</p><p>LACEY: One of the industries most at risk from a changing economy is the auto industry. General Motors used to be the largest employer in Ohio. Now it's 72nd. Today, thousands of GM workers here in Ohio and across the country are on strike. All of you on the stage have voiced support for these workers.</p><p>Senator Booker, one of the latest impasses in negotiations involves bringing jobs back from Mexico. As president, how would you convince GM to return production to the United States?</p><p>BOOKER: Well, first of all, the one point I wanted to make about the UBI conversation -- and I hope that my friend, Andrew Yang, will come out for this -- doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It would put more money in people's pockets than giving them $1,000 a month.</p><p>We have to start putting the dignity back in work. And, number one, you start having trade deals, not like this thing that the president is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesn't put workers at the center of every trade deal.</p><p>We must make sure we are not giving corporate tax incentives for people to move jobs out of our country, but start to put the worker at the center of that and make sure that they have the resources to succeed.</p><p>But it's more than that. I stood with these workers because we're seeing this trend all over our country. I stood with unions because, right now, unions in America are under attack. As union membership has gone down, we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country.</p><p>So the other thing that I'll do as president of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread, to make sure we have sectoral bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers' conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke, same question for you. How would you convince GM to bring production back to the United States from Mexico?</p><p>O'ROURKE: I've met with these members of the UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio, which has just been devastated, decimated by GM and their malfeasance, paying effectively zero in taxes last year. The people of Ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure around there.</p><p>What they want is a shot. And they want fairness in how we treat workers in this country, which they are not receiving today. Part of the way to do that is through our trade deals, making sure that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions, which they are effectively unable to do today. Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker, it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage.</p><p>If we complement that with investment in world-class pre-K through 12 public education, get behind our world-class public school educators, if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college, and if we elevate the role of unions in this country, and create more than 5 million apprenticeships over the next eight years, we will make sure that every single American has a shot.</p><p>They don't want a handout. They don't want a job guarantee. They just want a shot. And as president, I will give them that shot.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>BURNETT: Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate. The top 1 percent now own more of this nation's wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined. Senator Sanders, when you introduced your wealth tax, which would tax the assets of the wealthiest Americans, you said, quoting you, Senator, \"Billionaires should not exist.\" Is the goal of your plan to tax billionaires out of existence?</p><p>SANDERS: When you have a half-a-million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have 87 people -- 87 million people uninsured or underinsured, when you've got hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college, and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt, and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage.</p><p>And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality. And we cannot afford a billionaire class, whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years.</p><p>So if you're asking me do I think we should demand that the wealthy start paying -- the wealthiest, top 0.1 percent, start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us? Yes, that's exactly what I believe.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What's your plan for closing the income gap?</p><p>STEYER: Well, first of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It's absolutely wrong. It's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.</p><p>I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there's something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that's the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings.</p><p>As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven't had a raise -- 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get $11 bucks. It's $7.25. If you included the productivity gains of American workers, it would be over $20 bucks.</p><p>There's something wrong here, and that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That's why I'm running for president, because we're not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants -- health care, education, Green New Deal, or a living wage...</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.</p><p>STEYER: ... unless we break the power of these corporations.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren's wealth tax plans do that?</p><p>BIDEN: No, look, demonizing wealth -- what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea -- we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax -- I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate, of 39.5 percent.</p><p>I would double it, because guess what? Why in God's name should someone who's clipping coupons in the stock market make -- in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is -- like I said -- the -- a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It's ridiculous. And they pay a lower tax.</p><p>Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are -- there's $1,640,000,000,000 in tax loopholes. You can't justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time.</p><p>Secondly -- I mean, thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to -- we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We're going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not.</p><p>And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody's right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed is they're going back and not investing in our employees, they're reinvesting and buying back their stock.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.</p><p>BIDEN: See, I'm doing the same thing.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Senator Warren, your response.</p><p>WARREN: So I think this is about our values as a country. Show me your budget, show me your tax plans, and we'll know what your values are.</p><p>And right now in America, the top 0.1 percent have so much wealth -- understand this -- that if we put a 2 cent tax on their 50 millionth and first dollar, and on every dollar after that, we would have enough money to provide universal childcare for every baby in this country, age zero to five, universal pre-K for every child, raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America, provide for universal tuition-free college, put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities...</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren.</p><p>WARREN: ... and cancel -- no, let me finish, please, and cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it. My question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax. It's why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren.</p><p>BIDEN: No one is supporting billionaires.</p><p>BURNETT: Mayor Buttigieg? Mayor Buttigieg, your response?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I'm all for a wealth tax. I'm all for just about everything that was just mentioned in these answers. Let me tell, though, how this looks from the industrial Midwest where I live.</p><p>Washington politicians, congressmen and senators, saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes. I didn't even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that I would see out the windows of my dad's Chevy Cavalier when he drove me to school, I didn't know that wasn't every city until I went away to college. Now I drive my own Chevy. It's a Chevy Cruze. It used to be built right in Lordstown, which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers.</p><p>But why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place? It's because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything. And while he's unquestionably made it dramatically worse, this is time to realize that we're paying attention to the wrong things. We're paying attention...</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: ... to who sounded better on a debate stage or in a committee hearing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: This is what it's going to take to get something done.</p><p>BURNETT: Will a wealth tax -- will a wealth tax work?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that after that tax bill passed went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer. That was the one time in his presidency he told the truth.</p><p>So we have different ways -- I would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that help the rich, including what he did with the corporate tax rate, including what he did on international taxation. You add it all up, you got a lot of money that, one, helps pay for that childcare, protects that dignity of work, makes sure we have decent retirement, and makes sure that our kids can go to good schools.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you. Senator...</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: It is not one idea that rules here.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Warren, please respond.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN: So understand, taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does, that the rich are not like you and me. The really, really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing. We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation.</p><p>Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I would like to respond to that.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator Klobuchar, respond, please.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: You know, I think simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people. I wouldn't even be up on this stage if it wasn't for unions and the dignity of work. If my grandpa didn't have unions protecting him in those mines, he wouldn't have survived. If my mom didn't have unions as a teacher, she wouldn't have been able to make the wages she made when my parents got divorced.</p><p>So just because we have different ideas, and get to the same place in terms of beating Donald Trump and taking this on, we are in Ohio. We can win Ohio in the presidency, but only if we unite, if we unite around ideals and don't go fighting against each other and instead take the fight to him.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Senator Harris, you want to give working families a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year to help close the income gap.</p><p>HARRIS: Right.</p><p>BURNETT: Is that a better solution than a wealth tax?</p><p>HARRIS: Well, here's how I think about it. When I was growing up, my mother raised my sister and me. We would often come home from school before she came home from work. She'd come home, she'd cook dinner, and at some point we'd go to bed, and she'd sit up at the kitchen table trying to figure out how to make it all work.</p><p>And when I think about where we are right now in 2020, I do believe justice is on the ballot. It's on the ballot in terms of impeachment, it's on the ballot in terms of economic justice, health justice, and so many other issues.</p><p>So when I think about this issue, I'm thinking about that dad who tonight is going to be sitting at his kitchen table, after everyone's gone to sleep, and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee trying to figure out how it's going to make -- how he's going to make it work. And he's probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month, he's going to have to start driving an Uber. And what does that mean? That means that with those two jobs, he's going to miss his kids' soccer games.</p><p>That's the reality for Americans today, which is why, yes, when I get elected and pass this bill, which will give the American family who makes less than $100,000 a year a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year that they can take home at up to $500 a month, that's going to make a real difference in that man's life. And don't tell him that's not a big deal...</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>HARRIS: ... when he's trying to get through to the end of the month.</p><p>BURNETT: Mr. Yang, your response. Would you impose a wealth tax?</p><p>YANG: Senator Warren is 100 percent right that we're in the midst of the most extreme winner-take-all economy in history. And a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected.</p><p>If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countries' mistakes. Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax. If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands, because we know best how to use it.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke, do you think a wealth tax is the best way to address income inequality? Your response.</p><p>O'ROURKE: I think it's part of the solution. But I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions.</p><p>I think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas, Nevada. She's working four jobs, raising her child with disabilities, and any American with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and get by in this country already. Some of those jobs working for some of these corporations, she wants to know how we are going to help her, how we're going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs, that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities, that she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage.</p><p>And Senator Warren said show me your budget, show me your tax plan, and you'll show me your values. She has yet to describe her tax plan and whether or not that person I met would see a tax increase. Under my administration, if you make less than $250,000 a year as a family, you will not see a tax increase. That family needs to know that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>(UNKNOWN): Erin, let me say...</p><p>BURNETT: I want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.</p><p>WARREN: So I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive. Look, I don't have a beef with billionaires. My problem is you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America. I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You built it in part getting your goods to markets on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for.</p><p>And all I'm saying is, you make it to the top, the top 0.1 percent, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator, thank you.</p><p>WARREN: That's what this is about.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator Castro, your response?</p><p>O'ROURKE: There's no argument there. I just want to make sure that we're lifting up those families who are working and need help through an expanded earned income tax credit or child tax credit...</p><p>WARREN: But that is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'ROURKE: ... which we will do in my administration.</p><p>BURNETT: Go ahead, Senator.</p><p>WARREN: That is the point. This is universal childcare for every baby in this country, early educational opportunities for every child, universal pre-K no matter where you live for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old.</p><p>O'ROURKE: But in addition to that, will they see a tax increase?</p><p>WARREN: Raising the wages -- no, raising the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country. This is about universal college, about investment in our HBCUs, about making sure that we get rid of the student loan debt burden that is crushing...</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'ROURKE: ... I just want to know if working families are going to see a tax increase.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: I want to get Secretary Castro in here, please, Congressman. Go ahead, Secretary.</p><p>CASTRO: Thanks a lot, Erin. And you see that everybody has their own plans. And let me just say that the way that I view this is born out of my own experience.</p><p>I grew up like I bet a lot folks in this room grew up and folks that are watching on TV. I grew up with my twin brother, Joaquin, in a single-parent household where my mom was working hard to support us and also her mom, my grandmother. And we knew what it was like to wonder whether we were going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month or sometimes have the electricity turned off.</p><p>And when I was a kid, to look at the grocery list that seemed to get shorter and shorter, and that's what's happening to a lot of families these days. I was in Las Vegas a few months ago, and I visited people who were homeless, who are living in storm drainage tunnels under the Las Vegas strip in the shadow of hotels and casinos that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, where people from around the world are spending so much money on vacations.</p><p>We can do better than that. I believe that wealth and equality tax, as I've proposed, is part of the answer, but also I've proposed an inheritance tax, raising the top marginal tax rate...</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Secretary.</p><p>CASTRO: ... and investing in things like universal childcare and affordable housing.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Senator Booker, please respond.</p><p>BOOKER: Well, first of all, I just want to be respond by -- you know, we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president. And how we talk about each other in this debate actually really matters.</p><p>I've had the privilege of working with or being friends with everybody on this stage, and tearing each other down because we have a different plan to me is unacceptable. I have seen this script before.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It didn't work in 2016, and it will be a disaster for us in 2020. And so I have a different plan than Elizabeth Warren. I have a different plan than many people on this stage. And it involves, again, fair taxes for the richest. We have a lot of work to do there. But we've had 20 years of presidential debates, and we have never talked about the violence in America of child poverty.</p><p>We have got to begin to talk more eloquently and persuasively and urgently about doing the things not just to make sure fair taxes are paid by people on the top, but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world.</p><p>My plan will focus on that, and these are some of the issues we should be talking about, not defining ourselves just by what we're against, but we need to win this election by talking about who and what we are for.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Booker.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: We've got to take a quick break. We've got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio will be right back after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COOPER: And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.</p><p>I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all American forces from northern Syria, abandoning America's long-time Kurdish allies. As a result, Turkey has now evaded Syria, ISIS detainees have escaped, and the Kurds have announced a new deal with the government in Damascus, a victory for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and Russia, and Iran.</p><p>Vice President Biden, we know you would not have withdrawn troops from northern Syria in this way, but that is already in process. So would you send American troops back into northern Syria to prevent an ISIS resurgence and protect our Kurdish allies?</p><p>BIDEN: I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad's people. And the president of the United States saying, if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they're in, they'll only go to Europe and won't affect us.</p><p>It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history -- excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I've never seen a time -- and I've spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I've spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what's happening here.</p><p>What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he's going to have a problem -- because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he's going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now. Pay that price.</p><p>COOPER: Just to clarify, Mr. Vice President, would you want American troops back in northern Syria?</p><p>BIDEN: I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being -- having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds. They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful what this man has done.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Congresswoman Gabbard, last week you said that American troops should get out of Syria now. You don't agree with how the president handled the withdrawal. What would you have done differently? How would you have pulled out troops without the bloodshed we're seeing now?</p><p>GABBARD: Well, first of all, we've got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we've been waging in Syria.</p><p>Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war.</p><p>Not only that, but the New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war. Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.</p><p>As president, I will end these regime change wars by doing two things -- ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern-day siege the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen, that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve, and I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like Al Qaida in Syria who have been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>GABBARD: I'd like to ask Senator Warren if she would join me in calling for an end to this regime change war in Syria, finally.</p><p>WARREN: So, look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.</p><p>What this president has done is that he has sucked up to dictators, he has made impulsive decisions that often his own team doesn't understand, he has cut and run on our allies, and he has enriched himself at the expense of the United States of America. In Syria, he has created a bigger-than-ever humanitarian crisis. He has helped ISIS get another foothold, a new lease on life.</p><p>I sit on the Armed Services Committee. I talk with our military leaders about this.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN: I was in Iraq and went through the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>WARREN: We need to get out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no military solution in this region.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator. Mayor Buttigieg, Mayor Buttigieg, like many of your fellow candidates on the stage, you've been calling for an end to endless wars. What's your response on Syria?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong. The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It's a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.</p><p>Look, I didn't think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it's also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.</p><p>Meanwhile, soldiers in the field are reporting that for the first time they feel ashamed -- ashamed -- of what their country has done. We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms asking, what the hell happened to American leadership?</p><p>And when I was deployed, I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word. And our allies knew it and our enemies knew it.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: You take that away, you are taking away what makes America America.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: It makes our troops and the world a much more dangerous place.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?</p><p>GABBARD: Yeah, absolutely. So, really, what you're saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee Syria, that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security, you would continue this policy of the U.S. actually providing arms in support to terrorist groups in Syria, like Al Qaida, HTS, al-Nusra and others, because they are the ones who have been the ground force in this regime change war? That's really what you're saying?</p><p>COOPER: Mayor Pete -- Mayor Buttigieg?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: No, you can embrace -- or you can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump's policy, as you're doing.</p><p>GABBARD: Will you end the regime change war, is the question.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: What we are doing...</p><p>GABBARD: What is an endless war if it's not a regime change war?</p><p>COOPER: Allow him to respond. Please allow him to respond.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: What we are doing -- or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word. Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too.</p><p>When I was deployed, not just the Afghan National Army forces, but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U.S. forces. I would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there. And it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next.</p><p>This president has betrayed American values. Our credibility has been tattered.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I will restore U.S. credibility before it is finally too late.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, is Turkey still a U.S. ally? Should they remain in NATO?</p><p>SANDERS: I'm sorry. Say that again?</p><p>COOPER: Is Turkey still a U.S. ally? Should they remain in NATO?</p><p>SANDERS: No, Turkey is not a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.</p><p>The crisis here, as I think Joe said and Pete said, is when you begin to betray people, in terms of the Kurds, 11,000 of them died fighting ISIS, 20,000 were wounded. And the United States said, \"We're with you, we're standing with you.\" And then suddenly, one day after a phone call with Erdogan, announced by tweet, Trump reverses that policy.</p><p>Now, you tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States. In other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy, because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: But this is really important, because what this president has done shows that American leadership shapes the behavior of our allies, or sometimes allies, too. Remember, the problem right now is not just that -- with our competitors. And, for example a place like China, the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy and don't get a peep of support from the president. It's just not the behavior of adversaries like Russia.</p><p>But our one-time allies, like Saudi Arabia, which the CIA just concluded was responsible, as we all knew, for murdering and dismembering an American resident and journalist.</p><p>And Turkey, which was an American ally. That's the point. We had leverage. But when we abandon the international stage, when we think our only choices are between endless war or total isolation, the consequence is the disappearance of U.S. leadership...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: ... from the world stage.</p><p>COOPER: Senator...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: And that makes this entire world a more dangerous place.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Klobuchar, should Turkey remain in NATO? Your response?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: We need to work with our allies, to work with Turkey and bring them out. This is an outrageous thing that happened here. And I think we need to talk about this not only in terms of the horror of what happened here with Turkey, but the fact that our president blew it and now he's too proud to say it.</p><p>And what do we do now? We continue that humanitarian aid, but then we work with our allies to say come back, Turkey, and stop this, because what Mayor Pete has just said is true. Think about our other allies, Israel. How do they feel right now? Donald Trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the Mideast.</p><p>Think about our allies in Europe when he pulls out of the Iranian agreement and gives them holding the bag and gives the power to China and Russia.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Think about the nuclear agreement with Russia that he precipitously pulled out of. This is part of a pattern. It's not an isolated incident.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Senator Harris, given that the U.S. abandoned our Kurdish allies, what would you do as president to convince the rest of the world that we can still be trusted?</p><p>HARRIS: That's a great question, Anderson, because the commander-in-chief of the United States of America has as one of her greatest priorities and responsibilities to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland.</p><p>I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have over a period of time received classified information about the threats to our security and hot spots around the world.</p><p>What has happened in Syria is yet again Donald Trump selling folks out. And in this case, he sold out the Kurds, who, yes, fought with us and thousands died in our fight against ISIS.</p><p>And let's be clear. What Donald Trump has done, because of that phone call with Erdogan, is basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a \"get out of jail free\" card. And you know who the winner is in this? There are four: Russia, Iran, Assad, and ISIS.</p><p>This is a crisis of Donald Trump's making. And it is on a long list of crises of Donald Trump's making. And that's why dude got to go. And when I am commander-in-chief, we will stop this madness.</p><p>COOPER: Secretary Castro, your response.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>CASTRO: Well, I mean, you asked the question of, how are we going to get people to trust us again? The first thing is we got to boot Donald Trump out of the Oval Office so that people will trust us again.</p><p>You know, I also want people to think -- the folks this week that saw those images of ISIS prisoners running free to think about how absurd it is that this president is caging kids on the border and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>He has made a tremendous mistake, a total disaster there in Syria. And just to connect the dots for a second, if you're Kim Jong-un, for instance, why in the world would you believe anything that this president says to contain your nuclear weapons program, when he tore up an Iran nuclear agreement that we just signed four years ago, which was the strongest agreement to contain Iran's nuclear weapons program, and now he's abandoned the very people that we gave our word to?</p><p>I would make sure that we work with our allies to pressure Syria to stop the aggression, and I support efforts at stronger sanctions than this president has announced.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</p><p>LACEY: Senator Booker, the American intelligence community says that Russia is trying to capitalize on the power vacuums around the world as we're seeing right now in northern Syria. What specifically would you do as president to check Vladimir Putin's power on the world stage?</p><p>BOOKER: So, first of all, understand that this president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire. We literally have great generals like Mattis who said on the world stage, the United States of America, there can be no better friend than the United States of America and no better -- no greater enemy than the United States of America. This president has turned that upside down and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances and partner with Russia.</p><p>And so clearly, to your question, number one, we cannot allow the Russians to continue to grow in influence by abandoning the world stage. We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine, and Latvia, and Lithuania, but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable.</p><p>Russia and Putin understand strength, and this president time and time again is showing moral weakness. He makes promises to the American people that he's going to protect this nation. Well, instead of doing something to defeat ISIS, he's now given them a foothold again.</p><p>This is an American president that even right now is lying to the American public and saying he's bringing our troops home, at the same time he's increasing troop presence with the Saudis, while they're involved in an unjust war that is killing tens of thousands of children in Yemen.</p><p>This president is making us less safe. He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron. And as president of the United States, I will stop this and restore American integrity abroad.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Vice President?</p><p>BIDEN: I think I maybe -- it doesn't make me any better or worse, but maybe the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin, as well as with Erdogan. And Erdogan understands that -- you talk about should he stay in or out of NATO -- he understands if he's out of NATO, he's in real trouble.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is, we have been unwilling in this administration, because we have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own re-election.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Think what's happened. The fact of the matter is, you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO. What does the president do? He says, \"I believe Vladimir Putin. I believe Vladimir Putin. I don't believe our intelligence community.\"</p><p>SANDERS: You're suggesting I'm Vladimir Putin here.</p><p>BIDEN: No, no, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm not.</p><p>SANDERS: I know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BIDEN: But here -- look, but here's the deal. Think what that did. He turns around and he questions whether or not he'll keep the sacred commitment of Article 5 for the NATO members. If he is re-elected, I promise you, there will be no NATO. Our security will be vastly underrated, under -- we will be in real trouble.</p><p>And with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy we change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border.</p><p>And lastly, and I apologize for going on, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to -- I mean, excuse me, in Afghanistan, as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS that's going to come here. They are going to, in fact, damage the United States of America. That's why we got involved in the first place and not ceded the whole area to Assad and to the Russians.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke, Senate Democrats put out a report last year on Russia's hostile actions around the world. They suggest the next president could fight back by publicly revealing what the U.S. knows about Putin's corruption and work with allies to freeze his bank accounts. Would you take either of those actions, even in the face of possible retaliation?</p><p>O'ROURKE: Yes. We must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold Russia accountable for invading the world's greatest democracy and being able to do it thanks to Donald Trump functionally with impunity so far, so much so that they are invading this democracy right now as we speak, still at the invitation of this president. So if there are not consequences, we will continue to see this problem going forward.</p><p>But in addition, y ademas, to answer the previous question that you asked, how do we stand up to Russia on the global stage, we do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships. That is what makes America stronger. There isn't enough money in this country, there aren't enough servicemembers as brave and courageous as they are to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world.</p><p>And the Kurds are case in point. In fact, because we turned our backs on them, those Kurds who fought for us in Syria, helped to defeat ISIS not just for themselves, but for the United States of America, it makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of servicemembers to fight those battles there.</p><p>And then lastly, as General Mattis, who was invoked earlier, has said, we have two powers, one of intimidation and one of inspiration. We need to now focus on that latter power and make sure that we invest in diplomacy and our State Department and peacefully and non-violently resolving our foreign policy goals not on the backs of 18-, and 19-, and 20-year-olds any more, but making sure that our diplomats are invested in, have the focus necessary by this next president to make that they can accomplish those goals for this country and for the world.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Congressman. Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>Mr. Steyer, would you publicly reveal what the U.S. knows about Putin's corruption or work to freeze his bank accounts? Please respond.</p><p>STEYER: Absolutely. As far as I'm concerned, Mr. Trump's America first program, which involves having no plans, having no process, and having no partners, has proved to be a disaster in Syria, it's proved to be a disaster in terms of our response to Russia's attacking our democracy, and more than that, when we look at the problems around the world, the idea that the United States is going to act unilaterally against a country without the support of our traditional allies makes absolutely no sense.</p><p>Let's go to the most important international problem that we're facing, which no one has brought up, which is climate. We can't solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves. It's an international crisis. I've been working on it for 10 years, taking on the corporations. But we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world.</p><p>So if you look at what Mr. Trump is doing, of course he's been bought by the oil and gas companies. But any problem that we're going to do, but specifically climate, we're going to have to lead the world morally, we're going to have to lead it technologically, financially, and commercially.</p><p>This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I have ever heard and I would change it on day one in every single light.</p><p>LACEY: Mr. Yang, your response to Putin and Russia.</p><p>YANG: Of course. We have to look at the chain of events. How did we get here? The fact is, we were falling apart at home, so we voted in Donald Trump, and he's now led us down this dangerous path with erratic and unreliable foreign policy.</p><p>We have to let Russia know, look, we get it. We've tampered with other elections, you've tampered with our elections. And now it has to stop. And if it does not stop, we will take this as an act of hostility against the American people. I believe most Americans would support me on this.</p><p>But Russian hacking of our democracy is an illustration of the 21st century threats. Artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, climate change, loose nuclear material, military drones, and non-state actors, these are the threats that are going to require our administration to catch up in terms of technology.</p><p>We all know we are decades behind the curve on technology. We saw when Mark Zuckerberg testified at Congress the nature of the questioning. As commander-in-chief, I will help pull us forward...</p><p>LACEY: Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I want to respond to Mr. Yang.</p><p>YANG: ... and that's going to be the responsibility of the next president.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I want to respond to Mr. Yang. I don't see a moral equivalency between our country and Russia. Vladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent, and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election.</p><p>This wasn't meddling. That's what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she's doing. Sorry.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: This was much more serious than that. This was actually invading our election. So to protect ourselves in 2020, what we need, one, backup paper ballots in every single state. That is a bill that I need, and we need to stop Mitch McConnell from stopping that from happening.</p><p>And then we need to stop the social media companies from running paid political ads, including ones last time in rubles, without having to say where those ads came from and who paid for them. That's the Honest Ads Act. That's a bipartisan bill that I lead. And we can't wait...</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: ... to become president to get that done. We need to get it done now.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>COOPER: We want to turn back to domestic issues and the epidemic of gun violence in this country. We're less than 100 miles from Dayton, Ohio, where two months ago a gunman killed nine people using an AR-15-style weapon with a high-capacity magazine.</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke, in the last debate, you said, quote, \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\" but when you were asked how you'd enforce a mandatory buyback, you said police wouldn't be going door to door. So how exactly are you going to force people to give up their weapons? You don't even know who has those weapons.</p><p>O'ROURKE: Look, we're going to make sure that the priority is saving the lives of our fellow Americans. I think almost everyone on this stage agrees that it's not right and as president would seek to ban the sale of AR-15s and AK-47s.</p><p>Those are weapons of war. They were designed to kill people effectively, efficiently on a battlefield. You mentioned the massacre in Dayton. Nine people killed in under 40 seconds. In El Paso, Texas, 22 were killed in under three minutes. And the list goes on throughout the country.</p><p>So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging, with 16 million AR-15s and AK-47s out there, they are also too dangerous to own. Every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror.</p><p>Just ask Hispanics in Texas. Univision surveyed them. More than 80 percent feared that they would be a victim of a mass terror attack like the one in El Paso that was targeted at Mexican Americans and immigrants, inspired in part by this president's racism and hatred that he's directed at communities like mine in El Paso.</p><p>COOPER: Congressman...</p><p>O'ROURKE: So I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law, the same way that we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now.</p><p>COOPER: OK.</p><p>O'ROURKE: We don't go door to door to do anything in this country to enforce the law. I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun-owners, non-gun-owners alike to respect and follow the law.</p><p>COOPER: Congressman, let me follow up. Just to follow up, your expectations aside, your website says you will fine people who don't give up their weapons. That doesn't take those weapons off the street. So to be clear, exactly how are you going to take away weapons from people who do not want to give them up and you don't know where they are?</p><p>O'ROURKE: If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, they will be other consequences from law enforcement.</p><p>But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law. I believe in this country. I believe in my fellow Americans. I believe that they will do the right thing.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you. Mayor Buttigieg, just yesterday, you referred to mandatory buybacks as confiscation and said that Congressman O'Rourke has been picking a fight to try to stay relevant. Your response on guns?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Look, Congressman, you just made it clear that you don't know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets. If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it. But we can't wait. People are dying in the streets right now.</p><p>We can't wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through. We can't wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high-capacity magazines so we don't wind up with millions more of these things on the street. We can't wait for red flag laws that are going to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides, which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country. We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done.</p><p>COOPER: Congressman O'Rourke, your response.</p><p>O'ROURKE: This is not a purity test. This is a country that loses 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year to gun violence. This is a crisis. We've got to do something about it.</p><p>And those challenges that you described are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that I'm describing. I want to make sure we have universal background checks and red flag laws and that we end the sale of these weapons of war, but to use the analogy of health care, it would be as though we said, look, we're for primary care, but let's not talk about mental health care because that's a bridge too far. People need that primary care now, so let's save that for another day.</p><p>No, let's decide what we are going to believe in, what we're going to achieve. And then let's bring this country together in order to do that. Listening to my fellow Americans, to those moms who demand action, to those students who march for our lives, who, in fact, came up with this extraordinary bold peace plan...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>O'ROURKE: ... that calls for mandatory buybacks, let's follow their inspiration and lead and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups. Let's do what's right...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER: Mayor Buttigieg, your response? Mayor Buttigieg?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: The problem isn't the polls. The problems is the policy. And I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal. Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done. Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this.</p><p>The problem is the National Rifle Association and their enablers in Congress, and we should be united in taking the fight to them.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>O'ROURKE: That's a mischaracterization. Anderson, I've got to answer this. Never took you or anyone else on who disagrees with me on this issue. But when you, Mayor Buttigieg, described this policy as a shiny object, I don't care what that meant to me or my candidacy, but to those who have survived gun violence, those who've lost a loved one to an AR-15, an AK-47, marched for our lives, formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics and poll-tested politicians, that was a slap in the fact to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR-15 and an AK-47.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>O'ROURKE: We must buy them back.</p><p>COOPER: Congressman...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: What we owe to those survivors is to actually deliver a solution. I'm glad you offered up that analogy to health care, because this is really important. We are at the cusp of building a new American majority to actually do things that congressmen and senators have been talking about with almost no impact for my entire adult life.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: No, this is really important, OK? On guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban. That would be huge. And we're going to get wrapped around the axle in a debate over whether it's \"hell, yes, we're going to take your guns\"? We have an opportunity...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mayor. Your time is up.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: ... to deliver health care to everybody, and some on this stage are saying it doesn't count unless we obliterate...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER: I want to give somebody -- I want to give other -- I want to give other candidates a chance. Senator Booker, what's your response to Mayor Buttigieg?</p><p>BOOKER: Well, look, I again, worry about how we talk to each other and about each other and what this last week has shown. There was a young man in my neighborhood, I watched him grow up. I lived in some high-rise projects with him named Shahad, and he was murdered on my block last year with an assault rifle.</p><p>I'm living with a sense of urgency on this problem, because when I go home to my community, like millions of Americans, we live in communities where these weapons, where these gun shots are real every single day.</p><p>And I know where the American public is. This is not about leadership. This is why when I talk about things like gun licensing and point out the differences between us, I'm not attacking people or their character or their courage on these issues. We all have courage.</p><p>But it's frustrating that when the American people, 77 percent of Americans agree on licensing, we don't need leadership right now. We just need folks that are going to stand up and follow where the people already are, because there are millions of Americans where this is a daily nightmare, where we're surrendering our freedoms...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>BOOKER: ... to fear in this country. This is the first time in American history, this fall, where we have sent our children to school, the strongest nation on the Planet Earth, and said to them, \"We can't protect you\"...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>BOOKER: ... \"so in school, we're going to teach you how to hide.\" There are more duck-and-cover drills and shelter-in-place drills in America now than fire drills.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>BOOKER: If I'm president of the United States, I will bring an urgency to this issue and make sure that we end the scourge of mass violence in our country.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar, Senator Warren -- Senator Warren supports a voluntary -- excuse me, Senator Klobuchar, you support a voluntary buyback, if I'm correct, right. What is wrong with a mandatory buyback? Your response.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this. I'm looking at the mayor of Dayton. I met one of the survivors from that shooting, 30 seconds, nine people killed.</p><p>The public is with us on this in a big way. The majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks right now. The majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation. There are three bills right now on Mitch McConnell's desk, the background check bill, my bill to close the boyfriend loophole so domestic abusers don't get guns, the bill to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun. That's what we should be focusing on.</p><p>And I just don't want to screw this up. When I'm president, I do want to bring in an assault weapon ban and I do want to put a limitation on magazines so what happened in Dayton, Ohio, will never happen again. But let's not mess this up with this fight.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Warren, you support a voluntary gun buyback of assault-style weapons, as well. Why not a mandatory one?</p><p>WARREN: So, look, I want to get what works done. I want to use the method we used, for example, with machine guns. We registered them, we put in a huge penalty if you didn't register them, and a huge tax on them, and then let people turn them in, and it got machine guns out of the hands of people.</p><p>But the problem here that we need to focus on is, first, how widespread gun violence is. As you've rightly identified, it's not just about mass shootings. It's what happens in neighborhoods all across this country. It is about suicide, and it is about domestic violence.</p><p>This is not going to be a one and done, that we do one thing or two things or three things and then we're done. We have to reduce gun violence overall. And the question we have to ask is, why hasn't it happened?</p><p>You say we're so close. We have been so close. I stood in the United States Senate in 2013...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>WARREN: ... when 54 senators voted in favor of gun legislation and it didn't pass because of the filibuster.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator. Senator...</p><p>WARREN: We have got to attack the corruption and repeal the filibuster or the gun industry will always have a veto over what happens.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Harris? Senator Harris, you disagree with Senator Warren. You think the buyback should be mandatory. Please respond.</p><p>HARRIS: Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today. During the course of this debate, eight people will die from gun violence. The leading cause of death of young black men in America is gun violence, more than the top other six reasons total.</p><p>This is a serious matter. I have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you. I have looked at more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I'm done. And we need action.</p><p>And Congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage. When I'm elected, I'll give them 100 days to pull their act together, put a bill on my desk for signature, and if they don't, I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country because it is time to act.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Biden -- Vice President Biden, your response.</p><p>BIDEN: I'm the only one on this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them, and beat them twice. We were able to get assault weapons off the streets and not be able to be sold for 10 years. Recent studies show that mass violence went down when that occurred.</p><p>The way to deal with those guns and those AR-15s and assault weapons that are on the street -- or not on the street, that people own, is to do what we did with the National Firearms Act as it related to machine guns. You must register that weapon. You must register it. When you register it, the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially.</p><p>I'm the only one that got -- got -- moved the -- to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it. I've done this. I know how to get it done. If you really want to get it done, go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued. That would change it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.</p><p>Secretary Castro, the vast majority of homicides committed with a gun in this country are from handguns, not assault-style weapons. What's your plan to prevent those deaths?</p><p>CASTRO: Thank you very much for the question. You know, I grew up in neighborhoods where it wasn't uncommon to hear gunshots at night. And I can remember ducking into the back seat of a car when I was a freshman in high school, across the street from my school, my public school, because folks were shooting at each other.</p><p>You know, in the neighborhoods -- let me answer this question about voluntary versus mandatory. There are two problems I have with mandatory buybacks. Number one, folks can't define it. And if you're not going door to door, then it's not really mandatory.</p><p>But also, in the places that I grew up in, we weren't exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door. And you all saw a couple days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth. A cop showed up at 2:00 in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew. He didn't even announced himself. And within four seconds, he shot her and killed her through her home window. She was in her own home.</p><p>And so I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Secretary Castro, thank you.</p><p>LACEY: Turning to another key issue here in Ohio and around the country, the opioid epidemic, Senator Klobuchar, CNN reached out to Ohio Democratic voters for their most pressing questions. Brie, a teacher in Proctorville, asks, in rural Ohio, the opioid epidemic has affected our communities and schools. I have many high school students who have lost one or both parents to heroin. Teachers are on the front lines daily, witnessing these tragedies. How will you tackle this problem in general, but specifically what will you offer people in rural communities where rehabilitation is not easily accessed and access to jobs is difficult?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, I want to thank her for this question. This is something that should never have happened to begin with. I remember, when I was a prosecutor, these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door. And it's gotten worse and worse. And we now know why.</p><p>As the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits, probably one of the most horrible things that I saw was the e-mail from one of the pharma executives that actually said, \"Keep pumping them out. They're eating them like Doritos.\"</p><p>So my first answer to that question, and which is included in my plan, is that the people that should pay for this, that should pay for the treatment, are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place. And that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids. That's the first way.</p><p>And you can, with a 2 cents per milligram tax, bring in the money, plus with the federal master settlement, to help rural areas where they're so isolated, and also in urban areas, where it's, by the way, not just opiates. There are still mental health issues and crack cocaine issues.</p><p>This is personal for me. My dad, he struggled with alcoholism his whole life. And by his third DWI, they said to him, the prosecutor, you've got to face jail or you got to go to treatment. He picked treatment, and he was pursued by grace. And he has been sober ever since. And now he's 91 and in assisted living, and he said to me last year, it's hard to get a drink around here, anyway. But he still has an AA group that visits him there.</p><p>And so for me, I believe that everyone in this country, including the people in rural America, have that same right to be pursued by grace.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Mr. Steyer, how would you address the opioid epidemic that exists here in Ohio and around the country? Please respond.</p><p>STEYER: Well, I think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that America has had, 72,000 people died of opioid overdoses last year, and that's not only a tragedy for them, it's a tragedy for their family and their communities.</p><p>And so I think we have to treat this as a health citizens. We have to move the resources and the support there to try and help people.</p><p>But I think that Senator Klobuchar makes a good point. The reason I'm running for president is that we have a broken government. And we have a broken government because corporations have bought it. And every single one of these conversations is about that broken government. It's about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want. It's about the gun manufacturers buying the government and get what we want.</p><p>We need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government. I've put forward actual structural changes, including term limits, a natural referendum, the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of American citizens politically, and make it a lot easier to vote</p><p>These corporations have taken over our government. And 72,000 deaths...</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.</p><p>STEYER: ... last year are the tragic result.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mr. Yang, you want to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of opioids, including heroin. How would that solve the crisis?</p><p>YANG: That's exactly right. And we have to recognize this is a disease of capitalism run amok. There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio. And for some reason, the federal government thought that was appropriate.</p><p>They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money, until you realize that company made $30 billion. They got a 2 percent fine, and they killed tens of thousands of Americans, eight an hour.</p><p>So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our community so our people have a fighting chance to get well, even though this is not a money problem. We all know this is a human problem.</p><p>And part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they're not going to be referred to a prison cell. They will be referred to treatment and counseling. I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire, and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again, because the fact is, after you save someone who's OD'ing, you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week.</p><p>So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use. We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing. This was a systemic government failing. And then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country, because they save lives.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Yang. Congressman O'Rourke, is decriminalizing opioids part of the solution? Please respond.</p><p>O'ROURKE: Yes, it is, for many of the reasons that Mr. Yang just described. And also just from some personal experiences I've had as a member of Congress where constituents of mine have come forward, in some cases publicly, at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions.</p><p>I remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the V.A. Now, imagine if that veteran, instead of being prescribe an opioid, had been prescribed marijuana because we made that legal in America, ensured the V.A....</p><p>YANG: Yes, preach, Beto.</p><p>O'ROURKE: ... could prescribe it, expunge the arrest records for those who've been arrested for possession, and make sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted.</p><p>I also want to agree with Senator Klobuchar. Until we hold those responsible accountable for their actions, Purdue Pharma, Johnson &amp; Johnson, we're going to continue to have this problem going on again. So that veteran that I met, and anyone with drug addiction today, is not a problem for the criminal justice system.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you.</p><p>O'ROURKE: They're an opportunity for our public health system in America.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Congressman. Senator Harris, you want to hold the drug manufacturers that fueled the crisis accountable. Are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to jail?</p><p>HARRIS: I am. And I will tell you, as a former prosecutor, I do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability, because they are nothing more than some high-level dope dealers. They have been engaged...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I've seen it happen before. I've taken on the pharmaceutical companies when I was attorney general of California and led the second largest Department of Justice. I've seen what they do.</p><p>The biggest pharmaceutical companies, the eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies last year profited $72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis, which is a public health epidemic.</p><p>And they knew what they were doing. They were marketing false advertising. They knew what they were pushing in communities and states like Ohio, without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks. And, yes, they should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice.</p><p>And so as president of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department of Justice, understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal? Let's end mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs, and let's go after these pharmaceutical companies for what they've been doing to destroy our country and states like Ohio.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to prison? Please respond.</p><p>CASTRO: Yes, I am. They need to be held accountable, not only financially, but also with criminal penalties. And, you know, you can draw a straight line between making sure that we hold executives accountable, whether it's these drug manufacturers or Wall Street executives that should have been held accountable a decade-and-a-half ago.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you.</p><p>BURNETT: Now to the issue of candidates and their health. Senator Sanders, I want to start with you. We're moving on, Senator. I'm sorry.</p><p>SANDERS: I'm healthy. I'm feeling great, but I would like to respond to that question.</p><p>BURNETT: I want to -- I want start by saying...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BOOKER: And Senator Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana. I want to make sure that's clear, as well.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator Sanders, this debate does mark your...</p><p>SANDERS: I do. I'm not on it tonight.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURNETT: This debate -- this debate, sir, does mark your return to the campaign trail. Go ahead and finish your point and then I'll ask my question, Senator.</p><p>SANDERS: I'm more than happy to answer your question, but I wanted to pick up on what Kamala and Cory and others have said. Let's take a deep breath. Take a look at this opioid epidemic.</p><p>You have executives, CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies, making tens of millions of dollars a year. And in this particular case with the opioids, they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them. And last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit.</p><p>This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country. And it's not just the drug companies. Right now, the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world. And they continue to make huge profits.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator...</p><p>SANDERS: That is why we need a political revolution...</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>SANDERS: ... that says enough is enough to this behavior.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: Senator, we are all very glad you're feeling well...</p><p>SANDERS: Thank you.</p><p>BURNETT: ... as you just said. But there is a question on a lot of people's minds, and I want to address it tonight. You're 78 years old, and you just had a heart attack. How do you reassure Democratic voters that you're up to the stress of the presidency?</p><p>SANDERS: Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we're having in Queens, New York, berniesanders.com. We're going to have a special guest at that event. And we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.</p><p>But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. And I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: Vice President Biden, if you're elected, you will turn 80 during your first term. Last month, former President Jimmy Carter said he could not have undertaken the duties of the presidency at 80 years old. Why are you so sure that you can?</p><p>BIDEN: Because I've watched it. I know what the job is. I've been engaged.</p><p>Look, one of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders, from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track.</p><p>It is required now more than any time in any of our lifetimes to have someone who has that capacity on day one. That's one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I've done it before. I've been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I've been there, and I've got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act, as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression.</p><p>I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.</p><p>BURNETT: Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records?</p><p>BIDEN: Before the first vote.</p><p>BURNETT: Before Iowa?</p><p>BIDEN: Yes.</p><p>BURNETT: Not by the end of this year?</p><p>BIDEN: Well, before Iowa. I mean, look, I've released them before. I released 55 pages of my -- I'm the only guy that's released anything up here.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated in a first term. You would be 71. Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?</p><p>WARREN: Well, I say, I will out-work, out-organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Look, the way I see this, the way we're going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they're making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind.</p><p>And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don't want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong.</p><p>If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what's broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people's lives, things like childcare and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren.</p><p>Congresswoman Gabbard, you're 38 years old, and you would be the youngest president if elected. Should age matter when choosing a president?</p><p>GABBARD: I'm glad you asked, because I was going to say it's not fair to ask these three about their health and their fitness to serve as president but not every other one of us. I am grateful to have been trained very well by the Army and do my best to stay in shape.</p><p>But here's the real question I believe you should be asking is: Who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief? This is the most important responsibility that the president has. What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him, inviting Turkey to come in and slaughter the Kurds, show what an unfit president looks like. It highlights how critical it is that we have a president and commander-in-chief who is ready on day one, bringing experience and understanding in foreign policy and national security.</p><p>Bringing the experience that I have, both serving in Congress now for nearly seven years, serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, serving on the Armed Services Committee, subcommittees related to terrorism and upcoming threats, serving on the Homeland Security Committee, the experience that I have as a soldier, serving for over 16 years in the Army National Guard, deploying twice to the Middle East, being able to serve in different capacities, joint training exercises, training the Kuwait National Guard.</p><p>I understand the importance of our national security. I am prepared to do this job, to fulfill this responsibility as commander-in-chief on day one.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Congresswoman.</p><p>GABBARD: I'd like to ask our other candidates this question. I'd like to start with Senator Warren...</p><p>BURNETT: Sorry, Congressman, I'm sorry.</p><p>GABBARD: ... what her experience and background is to serve as commander-in-chief.</p><p>BURNETT: I'm sorry, thank you. We're going to take another break now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University here in Ohio will be back in just a few moments.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COOPER: And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate. Mark Lacey from the New York Times starts off our questioning. Mark?</p><p>LACEY: Thank you. Let's turn to the growing concerns over the power of big tech companies. Mr. Yang, Senator Warren is calling for companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google to be broken up. Is she right? Does that need to happen?</p><p>YANG: As usual, Senator Warren is 100 percent right in diagnosing the problem. There are absolutely excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move.</p><p>But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft. It's true.</p><p>So it's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country. And as the parent of two young children, I'm particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that we're seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.</p><p>Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to hone in on the specific problems we're trying to solve and use 21st century solutions for 21st century problems. Using a 20th century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you. Senator Warren, is Mr. Yang wrong? Your response, please.</p><p>WARREN: Look, I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It's time to fight back. Think about it this way. When you talk about how it works in competition, about 8 percent, 9 percent of all retail sales happen at bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place: that's Amazon.</p><p>It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses. Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don't get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating, big tech, big pharma, big oil, all of them.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Mr. Steyer, your response?</p><p>STEYER: Look, I agree with Senator Warren that, in fact, monopolies have to be dealt with. They either have to be broken up or regulated, and that's part of it.</p><p>But we have to understand that Mr. Trump is going to be running on the economy. He's going to be saying he's the person who can make it grow. I started a business from scratch -- one room, no employers -- and built a multi-billion-dollar international business. We're going to have to show the American people that we don't just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies but also talk about prosperity, talk about investing in the American people, talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector.</p><p>In fact, if we want to beat Mr. Trump, I think somebody who can go toe to toe with him and show him to be a fraud and a failure as a businessperson, and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy is going to be necessary. He is one. His tax plan's a failure. His trade war is a failure. I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show that, in fact, he's failed the American people, and he has to go.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.</p><p>Senator Booker, how do you respond? Would a President Booker break up big tech companies like Facebook and Amazon?</p><p>BOOKER: Anybody that does not think that we have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy -- we have seen it in the '16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform.</p><p>And antitrust, I mean Robert Bork right now is laughing in his sleep. We have a reality in this country where antitrust, from pharma to farms, is causing trouble, and we have to deal with this. As president of the United States, I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws.</p><p>And I want to say one last thing, and I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage. Going back to the fact that we -- it's rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke, you say you're not sure if it's appropriate for a president to designate which companies should be broken up. So what's the proper level of oversight here?</p><p>O'ROURKE: Yeah, we need to set very tough, very clear, transparent rules of the road, the kind of rules that we do not have today, that allow these social media platforms, where we, the people, have become the product, to abuse that public trust, and to do so at extraordinary profits.</p><p>Right now, we treat them functionally as a utility, when, in reality, they're more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see. Our pictures and personal information that they share with others, we would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president, treat them like the publisher that they are. That's what I will do as president.</p><p>And we will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that, but I don't think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That's something that Donald Trump has done, in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It's not something that we should do.</p><p>So tough rules of the road, protect your personal information, privacy, and data, and be fearless in the face of these tech giants.</p><p>LACEY: Senator Sanders, your response?</p><p>SANDERS: When we talk about a rigged economy, it's not just the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. It is also the fact that in sector after sector, whether it is Wall Street, where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States, whether it is media, where you have 10 media companies that control about 90 percent of what the American people see, hear, or read, whether it is agribusiness, where we see merger after merger which is resulting in the decline of family-based farming in this country, we need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business, and protect consumers by ending the price fixing that we see every day.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Senator Harris, to you, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that splitting up big tech companies will make election interference more likely because the companies won't be able to work together to fight it. Could breaking up these companies make the spread of disinformation worse?</p><p>HARRIS: No, I don't agree with that at all. And serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee, working with Amy Klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure, knowing that Russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the president of the United States and will attempt to do it again, that's -- that's a ridiculous argument he's making.</p><p>But I do want to also say this. What we're talking about is a grave injustice, when rules apply to some but not equally to all, and in particular when the rules that apply to the powerless don't apply to the powerful.</p><p>And so, Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's account, that you did not agree, and I would urge you to join me.</p><p>Because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice, and he and his account should be taken down.</p><p>We saw in El Paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform, and this is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you. Senator Warren, you can respond.</p><p>WARREN: So, look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job.</p><p>HARRIS: Well, join me -- join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down.</p><p>WARREN: But let's figure -- no. Let's figure out...</p><p>HARRIS: No?</p><p>WARREN: ... why it is that we have had laws on the books for antitrust for over a century, and yet for decades now, we've all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington, big ag, how the gun industry, big tech -- you know, we really need to address the elephant in the room, and that is how campaigns are financed.</p><p>HARRIS: You can't say you're for corporate responsibility if it doesn't apply to everyone.</p><p>WARREN: I announced this morning -- I announced this morning that I'm not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives. We've already agreed, Bernie and I, we're not taking any money from big pharma executives.</p><p>You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. We need campaign finance rules and practices...</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator Warren. Senator Harris?</p><p>WARREN: ... that support us all.</p><p>HARRIS: You -- it does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people. This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>HARRIS: Holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people's perceptions about issues, and they actually influence behaviors. We all have to agree this is their power. It is immense.</p><p>LACEY: Senator Klobuchar, let me bring you in here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACEY: Your response?</p><p>HARRIS: I'm not finished. I'm not finished.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARRIS: And so what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.</p><p>WARREN: Look, I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don't have a problem with that.</p><p>HARRIS: So you will join me in saying Twitter should shut down that account?</p><p>WARREN: What I do have a problem with is that if we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives. If we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies, we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives. If we are going to talk about Wall Street and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar, let's bring you in here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I would like to have a different take on this. I was in the private sector for 14 years, represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom markets. I had a life before government.</p><p>And what I saw was when we got more competition there, the prices went down in a big way in the long distance market. Well, right now we have another gilded age going on, and I am the lead Democrat on the Antitrust Committee. I have the lead legislation, which means, one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we've been talking about here, is breaking down some of this consolidation, and also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because they're so overwhelmed.</p><p>But the issue here is this. Start talking about this as a pro-competition issue. This used to be a Republican and Democratic issue, because America, our founding fathers, actually wanted to have less consolidation. We were a place of entrepreneurship. We are seeing a startup slump in this country.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, would you like to weigh in?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And this means everything from tech on down.</p><p>LACEY: Please respond.</p><p>CASTRO: Yeah, I think that we're on the right track in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices and setting, as Congressman O'Rourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today.</p><p>And, you know, whether that's Amazon that is leveraging its size I think to help put small businesses out of business, and then at the same time shortchanging a lot of its workers, not paying them as they should, not giving them the benefits that they should, or it's a number of other companies, big tech companies. We need to take a stronger stance when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices, and that's what I would do as president.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>YANG: The best way we can fight back -- the best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property. Right now, our data is worth more than oil. How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail? It got lost. It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google. If we say this is our property and we share in the gains, that's the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Yang.</p><p>GABBARD: There's a bigger issue here...</p><p>BURNETT: Turning to women's reproductive rights, Ohio is now one of several states that has banned abortions after as early as six weeks of pregnancy. Many women don't even know they're pregnant at that time. The Ohio law, like many others, is being challenged in the courts and has not yet taken effect. Senator Harris, if states prevail on restricting abortion, what's your plan to stop them?</p><p>HARRIS: My plan is as -- as follows. For any state that passes a law that violates the Constitution, and in particular Roe v. Wade, our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v. Wade and the Constitution, and if it is not, that law will not go into effect. That's called pre-clearance.</p><p>Because the reality is that while we still have -- as I said earlier -- these state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, then there needs to be accountability and consequence.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But, you know, I'll go further. You may have seen it. I questioned Brett Kavanaugh when I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and asked him as a nominee to serve on the United States Supreme Court, could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body? And the answer was, uh, uh, no.</p><p>The reality of it is, this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America. Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species. Our bodies were created to do that. And it does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body. It is her body. It is her right. It is her decision.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: Senator Harris, thank you.</p><p>Senator Klobuchar, what would you do to stop states from prevailing? Your response?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I would codify Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. But what I want to do right now is just say, what if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me? You know what I would say to him? I said, you knew -- you said you wanted to do this in your race for president. You actually said that you wanted to put women in jail. Then you tried to dial it back, and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail.</p><p>That is exactly what the Alabama law is. It put doctors in jail for 99 years. You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women. You are not on the side of people of this country, when over 75 percent of people want to keep Roe v. Wade on the book, when over 90 percent of people want to make sure we have available contraception. You defunded Planned Parenthood. I would fund it again.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator, thank you.</p><p>Senator Booker, if states prevail on restricting abortion, how would you stop them? Please respond.</p><p>BOOKER: Well, first of all, let's be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio. They're not just attacks on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country -- liberty, the ability to control your own body -- but they're particularly another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty, because this is disproportionately affecting low-income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country. It is an assault on the most fundamental ideal that human beings should control their own body.</p><p>And so the way as president of the United States I'm going to deal with this is, first of all, elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House-level position. And I will create the Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights in the White House and make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt that's gone on for decades to undermine Roe v. Wade.</p><p>I will fight to codify it, and I will also make sure that we fight as this country to repeal the Hyde amendment, so that we are leading the Planet Earth in defending the global assault we see on women right now.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?</p><p>GABBARD: This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it's unfortunate to see how in this country it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon.</p><p>I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she's correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you're referring to can often lead to a dangerous place, as we've seen them as they're passed in other countries, where a woman who has a miscarriage past that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point.</p><p>I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that, during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you very much.</p><p>The Supreme Court is currently made up of five Republican-appointed justices and four appointed by Democrats. The court just announced it will hear arguments in a case challenging some abortion rights.</p><p>Vice President Biden, the Constitution does not specify the number of justices that serve on the Supreme Court. If Roe v. Wade is overturned on your watch and you can't pass legislation in Congress, would you seek to add justices to the Supreme Court to protect women's reproductive rights?</p><p>BIDEN: I would not get into court packing. We had three justices. Next time around, we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.</p><p>I want to point out that the justices I've supported, when I defeated Robert Bork -- and I say when I defeated Robert Bork, I made sure we guaranteed a woman's right to choose for the better part of a generation. I would make sure that we move and insist that we pass, we codify Roe v. Wade.</p><p>The public is already there. Things have changed. And I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio, Alabama, et cetera, who in fact are throwing up this barrier. Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. And, in fact, every woman should have that right.</p><p>And so I would not pack the court. What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the court, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan, who used to work for me, to others, that they, in fact, support the right of privacy, on which the entire notion of a woman's right to choose is based. And that's what I would do. No one would get on the court.</p><p>And by the way, if, in fact, at the end of this -- beginning next year, if, in fact, one of the justices steps down, God forbid, in fact, I would make sure that we would do exactly what McConnell did last time out. We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.</p><p>Mayor Buttigieg, you have discussed expanding the court from 9 to 15 justices. What's your response to the vice president?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: That's right. When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court, some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate. Now, I'm not talking about packing the court just with people who agree with me, although I certainly will appoint people who share my values, for example, the idea that women's reproductive freedom is an American right.</p><p>What I'm talking about is reforms that will depoliticize the court. We can't go on like this, where every single time there is a vacancy, we have this apocalyptic ideological firefight over what to do next.</p><p>Now, one way to fix this would be to have a 15-member court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10. Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal and how this could be done without a constitutional amendment. But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis.</p><p>There are other reforms that we could consider, from term limits -- don't forget, justices used to just retire like everybody else -- to a rotation off the appellate bench.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I'm not wedded to a particular solution, but I am committed to establishing a commission on day one...</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: ... that will propose reforms to depoliticize the Supreme Court, because we can't go on like this.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you very much, Mayor Buttigieg. Secretary Castro, he's talking about making the court bigger. Your response? Is it a good idea?</p><p>CASTRO: I don't think it is. I wouldn't pack the court. You know, I think the plan that Mayor Pete mentioned is an interesting one, but I actually believe, if we were selecting from one of those things, that the smarter move might be to look at term limits or having people cycle off from the appellate courts so that you would have a replenishment of perspective.</p><p>I would also make sure that I appoint as president people who respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade, that we codify Roe v. Wade, and that we do away with things like the Hyde amendment, because you shouldn't only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money. We have to think about people who do not, people who are poor. And we have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom, but also reproductive justice and invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her health care needs met.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator Warren, would you consider adding more justices to the Supreme Court to protect Roe v. Wade? Your response?</p><p>WARREN: I think there are a number of options. I think, as Mayor Buttigieg said, there are many different ways. People are talking about different options, and I think we may have to talk about them.</p><p>But on Roe v. Wade, can we just pause for a minute here? I lived in an America where abortion was illegal, and rich women still got abortions, because they could travel, they could go to places where it was legal.</p><p>What we're talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young, are 14-year-olds who were molested by a family member. And we now have support across this country. Three out of four Americans believe in the rule of Roe v. Wade. When you've got three out of four Americans supporting it, we should be able to get that passed through Congress.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator, thank you.</p><p>WARREN: We should not leave this to the Supreme Court. We should do it through democracy, because we can.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you very much, Senator.</p><p>COOPER: As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage.</p><p>Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?</p><p>BIDEN: Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Senator Warren said we can't be running any vague campaigns. We've got to level with people. We've got to level with people and tell them exactly what we're going to do, how we're going to get it done, and if you can get it done.</p><p>I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression, making us -- putting us in a position where I was able to end roe -- excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons.</p><p>And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I'm not suggesting they can't, but I'm suggesting that that's what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it's going to cost, how you're going to do it, and why you're going to do it. That's the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.</p><p>COOPER: Just to clarify, Vice President, who are you saying is being vague?</p><p>BIDEN: Well, the senator said -- she's being vague on the issue of -- actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, here's the deal. Come on. It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That's over $3 trillion -- it's more than the entire federal budget -- let me finish, OK?</p><p>COOPER: You'll both get in.</p><p>BIDEN: If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing, plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you -- it would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from?</p><p>SANDERS: Two things. Let me explain in two ways.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, respond.</p><p>SANDERS: Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.</p><p>Now, let's get to Medicare for all. Let's be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is to guarantee care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profit.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>SANDERS: If we stood together, we could create the greatest health care system in the world.</p><p>COOPER: Vice President Biden, you can respond, and then Senator Warren.</p><p>BIDEN: We can do that without Medicare for all. We can do that by adding a public option.</p><p>SANDERS: No.</p><p>BIDEN: We can.</p><p>SANDERS: No, you can't.</p><p>BIDEN: And we can afford to do it.</p><p>SANDERS: You've got to take on the greed and the profiteering of the health care industry.</p><p>BIDEN: By the way, the greed and...</p><p>COOPER: Let him respond. Mr. Vice President?</p><p>BIDEN: The greed and profiteering of those insurance companies, they are as much against my bill as they are anybody else. They were strongly against Obamacare. They know it cost them. And it's going to take away the right of people to choose, the 160 million people out there who've negotiated their health insurance, and they want to keep it. They should have a right to keep it.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Warren, your response?</p><p>WARREN: So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don't even try, because you will never get it passed.</p><p>And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated.</p><p>I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN: ... and repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN: ... for the things that touch people's lives.</p><p>COOPER: Mayor...</p><p>BIDEN: I agree. Let me -- she referenced me. I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let's get those things straight, too.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Warren, do you want to respond?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN: I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law. But understand...</p><p>BIDEN: You did a hell of a job in your job.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But understand this. It was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN: I said, no, let's go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.</p><p>COOPER: Senator, thank you.</p><p>WARREN: And President Obama said, I will fight for that, and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration. We have...</p><p>BIDEN: Not me.</p><p>WARREN: We have to be willing to make good, big, structural change.</p><p>COOPER: Mayor Buttigieg, which is the right vision for a Democrat to beat Donald Trump? That's the essential question.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: If I had a buck for every argument that I've witnessed like this, I could pay for college for everybody. We need to move past what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I've been alive.</p><p>We're being offered a false choice. I don't agree with the vice president that Trump is an aberration. I don't agree that there's any such thing as back to normal. Because here in the industrial Midwest, definitely where I live, normal didn't work. That's part of how we got here. That's part of how a guy like Donald Trump managed to get within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place.</p><p>But I also don't agree with Senator Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat. Yes, we have to fight -- absolutely, we have to fight for the big changes at hand, but it's going to take more than fighting. Once again, I want to take you back to that day after Trump has stopped being president. Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things we've attempted in my lifetime -- Medicare for all who want it, actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the '80s, an assault weapons ban, which would be a huge deal, making college free for low- and middle-income students.</p><p>Yet there are some here on this stage who say it doesn't count unless we go even further, free college for low- and middle-income students isn't good enough unless we're also paying for the children of billionaires. Immigration reform isn't enough unless we also decriminalize border crossings. We have an opportunity to do the biggest things we've done...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: ... in my lifetime...</p><p>COOPER: Senator?</p><p>BIDEN: I did not say back to normal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mayor. Senator Klobuchar? Senator Klobuchar?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. You know, this isn't a flyover part of the country to me. The heartland is where I live. And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they're different than Elizabeth's doesn't mean they're bold.</p><p>But we can't get any of this done on climate change or immigration reform unless they win. And what I have done is win and the only one up here, time and time again, the reddest of red districts, Michele Bachmann's, I -- I won that district three times, rural districts that border Iowa and North and South Dakota. And I do it by going not just where it's comfortable but where it's uncomfortable.</p><p>And that is why I have been in Pennsylvania and in Michigan and in Wisconsin and all over Ohio and in Iowa, because I think we need to build a blue Democratic wall around those states and make Donald Trump pay for it.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you. Senator Warren, she referenced you, so you can respond.</p><p>WARREN: Now, people who are struggling to pay health care are fighting today. People who are getting crushed by student loans are in a fight today. People who are getting stopped by the police or paid less because of the color of their skin are in a fight today.</p><p>And anyone who doesn't understand that Americans are already in these fights is not someone who is likely to win them. For me, this is about knowing what's broken, knowing how to fix it, and, yes, I'm willing to get out there and fight for it.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: There's a missing people, and that is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, why is your approach more likely to beat President Trump?</p><p>SANDERS: I'll tell you why.</p><p>COOPER: Please respond.</p><p>SANDERS: And here's the radical reason why. It's what the American people want.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>SANDERS: All right, the American people do not want tax breaks for billionaires. They want the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes. A poll came out yesterday, 71 percent of Democrats support Medicare for all. The people of this country understand that we've got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. And more and more Americans, including Republicans, understand we need bold action if we're going to save this planet for our children and our grandchildren.</p><p>The way you win an election in this time in history is not the same old, same old. You have to inspire people. You have to excite people. You've got to bring working people and young people and poor people into the political process...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>SANDERS: ... because they know you stand for them, not corporate America.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Congressman O'Rourke, is political revolution what the American people want? Your response.</p><p>O'ROURKE: There was some talk about getting big things done. When I was first elected to Congress, I found that El Paso, Texas, had the worst wait times in the country to see a mental health care provider at the V.A. I don't know how sensational or exciting that was to everyone in the country or even most people in El Paso, but it was important to those veterans who I serve.</p><p>So we set about turning around the V.A., hiring up the psychiatrists and psychologists and therapists to take care of those women and men who had put their lives on the line for this country. And we were able to do that, and we took what we learned, and we applied it to a national law as a member of the minority working with Republicans and Democrats alike to expand mental health care access for veterans nationally.</p><p>And then in Texas, one of what was thought to be the reddest states in the country, going to every single county...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>O'ROURKE: ... talking about this progressive agenda, and winning more votes than any Democrat has ever won, that's the way that we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020.</p><p>COOPER: Congressman O'Rourke, thank you. We have to take a quick break. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Ohio will continue right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COOPER: We are back with the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate. We have time for one more question that we would like all of you to weigh in on.</p><p>Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, we're all different and I think that we've forgotten that that's OK that we're all different.</p><p>So in that spirit, we'd like you to tell us about a friendship that you've had that would surprise us and what impact it's had on you and your beliefs.</p><p>Secretary Castro, let's begin with you.</p><p>CASTRO: Well, first of all, thank you to Marc, thank you, Anderson, and thank you, Erin, and CNN, and New York Times and everybody who is here tonight.</p><p>You know, some of the most interesting friendships that I've had have been with people different from me, either people older than me that had a lot to teach me, or people who grew up very different from me. Also, teachers, as I was growing up, people that had a life experience that when I was growing up was beyond mine.</p><p>And sometimes also -- and this goes to the heart of your question, I think -- people who thought differently from me, folks that I considered and have considered friends, and I think that there's a value to that. I think that that should be reflected more in our public life.</p><p>I also believe, to just speak about the incident last week with Ellen and George W. Bush, I completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others. I believe that we should be more kind to other folks.</p><p>I also believe that we should hold people to account for what they've done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something. And I think that we can do both of those things. I think that we can be kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions.</p><p>And there are people, whether it's our former president, George W. Bush, or others that should be held accountable. Just as we should be kind, we shouldn't be made to feel shameful about holding people accountable for what they've done.</p><p>COOPER: Congresswoman Gabbard?</p><p>GABBARD: Thank you. You know, where I come from in Hawaii, many of you know, we greet each other with \"aloha.\" It's not a word that means hello and goodbye. It actually means something much more powerful than that. It means I come to you with respect and a recognition that we're all connected, we're all brothers and sisters, we're all God's children.</p><p>So I've developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially, with Republicans, like Trey Gowdy, for example. He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues. We've developed a friendship that's based on respect. And he's been there for me during some personally challenging times.</p><p>The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided. Donald Trump must be defeated. But we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump. We need to deliver a win for the American people. We must stand united as Americans, remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president, inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln, who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all.</p><p>When I look out at our country, I don't see deplorables, I see fellow Americans, people who I treat with respect, even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly. I will work to restore a White House that represents light and compassion and respect for every American regardless of race, religion, orientation, gender, or political affiliation.</p><p>So I want to ask everyone to join me. Join me in bringing about this government of, by, and for the people that serves all the people of this country. You can visit my website, tulsi2020.com, for more information.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Congresswoman.</p><p>Senator Klobuchar?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: For me, it's John McCain, and I miss him every day. I traveled all over the world with him. And he would sometimes, when we were seated with world leaders, and they would look away from me, he'd say, \"Senator Klobuchar is the lead Democrat on this trip, and she will go next.\"</p><p>And I still remember being there at his ranch. John and I went to visit him and Cindy when he was dying. And he pointed to some words in his book, because he could hardly talk. And the words says this: \"There is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.\"</p><p>That's what we're doing right now. And while we have had major debates about policy, we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. And we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy, but to change the tone in our politics, to look up from our phones, to look at each other, to start talking to each other, because the way we win -- and not just win the presidency, but take back the U.S. Senate -- is by winning big.</p><p>And the way we win big is with that fired up Democratic base that's out there today, but it is also about bringing in independents and moderate Republicans. I can lead this. And I ask you to join me because I've done it before and I will do it again, amyklobuchar.com. Join our team. Thank you.</p><p>COOPER: Senator, thank you very much.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Mr. Steyer, tell us about your most surprising friendship.</p><p>STEYER: So I'm friends with a woman from Denmark, South Carolina, named Deanna Berry, who's fighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community. She's a different gender. She's a different race. She's from a different part of the country. But she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism and her honor.</p><p>My mother was a schoolteacher in the New York Public Schools and in the Brooklyn House of Detention. My father was the first generation in his family to go to college. My grandfather was a plumber. He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg. And when I asked him what that experience meant, he said, when you see something wrong in your society, you fight it from the first day and every single day after.</p><p>And that's why I started the Need to Impeach movement two years ago, because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And over 10 years ago, I saw that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every American in terms of the climate crisis. And I've been fighting those companies with the help of the American people ever since successfully, and that's why I'm running for the president, because our government has failed, it's been bought by corporations, and it's absolutely essential to return power to the people.</p><p>I have been doing exactly what my parents taught me to do, which is to take on the biggest problems in America directly and fight for them every single day.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke?</p><p>O'ROURKE: I've always tried to bring people in to the solutions that we have to our common challenges, regardless of the differences. I did that as a small-business owner more than 20 years ago, making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in El Paso, Texas.</p><p>Did it as a member of the City Council, where I saw my colleagues not as Republicans or Democrats, but my fellow El Pasoans who had a responsibility to deliver for our community.</p><p>As a member of Congress, I remember being in San Antonio. I was visiting the V.A. there, March of 2017. Found that my flight had been snowed in, in Washington, D.C. I happened to be in the elevator with a Republican member of Congress, Will Hurd. And on a whim, I said, do you want to just rent a car and drive from San Antonio to Washington?</p><p>And he called my bluff. We got in that Chevy Impala, last car on the lot. It was spring break. Drove 1,600 miles across the country. Live streamed the conversation, a Republican and a Democrat finding out what we had in common.</p><p>By the end of that trip, not only had we formed a friendship, but we had formed trust. We worked with each other on each other's bills. I got Will to work with me on an immigration bill, showing party leaders from either side that Republicans and Democrats could work together on an otherwise contentious issue.</p><p>And then across Texas, I mentioned winning more votes than any Democrat. We won independents and Republicans in record numbers, as well. I will bring people in and together to face the common challenges that we have and to make sure that America rises to this opportunity.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Booker, tell us about your most surprising friendship.</p><p>BOOKER: Well, look, I have so many, I don't even know where to count. I was the mayor of a large city with a Republican governor. He and I had to form a friendship, even though I can write a dissertation on our disagreements. When I got to the United States Senate, I went there with the purpose of making friendships across the aisle.</p><p>I go to Bible study in Chairman Inhofe's office. He and I pass legislation together to help homeless and foster kids. I went out to try to invite every one of my Republican colleagues to dinner. And let me again say, finding a dinner at a restaurant, agreeing on one with Ted Cruz was a very difficult thing. I'm a vegan, and he's a meat-eating Texan.</p><p>But I'll tell you this right now, this is the moment in America that this is our test. The spirit of our country, I believe in the values of rugged individualism and self-reliance, but think about our history. Rugged individualism didn't get us to the Moon. It didn't beat the Nazis. It didn't map the human genome. It didn't beat Jim Crow. Everything we did in this country big.</p><p>And, Vice President, we have done so many big things. The fact that there's an openly gay man, a black woman, all of us on the stage are because we in the past are all inheritors of a legacy of common struggle and common purpose.</p><p>This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office. It's a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other. The next leader is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all, not throw elbows at other Democrats that are unfair, because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic of grace in our country, teach us a more courageous empathy, and remind America that patriotism is love of country, and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women.</p><p>And love is not sentimentality. It's not anemic. Love is struggle. Love is sacrifice. Love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the Declaration of Independence that if we're ever going to make it as a nation, we must mutually pledge to each other...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>BOOKER: ... our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. I am running for president to restore that sacred honor.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>BOOKER: And if you believe in that like I do, please join me by going to corybooker.com. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator. Mr. Yang?</p><p>YANG: First, I want to thank all the voters tuned in at home. And if you don't feel like you answered your -- you got your question answered tonight, it's understandable. There are 12 of us.</p><p>I'm going to be answering voter questions for 10 straight hours this Friday. My web site, yang2020.com. And if you ask your question tonight, there's a better chance I'll get to it.</p><p>My surprising friendship, it's been so much fun running for president, because I've gotten to meet so many Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise. The friendship that sticks out for me is a guy named Fred, who's an avid Trump supporter, a trucker. He let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail. I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs.</p><p>And I'm happy to say that, after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me. And we remained in touch ever since.</p><p>The truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party. The fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail, call centers, transportation, as well as to white-collar workers like attorneys, pharmacists, and radiologists. It does not care about our party.</p><p>Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016. What did he say? He said we're going to build a wall, we're going to turn the clock back, we're going to bring the old jobs back. America, we have to do the opposite of all of these things. We have to turn the clock forward. We have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible. We have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value. It is not left. It is not right. It is forward. And that is where we must take the country in 2020.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Mr. Yang, thank you very much. Senator Harris?</p><p>HARRIS: Thank you. Probably Rand Paul. He and I -- actually, I invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bail system in the United States. He and I agree on almost nothing, but we agree on that. And after we joined forces, he said to me, \"Kamala, you know, Appalachia loves this.\" And it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.</p><p>And I guess that's why I'm running. I do believe that to beat Donald Trump, but also to heal our country, we need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.</p><p>And I'll tell you, my mother was 19 when she left India alone. And she wanted to travel to learn science because her mission in life was to cure cancer. And so she arrived in California. She got -- you know, she was supposed to have an arranged marriage, but she got involved in the civil rights movement, she met my father, and that produced my sister and me. They got married. But when I was five, that marriage ended.</p><p>But my mother convinced us that we could do anything. And so I became the first woman attorney general of California, the second black woman elected to the United States Senate, and I will tell you, that's part of why I'm running, because Donald Trump, if he had his way, my story would not be possible. And I am running to make sure that that dream, the American dream, American values, American ideas will always hold true.</p><p>And so that's what is at stake in this election. And I believe I am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak the story of the American dream and the need to reclaim it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator Harris. Mayor Buttigieg?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, I think about the friendships that I formed in the military, people who were radically different from me, different generation, different race, definitely different politics. And we learned to trust each other with our lives.</p><p>When they got into my vehicle and when we went outside the wire, they didn't care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend, they didn't care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not. We just learned to trust each other.</p><p>In fact, the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go to war to get there is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important. I guess I'll follow in the pattern tonight and point out you can go to peteforamerica.com and read all about it.</p><p>It's also about building a sense of belonging in this country, because I think that's what friendship and that's what service can create. And I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems, from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self-medicating and we're seeing a rise in the deaths from despair.</p><p>I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country. The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president. It is the unification of the American people. And I'm asking for your vote to be that president, when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency, pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Mr. Mayor, thank you. Senator Sanders?</p><p>SANDERS: When I was chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I tried to get through the most comprehensive piece of veterans legislation in modern American history. And I failed. I only had two Republicans to vote with me in the Senate. So we had to go back to the drawing board.</p><p>And I worked with John McCain. I certainly did not get in that legislation working with McCain all that I wanted. But it turned out that we were able to pass a very, very significant piece of legislation, including $5 billion more for the Veterans Administration.</p><p>More recently, I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah, Mike Lee. And Mike understood, although he and I disagree on everything, that the U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen. And for the first time in 45 years, we were able to get the War Powers Act utilized and get U.S. -- get the votes to get the U.S. troops out of that area.</p><p>But I think, at the end of day, what I appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that Trump is fostering on our people, the divisiveness, trying to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation or our religion.</p><p>And there is no job that I would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man, woman, and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1 percent. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, thank you. Senator Warren?</p><p>WARREN: You ask about a surprising friend. For me, it would be Charles Fried. Twenty-seven years ago, when I was under consideration for a job, he was someone who had been George Bush, the first, solicitor general, a deeply principled Republican.</p><p>And we didn't agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was. But he also was willing to listen to my work about what's happening to America's middle class. And Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure I got the job.</p><p>You know, I grew up out in Oklahoma. I have three elder brothers. They all served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers. And there are a lot of things that we're divided on, but there are core things that we believe in together.</p><p>We want to see all of our children get a good start in life. We don't want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by health care. We're willing to get out there for the things we believe in.</p><p>Look, people across this country, whether they're Democrats, independents, or Republicans, they know what's broken. They know that we have an America that's working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind.</p><p>People across this country, regardless of party, are ready to say no more, we want an America that works for everyone. 2020 is our moment in history. It is a deep honor to be here, to be in this fight.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>WARREN: I know what's broken. I know how to fix it. And we are building a grassroots movement to get it done that includes everyone.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. Vice President Biden?</p><p>BIDEN: This is reassuring in the fact that we're all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country.</p><p>The two people maybe would surprise you the most were -- he's been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was -- he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children.</p><p>And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, \"John, you didn't see a war you never wanted to fight.\" And he'd say, \"You didn't see a problem you never wanted to solve.\" But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable.</p><p>And one of the things -- that's the reason why I'm running. We have to restore the soul of this country. That's why I'm doing this. In fact, this president has ripped the soul out of this country, divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous. A liar, he cheats, he does not do anything to promote people generally.</p><p>Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle class. The only way we're going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle. My dad used to say a job is about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It's about your dignity. We have to restore people's dignity.</p><p>And lastly, we have to unite the country, because, folks, it's time we stopped walking around with our heads down. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century. So for god's sake, get up. Get up and remember, there is the United States of America. There's nothing, nothing we're unable to do when we decide we're going to do it. Nothing at all. Period.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Candidates, thank you.

The more tech companies know about their users, the more effectively they can direct them to goods and services that they are likely to buy. The more companies know about their users, the more competitive they are in the market.  Custom-tailored capitalism is what has made Google, Facebook, Amazon and others the richest companies in the world. This profit incentive has turned big tech into a competitive field of mass intelligence gathering. The better and more comprehensive the data, the higher profits will be.  But this business model - what I consider spying machines - has enormous potential to violate civil liberties. Big tech is already being used abroad to enhance the power of repressive regimes, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.boisestate.edu/sps-frankchurchinstitute/about-us/chase-johnson/\">my work</url> and others' has shown.  While it is not presently a direct threat to US democracy, I worry that the potential for future abuses exists so long as big tech remains largely unregulated. Big tech's spy machines Current news is rife with examples of data abuses. In April,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-leveraged-facebook-user-data-fight-rivals-help-friends-n994706\">NBC News</url> broke a story detailing how Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg had used data gathered by the platform to support his friends and defeat his rivals.  This is not Facebook's first privacy PR nightmare. In 2018, data firm Cambridge Analytica used a Facebook app to collect       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html\">data profiles of over 87 million</url> people, which was later used to distribute targeted political advertising during elections.  Facebook is not alone in the data collection boom. This May, it was revealed that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xwnva7/snapchat-employees-abused-data-access-spy-on-users-snaplion\">Snapchat employees were using the app's data</url> to obtain location data, pictures and email addresses without users' consent. A new book by former Harvard business professor Shoshana Zuboff goes into great detail of the practices of what she calls \"surveillance capitalism\". Zuboff writes: \"Once we searched Google. Now, Google searches us.\"  The practice goes beyond someone's taste in music or what they purchase on Amazon. Apps created to help people through mental illness or quit smoking       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/22/smoking-depression-apps-are-selling-your-data-google-facebook-study-finds/\">sell data to big tech companies</url>. These users could be potential targets for social stigmatisation or targeted advertising that exacerbates health problems rather than solving them.  In December, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> published an       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html\">expos\u00e9</url> on what one can learn about someone using their collated data from apps and smartphones. By blending location tracking with other online behaviour, researchers were able to put together a detailed portrait of the most intimate details of users' lives, such as where their children go to school or who was cheating on their diet. They could even tell which area of a nuclear power plant an individual worked in - information that is typically classified.  Because of these revelations, data that big tech collects poses a national security problem. One open source researcher used data from Strava, a fitness app, to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/Nrg8000/status/957318498102865920?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">map US military bases</url> around the world as soldiers tracked their runs. Our devices are constantly telling companies where we are and what we are doing. That is not always a good thing. For the worst-case scenarios, look abroad Big tech is a highly unregulated sector of the economy. Existing regulations have struggled to keep up with a rapidly innovating tech sector. In some scenarios, big tech's capabilities are being used by dictators to craft a dystopian digital reality.  Autocratic governments around the world have already begun to use emerging technology to violate human rights.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/chinas-orwellian-tools-of-high-tech-repression/2018/09/17/b06a9a72-baa1-11e8-9812-a389be6690af_story.html\">China is a prime example</url>. China integrates AI, biometric data and online activity to track and monitor dissidents and members of ethnic minority communities, who are then       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-04-26/inside-china-s-uighur-camps-video\">sent to reeducation camps</url>.  From my time researching the ways Russia uses these platforms to threaten democracy, I am familiar with the worst-case scenarios of big tech's capabilities. Because platforms' success is predicated on making information go viral, the most successful content can also be some of the most divisive. Russia believes that by disseminating       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/02/dont-believe-lies-just-people-repeat/\">enough false information</url> about the most inflammatory areas of American politics, it can sow chaos in the system. Big tech is the perfect port of entry for such campaigns.  If Russian attacks on social media       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/The_MADCOM_Future_RW_0926.pdf\">are combined with AI technology</url>, information attacks could become precision-guided. Nefarious actors could gather the comprehensive profiles that surveillance capitalism has compiled over the years. Fake news would then no longer speak to issues       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/join-scout/the-rise-of-the-weaponized-ai-propaganda-machine-86dac61668b\">but to individuals</url>, appealing to what makes the user       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/weaponized-information-seeks-a-new-target-in-cyberspace-users-minds-100069\">change their mind</url>.  If a monopolistic tech company decided to fully embrace its capacity to spy on its users and leverage that data to a personal or political end, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/can-mark-zuckerberg-fix-facebook-before-it-breaks-democracy\">consequences for democracy could be catastrophic</url>. Americans got a taste of what an influence attack looks like during the 2016 US presidential election. So long as big tech remains largely unregulated, future influence attacks on American elections will become only more potent. Big tech isn't going anywhere A surface-level solution to this privacy dilemma would be for people to decouple their online lives from these companies.  For example, DuckDuckGo is an alternative search engine that does not compile user data and promises total privacy. A new browser, Brave, has promised to pay users back for selling data to advertisers.  However, these products are nowhere near as useful for a casual internet user than Google. Simply choosing not to use Google       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-cut-google-out-of-my-life-it-screwed-up-everything-1830565500\">is not that simple</url>.  While there are many different companies in question, they all hold near-monopolistic control over their corner of the market. Amazon dominates online shopping. Facebook dominates interacting with friends and causes. Google dominates web browsing.  Individuals are thus faced with a choice: radically change their lifestyle and how they interact with the world, or continue to be the target of big tech's spy machines.  Oversight and regulation may seem dramatic and anti-growth at the moment, but I believe that it is a necessary check on big tech - before the worst of its potentials come true.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This article is republished from</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">under a Creative Commons license.

Yet increasingly the push to regulate 'Big Tech' is an area of agreement for Republicans and Democrats. This consensus was on full display at last week's contentious congressional hearing[1] featuring top tech CEOs such as Google's Sundar Pichai, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. \"This hearing has made one fact clear to me,\" Democratic Rep. </p><p>David Cicilline said[2]. \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable. We need to ensure the antitrust laws, first written more than a century ago, work in the digital age.\" This is seemingly the mainstream position among today's Democrats. The party's presidential nominee, Joe Biden, has backed[3] restoring heavy-handed internet regulations known as 'net neutrality' and is also encouraging[4] the federal government to wade into the debate over social media censorship by repealing Section 230, which shields online platforms for liability for what users post. (Social media as we know it couldn't exist without Section 230[5].) Meanwhile, many prominent Republicans and conservatives have also come out in favor of regulating Big Tech. Populist Republican Sen. Josh Hawley has called for regulating tech companies' ability to moderate their own platforms, and argued[6] that 'Google and Facebook should not be a law unto themselves.' The Missouri senator has also introduced legislation that would impose nanny-state restrictions on social media[7] to combat perceived addiction. Hawley's bill would ban popular features such as Snapchat 'streaks' and YouTube autoplay. While many principled small-government conservatives, such as Sen. Rand Paul, still back a free-market approach to tech policy issues, Hawley is not an outlier by any means.Conservative anger at Big Tech's censorship should not delude us into supporting the Big Government tool of antitrust. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/bLZiQ7t1sr\">https://t.co/bLZiQ7t1sr</url>[8]\u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) August 3, 2020[9]Indeed, President Trump has also backed the regulation[10] of social media companies to combat perceived anti-conservative bias. And the most popular conservative media personality in the country, Fox News host Tucker Carlson, regularly rails against Big Tech\u2014even agreeing with progressive proposals[11] to use the heavy hand of government antitrust regulation to break up companies such as Facebook and Google. So, if major figures from both parties can agree on regulating Big Tech, it must be a good idea, right? Not so fast. From left to right, the intentions behind these regulatory proposals are often good. After all, most reasonable people would likely share Democrats' desire to see Big Tech better handle misinformation, 'fake news,' and foreign election interference, while conservative Republicans' calls for political neutrality online are no doubt appealing in the abstract. Unfortunately, in their haphazard rush to score political points through government action, would-be regulators from both parties are forgetting the inevitable 'knowledge problem' that plagues any central planners who try to dictate the minutiae of complicated industries from the halls of Washington, DC. Economic philosopher Friedrich A. Hayek diagnosed this fatal flaw of government control in his seminal work \"The Use of Knowledge in Society[12].\" 'If we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place,' Hayek wrote[13]. 'It would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them.' 'We cannot expect that this problem will be solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board which, after integrating all knowledge, issues its orders,' he continued[14]. 'We must solve it by some form of decentralization. But this answers only part of our problem. We need decentralization because only thus can we insure that the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place will be promptly used.' To put it simply, the knowledge problem means that centralized decision-making is doomed to failure, because only those closest to a given situation have the relevant knowledge and awareness to properly gauge the best outcome. For example, a planning committee of bureaucrats in Washington, DC that tried to set the prices for corn sales in Iowa is far less likely to set an efficient and realistic price than if farmers themselves can respond to changes in their business and adjust their own prices accordingly. 'The knowledge problem... is about more than the ability to plan an economy,' Jeffrey A. Tucker wrote in his analysis of Hayek's theory[15]. 'It is about the whole of our lives. It is about the ability to plan and direct the course of civilization. That capacity to manage the world, even the smallest part of it, will always and everywhere elude our grasp.' The knowledge problem plagues all centralized government planning. But the gap between the knowledge of the often elderly members of Congress who would write Big Tech regulatory legislation and the extremely advanced and complex workings of the tech industry is especially acute. Consider a viral moment from a 2018 hearing where Zuckerberg testified before the Senate and was asked a hilarious question by former Sen. Orrin Hatch[16], who was 84 years old at the time. 'How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?' Hatch asked the Facebook CEO. Holding back a laugh, Zuckerberg replied 'Senator we run ads.'Sen. Hatch: \"If [a version of Facebook will always be free], how do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?\" Mark Zuckerberg: \"Senator, we run ads.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co\">https://t.co</url> /CbFO899XlU[17] pic.twitter.com/bGKWks7zIk[18];\u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) April 10, 2018[19]Given the fact that he was born in 1934, we can certainly forgive former Sen. Hatch for not grasping the workings of Facebook. But the lighthearted example of a top Republican senator's total failure to grasp the basics of social media 101 should be a giant red flag. If some of Congress's most prominent members can't even understand the basics of social media, how are they supposed to regulate the industry with even a modicum of competence? It's not as if Hatch was alone in his tech illiteracy. The average age in the US Senate is 63 years old[20]. Do you think your grandma or grandpa would fare any better if asked to write the rules for Google or Facebook? The House of Representatives fares somewhat better, with an average age[21] of 58 years old. But last week's hearing showed us many members of the House are just as plagued by tech illiteracy as their colleagues in the Senate. Rep. Greg Steube of Florida used some of his time questioning Pichai, the Google CEO, to ask why some of his campaign emails go to his parents' 'spam' folders on Gmail. Yes, seriously[22].Rep . Steube complains to Google CEO about his campaign emails going to Gmail spam boxes and says that it's only happening to republicans. (No, pretty much every campaign deals with email delivery issues.) pic.twitter.com/XH1floO9ff[23];\u2014 Tony Webster (@webster) July 29, 2020[24]In another hilarious-yet-eyebrow-raising turn of events, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner confronted[25] Mark Zuckerberg on the censorship of Donald Trump Jr.'s Twitter posts on the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine that some tout as a COVID-19 treatment.It  does not inspire great confidence in the government's ability to fairly regulate Big Tech when members of Congress accuse the wrong company of censoring Don Trump Jr. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/PIGgPFpFYe\">https://t.co/PIGgPFpFYe</url>[26]\u2014 Robby Soave (@robbysoave) July 29, 2020[27]The only problem? Zuckerberg is the CEO of Facebook\u2014not Twitter.Parody  imageMeanwhile, Biden would be the oldest president ever if elected, while at the same time he promises to launch a government overhaul of the internet as we know it[28]. If you're looking for insights into Biden's tech acumen, consider an answer[29] he provided to a debate-stage question about race:Social workers help parents deal with how to raise their children. It's not that they don't want to help, they don't know what to play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the \u2014 make sure that kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time we get there.Does anyone really think an aging septuagenarian who struggles to form full sentences and thinks people still use 'record players' should write the rules for Silicon Valley? It's perfectly fine to laugh at these moments and flubs. We could use more light-heartedness in our politics. But we can't overlook the crucial lesson here as well. Young people have made a generational rallying cry out of the slogan 'OK Boomer,' through millions of memes and social media posts poking fun at older generations' inability to understand new societal realities. While sometimes applied flippantly or rudely, at its best 'OK Boomer' is a lighthearted way of pointing out the Hayekian knowledge problem older folks run into when they lecture young people on how to navigate new, unfamiliar complexities. \"I paid for my college by myself by waiting tables, young people these days are just lazy.\" 'Ok Boomer.' Actually, adjusting for inflation, the price of college tuition has roughly tripled since 1980[30]. (Thanks, government subsidies![31])And so on. You get the point. There is no more glaring issue where the 'OK Boomer' mantra's invocation of the knowledge problem is more relevant than the debate over regulating Big Tech. Our elderly leaders in Congress have made it clear they don't even understand the basic revenue model of social media, aren't familiar with how email filtering works, and fail to grasp the differences between various online platforms. If we put well-intentioned but aged politicians in charge of writing the rules, their lack of knowledge and familiarity with technology would result in deeply flawed and broken regulations. How can you write a bill effectively regulating speech on social media if you don't understand the difference between Facebook and Twitter? It seems almost certain such regulatory attempts would end with rules misapplied and innovation throttled. And no, this doesn't mean it's fine for young legislators like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to regulate Big Tech however they want. Even the most youthful, tech-savvy politicians will be prone to the knowledge problem, because they don't have the familiarity, expertise, or skin-in-the-game of an on-the-ground entrepreneur. But the age issue no doubt exacerbates this problem. Major disruptions to the technology we use every day will inevitably accompany any serious effort by Boomers in Congress to regulate an industry they can't even comprehend. That's a fate we should all want to avoid.

Yet increasingly the push to regulate \u201cBig Tech\u201d is an area of agreement for Republicans and Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consensus was on full display at last week\u2019s contentious congressional hearing featuring top tech CEOs such as Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This hearing has made one fact clear to me,\" Democratic Rep. David Cicilline said. \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable. </p><p>We need to ensure the antitrust laws, first written more than a century ago, work in the digital age.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is seemingly the mainstream position among today\u2019s Democrats. The party\u2019s presidential nominee, Joe Biden, has backed restoring heavy-handed internet regulations known as \u201cnet neutrality\u201d and is also encouraging the federal government to wade into the debate over social media censorship by repealing Section 230, which shields online platforms for liability for what users post. (Social media as we know it couldn\u2019t exist without Section 230.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, many prominent Republicans and conservatives have also come out in favor of regulating Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Populist Republican Sen. Josh Hawley has called for regulating tech companies' ability to moderate their own platforms, and argued that \u201cGoogle and Facebook should not be a law unto themselves.\u201d The Missouri senator has also introduced legislation that would impose nanny-state restrictions on social media to combat perceived addiction. Hawley\u2019s bill would ban popular features such as Snapchat \u201cstreaks\u201d and YouTube autoplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many principled small-government conservatives, such as Sen. Rand Paul, still back a free-market approach to tech policy issues, Hawley is not an outlier by any means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Conservative anger at Big Tech\u2019s censorship should not delude us into supporting the Big Government tool of antitrust. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/bLZiQ7t1sr\">https://t.co/bLZiQ7t1sr</url>&lt;/p&gt;\u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) August 3, 2020&lt;p&gt;Indeed, President Trump has also backed the regulation of social media companies to combat perceived anti-conservative bias. And the most popular conservative media personality in the country, Fox News host Tucker Carlson, regularly rails against Big Tech\u2014even agreeing with progressive proposals to use the heavy hand of government antitrust regulation to break up companies such as Facebook and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if major figures from both parties can agree on regulating Big Tech, it must be a good idea, right? Not so fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From left to right, the intentions behind these regulatory proposals are often good. After all, most reasonable people would likely share Democrats\u2019 desire to see Big Tech better handle misinformation, \u201cfake news,\u201d and foreign election interference, while conservative Republicans\u2019 calls for political neutrality online are no doubt appealing in the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in their haphazard rush to score political points through government action, would-be regulators from both parties are forgetting the inevitable \u201cknowledge problem\u201d that plagues any central planners who try to dictate the minutiae of complicated industries from the halls of Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic philosopher Friedrich A. Hayek diagnosed this fatal flaw of government control in his seminal work \"The Use of Knowledge in Society.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place,\u201d Hayek wrote. \u201cIt would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe cannot expect that this problem will be solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board which, after integrating all knowledge, issues its orders,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe must solve it by some form of decentralization. But this answers only part of our problem. We need decentralization because only thus can we insure that the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place will be promptly used.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, the knowledge problem means that centralized decision-making is doomed to failure, because only those closest to a given situation have the relevant knowledge and awareness to properly gauge the best outcome. For example, a planning committee of bureaucrats in Washington, DC that tried to set the prices for corn sales in Iowa is far less likely to set an efficient and realistic price than if farmers themselves can respond to changes in their business and adjust their own prices accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe knowledge problem... is about more than the ability to plan an economy,\u201d Jeffrey A. Tucker wrote in his analysis of Hayek\u2019s theory. \u201cIt is about the whole of our lives. It is about the ability to plan and direct the course of civilization. That capacity to manage the world, even the smallest part of it, will always and everywhere elude our grasp.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The knowledge problem plagues all centralized government planning. But the gap between the knowledge of the often elderly members of Congress who would write Big Tech regulatory legislation and the extremely advanced and complex workings of the tech industry is especially acute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider a viral moment from a 2018 hearing where Zuckerberg testified before the Senate and was asked a hilarious question by former Sen. Orrin Hatch, who was 84 years old at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow do you sustain a business model in which users don\u2019t pay for your service?\u201d Hatch asked the Facebook CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holding back a laugh, Zuckerberg replied \u201cSenator\u2026 we run ads.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Sen. Hatch: \"If [a version of Facebook will always be free], how do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?\"&lt;br&gt;Mark Zuckerberg: \"Senator, we run ads.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/CbFO899XlU\">https://t.co/CbFO899XlU</url> pic.twitter.com/bGKWks7zIk&lt;/p&gt;\u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) April 10, 2018&lt;p&gt;Given the fact that he was born in 1934, we can certainly forgive former Sen. Hatch for not grasping the workings of Facebook. But the lighthearted example of a top Republican senator\u2019s total failure to grasp the basics of social media 101 should be a giant red flag. If some of Congress\u2019s most prominent members can\u2019t even understand the basics of social media, how are they supposed to regulate the industry with even a modicum of competence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not as if Hatch was alone in his tech illiteracy. The average age in the US Senate is 63 years old. Do you think your grandma or grandpa would fare any better if asked to write the rules for Google or Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House of Representatives fares somewhat better, with an average age of 58 years old. But last week\u2019s hearing showed us many members of the House are just as plagued by tech illiteracy as their colleagues in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Greg Steube of Florida used some of his time questioning Pichai, the Google CEO, to ask why some of his campaign emails go to his parents' \u201cspam\u201d folders on Gmail. Yes, seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Rep. Steube complains to Google CEO about his campaign emails going to Gmail spam boxes and says that it's only happening to republicans. (No, pretty much every campaign deals with email delivery issues.) pic.twitter.com/XH1floO9ff&lt;/p&gt;\u2014 Tony Webster (@webster) July 29, 2020&lt;p&gt;In another hilarious-yet-eyebrow-raising turn of events, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner confronted Mark Zuckerberg on the censorship of Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s Twitter posts on the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine that some tout as a COVID-19 treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;It does not inspire great confidence in the government's ability to fairly regulate Big Tech when members of Congress accuse the wrong company of censoring Don Trump Jr. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/PIGgPFpFYe\">https://t.co/PIGgPFpFYe</url>&lt;/p&gt;\u2014 Robby Soave (@robbysoave) July 29, 2020&lt;p&gt;The only problem?

If you\u2019re looking for insights into Biden\u2019s tech acumen, consider an answer he provided to a debate-stage question\u2026 about race:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social workers help parents deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help, they don\u2019t know what to play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the \u2014 make sure that kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time we get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone really think an aging septuagenarian who struggles to form full sentences and thinks people still use \u201crecord players\u201d should write the rules for Silicon Valley?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s perfectly fine to laugh at these moments and flubs. We could use more light-heartedness in our politics. But we can\u2019t overlook the crucial lesson here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people have made a generational rallying cry out of the slogan \u201cOK Boomer,\u201d through millions of memes and social media posts poking fun at older generations\u2019 inability to understand new societal realities. While sometimes applied flippantly or rudely, at its best \u201cOK Boomer\u201d is a lighthearted way of pointing out the Hayekian knowledge problem older folks run into when they lecture young people on how to navigate new, unfamiliar complexities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I paid for my college by myself by waiting tables, young people these days are just lazy.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOk Boomer.\u201d Actually, adjusting for inflation, the price of college tuition has roughly tripled since 1980. (Thanks, government subsidies!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-cfstyle=\"width: 500px; height: 492px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" data-cfsrc=\"/media/38068/ok-boomer-meme.png?width=500&amp;height;=492\" alt=\"\" data-udi=\"umb://media/aee79e44a0f24844bf9a2acdc15f53a4\" style=\"display:none;visibility:hidden;\" src=\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://fee.org\">https://fee.org</url>\"&gt;&lt;img style=\"width: 500px; height: 492px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://fee.org/media/38068/ok-boomer-meme.png?width=500&amp;height;=492\">https://fee.org/media/38068/ok-boomer-meme.png?width=500&amp;height;=492</url>\" alt=\"\" data-udi=\"umb://media/aee79e44a0f24844bf9a2acdc15f53a4\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so on. You get the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no more glaring issue where the \u201cOK Boomer\u201d mantra\u2019s invocation of the knowledge problem is more relevant than the debate over regulating Big Tech. Our elderly leaders in Congress have made it clear they don\u2019t even understand the basic revenue model of social media, aren\u2019t familiar with how email filtering works, and fail to grasp the differences between various online platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we put well-intentioned but aged politicians in charge of writing the rules, their lack of knowledge and familiarity with technology would result in deeply flawed and broken regulations. How can you write a bill effectively regulating speech on social media if you don\u2019t understand the difference between Facebook and Twitter? It seems almost certain such regulatory attempts would end with rules misapplied and innovation throttled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And no, this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fine for young legislators like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to regulate Big Tech however they want. Even the most youthful, tech-savvy politicians will be prone to the knowledge problem, because they don\u2019t have the familiarity, expertise, or skin-in-the-game of an on-the-ground entrepreneur. But the age issue no doubt exacerbates this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major disruptions to the technology we use every day will inevitably accompany any serious effort by Boomers in Congress to regulate an industry they can\u2019t even comprehend. That\u2019s a fate we should all want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-109527</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HS-69N1-DY1R-B0P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2071\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Monday's hearing gives Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai a big platform to try to prevent that from happening. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: Congress should pass better laws. </p><p>Let's work together and do that! Zuckerberg will likely argue that it's Congress's job to write laws to bolster election security and establish consistent nationwide online privacy standards.Facebook's goal is to see such laws written carefully and applied consistently.He'll also point to progress Facebook has made in cracking down on misinformation and hate speech. Google CEO Sundar Pichai: We won search by doing it well \u2014 why punish us for that? Google doesn't dispute its clear dominance in search, nor of certain corners of the online advertising market. But it has long maintained in both cases that this is just a natural outgrowth of delivering value. It contends that digital advertising is in fact wildly competitive and that each individual advertising-technology service it offers faces a raft of rivals. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos: We're big because we've always given users what they want \u2014 fast delivery, wide selection and good prices. Bezos is likely to point to Amazon's ability to get goods to Americans' homes during the pandemic as a public service.He will also need to defend the company against criticism of how it runs its third-party marketplace. In the past, Amazon has softened[1] some of its marketplace terms and denied reports that it uses third-party sales data to develop its own competing products. Apple CEO Tim Cook: Our App Store creates opportunity for countless developers \u2014 and Google's Android controls more of the smartphone market, anyway. Apple has faced criticism for the way it develops and features its own apps that compete with third-party programs, as well as[2] for the commissions it takes from app makers.The company says its tightly controlled approach keeps iPhone apps safe, maintains their quality, and protects users' privacy. Expect Cook to cite the size and vitality of the app market and the continued enthusiasm of Apple's customers. One wild card: China. All four companies have loudly or quietly warned that the U.S. shouldn't over-regulate its big tech firms because the nation needs them to be big and strong to counter threats from China. But China is also at the heart of Apple's supply chains and a key consumer market for the company. Google and Facebook have also flirted in the past with trying to crack the Chinese market. Between the lines: Many of the loudest and most potent lines of attack on tech \u2014 like the idea, promoted by President Trump and other Republicans, that it's stifling conservatives \u2014 can be countered with facts, but they're too politically useful to simply be dropped.The bottom line: The CEOs will get a chance Monday to rebut criticisms, argue that they're a net good for the nation, and tell lawmakers directly that antitrust enforcement is the wrong remedy for their ills.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, the frontrunner Democrat for president, wants to break up Silicon Valley giants. But one tech stock might be insulated from that threat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Netflix may be the only FAANG company --- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google -- that wouldn't be subject to Warren's plan to disband big tech. Some of Netflix's disadvantages, like steep streaming competition, are actually beneficial when it comes to the political, and possibly regulatory, crackdown on tech. </p><p>\"Netflix has not so far run into any of the controversies that any of the other FAANG stocks have,\" said Jim Nail, principal analyst at research firm Forrester. \"They're not doing advertisements, and they're not using data in ways that some of these other companies are.\" </p><p>Netflix probably couldn't be accused of having too much monopoly power either, as streaming competition increases with the launch of Apple TV+, Disney+, and NBCUniversal's Peacock, around the corner.</p><p>US Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed in a blog post in March to break up Google, Facebook and Amazon. Shortly after, in an interview with The Verge, Warren said she thinks Apple should be broken apart, too. She said that the company should not be able to run the App Store and sell its own apps on it. </p><p>In light of Warren's plan to break up big tech, BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Salmon made Netflix his top tech stock over e-commerce giant Amazon.</p><p>\"We continue to seek out how the legal path might progress for these types of actions, but in the short term, we think it's appropriate to move Netflix to top pick and Amazon to number two,\" Salmon wrote in a note to clients. </p><p>\"We have less confidence in the subject being a wall of worry to climb and instead increasingly clouding the fundamental thesis for Amazon,\" he wrote. \"Netflix, on the other hand, faces little to no regulatory risk.\"</p><p>Warren did not respond to a request for comment Friday. </p><p>Warren is not the only one to vouch for a big tech crackdown. Criticism against big tech companies is coming from left, right and center. The US government is targeting tech companies for issues ranging from violation of users' privacy to monopolistic behavior.</p><p>Policymakers in Washington have increasingly focused on complaints of anti-competitive behavior concerning Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The Justice Department launched in July a formal antitrust review of the nation's biggest tech companies. Although those companies were not named by the Justice Department, the agency indicated it will look into areas where those companies are dominant players.</p><p>The Department of Justice declined to comment on Friday. The Federal Trade Commission said it can't comment on Netflix specifically.</p><p>Breaking up a big company, however, is a complex process. Even under the most radical vision of some of the progressives who are raising concerns in this area, the antitrust laws don't break up companies because they're large, said David Balto, an antitrust attorney and former policy director at the Federal Trade Commission's competition bureau.</p><p>\"The antitrust laws would speak to break up companies if they were engaging in profound anti-competitive conduct, and if there was no remedy short of divestiture that really could solve the competitive problem,\" Balto said. \"That's a universe that is very far away from where we're at today. I just don't see a basis for talking about break ups of either of these companies.\"</p><p>For now, those concerns don't apply to Netflix, said Jim Nail an analyst at Forrester.</p><p>\"So far, it seems like Netflix is all good for the consumer. They're getting lots of content at a very low price. And a lot of Netflix's content would probably not have been produced in the traditional movie and television studios system. So it's creating more choice for consumers, and legislators and regulators tend to think that more choice for consumers is a good thing,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't see any reason they [Netflix] would eventually come into the crosshairs.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The stock spiked on the takeover rumors and Google ultimately agreed to pay $7.35 a share, or $2.1 billion in cash, for the fitness tracker. </p><p>Still, that's a far cry from when Fitbit traded above $50 a share in July 2015, just a few months after the wearables company went public.</p><p>The lesson here may be that at a time when Google and fellow tech titans Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft seem intent on getting bigger -- despite antitrust and other regulatory concerns -- niche tech companies may find it difficult to survive, let alone thrive.</p><p>Just take a look at what's happening to some other smaller tech firms. </p><p>Specialized tech firms can't compete with the megacaps</p><p>Shares of food delivery service GrubHub tanked last month after it reported disastrous results and an unappetizing outlook. Competition in the business is now intense, with Uber and privately held startups Postmates and DoorDash all gaining traction in that market. </p><p>Heck, the delivery business is so cutthroat that even Amazon recently decided to throw in the towel on its own Amazon Restaurants service.</p><p>Online review service Yelp has struggled as well, mainly due to competition with Google. </p><p>Yelp shares are down more than 40% in the past five years and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman has frequently criticized Google and Facebook for their growing clout in the tech world. He's even gone so far as to call Google a monopoly on numerous occasions.</p><p>And then there's action camera company GoPro, a firm that helped symbolize the wearables market along with Fitbit. </p><p>GoPro tried--and failed--to branch beyond its Hero line of cameras with the since-discontinued Karma line of quadcopter drones. And even though the company recently reported solid sales of its latest Hero camera, GoPro still trades below $5 a share -- more than 95% below its all-time high of just under $100 a share, which it reached in September 2014.</p><p>So could any of these companies wind up getting bought out by the giant tech companies, as Fitbit did? </p><p>Stacks of cash could be used for M&amp;A</p><p>Big Tech firms are still sitting on Mount Everest-sized piles of cash on their balance sheets even though many of them have been using more money to buy back stock, pay bigger dividends and increase their research and development budgets. </p><p>Moody's predicted in a report this week that Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, Cisco and Oracle will finish 2019 with nearly $640 billion in cash combined. That's down just 1% from a year ago.</p><p>And even though politicians ranging from President Trump to 2020 Democratic contender Elizabeth Warren have criticized the growing clout of tech giants, it's unclear if these companies are going to change their behavior or cater to pressure from lawmakers.</p><p>\"Big Tech has not proven to be adept at managing K Street,\" said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investment, told CNN Business in a reference to the Washington D.C. street where many lobbyists have their offices. \"It's been a little clumsy,\"</p><p>The tech firms also seem more than willing to test how far they can go with their diversification and expansion efforts before Washington calls foul.</p><p>Google, for example, confirmed this week that it is collecting health care data as part of a deal with the non-profit health care provider Ascension. The initiative, codenamed Project Nightingale, is already the subject of at least one federal government inquiry. </p><p>But unless regulators and lawmakers step in and force tech giants to stop scooping up smaller rivals, specialized companies will likely keep running to deep pocketed tech firms. </p><p>That's exactly what Whole Foods did in 2017 when it sold to Amazon. LinkedIn and GitHub did much the same by selling out to Microsoft. Apple scooped up Shazam and Beats to bolster its music business. And Facebook has acquired Instagram, WhatsApp and VR firm Oculus in its short history. </p><p>Fitbit CEO James Park made no qualms about its decision to sell to Google. The company \"is an ideal partner to advance our mission,\" he said in a press release. \"With Google's resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone.\"</p><p>In other words, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

A Group of Companies Wants to Fix That.</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText>Steve Lohr</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline><highlight><bodyText><p>Sixteen companies are calling for more transparency from the likes of Google and Facebook, and setting their own example in hopes of a less expensive, more efficient system.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A group of 16 companies \u2014 including leading ad tech firms, ad agencies and publishers \u2014 is trying to help clean up the murky world of digital advertising.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Wednesday, the companies called for more visibility into where each dollar is spent in the online advertising supply chain. They committed to standards and practices for sharing data on fees and authenticating content, and urged others to move in the same direction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The move, industry executives and analysts say, is an effort to bolster digital advertising outside the domains of Google and Facebook, whose <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/08/technology/antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html\">ad businesses are being scrutinized</url> by federal and state investigators for anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>The group, which includes Oracle and News Corporation, also hopes to apply pressure on the digital ad powers to pry open their \u201cblack box\u201d marketplaces, by disclosing fees and other information.</p><p>Publishers routinely complain that the opaque nature of the digital ad pipeline is inefficient and expensive, with middlemen taking an outsize share of ad spending. Newspaper and magazine publishers, by some estimates, collect only 30 to 40 cents of every dollar spent on their ads online, compared with about 85 cents in the pre-internet days.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to create new terms of trade to modernize the business,\u201d said Joe Zawadzki, chief executive of MediaMath, an ad tech company. \u201cSeeing where every dollar goes \u2014 that doesn\u2019t exist today.\u201d</p><p>The initiative is led by MediaMath, which makes automated ad-buying and data analysis tools for advertisers and ad agencies. The group\u2019s members also include IBM Watson Advertising, White Ops, Havas Media and Business Insider.</p><p>The companies are all looking for a path to prosperity in an industry criticized for a lack of transparency, for hidden fees and for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/08/technology/antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html\">rampant ad fraud</url>. The companies in the initiative, called Source, are trying to demonstrate that a more efficient, more open marketplace can exist.</p><p>They want to be a viable alternative to Google and Facebook, which supply tools for ad buyers and sellers and run the auctions within their digital walls. The tech giants, which are able to offer advertisers huge audiences, increasingly hold sway.</p><p>\u201cThis is just one effort, but it is trying to address the larger issue of whether the digital advertising business will be more like the open internet, open to many, or will it be dominated by a few walled gardens?\u201d said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, which is aware of the initiative but is not directly involved. Nearly all the Source participants, as well as Google and Facebook, are members of the trade group.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to crack open the black box and compete on a different playing field than the walled gardens,\u201d said Mark Zagorski, chief executive of Telaria, a company whose software is used by digital TV services like Hulu and Sling to maximize ad revenue.</p><p>The members of the initiative are making commitments to share data. Publishers and video distributors, for example, will have to verify the type of content they are supplying to meet quality and authenticity standards to guard against fraud. And ad tech companies will have to disclose their fees.</p><p>Moving to more open digital ad markets, giving buyers and sellers ample information on pricing and auctions, will take time, said Chris Guenther, a senior vice president at News Corporation, which owns The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post.</p><p>\u201cBut this initiative is a step in the right direction \u2014 toward transparency,\u201d Mr. Guenther said.</p><p>Even without Google and Facebook, the companies say, the effort could help open up the digital ad business because it is in step with market demand.</p><p>\u201cBuyers and sellers are looking to take more control of their business,\u201d said Adam Soroca, an executive at the Rubicon Project, which provides tools to buyers and sellers of digital ads.</p><p>MediaMath has held discussions with Google about possibly joining the initiative, but not Facebook, the company said.</p><p>PHOTO: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create new terms of trade to modernize the business,\u201d said Joe Zawadzki of MediaMath.

A birthday card, perhaps; or notification of a big, \u00a325 win on the premium bonds. True, it could be a bill, but if you're really lucky you might see a political leaflet on the door mat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There, staring up at you, will be the smiling face of your local MP, who has a message for you about how hard he's working to make sure there is plenty of affordable housing for everyone - but how's he's working even harder to ensure it's not built in his constituency.</p><p>Or it might be your local council candidates, keen to explain how they'll transform the local playground if only you vote Labour at the polls. And to hammer home the point, here's a picture of them - Graham and Jill - pointing at a moderately misaligned swing with a mixture of outrage and compassion. If they don't get elected, they might still be in with a sniff for a Bafta.</p><p>Sometimes, the literature will be spikier than you expect, such as when a Conservative candidate in Dudley last year said: \"What have Labour delivered to this ward? Hepatitis.\" Or how about the Labour leaflet which listed among Conservative priorities: \"Shitting on us.\"</p><p>Good or bad though, at least the provenance of these leaflets - typos, smears, false promises and all - has to be made clear. You know who they're from; and you can be pretty confident that they're financing is sufficiently transparent to be subject to Electoral Commission oversight.</p><p>This isn't true of online political advertising. Despite the Electoral Commission having recommended as long ago as 2003 a change to existing rules to bring them into the digital age, the government has still not acted to get a grip on the situation. That really is an extraordinary dereliction of duty.</p><p>Whether that changes in the immediate future remains unclear. While pressure to regulate various corners of the internet continues to grow, democratic governments around the world retain their traditional anxiety about both the principle and practice.</p><p>With politicians flailing, big tech firms - not immune to public and political pressure - have taken matters into their own hands to some extent, accepting belatedly that they have a responsibility to protect the public from such diverse evils as hate speech and political manipulation.</p><p>Read more</p><p>Brexit has shown we need to reform our electoral system</p><p>Former chair of Vote Leave refuses to apologise for breaking law </p><p>Vote Leave drops appeal against fine for breaking electoral law</p><p>Momentum fined over \u00a316,000 for multiple breaches of electoral law</p><p>Facebook now requires that individuals and groups provide verifiable, publicly-available contact details before they can run political campaigns. And in the run-up to the European Parliament elections, the social media giant has set up a new team at its HQ in Dublin which hopes to spot (and take down) attempted political misinformation.</p><p>This is all to the good of course, although it begs the question of how Facebook might reach decisions about which material to remove from its pages, and whether appeals will be possible before or after content has been taken down. There is an innate irony in systems of oversight which aim to improve transparency being themselves pretty opaque.</p><p>In any event, there are broader questions which will not - and cannot - be dealt with by the initiatives of companies even of the size of Facebook or Google.</p><p>After the Brexit referendum, the Electoral Commission's adverse findings against Vote Leave and Leave.EU and (at the less serious end of the scale) the official Remain campaign suggest either that current spending rules are not understood or that breaches - leading to fines in the tens of thousands of pounds - are not punished in a way that deters wrongdoing.</p><p>Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds</p><p>And the ability of rich individuals to use networks of offshore financial arrangements means that the origins of their money are difficult to examine - even if the money is then used properly for legitimate campaigning.</p><p>Add to this mix the already very different resources available to different political parties and it becomes clear that Facebook's team of 40 people monitoring attempts to deceive Europe's voting public will be able to do little more than tinker at the edges.</p><p>In fact, there is always a danger that we are blinded by the potential dangers of the odd Russian bot, or obvious piece of online \"fake news\" (the impact of which remains uncertain), and ignore what is staring us in the face: real, breathing politicians, with real - if opaque - sources of wealth, saying in the flesh things that are wrong, threatening or that incite hatred.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-53060950</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W24-W231-JCJY-G2GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><timeReceived>5:07 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 6, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is one of the idea's biggest proponents. Experts caution against such a change.The Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week asked House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy[1] about an idea that has gained some steam on the right, as conservatives have vented at large tech companies they accuse of bias. Ingraham told McCarthy, a California Republican leading the charge against Silicon Valley, that \"there is another interesting idea beyond antitrust.\" </p><p>\"Consider Facebook and Twitter and so forth like a public utility, and thus they could be regulated like a public utility,\" she said. The point, she said, is that the companies like Facebook are \"the town square.\" \"And even though it is a private company, it dominates speech, dominates advertising ... so we have to treat a different way,\" she said. In response, McCarthy said he thought \"Congress is going to look at everything from the perspective of how powerful they have become.\" The idea of regulating companies such as Facebook and Google as public utilities has been highlighted by some on the left[2] as hypocritical. Strict government regulation of a business? Sounds socialistic. But it is getting renewed attention as those companies come under increased fire over their data practices, allegations of bias against conservatives, and foreign actors using the platforms to attempt to manipulate elections. Such regulation has been pushed by people on both the right and the left, albeit for differing reasons. The former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon[3] is one of its most prominent proponents. If these platforms were treated as such, which would require an act of Congress, the government would be able[4] to implement due process regarding the removal of content on the platforms. On Wednesday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, are scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Afterward, Dorsey is set to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Government is 'the only answer in this case'The Fox News host Tucker Carlson, a proponent of more stringent regulation of Facebook and Google, told Business Insider last year that a reason tech regulation had not gained more traction on the right was that Republicans \"have a gut-level resistance to criticizing corporations.\" \"They're raised that way, and they just can't quite bring themselves to do it,\" he said. But he added: \"Given the choice between a Democratic government overreaching and a private company overreaching, I would take the government any day of the week because at least there are mechanisms with which to hold it accountable.\" Though it would be difficult to convince mainstream Republicans that government must get involved, Carlson said \"that's the only answer in this case.\" The Fox anchor, who has held multiple segments on the subject over the past year, said that if the Trump administration was \"smart, they'd make this a signature issue.\" In recent weeks, Trump and conservatives[5] have zeroed in on[6] big tech. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-social-media-twitter-google-conservatives-36666aab-b1ca-47cc-84eb-7a96b1ce4579.htmlA\">https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-social-media-twitter-google-conservatives-36666aab-b1ca-47cc-84eb-7a96b1ce4579.htmlA</url> 'ridiculous idea'Most conservatives are averse to such extreme measures, though they want Silicon Valley to take seriously their concerns about bias. \"Conservatives simply want these tech companies to be clear and transparent about their policies and algorithms because right now when they look at Silicon Valley, all they see is double standards,\" Andy Surabian, an adviser to Donald Trump Jr. who previously served as a special assistant at the White House, told Business Insider. Experts, however, have sought to pump the brakes on any consideration of big tech being faced with such a high level of government involvement. \"Treating these nascent digital services as regulated utilities would harm consumer welfare because public utility regulation has traditionally been the archenemy of innovation and competition,\" Adam Thierer, a senior research fellow at George Mason University, wrote in 2012[7]. Harry First, a New York University law professor and expert in antitrust law, told Business Insider last year that calls for these companies to be regulated as public utilities was an over-the-top solution to problems that could be addressed otherwise with specific enforcement of laws already on the books. Some voices in the political center have also expressed doubt about such regulation. Mark Cuban, the owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks and star of ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" told Business Insider in an email that he had \"never seen a public utility that has competitors that can be started with a laptop, an internet connection and a free hosting account.\" \"That's not to say that regulation shouldn't be an option,\" he continued, saying they were \"indirectly regulated\" through copyright law, advertising law, antitrust law, and the Federal Trade Commission. Cuban said the \"first step\" should be to \"aggregate and organize all relevant regulations and come to an understanding of what is already in place.\" \"I think it may be that the regulations are already there, but no one is in charge of managing and enforcing them,\" he added. Evan Siegfried, a Republican strategist and commentator who recently called on Dorsey[8] to engage with him on some of the gripes he said conservatives had with Twitter, called the idea of regulating such platforms as a public utility a \"ridiculous idea.\" Of the increased calls for regulation, he said: \"That's a quick and hard turnaround that seems to be brought about by Trump.\"NOW WATCH: Meet

From India and Australia to France and America - and now the UK, with its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">report</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">from the Digital Competition Expert Panel</url> - politicians have been reckoning with how to mitigate the harms of the world's largest technology platforms. And they all seem to arrive at the same answer: competition is the magic mechanism that will somehow tame the giants, unleash innovation and fix our digital world.</p><p>But what if competition is the problem rather than the solution? After all, it's competition - not size - that demands more data, more attention, more engagement and more profits at all costs. It's competition that demands the tech giants expand. It's competition for ad dollars that drives Google, Facebook and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">Amazon</url> to ignore privacy concerns and expand data collection. It's the struggle to dominate voice interfaces and smart-home data that leads Amazon and Google to aggressively push their surveillance machines into our homes. It's competition for attention that leads apps and platforms to make their products as addictive as possible. It's competition for users and engagement that makes Twitter, Facebook and others turn a blind eye to abuse, fake news and far-right radicalisation. And it's competition over who will be the dominant AI provider that leads the tech giants to constantly colonise new sources of data. The government's efforts to increase competition risk simply aggravating these problems.</p><p>We could go even further and socialise the platforms instead of leaving them in private hands</p><p>So if increasing competition won't hold big tech in check, what will? Too often, discussions about this start and end with government and consumers, and pay little heed to workers. That's a mistake: larger and stronger tech unions can be an important counterbalance to the power of big tech. One area where the lack of competition really matters is in terms of wages: new research suggests that the bigger and more concentrated companies are in a particular industry, the more <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">wages</url> are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">suppressed</url>. </p><p>The right solution is to support efforts to organise tech workers into unions. While still in their early stages, unions of tech workers have already made significant progress in terms of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">improving working conditions</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">blocking tech's cooperation with the surveillance state</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">bringing to light the tech industry's latent sexism and racism</url>. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, for example, has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">made major strides in getting basic rights for gig economy workers</url>.</p><p>A second step would be to regulate social media platforms like the public utilities they are. In an earlier era, governments didn't hesitate to regulate natural monopolies where services provided were essential public goods. It didn't make sense, for instance, to lay down two sets of railroad tracks next to each other in a wasteful and desperate effort to maintain competition. In cases like this, monopolies were recognised as inevitable, but were subject to strict regulations that ensured they worked for the common good and not just private profit. </p><p>Today, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">these regulations could apply to some of the services</url> provided by big tech, and might include rules around who can use the platforms, limits on how the platforms can prioritise their own products on them, restrictions on how these companies can collect and use personal data, and requirements to open up intellectual property or licence patents cheaply. US Senator Elizabeth Warren has, for instance, suggested this recently in her       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">proposals to tackle</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">big</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">tech</url>.</p><p>Or we could go even further and socialise the platforms instead of leaving them in private hands, shifting ownership and control to workers, users and citizens. For example, one of the major problems posed by private ride-sharing apps such as Uber is that they produce negative externalities such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">congestion</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">and air pollution</url>. A publicly owned platform, by contrast, would have a much wider mandate than simply adding more vehicles on to the road. Transport for London (TfL) could build and run a ride-sharing app that enabled low-emission movement across London. And the data from that platform could then be freely shared with other public bodies, ensuring better planning for housing and transportation.</p><p>At a different scale, we could decisively move away from Amazon, Google and Microsoft's control over cloud computing and imagine computing as a basic 21st-century utility. Initiatives such as the European Union's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-digital-competition-report-of-the-digital-competition-expert-panel\">Open Science Cloud</url> demonstrate one model for providing a publicly funded and operated cloud infrastructure. There's no reason why governments shouldn't provide citizens with free access to a public cloud that ensures privacy, security, energy efficiency and equal access for all. Our digital infrastructures should not be left in the hands of profit-seeking monopolies, but instead run democratically for the common good.</p><p>Something needs to be done to rein in the increasing economic and political power of big tech, and fast. But the instinctual liberal belief in the value of competition will exacerbate rather than solve the problems. We need to think bigger if we are to take back control of our digital lives.</p><p> Nick Srnicek is a lecturer in digital economy at King's College London and the author of Platform Capitalism</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-52945840</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYB-8CP1-F021-60FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Now Ruth is demanding social media bosses go to prison if they have inappropriate material on their sites, from images of self-harm to child abuse.</p><p>She said: \"Executives should be held criminally accountable. If child abuse is found on their websites, they should be facing jail.</p><p>\"They should be doing everything they can to bring these things down.\"</p><p>Last year Ruth met with Facebook exec Nick Clegg, who promised to rid the site of harmful material.</p><p>But Ruth, 48, was appalled to learn this week that while Ofcom will finally regulate social media companies, it might NOT be given the power to prosecute execs whose firms fall short.</p><p>Speaking exclusively to The Sun on Sunday, Ruth said: \"Boris Johnson needs to show some backbone on this.</p><p>\"He needs to show he has morals and cares about issues such as children being groomed by paedophiles on social media.</p><p>\"How would he feel if his child had become a victim?

There is no reason why we should allow big tech firms to come in and do whatever they want. That's why we have laws - to protect the public.\"</p><p>Images of self-harm are not the only concern.</p><p>Experts say one in 20 kids have been sent a semi-naked pic online by an adult. Of those, 70 per cent were contacted on Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook.</p><p>NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: \"News on Wednesday that Ofcom would be the country's first internet watchdog, ahead of promised new online harms laws, is a huge step forward.</p><p>\"New laws need to be top of the in-tray for new Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden. Ofcom needs teeth.</p><p>It needs the power to hit firms with hefty fines.</p><p>\"Tech bosses need to be hauled from the boardroom into the courts if they fall foul of the rules.\"</p><p>Ruth, a research nurse from Edinburgh, added: \"I fear these companies will be given nothing more than a slap on the wrist and will continue to do whatever they like. We're not just talking about 'offensive' material.</p><p>\"We're talking about things related to child exploitation and human trafficking. We are talking about child-abuse images. This stuff is illegal in every other domain, so why not on social media? \"If you saw child abuse on TV, that station would be shut down.</p><p>\"But the Government seems willing to let tech firms get away with it.</p><p>\"It is still too easy to access illegal content.

Buffett also added to his sizable stake in struggling IBM. And he said he'd be willing to use his cash hoard to help finance another investors' bid for Yahoo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Berkshire's front man is still the billionaire investor, now 85. But change is afoot at the giant conglomerate, witnessed by a more aggressive move into areas of the market that Buffett once steered clear of -- such as tech stocks -- and increasing signs that decisions on what stocks to buy and sell appear to be shifting to investment lieutenants that Buffett himself brought in a few years back.</p><p>Buffett's Berkshire made big news Monday when it revealed in a regulatory filing that in the first quarter it had built a 9.8 million-share stake in iPhone maker Apple worth nearly $1.1billion at the end of March. But as experts had theorized, and as Buffett confirmed to The Wall Street Journal, the Apple buy was not the work of the <person><nameText>Oracle of Omaha </nameText></person>himself.</p><p>Instead, it was executed by one of the two ex-hedge fund managers he hired a few years ago who now manage a big chunk of Berkshire's stock portfolio.</p><p>Indeed, the Apple stock purchase was likely the brainchild of Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, the money managers Buffett brought in to pick stocks for the conglomerate when he's gone. The addition of the two stock pickers is resulting in a broadening out of the types of stocks Berkshire invests in -- and which ones are jettisoned. Buffett is better known for his own stock picks, which include iconic American companies such as Coca-Cola, American Express and IBM.</p><p>Though Buffett has repeatedly said he has no plans to quit, the fact that the new Apple position has the fingerprints of  Combs or Weschler suggests that the transfer of responsibility on the stock picking side of the business is well underway.</p><p>\"It continues the transition away from Buffett and the broadening of the portfolio away from areas of the market only Buffett is comfortable with,\" says Jeff Matthews, general partner at hedge fund Ram Partners.</p><p>Buffett's name also made headlines over the weekend and early Monday when he confirmed to CNBC that he would consider helping to finance Quicken Loans' <person><nameText>Dan Gilbert's </nameText></person>bid to buy Yahoo. But Buffett admitted that tech is still not his thing and that he would not buy stock in Yahoo.</p><p>\"Yahoo is not the type of thing I'd ever be an equity partner in,\" Buffett told CNBC. \"I don't know the business and wouldn't know how to evaluate it, but if Dan needed financing, with proper terms and protections, we would be a possible financing help.\"</p><p>The biggest Buffett-chosen tech stock investment was IBM, which he bought in mass  in 2011. His IBM stake at the end of the first quarter was $12.3 billion, according to regulatory filings. And despite being underwater on the investment by a sizable amount, Buffett defended his IBM holding at last month's shareholder meeting and added slightly to his position in the just-completed first quarter by about 200,000 shares, according to SEC filings.</p><p>The influence of Combs and Weschler on Berkshire's holdings were apparent when Buffett recently cited Combs' stock investment and positive impression of aerospace parts maker Precision Castparts as a key reason why Buffett made Precision  its biggest acquisition ever, a $37billion deal which closed in January.</p><p>Still, while things are changing at Berkshire, the investment philosophy of buying established companies with staying power and top-flight management at good prices remains very much the same.</p><p>\"Honestly, I don't think (the Apple buy) signifies any dramatic change at Berkshire,\" Matthews says.</p><p>\"(Berkshire is) always looking for investments that they think make sense. And they think Apple makes sense,\" he says.</p><p>What's changing at Berkshire is the people making many of the buy-and-sell decisions.</p><p>\"Buffett is getting less involved in investment decisions, but at the same time Berkshire is still looking for what they consider is good value,\" says Vahan Janjigian, chief investment officer at Greenwich Wealth Management.</p><p>Building a stake in Apple is a sign the new blood at Berkshire is diversifying into parts of the market that Buffett once avoided.</p><p>\"Tech has become such a big part of the economy that it would sound foolish to say I would never invest in tech,\" Janjigian argues. The information technology sector now accounts for 19.8% of the S&amp;P 500 and is the biggest of the 10 major sectors, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. At the end of 2015, the weighting of Berkshire's public tech stock holdings was around 10%, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p><p>And even though Apple is a tech stock, the investment still jibes with Berkshire's time-tested investment philosophy.</p><p>The purchases follow a more than 30% drop in the price of Apple stock since its peak in February 2015.</p><p>Apple now trades at just 10 times earnings -- well below the broad U.S. stock market valuation of 17 times earnings -- and it's not nearly as expensive as some other popular tech stocks selling at much higher P-Es. Apple also is a great brand with a strong management team.</p><p>The Apple purchase \"does tell us that the people making many of the investment decisions at Berkshire are picking more modern and up-to-date names that are much more popular with everyone else,\" Janjigian says. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>graphic AFP/Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-81929787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JSX-WHS1-DYRR-9092-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"909\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Gannett Company, Inc.

But after his family cracked his Google account, they had an incredible amount of information at their -fingertips.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Theo's case - detailed in The Australian's new investigative podcast series The Lighthouse - raises fresh questions about the role the tech giants play when someone goes missing, and if the companies adequately respond to emergency requests for user data. In many cases, hackers have proven more adept than law enforcement and the tech giants themselves when it comes to tracking down missing persons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google was tracking and recording Theo's movements and activities on the far north coast of NSW via his smartphone, an Oppo R17. This meant his family could see he went from Cheeky Monkey's to Cosy Corner on Tallow Beach. It was tracking his -location every 15 seconds after he left Cheeky Monkey's.</p><p>Google's location data is accurate to within 3m for most of Theo's route, and the trove of data from the tech giant included his precise latitudes and longitudes, time-stamped to the millisecond.</p><p>Theo's family could see a whole range of other things as well - what Theo had looked up online, when he'd checked maps and what he was searching on the maps.</p><p>And they couldn't just see information from that night. Google Takeout gave Theo's family his online history for the previous five years.</p><p>The information didn't come from a request to Google, however. It came only when his family figured out his email password and then reset his Google account password.</p><p>Data disclosure Documents seen by The Australian show Google received -emergency requests relating to 18 Australian user accounts between January and June this year, -producing data in 60 per cent of cases.</p><p>Overall it received 2535 user data-disclosure requests relating to Australians, handing over that data about 70 per cent of the time.</p><p>But how quickly did it provide that data and what was the extent of data it provided? Google and police aren't saying.</p><p>\"This is one of the problems with the way the international law enforcement community works,\" says private investigator Ken Gamble.</p><p>\"It's all too slow. There's a lack of direct co-operation between these big tech giants and police.</p><p>\"In life-threatening situations you can't just reach out and get the info in real time.\" In Theo's case, family members say they expected it to take police hours if not days to get information from the tech titans. When there appeared no movement, they did it themselves, but time had been lost.</p><p>The Lighthouse is continuing to investigate Google's role in the case.

In January, I was among many who predicted that Amazon, Google and other big tech giants would be grabbing health care headlines this year as they fought to gain control of the volume of clinical data stored in electronic health records (EHRs). Obviously, the big headlines this year have not focused on big tech but on big challenges surrounding the pandemic.    While we did not predict the coronavirus pandemic, I am confident in forecasting a parallel phenomenon threatening damage to the mental and physical health of physicians and nurses. In the midst of the current health crisis, clinician burnout is rising rapidly \u2014 and health care leaders and technology providers should act now to improve the clinical usability of EHRs.     The Parallel Pandemic    Even before the virus, as many as 45% to 55% of health professionals were suffering from professional burnout, according to a recent opinion piece in the NEJM . I agree with the authors, who noted that Covid-19 is creating a \"parallel pandemic\" for health care workers facing a surge of physical and emotional harm. Not surprisingly, 52% of health care providers who participated in a recent survey by LocumTenens.com reported experiencing increases in stress, burnout or mental health issues due to Covid-19.    Clinician burnout is a serious health concern linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, decreased life expectancy, depression and suicide. It is also associated with poorer patient outcomes, increased risk for patient safety incidents and reduced patient satisfaction.    To fight this parallel pandemic, health care leaders and technology providers should provide physicians and nurses with solutions that reduce the known contributors to burnout. These include cumbersome electronic health record (EHR) systems, inefficient workflows, interoperability issues and the lack of \"clean\" data for efficient decision-making.    Improving EHR Usability    The correlation between burnout rates and EHR usability is well-established. A University of New Mexico study attributed 40% of physician burnout and stress to clinical process design and clinical culture (both of which are impacted by EHRs), while 71% of physicians participating in a Stanford Medicine and Harris Poll survey agreed that EHRs \"greatly contribute\" to physician burnout.    One way to improve EHR usability is to introduce artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies that improve workflows and make patient and problem-specific information more accessible at the point of care. Many EHRs require users to search through multiple screens to find relevant data. Such inefficiencies can decrease clinician productivity and take away from direct patient care.    In addition to my company's technology, another example is Enlitic, which uses deep learning to analyze data to streamline radiology diagnoses by giving doctors better insight into a patient's needs. Another example is Freenome, which uses AI in screenings to detect cancer in its earliest stages.     What clinicians need is access to pertinent details in a patient's chart related to specific problems or diseases. This is critical when treating patients with chronic diseases who have multiple records.    By adding AI-powered technologies, organizations can improve the usability of their existing EHRs. They can use such tools to quickly identify and interpret clinical information from multiple sources to improve patient care and minimize clinician frustration.    Enhancing Interoperability    Another often-discussed challenge for health care providers is the lack of interoperability between clinical systems and health care organizations. In March, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) finalized a set of rules designed to improve interoperability. A month later, HHS announced that enforcement of the rules would be delayed until 2021 . This allowed providers to focus on the immediate health crisis and extended the time to install the necessary infrastructure.    According to 590 health care leaders participating in a recent Black Book survey , the absence of true interoperability has detracted from Covid-19 patient care. Ninety-three percent of the survey participants reported that complete patient health pictures were not reaching downstream Covid-19 clinicians upon admission, which could lead to poorer health outcomes and increased expenditures.    Clinicians, researchers, public health officials and regulatory agencies have an increased need to share critical patient information related to Covid-19, as well as patients' preexisting conditions and medications. Health care professionals do not have time to spend hours a day manually searching through clinical systems to find the information they need.    While health care leaders may have to delay system-wide interoperability enhancements, they can add third-party solutions like the ones above to their existing EHRs to facilitate the transfer and exchange of clinical information. For example, applying mapping tools to certain clinical concepts would result in diagnoses, medications, laboratory tests and similar information becoming standardized within the EHR so users can then gain immediate access to the essential details they need.    Facilitating Clean Data    Clinician frustration and burnout can also be diminished if health care leaders can leverage technology to reduce the tsunami of redundant or irrelevant data in clinical systems. Patient care can be optimized when physicians and nurses have access to a patient's complete medical history.    As we continue to fight Covid-19, we must simultaneously take action to minimize the damaging impact of a parallel pandemic that threatens the well-being of health care professionals. Health care leaders and technology providers should work together to add solutions that enhance the usability of EHRs, improve interoperability, and deliver users clean data that facilitates clinical decision-making.    To help health care leaders choose the right solutions for their organizations, it's essential that they include their providers as part of the process. Including them in the selection and implementation of the technology will avoid frustrations in the future. Health care leaders need to survey providers regarding their existing EHR to uncover the flaws and benefits in order to best determine the needs for additional solutions. Lastly, health care leaders should have an understanding of timelines for how quickly they need the technology to be implemented and the overall budget they have available.

Even ancillary products are dealt with ie: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"Customers who bought [that] also bought [this]\".</emphasis> Business users must now be put on specific notice of this practice and be informed whether their products may also be offered for ancillary purchases.</p><p>Access to data is always a sensitive issue. OISs must now explain in their Ts&amp;Cs whether or not, and if so how, access is granted to personal or other data provided or generated in the course of using the services.</p><p>Most ink is devoted to the area of dispute resolution between OISs and their business users. Provision for both internal complaints procedures and external mediation are now compulsory. And continuing that theme - in another throw back to the GDPR - allowance is made for judicial proceedings to be instituted against OISs on a representative basis, provided these representative organisations meet certain basic hygiene criteria.</p><p>The European Commission has clearly been exercised by the potentially unhealthy dependence business users have on intermediation services</p><p>The European Commission has clearly been exercised by the potentially unhealthy dependence business users have on intermediation services and the unfair commercial practices lurking within these.

According to the leak, a large part of the plan would involve having the FCC, which has no real authority in this area, police speech on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Most legal experts I've spoken to say the plan is illegal and utterly nonsensical, and the FCC has no authority to do this under Section 230[3] or anywhere else. The order would also undermine most of the logic the Pai FCC used in its effort to repeal net neutrality. </p><p>Oddly though, an FCC that has been very vocal on this subject when convenient has been oddly mute since the story broke, with none of the agency's three Republican Commissioners (Ajit Pai, Brendan Carr, or Mike O'Rielly) making so much as a peep about the terribleness of the latest Trump \"plan.\" This kind of silence is uncharacteristic. O'Rielly, for example, was positively apoplectic recently when he proclaimed (falsely) that community broadband posed a dire threat to free speech[4]. Carr has similarly expressed great disdain[5] previously at the idea of government regulating speech on social media platforms, and hyperventilates over telecom sector free speech rights any time someone even faintly suggests giants like Comcast should be regulated: The First Amendment operates as a restraint on the government. Disappointed that my Democrat FCC colleagues now invoke it as a basis for infringing the free speech rights of entities we regulate. \u2014 Brendan Carr (@BrendanCarrFCC) June 6, 2019[6]Then there's Pai, who attacked net neutrality extensively by insisting it was the equivalent of the Fairness Doctrine, the exact type of solution Trump is now proposing for social media. Pai has routinely tried to play both sides of this debate, insisting he's a stalwart defender of free speech, yet demonizing platforms like Twitter for nonexistent censorship[7] when it makes for a good sound byte. He's also repeatedly stated we can't possibly hold bumbling monopolies like AT...nd Comcast accountable on the state or federal level because it would violate their First Amendment rights[8] (a belief those companies share[9]). All of this endless hand wringing over free speech, and yet when the President of the United States says he wants to use the FCC to police speech on social media (again with near zero authority to do so), all three of these free speech patriots are suddenly quiet. And while you could argue that they didn't comment because the plan hasn't been made official yet, that didn't stop them from loudly deriding a similarly undercooked, leaked plan by the Trump administration to nationalize the nation's 5G networks[10]. That plan was largely just the lobbyist brain fart of a Peter Thiel-backed company named Rivada Networks[11] (supported by folks like Karl Rove and Newt Gingrich), yet Carr, O'Rielly, and Pai all had plenty[12] to say[13] about the unworkability of that plan (largely because such a plan is AT...nd Verizon's worst nightmare). The trio's fellow commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel offered up what was probably the most concise reaction to having the FCC police Facebook and Twitter: What. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/wLFD0aQHJf\">https://t.co/wLFD0aQHJf</url>[14] \u2014 Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) August 9, 2019[15]As many have surmised this could all amount to a giant hill of bupkis. The administration may have just been floating a trial balloon that has now, clearly, popped. After all, in the Trump era you can never tell what's serious policy and what's the passing brain fart of whoever has the President's ear at one particular moment. Still, you'd think a trio of FCC Commissioners who proclaim to be champions of free speech would have had something to say about the plan given the scale of its stupidity. Yet they've refused to issue any comment whatsoever after more than a week. It's almost as if they're not actually being ideologically consistent, and are remaining mute simply out of blind partisan allegiance and support of Trump's clearly idiotic plan to blame social media for the fact that many people just can't stop being grifting assholes on the internet[16]; a plan the telecom industry not coincidentally supports[17] as it tries to edge in on their slice of online ad revenues.Permalink[18] | Comments[19] | Email This Story[20] [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url

Though its long-term ramifications are yet to be fully felt and understood, the events that transpired and the adjustments that had to be made during this pandemic cemented technology as the core building block in the re-emerging financial infrastructure of the economy, generally, and the financial services industry, in particular.While the pace of change was rapid, these recent events revealed that technology had been woven into the fabric of the financial services industry, even before the crisis. Therefore, the crisis should mark the end of any debate or discussion about the need for digital \"transformation\" in the financial sector. Rather, all industry stakeholders\u2014financial institutions, regulators, fintech companies, and third-party service providers\u2014must work together to optimize and accelerate the use of technological applications in the delivery of financial services to customers by:1) Reimagining the new operating model for a financial institution2) Reassessing engagement with third-party technology providers3) Reasserting a commitment to compliance and the effective use of 'RegTech'4) Reexamining cybersecurity controls5) Reassessing and updating business continuity and data recovery plans6) Practicing co-evolution, a process that emphasizes collaboration over competitionFinally, in order for the use of technology to be optimized and accelerated, regulators must embrace the use of technology for supervisory and oversight purposes. </p><p>While the scope of these actions may at first blush appear to be ambitious, we believe that they are imperative. These actions are not needed to simply achieve a seamless and harmonious melding of technology and financial services, but rather to ensure that the delivery of financial services by financial institutions occurs in a manner that is consistent with the opportunities and challenges of our times.'Transform' (\\ tran(t)s-\u02c8f\u022frm\\): to change in character or condition.'Based on the events that transpired in reaction to this pandemic and the changes that occurred[1], there is ample evidence that the financial services industry has been transformed with the power of technology. The pandemic crisis forced the financial services industry to launch new capabilities, new ways of doing business and operating, new methods to cope with demands, and new tools to deal with ever-growing compliance requirements that had to be adapted to the sudden surge of the digital channel.For the financial services industry, the discussion about the need for a cohesive and purposeful digital transformation strategy had been raging for years. Then COVID-19 happened! And the pace of change was beyond anyone's expectations and imagination. Financial institutions, which traditionally had long-term plans to scale their digital strategy, had to readjust and deal with a new reality where change happened virtually overnight. The future of digital adoption and use of technology became an immediate reality and an urgent necessity. Physical channels shut down, customers transitioned to digitally consuming financial services, and the workforce transitioned to remote working by leveraging cloud-based services and collaboration tools and infrastructure. Operational and financial workloads shifted (in part) to running in the cloud, and compliance functions had to be optimized and scaled for the online and digital world powered by data analytics, AI, and machine learning. Many fintech companies (e.g., neo-banks, lenders, and payment companies) saw growth during this time of crisis, driven by demands from consumers needing virtual and remote access to financial services. Whether the financial services industry was ready or not, change in character or condition happened; transformation happened\u2014and it happened with unimaginable speed and suddenness.Out of these challenging times and this unexpected real-life 'stress test,' several lessons and considerations are emerging. They require a change in the way all stakeholders\u2014financial institutions, their regulators, and fintech companies\u2014manage and navigate digital optimization and acceleration while working towards a more intelligent and resilient industry. We will explore these lessons and considerations in the hope to provide a clearer path from transformation to digital optimization and acceleration. The End of Digital 'Transformation' Declaring the end of digital transformation in the financial services industry does not mean that the industry has reached a perfectly harmonious and utopian fusion of technology and financial services. It is a declaration that this pandemic crisis ended any debate that technology is and will always be an integral part of financial services. They are and will always be inseparably intertwined.In 1989\u2014two years before the collapse of the Soviet Union\u2014Francis Fukuyama, an American political economist and historian, published his controversial article \"The End of History.' In it, he argued that the struggle over political ideologies, which propelled history for centuries, has ended because the debate over which form of government should prevail should end. With that, there is no longer a challenger to capitalism and liberal democracy. Many decried the article as a premature victory lap. For Fukuyama, it was not a declaration of an ideal form of government but an important historical evolutionary and factual event.In a similar vein, this pandemic and epidemiological crisis should mark the end of the debate over the role of technology in the financial services industry, the end of the discussion of the \"need to transform,\" and the end of the sluggish pace of technology adoption that has marred the financial industry for years. Transformation happened and the transformation phase should lead to a phase of intense technology optimization, accelerated deployment, and usage in the financial services industry.For years, the discussion and debate around the role of technology in the financial industry constantly intensified with the emergence of every new technology and with the rise of fintech companies that looked to disrupt the financial sector leveraging technology. Many declared the demise of incumbent financial institutions because of their inability to adapt to the technology-driven world. Financial institutions of all sizes have been devising long-term strategies for technology adoption and have been investing\u2014some more than others\u2014in technology modernization. Every year was declared the 'year of the fintech,\" and every few months, a new article gets published announcing that \"Big Tech\" will take over the financial sector.Yet, with the crisis, the financial lives of most people around the world transitioned in a surprisingly orderly fashion. So far, the integrity of financial markets and the stability of the financial system, while still facing challenges and vulnerabilities, continues to withstand this unprecedent turbulence, due in no small part to technology. Recent surveys, studies, and data have shown that many financial institutions digitally transitioned their services. Payment, clearing and settlement, wholesale funding, insurance services, capital markets, lending, and other essential financial services moved to the cyberworld somewhat seamlessly. This transition is due to the fact that, prior to the pandemic, many institutions were already working (but by no means completed) on improving their data management structure, modernizing core infrastructure, embracing AI, and utilizing the cloud. These financial institutions already started a journey of modernization to optimize experiences, operations, compliance, and productivity (including resiliency and security).Financial institutions with a clear strategy have made technology a core capability in their growth plans\u2014not because their goal is to become a technology company but because they know that financial services must be powered by technology if they are to survive. Meanwhile, many fintech companies are seeing double-digit growth because they have already made technology a core mechanism for delivering needed financial services to customers. Also, Big Tech companies have proven to be critical partners to financial institutions by providing them with critical and essential technologies that will propel the financial institutions' innovation and growth. To date, the business model for Big Tech has emphasized collaboration over competition.[3] A new financial digital world emerged and is being stress tested.So, why continue to emphasize 'transformation' when change has already occurred as a result of these historical events? The industry has, in effect, already undergone a real-life stress test of its new technological infrastructure. The Ultimate Stress Test and the Silver Lining Billions were spent on digital transformation over the past few years.[3] Many initiatives were considered unsuccessful or some are still at such an early stage that their value has not been fully realized. Despite the enormous investments on technology modernization, most of the digital transformation initiatives were multi-year journeys aimed at rearchitecting the financial institutions' data infrastructure: introducing data analytics, modernizing a fragmented and old core infrastructure, embracing cloud and hybrid cloud services, or starting to leverage AI and machine learning in a variety of use cases. However, progress against the goals of these initiatives stalled or took significantly longer than expected to implement. This happened for many reasons, including the complexity of the infrastructure, the challenges associated with modernizing legacy systems, the difficulties in amassing the right internal talent to navigate such a transformational initiative, and the enormous costs needed, especially in light of shrinking margins.[4]Progress towards digital adoption and usage was slow with little or no imminent need to accelerate it. Many financial institutions lacked the sense of urgency to accelerate digital adoption and usage despite the advocacy by many technology companies and industry consultants for such acceleration. The institutions' strategies were seen as reactionary and were being implemented only to respond to shifting customer demands and competitive threats from fintech companies, despite evidence that the adoption and use of technology could improve the financial institution's operational efficiencies and help reduce its costs. Many of the digital initiatives did not have aggressive timetables and failed to prioritize implementation.Another reason for the sluggish pace of digital transformation is the lack of regulatory pressures and requirements on financial institutions to integrate and accelerate the use of digital tools and capabilities. Unlike capital and liquidity requirements and controls, as well as other safety and soundness measures, the use and adoption of technology is not driven by regulations. Pressure, if any, to implement a digital strategy was driven by market and customer demands, rather than by regulatory mandate. Typically, regulators exercise their supervisory powers over these institutions through various means, including by periodically stress testing the resilience of these institutions to adverse market developments. Such regulatory-mandated requirements and tests lead to the urgency behind the institutions' implementation of controls and their strict prioritization of implementation.However, when it comes to technology adoption and usage in the financial services industry, there is neither a regulatory mandate nor a stress test to validate its effectiveness. It is a discretionary initiative left to the institutions to run, if they so choose, and to judge its extent and effectiveness. Arguably, the limited regulatory guidance that existed in the area of technological innovation and application focuses on the preservation of the regulatory status quo, rather than a parallel innovation with respect to regulatory oversight itself.The pandemic crisis put an end to the lack of urgency and may prove to be the ultimate stress test for the financial institutions' digital transformation strategies and initiatives. Several research studies, customer surveys, and market analyses seem to indicate that despite some expected challenges and misses, the financial services industry has transitioned effectively to the digital world and is evolving its operations and business model to manage the new normal, whatever that may be. Immediately after the declaration of public health emergencies, regulators across the globe issued guidance designating technology providers who provide the infrastructure for core processing, online and mobile banking, settlement activities, and other financial services as 'critical infrastructure' for essential services. Regulators also asked the institutions to closely examine their disaster recovery and business continuity plans and prioritize the coordination with their technology and cloud providers[6]. The fact that the financial sector did not experience major service disruptions or interruption presents further evidence that, for the most part, the industry has successfully transformed to a digital industrial architecture, even before the crisis.Meanwhile, this stress test also validated the critical role that fintech companies play in the financial life of customers, individuals, and enterprises. As mentioned before, many fintech companies saw double-digit growth in terms of customers and transactions during this pandemic and several are playing critical roles in the economic recovery efforts, whether through enabling faster and safer cross-border remittances or providing small business loans under various economic stimulus efforts. During this crisis, these companies, born and raised in technology, effectively complemented the role that traditional financial institutions play and proved that coexistence and collaboration may be the path towards a more resilient and more intelligent sector powered by technology.Unfortunately, and inevitably, every major crisis\u2014whether it is economic in nature, a war, or a pandemic\u2014will result in casualties both within the financial system and more broadly throughout the economy. These crises tend to eliminate the weakest institutions in the market or the ones who fail to adapt. The 'hopelessly unadapted'[7] institutions\u2014those who failed to launch their digital journey for whatever reason\u2014will likely not be able to withstand the stress of this crisis given the economic strain that banks were already under even before this pandemic. This crisis may have accelerated the demise of certain institutions which were already late on their digital transformation journey. Several more cannot fiscally withstand a prolonged economic slowdown, deal with rapidly shrinking margins, and are dealing with historically low interest rates.[8]Learning from the stress test, the mistakes of some institutions, and best practices from post-mortem change management principles, the following are some of the lessons and considerations that may provide a clearer path from transformation to digital optimization and acceleration for the financial services industry. Lessons From the Stress Test and Considerations for the New Reality 'Optimize' (\\ \u02c8p-t\u0259-\u02ccm\u012bz \\): to make as perfect, effective, or functional as possible.'The crisis has shown that financial institutions and fintech companies can cope and actually grow in the post-crisis new normal, at unprecedent speed. To build on the evolutionary momentum, leverage the learnings from the crisis, and make the financial industry as effective or functional as possible in the face of this digitally transformed reality, there are some key considerations and imperatives for all affected stakeholders: Reimagine the New Operating Model. Digital transformation is more than just the deployment of technology-powered tools and capabilities. With the shift that just occurred, institutions need to examine and redesign their operational processes and business models in light of new experiences and digital tools being used. A deeper alignment of digital, business, and operational strategies is needed to, among other things, (a) enhance the emerging customer experience and meet the demands of the new customer-engagement model, (b) empower the workforce, and (c) re-imagine product/service development and deployment cycles. Reassess Engagement With Technology Providers. In light of their recent pandemic-related experiences, institutions should relaunch their due diligence exercise with their technology providers to reassess how these providers fit into their evolving risk management framework, their long-term business strategy, and their digital optimization plans. A new heightened level of due diligence, oversight, and performance assessment is required in light of the massive shift to the digital channel, recognizing that the level of oversight will vary depending on the systemic importance of a particular use of each technological application. Financial institutions will need to allocate trained and qualified resources to perform the oversight and management functions, access appropriate information and data from providers for monitoring purposes (e.g., availability history, service disruptions, outages, and scheduled maintenance times), agree on key performance indicators regarding the provider's commitment around resiliency, scalability and/or capacity, and establish regular monitoring performance cadence and rhythm. Considering how integral technology is to the institutions' functions and new operations, there is a need for a deeper integration and collaboration between a financial institution and its third-party service providers to manage expectations regarding every aspect of the business including capacity management, scalability, and resiliency of the systems and infrastructure. Reassert Commitment to Compliance and Double Down on RegTech. The way that financial institutions are conducting business, operating processes, interacting with customers, and launching products and services has changed significantly. With this change comes the need to reassess how the digital shift and the new virtual environment is affecting current compliance controls and processes. For instance, are AML controls relating to customer authentication and due diligence scalable to meet the massive shift to digital and mobile banking? Financial institutions should take a closer look at technology to continue to optimize and accelerate their compliance controls and systems and therefore continue to keep pace with the ever-evolving regulatory changes and requirements and the newly emerging cyber risks and schemes. Furthermore, institutions should take a closer look at how their data and that of their customers is being used and how technology is affecting its scope of use, storage, and movement, especially when a third-party technology provider is involved. For instance, a financial institution should be fully aware of where data is held when in the cloud, which laws and regulations control if the data is hosted and stored overseas, and how technology providers are using and accessing the institution's data. With respect to AI/ML systems developed by third-party providers, the institutions need to keep a closer eye on the functioning of the algorithm and take accountability for the outputs of the AI/ML system to ensure its proper legal and ethical deployment and usage. Reexamine Cybersecurity Controls. The institutions and their providers must strive to evolve their cybersecurity policies and procedures to mitigate the increased risk in going virtual. The use of encryption technology that meets or exceeds international standards to protect and secure the data at all times (whether in storage or in transit), or the use of multi-factor authentication (i.e., requiring users to undergo multiple validation procedures to gain access to the service) to limit access to data, should be a given and should span the institutions and their providers. Meanwhile, the cybersecurity strategy should be reexamined to ensure that not only the technology is adequate to provide a strong line of defense, but that the security team is fully staffed, qualified (with the right technology experience), and scalable to meet the growing demands. Institutions should ensure that any technology provider with which it contracts is appropriately protecting confidential information both in transit and at rest by maintaining robust security measures that meet or exceed international standards. Financial institutions should also have in place processes to ensure effective monitoring for security threats and a comprehensive response mechanism to such threats. At a minimum, institutions need to ascertain that the provider (and the technology) is appropriately certified and maintains robust security measures and security policies, and that such security and privacy controls are aligned with the international standards and controls like the ones set out in the SOC 1 and SOC 2 assessment frameworks. Reassess and Update Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plans. The events of the crisis were a blunt reminder of the critical need for practical and operational business continuity plans. The financial services institutions needed to digitally scale suddenly and with minimal risks of downtime or service disruption. Institutions also realized very quickly that their business continuity and disaster recovery plans depend to a great extent on the plans of the technology providers, especially cloud providers and collaboration tools providers. A reexamination of data backup processes and frequency, support systems, incident response plans, redundant infrastructure, scalability and resiliency of systems, and capacity are critical steps in the optimization of the technology infrastructure and systems. Practice Coevolution. Niall Ferguson, in The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the Worlduses the term 'coevolution' in the context of financial services. He defined it as an instance where different species work and adapt together. Formally, 'coevolution' is defined as 'an evolution involving successive changes in two or more interdependent species (as of a plant and its pollinators) that affect their interactions.' The crisis has shown that the opportunity to coevolve in the financial industry is greater than ever. Traditional financial institutions, fintech companies, and technology providers have an unprecedented opportunity to come together and complement each other to optimize and accelerate the digitization of the financial services industry. The speed of change requires a closer examination of opportunities for financial institutions and fintech companies to partner to achieve the scale, speed-to-market, and technology prowess needed to meet the digital demands of customers, among other goals. Meanwhile, technology companies will continue to collaborate with institutions and fintech companies rather than compete with them or try to displace them. Together, these entities will accelerate innovation in a compliant manner, through greater technology scale, new approach to design and deployment, and the building of a robust culture of compliance. Coevolution should replace a culture of distrust between these 'species' and should prove to be an opportunity to allow institutions, regardless of their size or their IT or R&amp;#38;D budgets, to accelerate their path to digital optimization. For fintech companies it is an opportunity to partner with institutions that can bring scale, core competencies in financial services, and a robust culture of compliance.For regulators, the acceleration of transformation and the transition to technology optimization means a need to adapt and accelerate their own use of technology. They need to keep pace with the increased workload of compliance oversight in this virtual world. Now more than ever, regulators need to use technology to effectively and efficiently conduct their supervisory and oversight functions, an area commonly referred to as 'SupTech.' Available SupTech solutions, such as data analytics tools and AI systems or other infrastructure, do and will enable regulators to scale and continue to provide the critical supervision functions. The need for investment by public agencies and governments and the need to hire the qualified talent to support the evolution of the regulatory functions is more important and urgent than ever. Final Thoughts 'Accelerate' (\\ ik-\u02c8se-l\u0259-\u02ccr\u0101t , ak- \\): to move faster: to gain speed.'The end of digital transformation is exciting and hopefully will mark the beginning of the phases of optimization and acceleration of technology adoption, deployment, and acquisition in financial services. The crisis became a function that forced the industry to move beyond traditional and stale business models\u2014financial institutions had to shift to new ways of working to meet customers' needs. Technology allowed the shift to a new way of doing financial business and has forever been intertwined with financial services. We have a long way to go to achieve the seamless and harmonious melding of technology and financial services. Yet the events of the past few months forced an unexpected acceleration, the momentum of which can propel our financial lives into the new normal.Endnotes[1] By way of example, according to Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), new mobile banking registrations in April increased by 200% with mobile banking traffic increasing by 85%.

From groceries to cleaning supplies, shipments from Amazon have become lifelines for many who are steering clear of supermarkets and other physical retail stores. Company executives have likened the surge in demand to the annual holiday shopping crush.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But e-commerce isn't the only sector where Amazon is booming. Analysts say its cloud business, Amazon Web Services, faces higher demand as people turn to some of its biggest clients -- from Zoom to Netflix -- for work and play. Amazon sells access to audiobooks and original television programs that are helping to entertain reluctant shut-ins. And with more people staying home, that's more time they have to engage with Amazon's AI-powered smart speakers. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The breadth of Amazon's sprawling business interests, and its increasingly central place in America's fragile supply chain, underscores the company's hold on consumers --- and its potential to solidify its dominance in the coming months. The longer this crisis goes on, the more formidable Amazon will become, according to James Bailey, a management professor at George Washington University's business school.</p><p>\"Every crisis creates a void,\" said Bailey. \"And whatever force fills that void, inherits power.\"</p><p>Amazon isn't the only company that could benefit. The crisis appears to be lifting the entire e-commerce industry, according to Bank of America research, which showed the sector grew 16% in March compared to a year ago. Those consumer habits could persist even after the crisis passes, marking a potential tidal wave of change benefiting Amazon's bottom line for years to come. </p><p>But thanks to its existing advantages in scale and efficiency, Amazon stands to emerge from the pandemic stronger than many of its competitors, experts say. In light of the pandemic, Amazon could pull in as much as an additional $4 billion in revenue this year, though added costs of managing the pandemic may cut into Amazon's profits, said Bank of America in an investor note last week.</p><p>Amazon's expanded importance is even being felt in Washington, where CEO Jeff Bezos, a frequent target of President Donald Trump, has been in frequent communication with the White House since the outbreak began. With Amazon doing its part to smooth an already turbulent economic situation, Trump needs Bezos more than ever. </p><p>But now that it's been laid bare, the world's dependence on Amazon may only reinforce questions policymakers were asking before the current crisis about whether the company is too powerful.</p><p>Prime positioning</p><p>The most visible changes in demand for Amazon services have, unsurprisingly, taken place in its core online retail business. The company that built its reputation on ultra-fast deliveries is now experiencing uncharacteristically long wait times to ship many products, including hand sanitizer, toilet paper and digital thermometers.</p><p>Amazon spokespeople including Jay Carney, senior vice president of global corporate affairs, have compared the volume they're witnessing to peak holiday shopping periods. Last week, Amazon said in a blog post that it's nearly finished hiring an additional 100,000 workers to \"help meet demand.\"</p><p>But these boom times aren't without further challenges. For example, Amazon has had to battle price gouging on its platform. Amid questions from lawmakers and attorneys general about the practice, Amazon has said it is using a mix of manual and automated reviews of its platform to catch thousands of price gougers, and reporting them to the authorities. \"Amazon has zero tolerance for price gouging,\" the company said in a blog post last week.</p><p>The crunch is affecting front-line workers, too, some of whom anticipate Amazon could need even more hands as workers continue to fall ill or need to quarantine themselves. More than a dozen Amazon facilities have now been hit by the coronavirus, and some workers have staged walkouts to protest what they say are insufficient protections on the job. </p><p>\"It's getting backed up,\" one employee who works at Amazon's facility in Staten Island, JFK8, told CNN in an interview. \"There's not enough employees to move this stuff.\" The worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job, said so many of his colleagues have taken paid or unpaid coronavirus leave that the fulfillment center now resembles \"a ghost town.\"</p><p>Amazon didn't respond to questions about possible worker shortages, but has said in statements that its workers \"are heroes fighting for their communities and helping people get critical items they need in this crisis.\" </p><p>Meanwhile, employees at JFK8 and other facilities around the country have complained of inconsistent temperature-check screenings, limited cleaning supplies and having to work in close quarters despite Amazon's own social distancing guidelines. The company has said it's tripled its cleaning efforts in fulfillment centers and that previously ordered facemasks are starting to become available for employees.</p><p>The complaints about Amazon's safety protections reflect the enormous pressure the company is under to keep delivering packages during the crisis --- and how vital the platform has become. </p><p>Powering the internet</p><p>For all of the focus on Amazon's e-commerce business, it's the company's cloud services unit that makes most of the company's profit. Financial filings show that Amazon Web Services --- which runs the websites of many consumer-facing businesses --- accounted for 63% of Amazon's operating income last year.</p><p>Now, as usage of popular digital applications has grown amid the pandemic, that's meant added usage of the Amazon cloud platform that supports them, too. </p><p>\"You're seeing surges in things like Slack, Zoom, Fortnite, Netflix --- all clients of AWS,\" said Justin Post, an industry analyst at Bank of America. \"The activity levels for some of their clients are through the roof.\"</p><p>Like many of Amazon's subsidiaries, AWS declined to comment for this story. But the range of businesses Amazon owns demonstrates its reach. It has invested tremendously in Whole Foods and a separate grocery delivery service, Amazon Fresh, Post said, both of which are now poised to benefit massively from a population that's increasingly avoiding brick-and-mortar supermarkets.</p><p>\"The timing is really interesting,\" Post said.</p><p>Filling the downtime void</p><p>Just as Amazon faces an unprecedented kind of demand for physical goods, it also stands to benefit from a growing appetite for digital services as people seek to stay sane indoors.</p><p>Amazon owns Audible, the audiobook marketplace. Last month, Audible made a selection of hundreds of audiobooks accessible for free as part of its response to the pandemic. Since launching Audible Stories on March 19, traffic to the site has spiked. The new offering has received \"millions of daily visitors\" from around the world, Matthew Thornton, the head of global corporate affairs for Audible, told CNN.</p><p>Meanwhile, a surge in digital entertainment may be boosting YouTube and Netflix, but also Amazon's Twitch, the popular online platform where users can watch livestreams of other people playing video games. In recent weeks, the company confirmed to CNN, traffic and viewership on Twitch have risen across the board, particularly on channels linked to music and sports. With the cancellation of live sports, numerous professional basketball and football players have taken to streaming themselves playing games including \"Call of Duty\" and \"NBA 2K.\" </p><p>Before the pandemic, Twitch was already among the 10 most popular video streaming services on the entire internet, according to the market research firm Sandvine. Now, facing higher demand, the company has had to downgrade its video quality in Europe, following in the footsteps of YouTube and Facebook. </p><p>Amazon's influence will likely exert itself in other ways, too, some more noticeable than others. Having exhausted Netflix's catalog, Americans may soon gorge themselves on Amazon's original television series, or buy more e-books for their Kindles. Cooped up inside, those with Amazon smart speakers may now be setting cooking timers more often, or asking their devices to play more music --- giving Amazon even more behavioral data and speech samples it can use to hone its services to anticipate our every need. </p><p>Playing to Amazon's strengths</p><p>What makes Amazon particularly suited for our current moment isn't just its ability to serve people's needs remotely, or its massive customer base. It's that those things help make Amazon the most well-oiled retail machine on earth, creating positive feedback loops where the more efficient it is, the more attractive it becomes. </p><p>Consumers have little time or money to waste; that was certainly true before the pandemic, but is even more so now. That means the crisis may very well cement Amazon's power further --- and at the expense of rivals that are less efficient or can't outlast the crisis, said Kevin Arquit, an antitrust lawyer at the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres. </p><p>\"It plays right into Amazon's strengths,\" he said.</p><p>Pound for pound, Amazon is better equipped than its competitors to weather the pandemic, Arquit said, because its wealth, scale and supplier relationships translate into the most valuable trait of all in a crisis: resilience. As smaller or less nimble businesses close up shop, in some cases for good, it's large incumbents like Amazon that will likely win out, he said.</p><p>Until a few weeks ago, Amazon's staying power wasn't being hailed as essential. Instead, it found itself on the front lines of a very different battle --- one in which policymakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren were accusing large tech platforms of abusing their dominance. Warren and others have called for Amazon to be broken up and to face tough new regulations designed to rein in the power of Silicon Valley. She has specifically targeted Amazon, saying that by sharing its marketplace with third-party sellers, it is playing as both the umpire and the owner of the home team. </p><p>Those concerns haven't gone away. In fact, amid the outbreak, some policymakers may be even more attuned now to Amazon's power over Americans' lives. In their recent letter to Amazon, nearly three dozen states and the District of Columbia wrote that despite the company's efforts to curb price gouging, it had failed to de-list \"unconscionably priced critical supplies\" that Americans need, such as hand sanitizer. Federal lawmakers have expressed similar worries.</p><p>Paul Gallant, an industry analyst at the firm Cowen &amp; Co., said in an investor note Wednesday that the pandemic has temporarily blunted the onslaught of criticism that faced Big Tech just months ago --- and that many dominant platforms are now likely \"benefiting from new public awareness of how difficult remote life would be without them.\"</p><p>But, he warned, the federal government's scrutiny of large, dominant tech platforms continues --- on Capitol Hill, at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Those investigations may result in reports or even lawsuits that may not be favorable to those businesses, he said.</p><p>With Americans relying more on Amazon than ever, it's a reminder of how pervasive its influence is, and how limited the constraints are on its growth.</p><p>\"This [pandemic] will move the status quo to even more demand for online shopping, which obviously benefits Amazon, the largest player,\" said Arquit. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Aside from possibly bringing together more wealth than ever before assembled in a congressional hearing, the event marks a triumph for a nascent movement of antitrust scholars who have revived the debate about concentrated economic power in the United States. Members of Congress will be able to detail how large tech platforms abuse their position to invade user privacy, muscle out or buy up competitors, and gouge suppliers and partners-behaviors that ultimately damage innovation and exacerbate inequality.</p><p><br/>These problems have only grown worse with the coronavirus pandemic, as smaller businesses succumb to the economic damage, and changing patterns in teleworking and retail accelerate in ways that make Americans more reliant on technologies produced by a few firms.

The truth is that, even if Congress somehow decreed the breakup of all four tech giants, the U.S. would still have an astounding number of industries controlled by a tiny number of firms. That's because the structure of modern capitalism favors companies that operate at once-unimaginable scale, in the absence of a government will to prevent monopolies from forming.<br/>Lawmakers and the public should be concerned about the surveillance networks by which Facebook and Google-which dominate the digital-advertising market-track users, build data profiles on them, and serve them customized ads. But millions of rural Americans cannot access the internet to begin with, in part because telecom companies harass, fight, and induce state legislatures to pass laws restricting municipal broadband. Across America, people send their kids to Starbucks parking lots to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/technology/parking-lots-wifi-coronavirus.html\">piggyback on the wifi</url> and complete their homework.<br/>Amazon's rapidly expanding e-commerce empire-and the potential consequences for Main Streets and municipal tax bases across the country-is definitely worth worrying about.

Forty years ago, the government essentially stopped policing industry concentration. The conservative legal theorist Robert Bork-later a failed Supreme Court nominee-and his allies in the law-and-economics movement argued that any merger making businesses more efficient must be approved, and that a larger scale generally increases efficiency. Bork's analysis gained enormous power in the courts and the Reagan administration. The lawyers and the bankers who handled mergers and acquisitions loved it.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/02/antimonopoly-big-business/514358/?utm_source=feed\">Read: America's monopolies are holding back the economy</url>]<br/>All Americans suffer from the wave of corporate consolidation that followed. Workers have fewer bidders for their labor and cannot secure decent wages. The number of start-up businesses has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/declining-business-dynamism-in-the-united-states-a-look-at-states-and-metros/\">plummeted</url> since the late 1970s. Products and services grow worse, and companies with little competition have no incentive to improve them. Concentrated supply chains are more vulnerable to disruption, as the coronavirus crisis has shown. Fewer firms shovel more economic gains to smaller groups of executives. Politics becomes unbalanced as monopolists bend lawmakers and regulators to their will. In a variety of industries, the pandemic has added to the burden on small companies while heightening the advantages enjoyed by their larger rivals that can afford to wait the catastrophe out.<br/>The unique challenges presented by Big Tech at least receive generous media coverage. But headlines about the damage non-tech behemoths have done are waiting to be written. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-booker-open-investigation-into-meatpackers-manipulation-of-covid-19-crisis-to-raise-prices-and-exploit-workers\">investigating a budding scandal</url> of large meatpackers using the coronavirus crisis to claim shortages at home while shipping record levels of pork to China. A decades-long consolidation of the banking industry was routinely justified in the name of consumer welfare, but millions of Americans are still unserved-a problem that became evident amid America's fumbling delivery of stimulus payments to citizens. Market concentration is an <url normalizedValue=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/marchaprilmay-2017/the-decline-of-black-business/\">underappreciated factor</url> in the destruction of Black-owned businesses.<br/>Prohibiting mergers and breaking up companies that contribute to such negative effects would allow America to be governed democratically, rather than by the corporate boardroom. Congress should scrutinize the concentration in internet search, social media, e-commerce, and telecom hardware. But to topple monopolies, lawmakers need to cast a wider net.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-pandemicmakingmonopoliesworse614644</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G2-GWW1-JCG7-V17W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.
