Snyder, </nameText></person>the former president and COO of Gateway Inc., has never held political office, and rode his outsider status to victory in a state with the nation's highest unemployment rate. Snyder touted himself as \"one tough nerd\" in TV ads, arguing that it's time to reinvent Michigan's government. His private-sector approach is what the state needs, according to his business-oriented pitch. Snyder finished ahead of fellow Ross alum Pete Hoekstra, MBA '77 , a congressman from western Michigan. He now faces Democrat and Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero in the November general election. Current Gov. Jennifer Granholm cannot run again due to term limits.</p><p>After his time as a Gateway executive, Snyder set up venture capital fund Ardesta in Ann Arbor and helped create and lead Ann Arbor SPARK, a public-private economic development organization. He's always pursued lofty goals but usually quiets naysayers with concrete achievements. He's quieted quite a few by finishing on top of the Republican side after some pundits wrote him off as longshot for Michigan governor. But the journey isn't over and he faces a tireless campaigner and firebrand in Bernero for the ultimate goal.</p><p>The following are excerpts from an interview conducted with Snyder shortly after he announced his candidacy.</p><p>Why did you decide to run for governor, despite never having held office before?</p><p>Snyder: The most frequently asked question I get is, \"Why would you want to be governor?\" And the interesting part is the intonation as much as the question. People wonder why someone would want the job given the circumstances. But I really do, and it's for the intersection of three reasons. One, Michigan is an economic disaster. We're losing a million jobs this decade, we have (high) unemployment. We're losing a family every 12 minutes. Two, I believe there's a fundamental lack of leadership in Lansing. There's no clear direction, there's no vision, they're ignoring problems, and using Band-Aids instead of long-term, structural fixes. And they're in conflict instead of working together for the common good. Three, I don't believe that a traditional politician is the answer. I think [traditional politicians] come from a culture that's broken. We need to bring the knowledge and tools from the business world to get us on a positive track and fundamentally reinvent the economy in this state and in our government.</p><p>We've heard plans to reinvent government before from others. How can you, as a political outsider, get that done?</p><p>Snyder: Look at the business world: We reinvent ourselves multiple times or we wouldn't be in business. There have been a number of periods where that's the case. You can look at the period we're in now, or look at the tech bubble period. You can identify multiple periods where if we didn't reinvent our practices we would have been put out of business. Those are the kind of skill sets we've learned that we need to apply to government. A simple case I like to talk about is the budgeting process. It's been an absolute failure in the state of Michigan. [The state government shut down twice in recent years when budgets were not agreed upon in time.] Your business would never survive if you did cost-based budgeting. There's where departments ask for money, say they're doing to do a whole bunch of stuff, and then next year ask for more money so they can do more stuff.</p><p>What we need is outcomes-based budgeting, which lays out a set of outcomes to achieve. We would be held accountable and measured against other states and even other countries. We want to deliver results and tell people, 'This is how we're going to build up a budget. You, as citizens, customers, want to buy these services and deliver these outcomes.' They say you can't do that in government. Well, it's worked successfully in other places, why aren't we looking at it here? The state of Washington has been doing this since 2003. They had a major budget crisis, a $2.5 billion deficit, they had to cut 10 percent of the budget, and they went through outcomes-based budgeting. I like to call it value-for-money budgeting because we need to show value for money to our customers, the citizens. And they went out and surveyed people from both parties. And people from both parties thought the process worked. Independents thought the process worked. So here you have a situation where you can get everyone on board. Everyone might not be thrilled, but they understand it's a fair and open process involving citizen input in a way that builds up a project with real outcomes and real results. Why aren't we doing that? It's been done. It's not impossible in government.</p><p>Michigan has an incumbent leaving and a poor state economy, so if there were a time when the public might embrace an outsider, do you think this is it?</p><p>Snyder: I think people are excited. When I talk to people, I get a great response. My main issue is name recognition, getting out there and getting known. People know most of this stuff is common sense. Politicians have lacked transparency and have been caught up in this win/lose attitude. It's a culture that just doesn't work. We need to get out of that and break out in the open and say, 'We can all win together. We can make Michigan a great state again.' It's about Michiganders stepping up and taking our state back from people who are not doing their job right so we can run it the appropriate way. I often ask, 'If our government were a business, what would you do with these people?' And the answer I get from many people is, 'Fire them.' So why do we put up with this?</p><p>You are a product of the new economy, or what we used to call the new economy, and you've lived in other states. You've also led a big tech company. What does Michigan need to rebound, and how would you get that done?</p><p>Snyder: We need to change the concept of government from bureaucracy to customer service. The role of government should be to serve our citizens and customers. And everything we do shouldn't be through the lens of, 'We're government and we're going to go out and do stuff.' It should be, 'If you're a citizen, how can we help you be more successful?' And within that we need to be much more competitive on our tax and regulatory system. The Michigan Business Tax is the dumbest tax in the United States. Our regulatory system is biased toward assuming people are bad and they need to be controlled, versus the average citizen is a good and you need to deal with the exceptions. So we need to actually make a much more competitive playing field and reduce these Band-Aid things like incentives. If you have a competitive playing field, you don't need Band-Aids. The second thing is to go to the concept of value-for-money budgeting. What's the return on investment we're giving you? Why are we a good shopping choice? We need to be showing our worth to be on your shopping list.</p><p>What did you learn at Ross that maybe you've applied to your career and your campaign?</p><p>Snyder: I learned a lot there. That's a tough question because it's blended so much into my life. It's just part of me. One thing I really appreciated was that most of the people I met in business school had work experience. Here I was, a kid of 19, working in teams with these people. And it was just an awesome experience when people who had divergent backgrounds developed the chemistry to work as a team. It's one of those soft things, but it was a critical skill set to learn.</p><p>I've faced the challenge of people saying I can't do something my entire career. Actually, I thrive on that. I built this plan to get three degrees in six years when I was 16. So I designed it to get my bachelor's when I was 19, my MBA when I was 20, and my law degree when I was 23. I was an adjunct professor in the business school teaching tax when I was 24, 25, 26. I'd show up and most of the people were older than I was. But that's an important lesson. Teaching working people isn't taking the position that you're smarter or better than anyone else. I just happen to have more knowledge in the field, and we're there to learn together. We're all solid people. People aren't better than one another. The question is, how can you take that knowledge and share those tools with other people so we can all learn together? That's the same kind of message I want to bring to government.</p><p>Terry Kosdrosky</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1114293106</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:8042-WSY1-2R6P-M4VC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>August 6, 2010 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The most common complaint: the buses add to congestion on city streets and block public bus stops when they pause to ingest or disgorge their lucky riders.<br/> Tensions boiled over in San Francisco's Mission district one morning last week, as protesters surrounded a Google bus[1] and blocked it from leaving for about half an hour. The protesters waved signs saying 'Public $$$$, Private Gains' and 'Warning, Illegal Use of Public Infrastructure.'<br/> And it's not just street activists who have been taking a closer look at the private buses and their impact. In February, local author Rebecca Solnit penned a column for the London Review of Books[2] that portrayed the buses as signs of growing inequality and the callousness of the city's new rich; Longform.org picked her essay as one of the Web's five best long-form sci/tech articles of 2013.<br/> And this fall, Stamen Design, a San Francisco design firm, published dramatic data visualizations[3] based on crowdsourced observations on the routes and schedules of the private bus lines. 'It's not news that these shuttles, and the big digital tech companies that run them, are changing fabric of San Francisco as we've known it,' Stamen founder Eric Rodenbeck wrote for Wired's opinion site[4] in September. 'It's clear that we're looking at a reversal of the historical norm: The workers that used to live in residential suburbs while commuting to work in the city are now living in the city, while the largest technology companies are based in the suburbs and increasingly draw their labor supply from dense urban neighborhoods.'<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2012/05/08/greenstarts-second-batch-of-startups-has-digital-cleantech-focus/attachment/screen-shot-2012-05-08-at-8-04-34-am/As\">http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2012/05/08/greenstarts-second-batch-of-startups-has-digital-cleantech-focus/attachment/screen-shot-2012-05-08-at-8-04-34-am/As</url> long as Silicon Valley remains the center of gravity for the big tech firms\u2014and as long as these firms want to hire hip young employees who prefer to live in San Francisco\u2014the imbalance Rodenbeck described will worsen. What hasn't begun yet is a coherent political discussion about the alternatives to the private buses.<br/> Clearly, the competition among tech companies to provide the cushiest ride to work (and make no mistake, the buses are a big perk and recruiting tool in a hyper-competitive industry) is a net plus for other commuters. If all those Googlers and Facebookers suddenly decided to drive to work in their own cars, it would induce something like an infarction on 101 and 280, the peninsula's already sclerotic arterial highways. But so far, city governments up and down the peninsula have only begun to examine the question of how to regulate the buses, and where they should be allowed to stop.<br/> Into this hazardous fray steps RidePal[5]. The San Francisco startup, a 2012 graduate of the Greenstart accelerator and venture fund, has jokingly called itself 'the Google bus for the rest of us.' The company acts as a middleman, contracting with private transportation companies to provide bus transportation for the employees of corporations that don't want the hassle of administering their own bus fleets, or aren't big enough to afford them.<br/> RidePal founder and CEO Nathalie Criou, a resident of San Francisco, knows a thing or two about the commute to Silicon Valley; she lives in San Francisco (where, these days, she bikes to work) but spent years working as a product manager for Valley companies like Google, Admob, and Meebo. That experience, plus her background in technology and business\u2014she's got an MBA from the famed French business school INSEAD\u2014gives her a pragmatic perspective on the private-bus question.<br/> The way Criou sees things, it isn't possible to stop people from living where they want to live, or to stop companies from building their headquarters wherever they see fit. Nor can cities or regional transportation authorities build new roads or rail connections fast enough to keep up with shifting population patterns. Under those conditions, Criou believes, buses are an ideal way to transport commuters: they can go anywhere, and fleets can grow or shrink on demand.<br/> 'If you want to change the roads, it takes a long time,' says Criou (pictured above right). 'In the meantime, the new hip area will have moved somewhere else. So there will always be a mismatch between the resources available for these people, and where they choose to go. That's why I like buses as a transportation initiative\u2014because it makes use of an existing resource, which is roads, and it is much more likely to stay relevant as time goes by. It will be wherever it needs to run.'<br/> Criou says she understands perceptions that private buses are the domain of a privileged elite. But she says the whole mission of RidePal is to scale up bus transportation to the point where it's a practical and affordable option for a much larger cross-section of companies and workers.<br/> 'The whole idea behind RidePal, the vision, is that every single person who has to go to work should have a better alternative than driving alone,' she says. But 'it's very common that any new industry will start with the people who have a higher willingness to pay, because they have a need that's tenfold that of the average population. Then you can start refining the product and scale up.'<br/> In addition to easing freeway congestion, Criou points out, buses reduce the environmental impact of commuting. 'If you take one person away from their car and put them on a bus, you reduce their carbon footprint by about 40 percent, on average,' she says.<br/> RidePal, founded in early 2011, now works with more than 30 Bay Area companies. Criou says thousands of riders use the buses every month. The startup has raised $3.7 million in seed and Series A funding from Greenstart, 500 Startups, Amicus Capital, Claremont Creek Ventures, and Volvo Group Venture Capital, and has plans to hire more staff, improve its route planning and notification software, and investigate expansion to other regions in 2014.<br/> I interviewed Criou over breakfast in San Francisco's Dogpatch neighborhood last month\u2014we both showed up on our bikes. Below is an edited version of our conversation.<br/> Xconomy: Would you say that the hypothesis you started out with a couple of years ago is proving to be true? In other words, that there is a demand for bus transportation below the level of an Apple or a Google or a Genentech?<br/> Nathalie Criou: It is probably even becoming more true than I thought two years ago. What was very obvious two years ago was the need on the consumer side. Most of our riders were driving alone. We poll our riders regularly, and they all said they were either living too far away from public transit, or they were not able to afford the train. At least 90 percent of our ridership was just driving to work.<br/> X: So those are people you have effectively taken off the highways.<br/> NC: Exactly. So I think for these people\u2014and a lot of the hypothesis actually came from those people\u2014driving alone is not a good thing. The waste of time is the thing that people are very acutely aware of.<br/> Then on the corporate side, I think we are seeing a lot more interest than we had anticipated initially, and particularly from larger organizations. A lot of these larger corporations have a lot of cash. They have options. They could definitely afford to do this themselves. But the logistics associated with running this sort of service are pretty big. And a lot of these companies don't want to take that on.<br/> X: You don't own any buses, right? You are contracting for the buses from logistics and transportation companies.<br/> NC: From bus operators, exactly. These operators have the expertise to hire drivers, maintain buses, make sure they will be cleaned properly. They have a lot of expertise that we don't have, and I don't see why we would want to duplicate.<br/> X: To really deal with traffic and the health effects of commuting and have a serious impact on energy use, you would need to get hundreds of thousands of people out of their cars and onto buses. Do you see signs that there is a larger movement here? It would require awareness by consumers, and more convenience and access. Maybe some regulatory changes on the part of the cities you are moving through. And of course, demand on the part of corporate customers. What signs do you see that this is happening?<br/> NC: On the consumer side, all the signs point in this direction. I think there is a general shift in how people see the car. It's much more of a utility. So if other tools are available that provide the same utility, that they find more convenient or less stressful or less wasteful, people are much more open. We have several users who have told us they chose not to buy a car after they moved here. For a long time people have hated to commute in traffic, but they were not thinking that there could be an alternative. So we definitely see no problem with people adopting this if it is available.<br/> We are having a lot of conversations with cities, and cities seem to have a different problem. They tend to have two major constituents: they have residents, who also happen to be voters, and then they have businesses, who are the economic engines of the city. And both are equally important. The problem is, there tends to be a tension between the two, because residents want less traffic and businesses tend to need more traffic if they want to keep on hiring and growing.<br/> So cities are exploring ways they can allow businesses to grow and basically conduct more business, and remain competitive, without increasing the negative aspects or the impact on their residents. So it's an interesting problem. There is no formal program, but there is definitely a lot of conversations. And not just in the Bay Area. We have had cities from other parts of California or other states who have made inquiries. So this is an interesting area.<br/> X: What kinds of cooperation from cities would make a difference for a company like yours? Do you need special permission, for example, to set up a bus stop, or just to send the buses down city streets?<br/> NC: This is happening already, in every case. We always reach out to the cities or the public transportation authorities in each city, because we want to make sure we are not actually making things worse when we want to make them better. Usually it just takes conversation and understanding the areas of concern on both sides. So far, we haven't really run into a lot of problems.<br/> San Francisco is taking a very aggressive approach. They are bringing everyone to the table. Everyone recognizes that there is limited availability of curb space, which is a rare resource. So we need to work together to determine how we can make the best use of it to better serve the public.<br/> X: I'm sure you saw the study that Stamen Design did. To me, what was striking about the maps they produced is that there is this parallel world of commuting evolving right alongside everyone else who is still driving. If you are lucky enough to work for a big company like Apple, Google, Facebook, or Yahoo, you have this alternative available to you. It's almost like this ghost transportation infrastructure is arising, but it's not available to a lot of people. I'm wondering what messages or thoughts you come away with when you look at the Stamen map. Is this being managed in a way that, on the whole, is going to improve urban life, or make it even more unequal?<br/> NC: I think there are different aspects to this. What is striking about this map is the sheer volume of services. For companies that have the means to do it\u2014which tend to be newer Internet companies with a lot of cash reserves that they can put to use for this\u2014it's a very, very used perquisite. It's very highly valued [by employees]. They are doing this because it's working.<br/> X: Well, in many cases, it's the only way that their employees can live in they place where they want and work at the company they want to work for.<br/> NC: Exactly. If anything, it's an illustration of need. Initially you don't have an alternative, so they have to do it themselves and it's a very inefficient and expensive way to do it. But they have no choice because there is nothing else. And then I think this is a trigger. People say, oh, look at that, something is happening.<br/> It's hard to stop the direction these companies are going. I think the best we can do is follow that evolution in a direction that is going to be sustainable, that is going to be socially responsible.<br/> X: But the openness of the system is a concern. Your system is obviously more open than the Google bus\u2014anybody who wants to take it can get on. But you still need to be able to pay. And you need to know where the bus is going to show up. You need to be able to go online and see the routes. So, if this is going to be a solution that really contributes in a long-term way to sustainability and lowering emissions and all of that, is there a way to scale it up and make it more accessible? Is that something you think about very much?<br/> NC: That's the whole reason we founded the company! Commuting is just one use case. It's a very powerful one because it is the number one cause of emissions. We're talking about millions and millions of people around the globe, every single day. When people commute, they go to a job. And if a solution like RidePal or public transit wasn't available, they would still have to find a way to pay to get to their job.<br/> So I think it's not so much about payment, it's about how much do you charge. And whenever you have scale and you have volume, your ability to charge less and less increases, while still making a very comfortable profit. So it's very common that any new industry will start with the most acute need, with people who have a higher willingness to pay, because they have a need that's tenfold that of the average population. Then you can start refining the product and scale.<br/> The whole idea behind RidePal is that every single person who has to go to work should have a better alternative than driving alone. This is what we are working toward.<br/> Deploying buses like this is probably one of the cheapest, most cost effective ways to transport people, on a per-person basis. It's using the existing infrastructure, so you don't have to build tracks or stations. It's a very fluid thing. If it needs to morphs it just morphs. There is nothing fixed. So it's very, very flexible. The size of the buses can vary with demand. So it's still, overall, a much cheaper way to travel, no matter what. Much cheaper than cars.<br/> X: Is that also true in terms of pounds of carbon dioxide emitted per passenger per year?<br/> NC: It is. If you take one person away from their car and put them on a bus, assuming that the bus transports more than one person, obviously, you reduce their carbon footprint by about 40 percent, on average. There is definitely a strong environmental gain. It is just a very flexible, cost effective way of transporting people. Doing it in a more egalitarian way should be very achievable.<br/> X: The other thing that's striking to me about the Stamen Design maps is that there are so many people who work in Silicon Valley but absolutely refuse to live in Silicon Valley. It's kind of silly that we have this dumbbell pattern, where all of the employers are down at the other end of 101, and yet there are so many people who have decided that the cool place to live is San Francisco. And for obvious reasons that I totally agree with\u2014but it's a completely inefficient distribution.<br/> NC: It might be. But the truth is, when we are looking at our customer base, it's not just Silicon Valley and San Francisco. There are actually employers all over the place. Silicon Valley is definitely the core of what this area is known for. But there are a lot of people who work elsewhere. So if you look at congestion patterns, it's not just along 101. I think there is a lot of misperception in the general public about where people live and where people work.<br/> Things do change. Until recently, very few young people wanted to live in San Francisco, and that has changed. The average job lasts about five years, and the average person stays in their home for about seven years, so at some point you are not going to live next to where you work. It will always be like that. Cities will not have either resources or the physical infrastructure [to keep up with shifting populations]. If you want to change roads, it takes a long time. In the meantime, the new hip area will have moved somewhere else. So there will always be a mismatch between the resources available for these people and where they choose to go.<br/> X: OK, and you're saying buses are a flexible solution for that.<br/> NC: Yes, and it's true for companies too. When property becomes too expensive, companies will go somewhere else, and they will do everything they can to make that location seem like the next big thing, because that is how they compete to attract talent. So it's all a moving target, all the time. And all of these people would make their decisions individually, limited not just by economic factors. Which is why I like buses as a transportation initiative, because it makes use of an existing resource, which is roads, and it is much more likely to stay relevant as time goes by because it will be wherever it needs to run.<br/> X: How do people use their time on the buses? From what I've heard about the Apple bus or the Google bus, once you get on, that is almost the beginning of your work day. Everybody has a laptop and is doing e-mail all the way down the peninsula. It's almost seen as your chance to get on top of your e-mail.<br/> NC: There seem to be different kinds of people. There are some people who are definitely making very heavy use [of the on-board Wi-Fi network]. And there are some people who use these trips for reading, catching up on some sleep.<br/> We have not done a formal study, we don't have hard data, but it looks like morning and evening behaviors are different. More people work in the evening on laptops. In the morning there are people who work. They do things they would otherwise do at work when they get there, so it's definitely time-saving. And other people may read or sleep, which is also a productivity gain. They don't have to be tired at work. And when we formally talk with these people, they usually say it allows them to have a longer work day. Or they can leave work earlier and still spend time with their family.<br/> One of the things people tell us they like is that on the buses there is no social expectation of having to talk to someone else if you don't want to. People feel quite free to do whatever they like, which is valued. There is definitely a lot of social connection that can happen.<br/> X: How do you see RidePal expanding over the next five years? Do you feel like you have a lot of work left to do to conquer the Bay Area before you start looking at other regions or cities? Are there specific types of regions that would be a good fit for you? What challenges do you feel like you still have to figure out here before you scale up to other cities?<br/> NC: The easiest question to start with is, are there other markets that would work? The answer is yes, there are a lot of them. Most urban areas in the U.S. and around the world tend to have a congestion problem.<br/> One reason is that a lot of cities, especially older cities, have a rail system, which was planned and built based on dynamics that existed 100 years ago, or 50 years ago, or that are not relevant today. So you have needs that are at odds with the fixed infrastructure. So these cities actually suffer. And public transportation has many different responsibilities. It has to work at times when people are going to work, and it has to work at times when no one else wants to travel.<br/> So it's very unfair to expect a transit system to try to optimize itself around the needs of commuters. In fact if you look at Caltrain, they are at capacity during rush hour. But if they were to increase capacity, then the increased cost would prevent them from serving the public at other times.<br/> So the volume of commuters, obviously, is one area we look at as we grow the company. The other factor we look at is going to be the kinds of corporations, the kinds of verticals that might be in these markets. Because initially the corporations that will be more able to offer something like this, even if it's much more cost effective than doing it themselves, tend to be businesses that already have resources devoted to managing their human capital, and that are constantly looking out for better solutions for their employees.<br/> X: One of the cities that comes to mind is Detroit. It's a city where we have a bureau, and the downtown is undergoing something of a resurgence. There are some big high-tech companies downtown like Quicken Loans and Compuserve. So this is a hub-and-spoke problem, getting people into the city. And there is a terrible public bus system, so there is no way to get into work on the city buses, and there is no rail system. Obviously, Detroit was built around highways.<br/> NC: Which is great for buses.<br/> X: Right. It's great for buses. So I don't know if there's a huge congestion problem in Detroit but there is definitely a people problem, just getting people downtown. So it may be a market for this kind of thing.<br/> NC: It may be. I think we will be looking and starting to talk about which markets will make sense to expand, and I think Detroit is probably on the list. Wherever there are problems moving people it is probably on the list and then we have to figure out, is this something we want to do now or something we want to do later?<br/> So I don't have an answer. We are not yet projecting where exactly we will expand. But the need is well beyond the Bay Area. If we were to be true to our vision, it would be difficult to stay in the Bay Area and still cover a huge percentage of the world population. [Laughs]<br/> Right now we are really in the starting phase. Once we start scaling all of these barriers can go way down because you have all sorts of economies of scale, and the ticket to entry for a lot of these corporations will be much lower.<br/> X: All that said, do you feel there is room to grow still here in the Bay Area?<br/> NC: Absolutely. We are seeing huge acceleration in the Bay Area. We have a lot more room to grow. I think for a long time, companies thought they had no other options. They were saying 'Oh, we don't have the cash reserves of Google, or we're not as big,' so for a long time people were not even thinking it could be possible. Now we have people more and more realizing this could be in reach, this may be an option.<br/> Comments[6] | Reprints[7] | Share: <url

You're confronted with billboards for things normal humans can't buy, like fighter jets. Small groups of lobbyists cluster in corners of office buildings and swap inside information in hushed tones. </p><p>And there are the invites. Loads upon loads of invites to seminars and open-bar events and celebrations, all for obscure reasons. Washington trades on these invites. While at a glance they can seem confusing or meaningless, they typically have an ulterior motive. You can build a story around the real and sometimes insidious reasons for the gathering. TheProspectgets a lot of these emails, and each week, we're going to share one of them with you, and take you inside what might be going on behind the scenes.This is another Washington perennial: the 'Capitol Hill briefing.' Privacy legislation in Congress generally has focused on Big Tech data breaches and unauthorized disclosures, for good reason. But other industries don't want to get caught up in the undertow. They want to make sure Capitol Hill staff take them into account in whatever new regulations they might devise (and if possible, carve them out).Enter the 'Connected Health Initiative[1]' (CHI), a subdivision of ACT | The App Association (weirdly, that's how the name is written, with that line and everything). CHI bills itself as 'a coalition of industry stakeholders and partners' who work 'to clarify outdated health regulations' and 'encourage mobile health innovation.' It's an app developers lobby that wants to allow digital hardware and software to access and track patient data.The history of move-fast-and-break-things 'innovation' efforts in the tech space shows that the security of patient data is a secondary concern. But though this data is more sensitive, health care doesn't have quite the same stigma, making it easier for the industry to seek special pleading.CHI has already won a round of this. The 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 created new rules for health-related mobile apps, which fall outside the data-sharing restrictions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). But any new privacy legislation could set those meddling politicians loose on the health innovation space again, and we can't have that.This event, held at a room in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, seeks to answer 'one of the most pressing questions' in privacy policy\u2014at least for the member firms of the Connected Health Initiative. The proceedings feature a lobbyist for CHI, a lobbyist for the American Medical Association, a director at the 'AI and healthcare policy' division of Intel, an executive with the mobile health data firm Particle Health, and two different officials with the Department of Health and Human Services. The latter two give the event the imprimatur of being a genuine exchange of ideas and not lobbying in another form.This is just a means to implant ideas into the minds of staffers who will have a hand in privacy legislation. They can 'hear from innovative companies' and 'understand what policymakers can do to ensure patient privacy while balancing the needs of healthcare providers and patients.' You'd think it'd be up to the, you know, policymakers to understand how to strike that balance, not lobbyists and executives. But Washington does things just a little bit differently.Oh, and there will be lunch. There will always be lunch.

All I need to do is charge the device at home with electricity. Now, it only takes around 15 minutes to get to work, compared to 30 minutes stuck on a bus during rush hour.\u201d</p><p>Kim is just one of many South Koreans who view electric scooters as an effective way to commute to and from work or school. Together with recreational riders, e-mobility users like Kim are fueling the popularity of personal mobility devices, or PMDs, here.</p><p>PMDs broadly refer to motorized, one-person vehicles powered by electricity, including standing electric scooters, two-wheeled Segways, hands-free hoverboards and electric bikes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Though varying by model, they can travel at a maximum speed of around 20 to 40 kilometers an hour. A standard e-scooter costs around 500,000 won ($450) at local retail prices.</p><p>And demand for PMDs is growing quickly. According to the Korea Transport Institute, approximately 75,000 PMDs were sold here in 2017, up 20 percent from 60,000 units the previous year. By 2022, this number is expected to surpass 200,000 units, according to the institute.\u00a0</p><p>Though PMDs initially garnered interest as recreational devices in Korea, they are now perceived more as practical vehicles for commuting.</p><p>According to a 2017 KTI survey of 150 personal mobility device users, 55.3 percent said they used PMDs as a means of commuting to work or school, exceeding those who were using them for recreational purposes (46.7 percent).</p><p>Despite the growth, the regulations surrounding PMDs have been ambiguous, if not absent, leading to safety risks as well as widespread confusion among scooter riders, cars and pedestrians.</p><p>In Korea, most people ride their e-scooters on sidewalks or in a bike lane when available. Many ride them at public parks. Most people do not wear helmets, and few can be seen riding in the streets.\u00a0</p><p>However, this is all illegal according to Korea\u2019s transport regulations.</p><p>The Road Traffic Act categorizes PMDs as motorbikes, treating them similar to a standard motorcycle. This means the legal way to ride a PMD here is to stay in regular car lanes and wear a helmet. The rider must also be over the age of 16 and hold a two-wheeled motor vehicle driving license.\u00a0</p><p>In reality, however, most e-mobility riders don\u2019t follow these rules, largely because they are unaware. Enforcement has been weak as well, with surveillance mostly limited to sporadic inspections at Seoul parks.</p><p>This legal stipulation itself is self-contradictory. While PMDs are required to travel within car lanes, there is no law mandating e-mobility devices obtain the governmental safety certification required of all vehicles on the roads.</p><p>Legal issues aside, experts warn it is realistically dangerous to send e-scooter riders to the roads to travel next to regular cars that are going at much higher speeds.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPersonal mobility devices are here and growing in scope, but the regulations are not keeping pace, hurting both the industry and PMD riding culture,\u201d said Kim Pil-su, an automotive engineering professor at Daelim University and chairman of the Korea Electric Vehicle Association.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAsking PMD riders to travel on car lanes is like sending them out to die,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government needs to legislate clear rules on travel speed, permitted locations and driving qualifications for PMD vehicles by benchmarking successful models from overseas.\u201d</p><p>In June 2017, local lawmakers proposed a revision to the Road Traffic Act to include legislation specific to personal mobility devices and the correct way to ride them. But the revision is still under consideration at the National Assembly.</p><p>The regulatory gap is hurting efforts to create an improved riding environment for PMDs as well.

If people aren't revealing information fearing stigma, what can the government do? he asked. \"There is a legitimate state interest in collecting information such as a person's name, their parents' names, relatives' names, places they have visited, etc,\" Patnaik said. The Odisha government had to divulge the name of a patient because all reasonable methods of contact tracing failed, he said. Issues such as how long the data will be collected for / stored, proportionality, minimum data required, and whether it has to be specified to a patient have to be pondered upon, he added.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Privacy is central to all these discussions, but it's by no means the only human right that is being violated,\" Malavika Jayaram said. To frame privacy as a trade-off or a balancing act is extremely disingenuous. It's extremely complicated and you have to deal with issues like accessibility, minorities, freedom, right to food, among others,\" she added.</p><p>MediaNama held an online event discussing Privacy in the era of COVID-19, on April 29, 2020, with participation of key stakeholders from law and policy. The discussion was supported by the Internet Society, Google, Facebook, and the Centre for Communications Governance at NLU, Delhi. Some of the issues around challenges to privacy, rights, and the global trends around privacy and data protection are summarised here.</p><p>What governments grapple with</p><p>The need for actors to respond in \"real-time\" : \"A lot is unknown about this virus and people are trying to develop ideas and strategies in real-time. They have to be allowed to work without everyone badgering them with questions: lawyers, activists, their own bosses, Twitter experts,\" said Sunil Bajpai. \"Could we consider that they are allowed to make their decisions today, the policymakers, administrators, but that everything should be declassified at a later date where all stakeholders can examine it?\" \"The people making the decisions now will also know that their steps will be open [to scrutiny?] later. You can question and engage for improvements [right now], but all it's very difficult to demand that all decisions be carefully thought of at this stage, because the numbers are rising everyday, and something needs to be done to save lives,\" Bajpai said. In response, Alok Prasanna Kumar said the government may need to respond in real-time, but their response cannot change every two days. \"A recent clarification to reopen shops required 4 clarifications for people to understand what it meant,\" he said.</p><p>The challenge of iterating quickly: An emergency like this leaves you completely unprepared. The measures that will be taken are rapid measures which require to be iterated. You need to have a system in government, that iterates in a sensible, reasonable manner. If you push something out quickly, you will make mistakes, Rahul Matthan said. The rate at which changes can be iterated into a [tech] product, is not really in the control of many people, he said.</p><p>But what about accountability? \"In Odisha, we have given the power to the community. Village sarpanch have been given the power to ensure quarantine and isolation of incoming migrants. They are going to collect data on these migrants, but what kind of protection mechanism do we expect at that level? What would happen if there is a leakage?\" Patnaik asked. \"There are safeguards, when put in place, would make this all more legally palatable,\" Narayan argued. \"This is not the way democracies are supposed to work. We don't put a dictator in place and say all they do is right. The quality of decision making improves with accountability.\"</p><p>Rights in the time of disasters and emergencies</p><p>Is the lockdown even legal? There is no law which permits the government to impose a lockdown, it's definitely not allowed in the Epidemic Diseases Act, according to Gopal Sankarnarayana. The government has to specify why steps such as social distancing, curbing of rumours, mandatory data collection are being taken and for what purpose, he said. \"The government should tell people that these are specific measures for which information is being collected, this is what it will be used for, and these are the safeguards,\" he added.</p><p>Existing laws allow for \"sort of\" emergency : The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, allow for a \"kind of\" emergency, explained Alok Prasanna Kumar. The Constitution provides for three different kinds of emergencies, but there are also other laws and provisions allowing for a \"state of exception\". \"Both laws allow authorities to exercise unusual powers, but both are inadequate to come up with a proper privacy regime, or even to deal with this pandemic,\" he said.</p><p>Constitutionality of emergency powers: \"In the Indian constitution's emergency provisions, there is a clear insistence that there needs to be a proclamation of emergency, ratification by the parliament, and a definite end date for an emergency,\" Bhatia said. \"The emergency begins, and then it ends. And then we go back into pre-emergency times. That ensures that the legal regimes are separate. The problem with the handling of the current pandemic is that both the National Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act are not formally emergency legislations. All central and state governments need to do is simply invoke them. These laws have umbrella clauses that give the government exceedingly broad powers to manage the pandemic without parliamentary oversight.\"</p><p>Keeping peacetime law and emergency law separate: \"The way the law normally operates in the legal framework is you have the legal landscape for normal times, which is the default; and then you have exceptions,\" Bhatia pointed out. That is premised on the shared belief that in cases of crisis like this one, you need to suspend some principles operating in normal times. \"The reason it's important to keep these clearly separate is that there will be a possibility that the state of exception will bleed into the state of normalcy,\" he said.</p><p>Legitimate suspension of rights for emergencies: \"There are certain kinds of rights that need to be suspended or temporarily infringed during a pandemic,\" Gautam Bhatia argued. \"Transporting people during a cyclone [during Cyclone Hudhud in Odisha] is a good example. You can argue that freedom of movement is being violated by forcing an evacuation, but everyone understands that to deal with a cyclone you need to temporarily suspend that right only to deal with this situation.\"</p><p>Some rights remain sacrosanct even in emergency situations: \"There are other rights that cannot be suspended even during a pandemic,\" Bhatia said. \" For example on data collection and use, as long as you have principles like purpose limitation and data minimisation for what data is being collected - these anyway applying in a normal time - that is fine. But you don't need to go beyond those principles and cite a pandemic to justify that. You don't have an added benefit in tackling the pandemic if you give a go-by to these principles. The question of which principles remain sacrosanct during a pandemic and which can be given short shrift, is important. And that is a democratic decision that should be taken after due deliberation.\"</p><p>Power at local levels can be ruthless : \"There is the role of Google and Apple in designing the instruments they use to assist during the pandemic,\" Aniruddh Nigam said. \"But then there are some private bodies being roped in for enforcement. There are reports of suraksha samitis and volunteer groups being granted police-like powers in Madhya Pradesh or Delhi, with residential welfare associations taking on the responsibility of ensuring that lockdowns and social distancing are followed. There is a question about the competence of these bodies to do these things. Power does operate more ruthlessly at local levels, and there are questionable motives these individuals might have.\"</p><p>: Is resisting contact tracing a legitimate form of resistance? \"There is some chatter on not installing Aarogya Setu as a sign of resistance,\" Nigam said. \"I think there needs to be a discussion on what would be legitimate resistance in this situation. Because my sense is that a response that refuses to opt in to contact tracing might be dangerous as well.\"</p><p>Can't have law-like regulations: \"We need to focus on institutional framework. A law needs to exist for a broad violation for rights,\" Rahul Narayan said. \"This is not an emergency constitutionally so the courts cannot say this or that is not important. Everyone needs to act in accordance with the law as it stands. In terms of the NDMA and Epidemics Act, it is not justifiable to allow massive amounts of legislation in the guise of regulations and rules. It'd be better to have a broad legislative framework to permit this. In the House of Commons, for a money bill that cannot be scrutinised by the House of Lords, the speaker has to consult backbenchers from both parties.\"</p><p>Existing laws were not made keeping future epidemics in mind : \"Both laws were reactive and never framed to deal with future epidemics. The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 was framed after the plague outbreak, which largely affected rural areas. The National Disaster Management Act came in the context of the Indian Ocean tsunami, and was designed for multi-state disasters, but was never intended for nationwide implementation from Delhi. There is a difference between dynamism and complete chaos,\" explained Kumar.</p><p>Do we need a separate disease surveillance law? \"In India it is assumed that the information collected by the government will be used only for the purpose of fighting the pandemic. But what happens if there's a leak? If we have higher numbers, then people will have to go to private hospitals, then the same data could potentially be leaked to people outside. So what is the kind of control we must have? To cover all this, is it necessary to have a separate disease surveillance act,\" Patnaik said.</p><p>What the PDP Bill allows: Section 12 of the Personal Data Protection Bill allows for non-consensual processing of data, including during epidemics, said Vrinda Bhandari. To invoke Section 35 - which exempts government agencies from large parts of the bill - the government would have to clearly say that this is a national security issue. That may be an impediment for the government, because to make the case that a health emergency might be a public order emergency is a harder case to make, she added.</p><p>Internet access and the pandemic</p><p>4G restrictions in the time of COVID-19: Jammu &amp; Kashmir has spent most of the lockdown with access to only 2G internet. This is is harmful to health, education of children, access to justice, right to be able to work, especially given that the communications shutdown had been in place for nine months. In Anuradha v. Union of India, the court was clear that this should not be a permanent state, she said.</p><p>\"We are in a state of emergency one way or another. There, proportionality becomes important. In proportionality analysis, the balancing test is important. What we are trying to argue is that during COVID-19, the balancing test is changed. The disproportionate effect on a majority of the people has happened: doctors can't download guidelines and advisories, students can't access online learning services, people can't work from home.\" said Vrinda Bhandari.</p><p>Challenges faced in protecting privacy</p><p>Will the courts interfere? \"Our courts are unlikely to interfere in this scenario and are willing to postpone any discussion on things which they think are rights of luxury, such as privacy,\" Gopal Sankaranarayana said. \"Even when it came to the right to food and health of migrant labourers, they refused to step in and deferred to the wisdom of the government,\" he added.</p><p>Privacy policies are not a complete solution : Privacy policies are helpful in that they give you some information about what's going to happen potentially, but without open protocols or open source app design by default. Privacy policies have never been challenged in court in India. No one is going to file a class action because we don't have a suitable structure for filing class action suits against privacy policies. We need to understand the limitations of what a privacy policy can actually do for either dismantling or handling our data.</p><p>: Contact tracing apps are only as good as the uptake : The TraceTogether app has been downloaded by only 17% of people in Singapore, a country where there is immense trust in the government. \"It doesn't address the behavioral aspects of how people function, with issues like battery draining. Social distancing won't work when you have 20 men in a small room sharing a common bathroom. If you don't look at the context in which even legal and legitimate measures are enforced, you are missing the woods for the trees.\"</p><p>Existing disease surveillance programs do not address privacy : The Integrated Disease Surveillance Program and other similar programs in India do not address data protection and privacy issues, explained Smitha Krishna Prasad. \"Our health laws also focus on doctor-confidentially and similar issues, rather than go into a more detailed explanation of privacy and data protection,\" she said.</p><p>How much anonymisation is possible? \"Data anonymisation is not needed if someone is doing research, and you can argue that the medical fraternity is actually doing continuous research to fight the pandemic. So how much anonymisation can we do so that it still remains useful,\" Patnaik asked. However he did acknowledge that anonymised data is useful for determining containment zones, and resource allocation to hospitals, etc.</p><p>Global trends in privacy incursions amidst the pandemic</p><p>Governments are taking the approach of \"never waste a crisis\" : The government is using the pandemic to push emergency powers, cut down on civil society movement, gag media and especially independent media, said Malavika Jayaram. \"There is a sense that people are asleep at the wheel, and the government can push through things which would be egregious and unconstitutional in normal circumstances,\" she said.</p><p>Increasing partnerships across public and private powers : Public-private partnerships and even private-private partnerships, such as the Apple-Google collaboration, have been accelerated, Jayaram added. \"We have to worry about consolidation and antitrust experts have said this dwarfs every competition issue out there,\" she said.</p><p>Active, rather than passive, surveillance : Governments are aggressively going after telecom, tech companies, and healthcare companies, and anybody who else actively collects data - they are being pursued, so that governments can actively pull data, Jayaram observed.</p><p>The emergence of traffic light and other binary systems; their concerns : Immunity passports, and traffic light systems in China and other countries, as well as other binary systems - which allow or disallow some actions or movements - have extremely long-term implications, Jayaram said. They are extremely hard to dismantle after the crisis is over, and will only enhance systems of oppression and structures that have amplified inequality,\" she said.</p><p>Observations from post-lockdown China</p><p>Health codes in China : The health code or passports in China has become a new form of identity, explained Dev Lewis, who has been based in Shanghai since January. The system records \"everybody's entry and exit into cities, domestic travel, public spaces, gyms, malls, and who is allowed to go back to work in factories and white-collar workplaces\", he said. The implementation is not uniform and is decentralised. 200 cities have created their own version of the health code that governs what people can and can't do, he explained.</p><p>China's real-time ID system : Everybody's phone is linked to a real-name ID, it has an existing system where every app you downloaded, and what you posted online was linked to this. On top of that, the health code was built by Tencent and Alibaba who were able to insert the code into WeChat and Alipay. Tencent had 900 million users within two weeks. Tencent claims that the app has been used 9 billion times. None of this is comparable with India's infrastructure.</p><p>There are increasingly more similarities between China and India's internet space, Lewis observed. \"Aarogya Setu also has a traffic light system now. It's difficult to see how India can look at the Chinese health code as a model, since the code sits on a techno-legal infrastructure which China has been building for the last few years. This is just not comparable with India.\"</p><p>Response of civil society</p><p>Civil society is also responding : Measures are being adopted to put in checks and balances, such as Professor Lillian Edwards' bill on safeguards against COVID-19. Lillian Edwards' safeguards bill prescribes minimum safeguards with regard to immunity certificates. It talks about the digitally excluded and ensuring confidence that data will not be misused, talks about consent. It warns against digital divides such as discrimination for not having a phone, failing to charge it, or leaving the house without it, imposing sharing status messages, etc. It also talks about Data Protection Impact Assessments.</p><p>Civil society with technical capability are pushing for contact tracing apps to be open-source , auditable, and to put them up for other people to vet them. The Trace Together app was touted as open-source, but only the protocol is open-source not the entire source code.</p><p>\"We need to resist norm changes in terms of what is happening. After 9/11 in the US and 26/11 in India, you have changes in the way surveillance is perceived and national security is perceived,\"Divij Joshi said. \"We are seeing operating system level or platform level changes, which Google and Apple have been proposing. Saying that this is a good time to breach end to end encryption. We need to make sure that technical design by design is limited to a specific time.\"</p><p>Consent and power asymmetry</p><p>Consent cannot be freely given if most don't have a choice: Shweta Reddy points out, \"Especially in the case of the pandemic, consent cannot be freely given. Central government employees have been told to download Aarogya Setu, so consent is gone there. If you move away from consent to the lawful ground under the Personal Data Protection Bill of ensuring that the state government is processing data based on the law, there is at least one additional step of deliberation to make sure the law is being followed.</p><p>Even without consent, trust and accountability are key: Accountability without consent: Section 12 of the Personal Data Protection Bill follows has provisions where even if you don't have consent, you have to demonstrate compliance with data minimisation. Trust is core to a public health response strategy, even if your response strategy is evolving over time. If you're able to show that at one point you don't need information collected in the past, that's fine as long as you have taken privacy into account by doing the risk assessment and need analysis for data.</p><p>Workers' rights and contact tracing: \"It's not a fair choice to make between livelihood and privacy,\" Shweta Reddy said of companies like Zomato requiring workers to have the Aarogya Setu app installed. \"An employer in certain cases can process personal employee data under the PDP Bill without consent, but only in the context of contract termination or background checks. Zomato is not legally doing anything wrong, since there is no data protection bill yet, so there is no framework to guide their reaction. Till there is an overarching law, acts of organisations cannot be held accountable.\"</p><p>Norms for private companies</p><p>Can private companies' tech solve a problem they didn't design their products for? \"The use of big data has driven disasters in the past, or at least sought to sideline equitable access to public health,\" Divij Joshi said. \"In Sierra Leone, big tech companies tried to use technology to counter the Ebola crisis. But because of lack of widespread technology adoption, and the fact that call data recording and GPS were not appropriate for that epidemic, it eventually sidelined the actual goal and led to decisions on resource allocation which affected people who are most unlikely to be able to challenge these systems.</p><p>\"We need to challenge the assumption that technology and data will be helpful. The systems we are trying to put in place to solve a humanitarian crisis were never created to solve humanitarian crises. They were made for surveillance or profit. You can't repurpose them. We need to be critical in how far data and surveillance will go, and see if they will detract from universal access to health.\" he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0053151763</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTS-DG91-DXMP-K0VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3477\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 4, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They are active media and information companies.''</p><p>He said the Bill did not go into this area at all, adding: ``There's nothing about regulating fake news.</p><p>``No attempt has been made to ensure that data companies are covered by competition and other regimes that apply to media companies.</p><p>``There are no proposals to deal with the allegations being made about undue influence by social media companies on politics and elections here and in the US.''</p><p>For the Liberal Democrats, Lord McNally said his party would seek to improve the Bill in a number of areas and the ``tech giants'' should not be seen as being too big to regulate.</p><p>``We have to devise the legislation and have the political courage to bring the global tech giants within the compass of the rule of law,'' he said.</p><p>Independent crossbencher Lord Jay of Ewelme backed the Government's stated determination to maintain the ``free and uninterrupted'' flow of data with the EU post-Brexit.</p><p>However, he said the European Union committee, which he chairs, was struck by the absence of ``clear and concrete proposals'' to achieve that.</p><p>Lord Jay told peers the stakes were high as the introduction of ``greater friction could present a real barrier to future trade''.</p><p>Any impediments to data flows could ``seriously hinder police and security co-operation,'' with lives at stake, he warned.</p><p>Tory former minister Lord Arbuthnot of Edrom raised the question of the bill to be footed by business in allowing people ``to demand to know what information was held about them''.</p><p>The Conservative peer, who is chairman of the Information Assurance Advisory Council, said: ``It is a good thing that citizens should find out what information people hold on them, but we should not pretend the exercise will be free of cost to businesses.''</p><p>Lord Arbuthnot pointed out the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) had estimated an additional cost of \u00a375,000 a year to small firms.</p><p>Labour former Lords leader Baroness Jay of Paddington said she found it very hard to see how an individual government could legislate to ``moderate the growing tsunami of online data exchange'' and protect people from manipulation and exploitation.</p><p>A possible route was through better public education, she said: ``Creating better informed consumers to understand better how their shared personal data may be used and what may happen to it would clearly be an advantage.''</p><p>Digital entrepreneur and independent crossbencher Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho said: ``There's much that's good in this Bill but I don't believe it's yet the best that it can be.''</p><p>Lady Lane-Fox said despite her expertise she found the Bill ``incredibly hard to read'' and even harder to understand.</p><p>She warned peers could be ``sleepwalking into a dystopian future'' if the Bill was not simplified to make it accessible to more people.</p><p>Opposition spokesman Lord Kennedy of Southwark pressed ministers over how the Government had arrived at 13 as the age of consent to access social media without parental consent.</p><p>Responding to the debate, Home Office Minister Baroness Williams of Trafford downplayed concerns raised over additional costs on business, pointing out firms were already required to abide by existing data protection legislation</p><p>She said the provisions contained in the new Bill ``should not be a disproportionate burden''.</p><p>Lady Williams said the age of consent set out in the legislation followed a government consultation to which 170 organisations had responded.</p><p>``It recognises the fundamental role that the internet already plays in the life of teenagers.</p><p>``While we need to educate children on the risks and work with internet companies to keep them safe, online platforms and communities provide children and young people with an enormous educational and social resource.</p><p>``It's not an easy balance to strike but I am convinced that in selecting 13 the Government has made the right choice and one fully compatible with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.''</p><p>The Bill received its second reading and now proceeds to committee stage.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

ensure that data companies are covered by competition and other regimes that apply to media companies.</p><p>\"There are no proposals to deal with the allegations being made about undue influence by social media companies on politics and elections here and in the US.\"</p><p>For the Liberal Democrats, Lord McNally said the party would seek to improve the Bill in a number of areas, and added that the \"tech giants\" should not be seen as being too big to regulate.</p><p>\"We have to devise the legislation and have the political courage to bring the global tech giants within the compass of the rule of law,\" he said.</p><p>Independent crossbencher Lord Jay of Ewelme backed the Government's stated determination to maintain the \"free and uninterrupted\" flow of data with the EU post-Brexit.</p><p>But the European Union committee, which he chaired, was struck by the absence of \"clear and concrete proposals\" to achieve that, he said.</p><p>Lord Jay told peers the stakes were high as the introduction of \"greater friction could present a real barrier to future trade\".</p><p>Any impediments to data flows could \"seriously hinder police and security co-operation,\" with lives at stake, he warned.</p><p>Tory former minister Lord Arbuthnot of Edrom raised the question of the bill to be footed by business in allowing people \"to demand to know what information was held about them\".</p><p>The Conservative peer, who is chairman of the Information Assurance Advisory Council , said: \"It is a good thing that citizens should find out what information people hold on them, but we should not pretend the exercise will be free of cost to businesses.\"</p><p>Lord Arbuthnot pointed out the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) had estimated an additional cost of \u00a375,000 a year to small firms.</p><p>Labour former Lords leader Baroness Jay of Paddington said she found it very hard to see how an individual government could legislate to \"moderate the growing tsunami of online data exchange\" and protect people from manipulation and exploitation.</p><p>A possible route was through better public education, she said: \"Creating better informed consumers to understand better how their shared personal data may be used and what may happen to it would clearly be an advantage.\"</p><p>Digital entrepreneur and independent crossbencher Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho said: \"There's much that's good in this Bill but I don't believe it's yet the best that it can be.\"</p><p>Lady Lane-Fox said that despite her expertise she found the Bill \"incredibly hard to read\" and even harder to understand - and warned that peers could be \"sleepwalking into a dystopian future\" if the Bill was not simplified to make it accessible to more people.</p><p>Opposition spokesman Lord Kennedy of Southwark pressed ministers over how the Government had arrived at 13 as the age of consent to access social media without parental consent.</p><p>Responding to the debate, Home Office Minister Baroness Williams of Trafford downplayed concerns raised over additional costs on business, pointing out that firms were already required to abide by existing data protection legislation, and that the provisions in the new Bill \"should not be a disproportionate burden\".</p><p> Lady Williams said the age of consent set out in the legislation followed a government consultation to which 170 organisations had responded.</p><p>\"It recognises the fundamental role that the internet already plays in the life of teenagers,\" she said.</p><p>\"While we need to educate children on the risks and work with internet companies to keep them safe, online platforms and communities provide children and young people with an enormous educational and social resource.</p><p>\"It's not an easy balance to strike but I am convinced that in selecting 13 the Government has made the right choice and one fully compatible with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child .\"</p><p>The Bill received its second reading and now proceeds to committee stage.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

She is currently writing a book about textile artisans. The European Commission will release its Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAC) on March 11. Key issue: will the plan enshrine a right to repair for smartphones as part of its ecodesign directive? This would allow regulation of device design and capacity for repair, as the Commission has already done for household appliances (see EU Adopts Right to Repair for Household Appliances[1]). Or will the Commission roll over and succumb to the blandishments of tech lobbyists - I'm looking at you Apple - and sidestep or water down right to repair requirements?</p><p> Motherboard reported on Friday in Leaked Plans Suggest Europe Wants to Pass Right to Repair Laws for Electronics[2]: Two versions of the CEAC have leaked ahead of its March 11. One draft obtained by Motherboard says the commission will 'explore ecodesign requirementsfor [informations and communications technology] products that the ecodesign directive does not already cover, including mobile phones,' but does not mention the right-to-repair. Another draft of the CEAC appears more explicit. It says the Commission will 'focus on electronics and [information and communications technology] as a priority sector for implementing the 'right to repair', including the possibility of necessary upgrades,' and explore regulatory measures for mobile phones under the Ecodesign Directive.' Which way will the Commission jump? We won't know until Wednesday. Here a little context is in order. Over to Motherboard: In 2015, the European Commission carried out a study to determine which products should be included in eco-design directives. This was the study that determined washing machines and fridges should be easily repairable. According to Jean-Pierre Schweitzer, Product Policy and Circular Economy Officer for the European Environmental Bureau\u2014a network of people and groups dedicated to fighting for environmental legislation in Europe, that same study concluded that smartphones were one of the most important products to make repairable and that laws around that should be prioritized. 'But, for whatever reason, [the European Commission] didn't put smartphones onto the list of products which they were going to address in [2018],' Schweitzer told Motherboard over the phone. 'At the time, different excuses were made. They felt that products like smartphones were innovating too quickly, that the policy cycle couldn't keep up with it.' Schweitzer said he and his fellow activists believe that the Commission didn't push smartphones for political reasons. 'They weren't willing to take on the big tech companies,' he said. 'What we want them to do is commit to putting smartphones on the eco design work plan. If it's on the work plan, they have to go through the process and develop requirements for the phones.' Even if the European Commission opts to mandate a right to repair for smartphones, that's only one battle in the right to repairwar. Because the big tech companies \u2014 such as Apple \u2014 will certainly fight back, as they did in January when the European Parliament voted 582-40 to set a standard charging cable for smartphones (seeEurope Just Voted in Favor of Making iPhone and Android Use the Same Charger[3], in which Motherboard tells that story). Apple responded with a statement, as discussed in the Financial Times, Apple hits out at EU plans for a universal smartphone charger[4]: Apple has hit out against European plans to force tech companies to adopt a universal standard charger for all smartphones and other electronics, arguing that doing so would hamper innovation. Earlier this month, the European Parliament revived a decade-long argument about mandating a so-called 'common charger' for mobile devices. Maros Sefcovic, vice-president of the European Commission for inter-institutional relations and foresight, said in a recentspeech that such a scheme would be more convenient for consumers and reduce electronic waste. 'We will look at a combination of policy options, including regulatory and non-regulatory measures, to achieve our objectives,' he said, after what he called a 'missed opportunity' for a voluntary approach from the tech industry. Since Europe's campaign for a common charger began in the late 2000s, the number of different charging cables and connection ports used by smartphone makers has reduced from dozens to three: two variants of USB, an industry standard, and Lightning, which is proprietary to iPhones and iPads. In its first statement in response to the latest proposals, Apple said on Thursday that forcing it to ditch Lightning would inconvenience hundreds of millions of its customers and create an 'unprecedented volume' of waste. 'We believe regulation that forces conformity across the type of connector built into all smartphones stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, and would harm consumers in Europe and the economy as a whole,' Apple said. 'We hope the Commission will continue to seek a solution that does not restrict the industry's ability to innovate and bring exciting new technology to customers.' Note that the charging cable issue is small potatoes, compared to what a right to repair might do to Apple's sales. Such a change might also reduce excess eWaste \u2014 estimated at 50 million metric tons of e-waste is generated globally per year, with an average of more than 6 kg per person; whereas total e-waste generation in Europe in 2016 was 12.3 million metric tonnes, equivalent to 16.6 kg on average per inhabitant, according to the European Parliament[5]. Not to mention start to direct us back on a more sustainable path for our use of electronics. Imagine being able to upgrade or repair a device without having to pony up for a new device? Or to avail oneself of cheaper, third party repair repair services, rather than being beholden to the tender mercies of Apple? So I will be watching closely to see what the European Commission will do on Wednesday. And if the Eorepoean Commission makes a courageous decision and mandates some right to repair, we must continue to pay attention to how any policy will be implemented. You can be sure that Apple and those opposed to a right to repair will not accept any decision as final. This is how right to repair advocates see the issue as well. As Friday's Motherboard article notes: 'It's a question of whether [The European Commission] has the guts to stand up to Apple,' [Janet Gunter, co-founder of The Restart Project[6]\u2014a U.K. based group that teaches people how to repair electronics and lobbies for the right-to-repair] said. 'This is a symbolic but potentially transformative moment in policy terms. But we're not naive. We know we're going to have to be there at every turn.' Schweitzer agreed. 'The truth is that even if they commit to putting smartphones on the work plan, then we have to go through the whole process of going through the requirements. You never know what the outcome from that will be.'<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/03/right-to-repair-will-the-european-commission-have-the-guts-to-stand-up-to-apple-et-al-details-on-wednesday.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/03/right-to-repair-will-the-european-commission-have-the-guts-to-stand-up-to-apple-et-al-details-on-wednesday.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Doomsday scenarios[7], Environment[8], Europe[9], Guest Post[10], Politics[11], Regulations and regulators[12], Technology and innovation[13] on March 8, 2020[14] by Jerri-Lynn Scofield[15].

In the popular imagination they're greedy, heedless, and amoral, adept at price manipulations and dirty tricks. In reality, they often play a key role in making markets run smoothly. Their frequent trades make it easier for the rest of us to find someone to trade with, and their perpetual hunt for market inefficiencies can make prices more accurate. But sometimes speculators really are just greedy and amoral. Certainly that's true of the hedge funds that are at the heart of Wall Street's latest scandal, which surfaced last month when New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer brought civil charges against a New Jersey hedge fund called Canary Capital, which is run by Edward Stern, a son of the former <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Village Voice</emphasis> owner Leonard Stern. Canary, Spitzer alleges, engaged in an elaborate bunco straight out of David Maurer's classic \"The Big Con,\" effectively betting on horse races (in this case, mutual-fund prices) after they'd already been run. Canary operated the scheme with the help of mutual funds owned by some of the country's biggest financial institutions, including Bank of America, Bank One, and Janus Capital. In the weeks since, it's become clear that Canary (which quickly settled the charges) was not alone, and a host of mutual funds and brokerage houses have been implicated.</p><p>The offending strategies are called \"late trading\" and \"market timing.\" Late trading is illegal; market timing isn't, though most funds say they actively discourage it. Both take advantage of the fact that mutual-fund prices don't change during the day, the way stock prices do. Instead, they're set once, at 4 p.m. This establishes a level playing field for all investors: if you buy before four o'clock, you get that day's price, and if you buy after four o'clock you get the next day's price. Canary, though, conspired to buy funds after four o'clock while still paying that day's price. So when important news broke after four-news that was likely to boost the market or a particular fund the next day-Canary could buy the fund's shares and then flip them for a quick and easy profit. That's late trading.</p><p>Market timers play similar games with, among other things, mutual funds that have a lot of international stocks. Markets overseas close long before 4 p.m. New York time. The Tokyo Stock Exchange, for instance, closes at 2 a.m. So international mutual-fund prices, based on closing stock prices that are hours old, are \"stale.\" If something important happens in the U.S. market that will probably boost overseas markets the next day-say, a big tech rally-market timers buy the international mutual fund at its current cheap, stale price and then sell it the next day at a tidy profit.</p><p>The victims are ordinary investors; the profits come right out of their pockets. Hedge funds like Canary are the fluke worms of Wall Street, feeding on the strength of others. A Stanford Business School study found that this kind of market timing could be robbing investors of more than four billion dollars a year. Usually, big profits can be earned only if one takes on significantly more risk or uncovers new information. But the late traders and market timers risked little and uncovered nothing, since the news they traded on was already public. The late traders made money because they were able to trade when no one else could. Stern racked up some big returns, but it isn't very hard to score touchdowns while your opponent is sitting back in the locker room.</p><p>So how did Canary and its ilk get away with all this? Bribery, more or less. According to Spitzer, Canary cut a deal with the manager of a Bank of America mutual fund, who allowed it to trade until 6:30 p.m. In exchange, Canary parked millions of dollars in Bank of America bond funds. Canary also allegedly paid a firm called Security Trust a percentage of its profits in exchange for the right to trade after hours. Other mutual funds have given hedge funds market-timing privileges in exchange for their business. Janus has admitted that it let firms engage in market timing, even though objections were raised within the company. In April, for instance, Richard Garland, the C.E.O. of Janus's international division, sent the following e-mail to a grumbler there: \"I have no interest in building a business around market timers, but at the same time I do not want to turn away $10-20m!\" The exclamation point says it all.</p><p>In a famous essay about a Moroccan bazaar, the anthropologist Clifford Geertz demonstrated that in the economy of the bazaar information is unreliable, and you can never be sure that you aren't being ripped off; success comes from having the best connections, rather than the best product or the best price. Modern economies, on the other hand, are built on the idea that trading should be impersonal rather than personal, and that whom you know should not influence what you pay. Mutual funds, in a way, are supposed to be the embodiment of that-truly democratic financial instruments, carefully regulated, transparent, open to all. Wall Street itself may be a bazaar economy, guided by personal connections, quid pro quos, and fleecings of the greater fool. But mutual funds were meant to be different.</p><p>In this respect, the late-trading scandal is even more troubling than Enron or WorldCom or the Internet bubble. Investors who kept their entire 401(k) in Enron stock were not entirely blameless, after all. They let their easy-money dreams get the better of their judgment. Most mutual-fund investors, though, can't be blamed. They thought they'd left the bazaar behind long ago.

In the past week, at the urging of several prominent MAGA personalities and elected officials, over 500,000 new users have signed up for Parler, the social media app for conservatives who truly love and value free speech (wait for it).It should be a perfect solution. Conservatives can go on there and say all of the things that Twitter won't let them say, harass other users to their hearts content, and perhaps, as a result, other social media can be less of a garbage fire. They can stop pushing for congressional hearings about supposed \"social media censorship\" if they have a problem. Plus, they can see principles of the free market they claim to love so very much at work. </p><p>You think they'd be happy, but they're not.According to a Politico report,[4] many noted MAGA personalities actually don't like the site \u2014 because all of the liberals they hate so much, the very ones who have been facilitating their \"oppression\" by reporting them for harassment or otherwise violating the terms of service, aren't there. And if they aren't there, who are they going to \"influence\"?In fact, they're so lonely that the social media site is willing to pay any progressive with 50K or more followers $20,000 to sign up. That's so sad! The MAGAfication problem is so bad that CEO and founder John Matze has openly begged progressive pundits to join the platform, offering a \"progressive bounty\" of $20,000 to any left-wing influencer with a following of 50,000 or more users on Twitter who makes an account. And with even establishment conservatives like Sens. Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney eschewing Parler for now, Trump supporters worry that Parler's influencers will be preaching to a MAGA choir forever. \"The question is not pure engagement. The question is influence,\" said Will Chamberlain, the editor-in-chief of the populist magazine Human Events. \"Twitter is interesting because there's so many people, prominent people, that can be influenced. Parler is not that.\"Clearly, they need us more than we need them. Personally, I would be totally fine just having a nice time on social media. Frankly, there's enough diversity of thought on the Left that even if every Republican ditched Twitter for Parler, I would suffer no loss of people on the internet being mad at me. Frankly, I get way more shit from Democrats over supporting things like Medicare For All and just cause terminations over at-will employment than I do from MAGA people \u2014 who are generally more concerned with whether or not I am a witch \u2014 and the shit I do get from the Right leaves a lot to be desired in terms of rigorous intellectual debate. @JonahDispatch Jonah just on this bitch <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co\">https://t.co</url> /hUplIuGCIp \u2014 The Iron Boar (@The Iron Boar)1593875466.0[5] And, as I would say if I ever answered the endless missives I get from overly entitled men, \"I have less than zero interest in 'debating' you.\"Noted Pizzagate Idiot Jack Posobiec also says he misses us. \"Until those people start getting on, I think it's going to be insular,\" said Jack Posobiec, a MAGA personality, former Pizzagate proponent and a correspondent for the pro-Trump One America News Network. \"And that's okay. People do like to be able to feel safe. People kind of feel like they're at a party right now. But the energy of Twitter comes from having different communities on it. And that that energy isn't there right now. Right now, Parler feels like a Trump rally.\" Chamberlain said Parler seems like an easy-out solution to what was ultimately conservatives' biggest internet problem: their perceived censorship on the platforms with the biggest audiences.\"There are a lot of libertarian-leaning legislators who find that really appealing because they don't like the idea of using government to regulate big tech,\" he said. \"They can say, 'Oh, look at Parler. We don't need to do anything, everybody should just move over to Parler.'\" [...]\"I would love to be able to leave for Parler,\" said Chamberlain. \"I would love to ignore Twitter, but my job isn't just getting engagement. My job is influencing public conversation, the way I see it. And I need Twitter for that.\"The issue, of course, is that people don't actually want their public conversation influenced by Will Chamberlain or Jack Posobiec. Speaking of rules. It turns out that Parler \u2014 the social media app for people who love free speech \u2014 has more of them than Twitter does. Last week, founder and CEO John Matze posted some Terms of Service[6] on the site: To the people complaining on Twitter about being banned on Parler. Please pay heed. Here are the very few basic rules we need you to follow on Parler. If these are not to your liking, we apologize, but we will enforce:\u2014 When you disagree with someone, posting pictures of your fecal matter in the comment section WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.\u2014 Your Username cannot be obscene like CumDumpster.\u2014 No pornography. Doesn't matter who, what, where, when or in what realm.\u2014 We will not allow you to spam other people trying to speak with unrelated comments like \"Fuck you\" in every comment. It's stupid. It's pointless. Grow up.\u2014 You cannot threaten to kill anyone in the comment section. Sorry, never going to be okayIf ever in doubt, ask yourself if you would say it on the streets of New York or national television.Aside  from the killing people thing, you can do pretty much all of those things on Twitter. Although you can't have your username be cumdumpster, as it has already been taken.  Sorry. As mentioned, the site has already banned a whole bunch of people. Because of how much they love free speech.Pretty much all of my leftist friends joined Parler to screw with MAGA folks, and every last one of them was banned <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/a4kal4YeZt\">https://t.co/a4kal4YeZt</url> \u2014 Respectable Lawyer (@Respectable Lawyer)1593197881.0[7] Since the very beginning of this \"social media censorship\" war, the Right has vastly overestimated its appeal and how muchanyone wants to spend their spare time getting pelted with racist and sexist insults all day on a social media site. If that was what people wanted, more than just the core group of MAGA devotees would flock to Parler. The free market they love so dearly would prove them right. People would agree that Parler (or Gab) was a better product and they would flee Twitter, just as they once left MySpace and Friendster and the many other social networks that have previously been supplanted by sites people liked better. Frankly, if Twitter were to give them what they want, that is probably exactly what would happen. All of the people they so desperately want access to would get up and go to a new site that did have moderation. Because no one likes a total cesspool. The fact is, MAGA people are not selling anything anyone who isn't a MAGA person wants to buy. They need us more than we need them. They want access to us, but we do not want or need access to them. Therefore, if they want us around, they have to play by the rules. Sorry.[Politico[8]]Wonkette is independent and fully funded by readers like you. Click below to tip us!

In the past week, at the urging of several prominent MAGA personalities and elected officials, over 500,000 new users have signed up for Parler, the social media app for conservatives who truly love and value free speech (wait for it).   It should be a perfect solution. Conservatives can go on there and say all of the things that Twitter won't let them say, harass other users to their hearts content, and perhaps, as a result, other social media can be less of a garbage fire. They can stop pushing for congressional hearings about supposed \"social media censorship\" if they have a problem. Plus, they can see principles of the free market they claim to love so very much at work.   You think they'd be happy, but they're not.   According to a Politico report, many noted MAGA personalities actually don't like the site \u2014 because all of the liberals they hate so much, the very ones who have been facilitating their \"oppression\" by reporting them for harassment or otherwise violating the terms of service, aren't there. And if they aren't there, who are they going to \"influence\"?   In fact, they're so lonely that the social media site is willing to pay any progressive with 50K or more followers $20,000 to sign up. That's so sad!  The MAGAfication problem is so bad that CEO and founder John Matze has openly begged progressive pundits to join the platform, offering a \"progressive bounty\" of $20,000 to any left-wing influencer with a following of 50,000 or more users on Twitter who makes an account. And with even establishment conservatives like Sens. Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney eschewing Parler for now, Trump supporters worry that Parler's influencers will be preaching to a MAGA choir forever.   \"The question is not pure engagement. The question is influence,\" said Will Chamberlain, the editor-in-chief of the populist magazine Human Events. \"Twitter is interesting because there's so many people, prominent people, that can be influenced. Parler is not that.\"  Clearly, they need us more than we need them. Personally, I would be totally fine just having a nice time on social media. Frankly, there's enough diversity of thought on the Left that even if every Republican ditched Twitter for Parler, I would suffer no loss of people on the internet being mad at me. Frankly, I get way more shit from Democrats over supporting things like Medicare For All and just cause terminations over at-will employment than I do from MAGA people \u2014 who are generally more concerned with whether or not I am a witch \u2014 and the shit I do get from the Right leaves a lot to be desired in terms of rigorous intellectual debate.  @JonahDispatch Jonah just on this bitch <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/hUplIuGCIp\">https://t.co/hUplIuGCIp</url> \u2014 The Iron Boar (@The Iron Boar) 1593875466.0  And, as I would say if I ever answered the endless missives I get from overly entitled men, \"I have less than zero interest in 'debating' you.\"   Noted Pizzagate Idiot Jack Posobiec also says he misses us.   \"Until those people start getting on, I think it's going to be insular,\" said Jack Posobiec, a MAGA personality, former Pizzagate proponent and a correspondent for the pro-Trump One America News Network. \"And that's okay. People do like to be able to feel safe. People kind of feel like they're at a party right now. But the energy of Twitter comes from having different communities on it. And that that energy isn't there right now. Right now, Parler feels like a Trump rally.\"   Chamberlain said Parler seems like an easy-out solution to what was ultimately conservatives' biggest internet problem: their perceived censorship on the platforms with the biggest audiences.   \"There are a lot of libertarian-leaning legislators who find that really appealing because they don't like the idea of using government to regulate big tech,\" he said. \"They can say, 'Oh, look at Parler. We don't need to do anything, everybody should just move over to Parler.'\" [...]   \"I would love to be able to leave for Parler,\" said Chamberlain. \"I would love to ignore Twitter, but my job isn't just getting engagement. My job is influencing public conversation, the way I see it. And I need Twitter for that.\"  The issue, of course, is that people don't actually want their public conversation influenced by Will Chamberlain or Jack Posobiec.   Speaking of rules. It turns out that Parler \u2014 the social media app for people who love free speech \u2014 has more of them than Twitter does. Last week, founder and CEO John Matze posted some Terms of Service on the site:  To the people complaining on Twitter about being banned on Parler. Please pay heed.   Here are the very few basic rules we need you to follow on Parler. If these are not to your liking, we apologize, but we will enforce:   \u2014 When you disagree with someone, posting pictures of your fecal matter in the comment section WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.   \u2014 Your Username cannot be obscene like CumDumpster.   \u2014 No pornography. Doesn't matter who, what, where, when or in what realm.   \u2014 We will not allow you to spam other people trying to speak with unrelated comments like \"Fuck you\" in every comment. It's stupid. It's pointless. Grow up.   \u2014 You cannot threaten to kill anyone in the comment section. Sorry, never going to be okay   If ever in doubt, ask yourself if you would say it on the streets of New York or national television.  Aside from the killing people thing, you can do pretty much all of those things on Twitter. Although you can't have your username be cumdumpster, as it has already been taken.       Sorry.   As mentioned, the site has already banned a whole bunch of people. Because of how much they love free speech.  Pretty much all of my leftist friends joined Parler to screw with MAGA folks, and every last one of them was banned\u2026 <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/a4kal4YeZt\">https://t.co/a4kal4YeZt</url> \u2014 Respectable Lawyer (@Respectable Lawyer) 1593197881.0  Since the very beginning of this \"social media censorship\" war, the Right has vastly overestimated its appeal and how muchanyone wants to spend their spare time getting pelted with racist and sexist insults all day on a social media site. If that was what people wanted, more than just the core group of MAGA devotees would flock to Parler. The free market they love so dearly would prove them right. People would agree that Parler (or Gab) was a better product and they would flee Twitter, just as they once left MySpace and Friendster and the many other social networks that have previously been supplanted by sites people liked better. Frankly, if Twitter were to give them what they want, that is probably exactly what would happen. All of the people they so desperately want access to would get up and go to a new site that did have moderation. Because no one likes a total cesspool.   The fact is, MAGA people are not selling anything anyone who isn't a MAGA person wants to buy. They need us more than we need them. They want access to us, but we do not want or need access to them. Therefore, if they want us around, they have to play by the rules. Sorry.   [ Politico ]   Wonkette is independent and fully funded by readers like you. Click below to tip us!

Plus, they can see principles of the free market they claim to love so very much at work.   You think they'd be happy, but they're not.   According to a Politico report, many noted MAGA personalities actually don't like the site \u2014 because all of the liberals they hate so much, the very ones who have been facilitating their \"oppression\" by reporting them for harassment or otherwise violating the terms of service, aren't there. And if they aren't there, who are they going to \"influence\"?   In fact, they're so lonely that the social media site is willing to pay any progressive with 50K or more followers $20,000 to sign up. That's so sad!   The MAGAfication problem is so bad that CEO and founder John Matze has openly begged progressive pundits to join the platform, offering a \"progressive bounty\" of $20,000 to any left-wing influencer with a following of 50,000 or more users on Twitter who makes an account. And with even establishment conservatives like Sens. Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney eschewing Parler for now, Trump supporters worry that Parler's influencers will be preaching to a MAGA choir forever.   \"The question is not pure engagement. The question is influence,\" said Will Chamberlain, the editor-in-chief of the populist magazine Human Events. \"Twitter is interesting because there's so many people, prominent people, that can be influenced. Parler is not that.\"   Clearly, they need us more than we need them. Personally, I would be totally fine just having a nice time on social media. Frankly, there's enough diversity of thought on the Left that even if every Republican ditched Twitter for Parler, I would suffer no loss of people on the internet being mad at me. Frankly, I get way more shit from Democrats over supporting things like Medicare For All and just cause terminations over at-will employment than I do from MAGA people \u2014 who are generally more concerned with whether or not I am a witch \u2014 and the shit I do get from the Right leaves a lot to be desired in terms of rigorous intellectual debate.   And, as I would say if I ever answered the endless missives I get from overly entitled men, \"I have less than zero interest in 'debating' you.\"   Noted Pizzagate Idiot Jack Posobiec also says he misses us.   \"Until those people start getting on, I think it's going to be insular,\" said Jack Posobiec, a MAGA personality, former Pizzagate proponent and a correspondent for the pro-Trump One America News Network. \"And that's okay. People do like to be able to feel safe. People kind of feel like they're at a party right now. But the energy of Twitter comes from having different communities on it. And that that energy isn't there right now. Right now, Parler feels like a Trump rally.\"   Chamberlain said Parler seems like an easy-out solution to what was ultimately conservatives' biggest internet problem: their perceived censorship on the platforms with the biggest audiences.   \"There are a lot of libertarian-leaning legislators who find that really appealing because they don't like the idea of using government to regulate big tech,\" he said. \"They can say, 'Oh, look at Parler. We don't need to do anything, everybody should just move over to Parler.'\" [...]   \"I would love to be able to leave for Parler,\" said Chamberlain. \"I would love to ignore Twitter, but my job isn't just getting engagement. My job is influencing public conversation, the way I see it. And I need Twitter for that.\"   The issue, of course, is that people don't actually want their public conversation influenced by Will Chamberlain or Jack Posobiec.   Speaking of rules. It turns out that Parler \u2014 the social media app for people who love free speech \u2014 has more of them than Twitter does. Last week, founder and CEO John Matze posted some Terms of Service on the site:   To the people complaining on Twitter about being banned on Parler. Please pay heed.   Here are the very few basic rules we need you to follow on Parler. If these are not to your liking, we apologize, but we will enforce:   \u2014 When you disagree with someone, posting pictures of your fecal matter in the comment section WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.   \u2014 Your Username cannot be obscene like CumDumpster.   \u2014 No pornography. Doesn't matter who, what, where, when or in what realm.   \u2014 We will not allow you to spam other people trying to speak with unrelated comments like \"Fuck you\" in every comment. It's stupid. It's pointless. Grow up.   \u2014 You cannot threaten to kill anyone in the comment section. Sorry, never going to be okay   If ever in doubt, ask yourself if you would say it on the streets of New York or national television.   Aside from the killing people thing, you can do pretty much all of those things on Twitter. Although you can't have your username be cumdumpster, as it has already been taken.   Sorry.   As mentioned, the site has already banned a whole bunch of people. Because of how much they love free speech.   Pretty much all of my leftist friends joined Parler to screw with MAGA folks, and every last one of them was banned\u2026 <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/a4kal4YeZt\">https://t.co/a4kal4YeZt</url>   \u2014 Respectable Lawyer (@Respectable Lawyer)1593197881.0   Since the very beginning of this \"social media censorship\" war, the Right has vastly overestimated its appeal and how muchanyone wants to spend their spare time getting pelted with racist and sexist insults all day on a social media site. If that was what people wanted, more than just the core group of MAGA devotees would flock to Parler. The free market they love so dearly would prove them right. People would agree that Parler (or Gab) was a better product and they would flee Twitter, just as they once left MySpace and Friendster and the many other social networks that have previously been supplanted by sites people liked better. Frankly, if Twitter were to give them what they want, that is probably exactly what would happen. All of the people they so desperately want access to would get up and go to a new site that did have moderation. Because no one likes a total cesspool.   The fact is, MAGA people are not selling anything anyone who isn't a MAGA person wants to buy. They need us more than we need them. They want access to us, but we do not want or need access to them. Therefore, if they want us around, they have to play by the rules. Sorry.   [Politico]   Wonkette is independent and fully funded by readers like you. Click below to tip us!

It would curb the way in which the firms operate, making them responsible for the liabilities of companies they buy, including pension obligations.</p><p>\"For decades, Washington has lived by a simple rule: if it's good for Wall Street, it's good for the economy,\" she wrote recently. \"To raise wages, help small businesses, and spur economic growth, we need to shut down the Wall Street giveaways and rein in the financial industry, so it stops sucking money out of the rest of the economy.\"</p><p>In the past, Wall Street did not take Warren especially seriously, says Charles Gabriel, president of Capital Alpha, which advises a number of major institutional investors. However, the faltering Biden campaign has changed the landscape.</p><p>\"There don't seem to be strong moderate candidates, and there was always a feeling that Biden was low energy and his campaign would risk flaming out,\" Gabriel says. \"But there has also been false confidence that Warren and Sanders would balance off against each other, splitting the liberal vote deep into the campaign.</p><p>\"And that perceptions of Biden's electability would help him long enough to prevail. That premise seems to be flagging much sooner than anyone would have thought.\"</p><p>Gabriel has taken a number of calls from clients alarmed by what a Warren presidency might mean for investors.</p><p>\"She is like a dagger pointed at Wall Street. She has attacked Wall Street for being corrupt. Some of the things she has written about private equity have been astounding. There are all kinds of reasons why people have been a bit freaked out by Warren.</p><p>\"Wall Street does not like being villainised and I think it is most concerned that Trump's deregulatory agenda will be eroded fairly quickly.\"</p><p>Should Warren win, observers believe she will put allies in place in key positions, such as the Federal Reserve. How quickly she could implement the rest of her agenda depends on whether the Democrats are able to take control of the Senate. Should the Republicans retain control, Mitch McConnell could mire Warren in a legislative morass.</p><p>The Massachusetts senator forged her political reputation in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. An expert on bankruptcy, she helped establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, designed to safeguard middle class families from what she regarded as the predatory practices of Wall Street. Brandon Barford, a partner at Washington-based Beacon Policy Advisors, believes she will go much further than just targeting banks and payday lenders.</p><p>\"Investors primarily think her focus is financial services. That is not the case at all. If she becomes president, she will mimic Trump, with a lot of aggressive executive orders early on. What we are talking about here is a fundamental reworking of the system.</p><p>\"Take the ruthlessness of the Trump administration and mix it with far more consistent politics - that is what you get with Elizabeth Warren. She will advance her agenda in a far more skilful and disciplined way.\"</p><p>Dec Mullarkey of SLC Management, which has assets worth $168bn (\u00a3136bn), believes a Warren administration would deliver a jolt to the markets. \"Under Warren's progressive agenda, the equity market would go through a significant correction, as most of her favoured policies would significantly constrain existing business models in major sectors. She has pledged to roll back Trump's corporate tax breaks and favours a heavy hand in regulating a broad range of US sectors.\"</p><p>Tim Anderson, managing director of TJM Investments, is more blunt in his assessment: \"I think her policies would be very destructive for the US economy.</p><p>\"If she is nominated, she is going to have major problems raising money from corporate interests who want to maintain the free market economy.\"</p><p>Her ultra-progressive agenda will present a challenge for her party's many friends on Wall Street who might find themselves having to choose between their wallets and their social consciences.</p><p>According to the Centre for Responsive Politics, the securities and investment industry has been generous to the Democrats, donating almost $100m to the party last year - about $10m more than the Republicans raked in.</p><p>\"There are more closet supporters for Elizabeth Warren on Wall Street than people realise,\" says Charles Myers, chairman of Signum Global Advisors, which numbers financial institutions and multinational firms among its clients.</p><p>In any case, he says, there may be less to fear from Warren - who on the campaign has insisted she was a \"capitalist to my bones\" - than self-proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders.</p><p>With the Democrats facing a tough battle to win control of the Senate, Warren's freedom to manoeuvre could be restricted.</p><p>\"She will have to govern as a centrist. She won't get Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and the wealth tax through the Senate,\" Myers says.</p><p>\"Legislatively she won't get much through, but with executive orders she will snap back much of Trump's deregulatory agenda. I think the market is already starting to price in some of the risk of a Warren administration.

Recently, the IMF, along with central banks and traditional financial institutions, all have raised the alarm on the burgeoning fintech industry and how it will transform financial services in the years to come.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The marriage of financial services and technology is not new to the 21st century. The Sumerians began experimenting with fintech as far back as 3,000BC, and are believed to be the first civilisation to invent writing in what is now known as the cuneiform script. This language was used primarily for book-keeping as the Sumerians discovered the advantages of recording financial transactions. Archaeologists believe that the first time humans ever used writing was for accounting purposes - they continued to rely on oral traditions for the rest. This was the first truly disruptive technology in the financial industry.</p><p>Since then, the industry has evolved and transformed continuously on the back of technology. Credit cards, ATMs, electronic stock trading, online and mobile banking, and e-commerce are all examples of technologies that have disrupted the sector. Each development has brought anxieties and concerns - think credit cards and hyper-consumerism, online banking and hackers, cryptocurrency and the dark web.</p><p>What makes the latest disruptions to the industry different, perhaps even more alarming, as Lagarde seems to suggest? One of the key reasons is that fintech developments over the last decade have posed an existential threat to traditional banks.</p><p>The marriage of financial services and technology is not new.</p><p>In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, customer confidence in big banks was severely shaken by the exposure of their irresponsible and unethical behaviour. The banking sector was irreparably scathed and customers began to search for alternatives for their financial needs. Meanwhile, the big financial institutions were forced to lay off scores of talented workers. This opened the space for the fintech industry to develop as the redundant workforce looked for alternate employment and customers looked for alternate vendors.</p><p>The fintech industry has since made leaps and bounds, providing many of the same services as traditional banks, but with new technologies and business models. Big Tech, telecom companies and start-ups have been pioneers in this space, disrupting the industry, eating into the existing market share of big banks and successfully infiltrating previously unbanked markets. Easypaisa is one such success story.</p><p>Lagarde, in her statement, rightfully directed attention to Big Tech, \"who will use their enormous customer bases and deep pockets to offer financial products based on big data and artificial intelligence\". Big Tech poses the greatest threat to traditional banks for several reasons. WhatsApp, for example, has over 1.5 billion users. Facebook recently announced a mobile payments feature to WhatsApp, making it, in Zuckerberg's words, \"as easy to send money to someone as it is to send a photo\". As Facebook enters the payments space, it has a value proposition that sets it apart from any bank along with a massive customer base ready for the taking.</p><p>Moreover, as Big Tech has become trendy among both prospective employees and customers, traditional banks are increasingly seen as dinosaurs. Big Tech recruits top talent from the world's top universities, pays highly competitive salaries and invests in creating trendy work experiences. Unbanked customers and younger generations also find it easier to relate to Big Tech, while the world of banks and brick-and-mortar branches seems inaccessible and inefficient. Though banks are paying more attention to digital banking, they are mostly playing catch-up.</p><p>Finally, the traditional banking industry has always struggled to bring unbanked people into the net, which increasingly forewarns of a future where traditional banks are irrelevant. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation estimates that 1.7bn people currently lack access to formal financial services. Digitisation is seen as a key to democratising such services, and Big Tech is far better positioned to provide modern fintech than traditional banks with their legacy IT systems and legacy mentality.</p><p>So, considering Lagarde's warning, is an intervention in the fintech industry needed? Big Tech's anti-competitive practices must indeed be curbed, and privacy and security concerns around fintech must be addressed. However, regulators must resist succumbing to the powerful lobbying of traditional financial institutions. The fintech industry should be nurtured as a means of modernising financial services and including unbanked populations. If that means the end of traditional banks' hegemony, it may prove a positive development after all.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINDLY-FINDAI1706201900020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC3-JXT1-JCH9-G0G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381911</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Daily All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Financial Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 17, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Incumbent banks, challenger banks, and account aggregator products are all eyeing the transition to marketplace banking, which is driven by customers, market and competition. In times where customers are moving away from banks to non-bank entities for their financial service needs[1], customers' trust in banks has been diminishing, particularly in their ability to provide unbiased and high-quality advice. Banks are pressured to find alternative means to reestablish customer trust and relationships. </p><p>'Forty per cent of customers expressed decreased dependence on their bank as their primary financial services provider and have rather used non-bank providers for financial services in the last 12 months' - Ernst &amp; Young's 2016 Global Consumer Banking Survey Big tech firms, such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Alibaba, are making increasingly bold forays into the financial sector. These non-bank players (such as Wechat, Alipay and ApplePay) and neo-banks (such as Chime, Digit and Aspiration in the United States) are altering the banking customers' expectations and behaviour. We see Google offers payments via Google Pay, while Amazon and Shopify are offering short-term cash advances or loans to their sellers. Furthermore, their online sites or user interfaces have conditioned consumers and customers to an intuitive e-commerce or marketplace-like user experience. Also Read:Why P2P lending can be the end of banking as we know it[2] With these factors in play, traditional banks are rethinking their roles and relevance to their customers, as well as reviewing their business and delivery models. Some have responded with marketplace banking. What is marketplace banking? How does it work? The marketplace banking model is an ecosystem of aggregated products and services sharing similar characteristics presented to a customer as a set of offers[3] with addressing specific customer needs in mind. These products and services could come from different ecosystem partners such as retail or healthcare players, in addition to those offered by the banks themselves. This approach offers transparency, choices, better pricing and better matching of banking customers' needs - the key benefits of any successful marketplace. We have seen a couple of variations in the marketplace banking operating models. First, there are those that aggregate to provide a wide menu of choices for the products and services on their marketplace platforms, such as Go-Bear[4], PolicyAdvisor.com[5], and Starling's Marketplace[6]. Another model stems from the bank offering a one-stop-shop platform enabling deep integrations with select third-party ecosystem partners to address very specific customer needs, such as the most recently launched online car marketplace by VTB Bank[7], Russia's second-largest bank. What is a better model? Personally, I believe the best banking marketplace model where it best addresses the needs of the customers at the right time, at the right place and one which aligns with the maturity of the market it serves. Also Read:Digital banking in Asia Pacific: What we can expect to happen in 2020[8] For instance, higher frequency purchases or lower pricing banking or insurance products may work better in a financial services aggregation platform where choices, reviews, and recommendations are what matters most to a customer. However, for low frequency, big-ticket items or life significant events such as buying a car, buying a house, or having the first child, the customers are generally overwhelmed by a flux of confusion and decisions with multiple information points to understand their options and arrive at the decisions they are most comfortable with. In such situations, having a trusted marketplace that offers guidance and advisory with a one-stop-shop proposition to help navigate the tedious and complicated process is more than welcome. Banks occupy a position of authority for their customers and could help narrow down their choices for their customers. So, it all boils down to the customers and how as a bank, you could deliver greater value to your customers. The traditional operating model of banks making money by charging fees for products and services with a product-focus approach is fast becoming obsolete. Banks need to create customer value by, for example helping them to save money on foreign exchange fees, switching over to a lower-cost energy provider, offer pre-approved mortgage loans quickly, or streamline supplier financing. In some of these value creation processes, the bank could take a referral fee from the beneficiary provider (for example, energy provider or property listing platforms). Who has deployed it successfully?  Many bank marketplaces seem to be launched in the last five years with varying degrees of success and progress. GoBear[9] was launched in 2015 to operate an online financial products marketplace that offers over 1,800 consumer financial products such as travel, health and car insurance, credit cards, and personal loans. It offers a smart targeting system that matches users' profiles to the financial products they wanted. Also Read: How unique lending platforms boost small businesses in Southeast Asia[10] Globally, GoBear has reached 40 million people[11], and is active in Asian markets, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. In Canada, there is a similar marketplace to GoBear called PolicyAdvisor.com[12] which is launched by a Toronto-based Insurtech startup in 2017. PolicyAdvisor.com is an online marketplace that aims to 'take away the pain' of searching for life insurance, critical illness insurance and mortgage protection products[13] for the Canadians. It plays as a matchmaker, connecting Canadians to insurance products that suit their needs, such as financial security, debt reduction, family planning and protection or future retirement. It is a mobile-first platform that offers 'real-world advice' from experienced licensed brokers and advisors[14] whom clients can speak to online, on the phone, or through video. In the United Kingdom, Starling Marketplace, owned by the London-based Starling Bank[15], puts products from other partnering fintech providers, lifestyle products and services providers onto its in-app marketplace. It competes head-to-head with Revolut[16], which offers insurance and wealth management services to its customers in-app, as well as access to consumer loans via a partnership with peer-to-peer lender Lending Works[17]. Coming back to Asia, there have been a few interesting banking marketplaces which leverage ecosystem partnerships with non-financial services providers to address specific customer needs in their purchasing journey and decisions. This was in response to the new Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) rules in 2017 which allow banks to operate and invests in digital platforms that match buyers and sellers of consumer goods and services. Also Read:5 key trends in banking for 2020 and beyond[18] These banking marketplaces are owned and operated by two leading financial services group in Southeast Asia - OCBC Bank[19] and DBS Bank[20]. OCBC Bank launched the OCBC OneAdvisor Home in January 2018 as a one-stop advisory service portal for property purchases[21] to enable buyers to do a home search based on affordability criteria. It provides information such as property listings, rules and regulations, comprehensive affordability advice to help residential purchasers, and policy details, and even offer customers the option to speak to mortgage specialists for consultation or loan applications. All property listings came from OCBC Bank's ecosystem partners, EdgeProp[22], 99.co[23], and Soreal[24]. OCBC Bank has also launched an e-commerce platform called mumstruly.com[25] targeting mothers and mothers-to-be but was shut down late 2019 due to change in strategic directives[26]. That was OCBC's first foray into e-commerce, offering a range of goods and services, from health services to baby and motherhood products as well as wealth and insurance products. The bank partnered up with Asia-based healthcare, retail and service providers to offer a one-stop-shop service. DBS Bank[27], on the other hand, has launched four consumer needs-driven banking marketplaces since 2017 - DBS Car Marketplace, DBS Electricity Marketplace, DBS Property Marketplace, and DBS Travel Marketplace. It was named both the World's Best Digital Bank and the Best Bank in the World in 2018. DBS Car Marketplace[28] was the first marketplace launched in July 2017 to offer a one-stop solution for car buyers and sellers, providing all the relevant services and information the customers may require in their car purchases or sales journey. Also Read:Think like a fintech company: How banks can capitalise on the digital banking revolution[29] It partners sgCarMart and Carro to establish Singapore's largest direct seller-to-buyer car marketplace for car listings, while the bank offers car insurance and car loans. In its first year of operation, the marketplace attracted more than 550,000 unique visits, 40 million views, and 2.6 million visitors a month. Almost eight months later, DBS launchesDBS Electricity Marketplace[30] to allow consumers to compare various pricing plans, hunt for deals and make a seamless switch of electricity retailers. Four months after, DBS Property[31] Marketplace was launched with a similar proposition as OCBC OneAdvisor Home. DBS's property listing partners are EdgeProp and Averspace. It was reported that the DBS Property Marketplace has generated more than SG$300 million in home loan requests within the first 12 months. The last e-commerce platform launched by DBS in July 2019[32] is the DBS Travel Marketplace. DBS has partnered with Singapore Airlines, Expedia Partner Solutions, and Chubb Insurance Singapore to create a one-stop platform where travellers can book flights, hotels, and complimentary travel insurance in one place. The bank wants to generate customer value by helping travellers reduce the time and effort they need to spend on multiple channels for their pre-vacation planning. In addition, the bank's customers get free travel insurance and can use their DBS or POSB Daily$ rewards points to offset travel costs. Singapore banks are not the only contenders in Asia. In India, Bank of Baroda, India's third-largest bank, announced its plans to launch an online marketplace to offer banking services and farm-related products[33] last year in July. The state-owned lender is keen to enhance its online digital capabilities and is seeking a partner to supply 'digital commerce platform' to provide assistance to merchants on catalogue management, purchase management fulfilment, pricing, promotion and other similar services. Also Read: What makes investments in fintech and alternative lending in SEA promising?[34] These Asia-based banking marketplaces are showcasing how banks could create meaningful ecosystem partnerships by collaborating and innovating together with partners through a marketplace platform. In this way, customers will benefit from a seamless, fuss-free experience that brings together the best of banking solutions and relevant products and services needed by customers to address specific consumer needs. Are you ready to brave the new world of Banking Marketplaces? Marketplaces are gradually becoming a more attractive banking business and operating model that increases customer convenience and efficiency by providing targeted solutions to match their needs while allowing banks to leverage their massive business and enterprise customer networks and partner with the right marketplace ecosystem providers. This also enables banks to strengthen their position in an environment where customers' trust in banks was diminishing. Banking marketplaces could be an effective strategy where it offers tremendous convenience as a one-stop-shop with a comprehensive range of curated products and services to address specific customer needs. Customers also enjoy greater peace of mind knowing that the platform and products are trustworthy and backed by their bank. In a report by McKinsey &amp; Company[35], it was described that self-service and greater transparency give customers more autonomy, automatically translating into higher customer satisfaction. This could strengthen customer engagement, causing new customer acquisition and lead generation. The convenience, security, and satisfaction all create a more meaningful customer experience, thus reducing customer loss and churn. However, the journey to becoming a successful banking marketplace is paved with difficulties and possibly, failures, as seen from the many failed online marketplaces in the retail and other non-banking industry sectors. The success stories to-date suggest a successful banking marketplace involves engaging and integrating with the right ecosystem partners to deliver a robust marketplace ecosystem.

It is definitely more challenging to execute. Nonetheless, it is mission-critical to start strategising on how to embark on this journey as the customers are changing fast while neo-banks and challenger banks are responding to the change and well accepted by the banking customers in this digital era. Braving a new frontier and heading towards a new business model is daunting but essential for future survival. - Editor's note:e27 aims to foster thought leadership by publishing contributions from the community.

Fast forward almost ten years and you could say the same, and much worse, about surveillance capitalism, according to Shoshana Zuboff author of 'Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This time though the squid is even bigger and it is jamming its blood funnel, via smart phones, smart TVs, tablets and soon even smart homes, into every last nook and cranny of our individual and collective privacy. The very thing that was suppose to set us free and serve us, as internet creator Tim Berners Lee had hoped, has now evolved as Lee said 'into an engine of inequity and division; swayed by powerful forces who use it for their own agendas.' The capture and commodification of our data, the predatory construction of user profiles and surveillance is in the DNA of surveillance capitalism. Cambridge Analytica is only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Zuboff points out in her brilliant book that all pervasive, stealthy and omnipresent surveillance capitalism has exploited human experience to collect free raw material for translation into behavorial data. The behavorial surplus-our emotions, fears, our voices and our personalities-is then fed into thinking 'machine intelligence', and then reconfigured into predictive products. Products specifically designed to anticipate what you will do today, tomorrow, and next week by means of behavorial modification. But not only does surveillance capitalism predict it also nudges us, influencing our behaviour through personalised and intrusive targeted advertising.</p><p>As she memorably puts it: once we searched Google, now Google (and the rest) searches us. We have been digitally dispossessed by the remorseless logic of big tech's profit imperative. Whereas before it was the social and natural world that was subordinated to the market dynamic now, as she puts it, it is our very human experience that is ripe for extractive profit.</p><p>Our data, remorsely collected in recent years, without our true consent, has been weaponised against us with military efficiency, as stated by Tim Cook that is, of Apple, no less-creating a digital profile that lets companies know us better than we know ourselves.</p><p>Far-fetched or implausible? Ponder this.</p><p>Wearable emotion trackers have integrated sensors which measure and track the wearer's biometric signals (skin temperature, heart rate and blood volume pulse). The data is then sent via wireless technologies such as Bluetooth to a connected appliance. A huge data-set set is then compiled, no doubt, which can bealgorithmically analysed so as to spot patterns and correlations from which future behaviour can be predicted. Perhaps every time we are feeling a bit down we'll get a zap of Oxytocin or Serotonin from our watches.</p><p>This is all marketed as consumer wellness, but it is really an assault on our unconscious selves that helps businesses sell dodgy products and increase revenue. Our most intimate micro feelings and sensations mined in real time just for profit.</p><p>Think that outlandish? Ponder further. Amazon recently patented a 'labour saving' design for wristbands that can track warehouse workers' hands which uses ultrasonic vibrations to nudge them quicker into more efficient working practices. Not long ago this was the stuff of dystopian sci-fi; now electronic supervision from a distance so as workers can't deviate from narrowly assigned roles is considered a possibility.</p><p>Twenty or thirty years ago people would have been indignant at such proposals and personal violations. In the late 1980s German greens fought with the state over a national census: only sheep are counted, was the slogan. In 1983 the German constitutional court ruled that proposed census questions were gratuitously intrusive and that the information could possibly be abused. Times have changed.</p><p>Recently two of the elite digital priesthood, Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg, called for more privacy and regulation of the internet. Zuckerberg also promised thatFacebook 'will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure.'</p><p>Both calls are brazen, self serving and cynical, and exercises in misdirection. The principles of trust, privacy and ethical behaviour were never high on their agenda as they grew their digital, social and cultural hegemonies. They've done little to protect our data-actually, legally speaking it's their data-and that was the way it was always meant to be. Laws protecting our data have long since been undermined by a labyrinth of online contracts and terms and conditions that nobody reads, and what could be euphemistically called a light-touch regulatory framework.</p><p>As most of the US big tech European headquarters are based in Ireland this means the Irish data protection commission is the de facto European regulator since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into being.Yet the Irish data commissioner last year said it would not investigate Google's secret tracking of the location of Android users. Best not to upset the empire too much with notions about privacy and freedom rights of individuals, I suppose. A few years ago former TaoiseachEnda Kenny said Ireland was the 'best little country' in the world to do business in. Maybe that's what he meant.</p><p>Silicon Valley, which has always been a kind of digital scientology populated by people with mid Atlantic upspeak as their lingua franca, have knowingly broken the social contract, now they've been caught and as their profits might suffer they are clamouring for regulation.</p><p>Zuckerberg came to Dublin recently and in a report by the Irish Times-which read like a facebook press release-he said of privacy rules in Europe via GDPR, 'I think it's a good foundation that encodes a lot of important values around people being able to choose how their data is used\u2026' Facebook grew relentlessly on a quasi-religious drive of hovering up data almost at any cost. Drunk on behavorial metrics and tracking our interactions it behaved like that blood sucking giant squid, smelling money wherever it latches onto human curiosity and weakness.</p><p>Our data being 'used' (mercilessly mined, exploited and sold off to the highest bidder he meant) is just mere PR deflection, risible if it wasn't so obvious. We should choose, and no one else, how our data is used, if it is to be used at all.</p><p>This is self-serving propaganda by Zuckerberg. Silicon Valley PR bullshit trying to boost its tarnished 'brand reputation'. After all, even when you turn off tracking, Facebook still tracks you. Likewise, it follows you across the internet via code implanted in your browser. So much for Zuckerberg's much lauded promise to rebuild Facebook as a 'privacy-focused' platform.</p><p>More risible still, Facebook is actually paying the Daily Telegraph as part of a marketing campaign to run positive stories about it titled: 'Being human in the information age'. As Orwell might have said about these propaganda pieces: you couldn't make this shit up.</p><p>Shoshanna Zuboff accurately points out that the digital oligarchs are the robber barons of the 21st century. Their business model has been premised on deliberate 'psychic numbing' and our unconscious awareness of what they have been doing.</p><p>Big tech calling for regulation now is a cynical public relations strategy, for years they resisted regulation as it hindered 'innovation' and privacy was, according to Zuckerberg, no longer a social norm anyway. Yet the technologies they make billions off were only made possible by massive state subsidies and public research contracts. Without the US defence budget, American tax dollars in other words, generations of computers would not have been built. State capitalism in other words recast as free-market entrepreneurialism.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWSNTL-TNEWSINT0905201900129</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWSNTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2X-GPX1-JCH9-G1WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423892</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1341\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The News International All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The News International</publicationName><volume>Vol. 29</volume><issueNumber>No. 48</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 9, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

Defined by Karger Publishers as \"objective, quantifiable physiological and behavioral data that are collected and measured by means of digital devices such as portables, wearables, implantables, or digestibles,\" academics, pharmas, payers, and big tech are actively collecting and studying this entirely new class of information to understand, influence, or predict health-related outcomes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Objective data captured through digital devices can be wide-ranging and not traditionally viewed as health information. However, the intentionality of analysis can make many types of data fall into the realm of health or healthcare,\" says Carlos Rodarte, founder and managing director of digital health consultancy Volar Health.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This means learning if how you type and tap on your smartphone can indicate your mood, if the likelihood to take your meds increases or decreases based on engagement with your Facebook account, or if data from a smart blood pressure cuff can predict if you will develop a comorbidity.</p><p>This data can be collected in any number of ways, from targeted studies to \"data in the wild\" - large-scale sets of data collected without a study intent, but that can retrospectively be mined to identify correlations.</p><p>The potential payoff is not insignificant. In Rock Health's seminal report, The Emerging Influence of Digital Biomarkers on Healthcare, use cases include optimizing clinical trial recruitment, introducing targeted interventions, and individualizing medical policy plans.</p><p>But in a world where any data can be considered health data, how are organizations navigating ethical boundaries?</p><p>While the term digital biomarker may be new, the concept of digitally enabled behavioral medicine is not. In 2013, Dr. Camille Nebeker's study had all of the necessary ingredients: willing participants, informed consent, wearable devices - including a camera - and control of the data. Yet the Institutional Review Board (IRB) felt it was too risky.</p><p>All human research has risks, and it is the role of the IRB to determine if the benefits outweigh said risks, and if so, what protections should be put in place for human subjects.</p><p>As it turns out, the board's primary concern wasn't the safety of the participants, but rather the impact on bystanders that might have been in the vicinity, and whose images might have been captured by the camera. It occurred to Nebeker, assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego, that being at the very front end of new ways of doing research presented challenges.</p><p>An Absence of Standards</p><p>Researchers want the tech because it captures information they need. But they don't know how to address questions of collection, storage, and security. \"The questions became, 'What should we do with the 30,000 images we capture from every person during the study?' and 'What do we do with the GPS data?'\" Nebeker recalls.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mmm-online.com/commercial/healthcare-pharma-innovation-startups-technology-data/article/650443/\">5 of healthcare's hardest nuts to crack</url></p><p>It's this part - the evolution of informed consent - that presents one of the larger questions for researchers. When your digital footprint also includes information about your family or your social network, what are the protections for these individuals who did not consent?</p><p>In 2015, Nebeker's response was to launch the Connected and Open Research Ethics (CORE) initiative at the University of California, San Diego, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. By bringing researchers, ethics board members, technologists, and stakeholders together, CORE aims to build a body of best practices for the use of mobile imaging, pervasive sensing, social media, and location tracking in research.</p><p>In the absence of standards, Nebeker is forging a new path for academia. But she is quick to add that new standards are also required for private sector companies pursuing the digital footprint studies, pilots, or trials.</p><p>Pharma has rules and regulations, notes Nebeker. \"It deals with the FDA. It is accustomed to HIPAA compliance because it is dealing with health data with a patient under care.\" So while there is a learning curve, the basic ethics principles are in place.</p><p>A number of experts agree this is a place where pharma gets it right. Craig Lipset, head of clinical innovation at Pfizer, shared best practices reflective of an environment that is thoughtful about the deployment of new tech. He suggests limiting data capture, reducing collection to the essential.</p><p>\"I would avoid using a device that is capturing 20 different types of data if the research team's need is just for five,\" explains Lipset.</p><p>\"For example, basic actigraphy devices are by far the most common sensor in research studies today for high-fidelity data with a focused purpose.\" It is worth noting he considers location data a slippery slope to avoid.</p><p>Lipset is also mindful as to how his organization will need to evolve to adapt to changes in tech. He points to the convergence of research-grade and consumer devices. As consumer devices increase in sophistication, studies may move toward using a patient's own device. \"But if it is their own device, then it is really the patient sharing their data with us - not the other way around,\" he says.</p><p>\"It will be interesting to see what consent and permissions look like when people have full control over their data, and how granular patients will want those controls and permissions to be,\" adds Lipset.</p><p>\"Informed consent has a long way to go these days,\" agrees Nebeker.</p><p>A greater area for concern is the lack of standards within big technology companies, or those who make use of their data. \"Big tech companies are accustomed to capturing a lot of data about individuals, but the moment it becomes 'health' data, there are many considerations to account for,\" says Rodarte.</p><p>As researchers tap into the big data opportunities presented by all of our digital traces - from keystrokes to search data to social networking - they should have agreed-upon standards of practice to guide big data research of human subjects. Some even go so far as to suggest big tech could learn something from pharma.</p><p>\"As tech enters more and more into health, it will better understand the liabilities, risk, traditional research, and healthcare stakeholders have faced,\" notes Rodarte.</p><p>Nebeker shared the example of a big tech study within an assisted living center to understand cognitive decline. \"You know the steps to the toilet, when it flushes. The whole home is sensored,\" she explains. When she inquired about the IRB's stance on resident protections and informed consent, Nebeker says the answer was, \"Well, we have a legal team. There is no IRB.\"</p><p>Between Smoking Jackets and Lawyers</p><p>Historically, ethical concerns were the domain of classically trained philosophers and lawyers. For Bray Patrick-Lake, director of stakeholder engagement at Duke Clinical Research Institute, this presents a problem, as there is a big disconnect between those who determine which research moves forward and those who are most likely to benefit.</p><p>\"As the quality of life decreases, you are willing to make trade-offs. That needs to be considered,\" Patrick-Lake says, knowing some patients are willing to say, \"Take my data, or I will die.\"</p><p>But who gets to make that decision in the digital age? \"This is not for someone in a smoking jacket, by a fire, to think about what the risks might be,\" she adds.</p><p>This is not to say research should not have guidance and boundaries, or that the intellectual-philosophical perspective is not welcome.</p><p>For Patrick-Lake, it's about bringing tech into the research space and making sure it is not bogged down with regulatory issues. \"But we also need not ignore the history of bioethics. We do need to think through the unintended consequences,\" she says. One way to do this is for IRBs to consider the point of view of real people.</p><p>\"We are going to have to live with this period of discomfort, but we need to proceed thoughtfully. And we need to return to human-centered design,\" adds Patrick-Lake, whose work is centered around the engagement of patients, their families, and their communities.</p><p>Duke has a bioethics and stakeholder lab that does empirical and formative research. Patrick-Lake describes the importance of informal conversations, roundtables, and town halls, as well as formal research on patient preference in this new digital age.</p><p>This is also an approach taken by the Precision Medicine initiative, where Patrick-Lake serves as the co-chair of the National Institutes of Health advisory committee to the director working group. She also believes that pharma, while making great strides in this space, would benefit from engaging and educating stakeholders, but to date, the industry has only \"put its toe in the water.\"</p><p>Patrick-Lake also points to the inevitable evolution of the IRBs themselves. One suggestion is to include more \"real people\" that mirror the population being served, a sentiment shared by Ifeoma Ajunwa, who holds both a J.D. and a Ph.D. and whose work is at the intersection of ethics and AI.</p><p>Ajunwa, who is on faculty at Cornell Law School and Cornell University School of ILR (industrial and labor relations), points out IRBs and the larger ecosystem have a responsibility to include the voices of women and other underrepresented populations. Case in point: voice-enabled tech.</p><p>\"If the people who did the testing are focused on a technological effectiveness 95% of the time, that's great, tech-wise. But if 10% of people are excluded, and they are all of one category, that's really bad.\"</p><p>Furthermore, IRB members will need to include people who are trained in health, tech, and ethics, which Patrick-Lake suggests would be a good focus for a graduate program. DJ Patil, former U.S. chief data scientist, takes it a step further: \"We need to get to a place where every technologist is trained in ethics and security,\" he says. \"Ethics can't be a side class. It needs to be core curriculum.\"</p><p>Patil is particularly concerned about the lack of attention on security, pointing out healthcare data breaches are just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>As devices are further embedded into our lives, security flaws can create greater risks for humans, including manipulation of actions and the data itself.</p><p>To even consider that scenario, ethicists need to have a greater understanding of new models, including the role of machine learning. \"Just because we can, doesn't mean we should,\" cautions Patil.</p><p>Will Ethics Make or Break the Industry?</p><p>Setting new standards, evolving the makeup of IRBs, and attaining new skills are all works in progress. Patrick-Lake believes we are heading in the right direction, pointing to Genetic Alliance's rare disease IRB, noted for its inclusion of experts in health, tech, and ethics.</p><p>Nebeker is encouraged by big tech's recent efforts, relaying that Facebook has built a review process and that Microsoft Research has formed an IRB.</p><p>But change is hard. Nebeker often advises scientists that ethics isn't in their wheelhouse and that they would be wise to add an ethics specialist to the grant application with secondary aims of addressing security, informed consent, and participant access.</p><p>\"It is a foreign concept,\" she shares. When researchers agree, they push it to the back burner as an amendment after they have won the grant.</p><p>Even those who spend considerable time weighing ethics find the waters are still muddy. \"It's confusing,\" acknowledges Patil. \"There isn't clear guidance as to what you are allowed to do with this data and who has access to it.\"</p><p>He's also noted the implications of informed consent in a more connected society with machine learning capabilities. He offers this scenario: If everyone on your street opts in and gives up data about their households, they have consented. If you are the only one on the street not to consent, you are still opted in.</p><p>This presents a challenge to the corporations with the potential to translate groundbreaking research into healthcare. With the arrival of big data capabilities and a focus on innovation, Ajunwa explains companies have done a good job of building teams to pilot and test new capabilities. \"The next stage,\" she continues, \"is bringing in techno-ethicists to think through the ramifications of decisions.\"</p><p>While chief privacy officers, lawyers, and biomedical panels abound, Ajunwa says their domain is too narrow. She recommends an in-house tech ethicist. While she is not aware of any full-time employees with this title, she notes it's not uncommon for large organizations to bring in consultants.</p><p>But Ajunwa sees this as a stopgap, and often it's only after a crisis. She warns against losing sight of business basics when chasing shiny objects in search of short-term gain: \"If you want long-term success, whether you are in tech or pharma, you need to remember the business basics of goodwill. Ethical issues will kill you if you ignore them.\"</p><p>In addition to developing the skills across the organization, Ajunwa suggests companies need stronger tech ethics at the highest level - the corporate board. Uber is a cautionary tale of what happens when no one is responsible for pausing, considering ethical issues, and formulating a strategy to protect the client base and the company.</p><p>\"Companies need someone at the board level,\" she says. \"Each quarter, they [need to be] reviewing policies, pointing out what looks problematic, and catching small fires.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sara Holoubek is CEO of Luminary Labs. </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(Luminary Labs has a commercial relationship with Pfizer.)</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MMMHUS-749609</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MMMHUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S41-XHH1-JDRS-7075-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">355070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2248\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Haymarket Media.

We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy and sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good night from Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A very talented singer joining us from a surprise appearance from New York City right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: If Tucker was on the West Coast, it would be now 6:00 and he'd say, it's too late to go to In-N-Out Burger. That's what you'd say to me. That was the worst excuse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CARLSON: I don't need anymore In-N-Out Burgers, man. I've eaten too many burgers in my life.</p><p>HANNITY: Listen, it's your lose, that, and Crown Burger in Salt Lake City, you cannot go wrong, you will love it.</p><p>CARLSON: It's true. It's good.</p><p>HANNITY: Obviously, I like hamburgers.</p><p>All right, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>Welcome to HANNITY. Busy news night tonight. We are witnessing what is a radical, major shift in American politics, like you've never seen.</p><p>The new far left extreme socialist Democratic Party, they are hitting new levels of radicalism. Mueller didn't deliver on their collusion fantasies, and by the way, Rush was great earlier tonight when he said, \"Oh, Hillary needs to be in jail and indicted, if you did what she did, you would be in jail.\"</p><p>Now, the Trump agenda succeeding, that is driving them off the rails. It was on full display last night. Fake news CNN put the 2020 Democrats on stage one after another, hour after hour of hard-core socialism, where they completely tried to out-socialist the other socialist on stage, from impeachment of Trump, open borders, guns, oppressive taxes, and, of course, yes, redistribution and the Green Deal, where crazy Bernie Sanders was confronted about the real failures of socialism throughout history. Why would we not learn from history?</p><p>Again, from a woman whose family actually fled the former Soviet Union in 1979. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMANTHA FRENKEL-POPELL, STUDENT, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: My father's family left Russia in 1979, fleeing from some of the same socialist policies that you seem eager to implement in this country. So, my question is, how do you rectify your notion of democratic socialism with the failure of socialism in nearly country that has tried it?</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Is it your assumption that I supported or believed in authoritarian communism that existed in the Soviet Union? I don't. It never happened. I opposed it.</p><p>What democratic socialism means to me as we expand Medicare, we provide educational opportunity to all Americans, we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. In other words, government serves the needs of all people, rather than just wealthy campaign contributors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: All right. Of course, Bernie, the socialist, didn't have an answer, because everywhere his ideas, his utopia is put in place, they always fail.</p><p>Remember, keep your doctor, keep your plan, save money? Everyone, millions lost doctors, plans, have only one choice, so everyone paid more.</p><p>And it got worse, because Sanders is backing the right for all felons to vote, prisoners, murderers, yes, even terrorist like the Boston bombers. You can't make this up. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNE CARLSTEIN, STUDENT, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: You have said that you will be people with felony records should be allowed to vote while in prison. Does this mean you would support and franchising people like the Boston marathon bomber, a convicted terrorist and murderer?</p><p>SANDERS: But I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy. Yes, even for terrible people. So I believe that people commit crimes, they pay the price. When they got out of jail, I believe they certainly should have the right to vote, but I do believe even if they are in jail, they are paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: Shocking. Bernie wants to take more of your hard-earned money, raise your taxes, eliminate all private health insurance. You only get the government version -- good luck with that.</p><p>You get rid of all fossil fuels, get rid of the combustion engine, we will let sex offenders, murderers, terrorists, vote from prison. What a plan for America's future, and that is only one candidate. Look at Kamala Harris, took even her big government agenda even further.</p><p>California senator ramping up her attacks, yep, on the Second Amendment, thinking we don't have a Constitution and we don't have coequal branches of government. Amazing moment. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There are people in Washington, D.C., supposed leaders, who have failed to have the courage to reject a false choice, which suggests you are either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. Suppose a leaders in Washington, D.C., who have failed to have the courage to recognize, you know what, you want to go hunting, that is fine, but we need reasonable gun safety laws in this country, starting with universal background checks and a renewal of the assault weapon ban.</p><p>Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws, and if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: OK, quick HANNITY civics lesson for the California senator. That's not how our constitutional republic works. Our government works. No magical countdown clock gives the president sole authority to attack constitutional rights because Congress will do what you want.</p><p>Remember, with President Trump's emergency declaration, well within his authority, legislatively, constitutionally, acting pursuant to a real law put out by Congress, passed by Congress to secure the southern border, granting him the power to do so, and something like the Constitution commander-in-chief.</p><p>Democrats, they don't care about it. Last night, did you hear anything about serious efforts to keep our nation safe and secure? Remember, two years, 4,000-plus homicides, 30,000 sexual assaults, 100,000, oh, yes, violent assaults by illegal immigrant criminals. Two years.</p><p>Now, it was just the opposite last night. Listen to good old Mayor Pete, genius that he is, talking about mass amnesty for millions of people that didn't respect our laws, our Constitution, our sovereignty, and our borders. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There is a broad U.S. consensus that we need to find a way to protect Dreamers. But as your question brings out, there are over 10 million people who are undocumented immigrants in this country who don't fall into that category. On the reality is, we can't have comprehensive immigration reform that works unless it addresses the status for those 11-some million undocumented immigrants. So, what we need to do is make sure there is a pathway to citizenship for them too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: And, of course, no Democratic event would be complete without, yes, even more lies and conspiracy theories about Trump and Russia. Even though we have four separate investigations, the FBI nine-month investigation, House Intel investigation, Senate bipartisan investigation and Robert Mueller himself, no collusion.</p><p>Listen to Senator Warren calling for impeachment, with no basis. Did she read the Constitution? Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The tools that we are given for that accountability is impeachment process. This is not about politics. This is about principles. This is about what kind of a democracy we have.</p><p>In a dictatorship, everything in government and revolves around protecting the one person at the center, but not in our democracy, and not under our Constitution. We have checks and balances, and we have to proceed here in a way understanding our place in history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: Senator, what part of collusion don't you understand? By the way, Senator, I have another question: did Hillary Clinton break the law, the Espionage Act, top secret classified information on that secret server? And was her intent to obstruct justice when she deleted, Bleached Bit, busted up devices with hammers, pulled out SIM cards?</p><p>Now, Warren followed up that remark with more talk about, yes, higher taxes. Remember, she wants to legislate stealing where after you pay all your taxes, if you happen to have any left, she wants the government to be able to say, wait a minute, you saved too much, we are going to go back and take another bite at the apple.</p><p>And don't forget, when you die, you pay a bigger bite of the apple. They always get the gold in your teeth if they could.</p><p>And massive government debt and forgiveness, free college, who is going to pay for all of this? Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN: We are going to rollback student loan debt for about 95 percent of students who have debt. That's part one. And part two is to make sure that we never get in this mess again on student loan debt, and that is to make college universally available, with free tuition and fees.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: And when did the rest of us get our refund? I wrote for ten years a check that you make a savings, I took out one student loan, and guess what, 5805, when I didn't have any money.</p><p>By the way, now, what we are seeing is a party that has gone so far left it even looks like crazy, creepy uncle Joe Biden is having cold feet. According to a new report tonight, he again pushed back his launch, which was now set for Thursday, won't do an official campaign kick off until Monday, and a new piece out in the \"Daily Mail\" lays out the chaos surrounding Biden's 2020, quote, \"rollout,\" raising more questions about whether creepy, crazy Uncle Joe even has a place in this new Democratic Party. Wait until they hear some of the things we are about to advise them on.</p><p>Now, that's pushing to get rid of -- this is your new Democratic Party. Remember, Medicare-for-All would take up most of the budget for ten straight years. That is one item. Gas and oil, remember, we are going to get rid of what is the lifeblood of our economy, the Green New Deal is $94- plus trillion in 10 years. Letting felons vote, open borders, abolishing ICE, oh, abolishing the Electoral College, so New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and California pick off all future presidents, stacking the Supreme Court with liberal activist judges, reparations, crippling the Second Amendment, they want a 70 percent top rate on individuals, marginal rate, 90 percent on corporations. Hmm, well, not many people are going to invest in America. And it goes on.</p><p>Now, maybe you want to dismiss all this, maybe you want to laugh at all of this as just crazy, unhinged madness, but these are really ideas within the new radical socialist Democratic Party. They have, what, over 100 congressmen and senators supporting Ocasio-Cortez's New Green Deal. All these presidential candidates support it.</p><p>These are ideas that have been tried and have been a massive failure everywhere they have been tried. If you have any doubts, look at the promises of Obamacare. Keep your doctor and pay less, how did that work out for you? Causing tremendous human suffering.</p><p>Let's go to San Francisco. Oh, we sent our own Lawrence Jones back yesterday. We have exclusive footage just ahead, but have to give a viewer warning, it is pretty disturbing what is going on in Nancy Pelosi's backyard.</p><p>By the way, within walking distance to both her home and office, homelessness, needles, massive wealth inequality, sanctuary cities, day in and day out, and yes, feces. And we've got the video, all over the place.</p><p>That is why so many people are fleeing places like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, where all of these progressive fairy tales turn out to be nightmares come to life and why do Democrats make such a far left turn? Why are they so out of touch with law-abiding, common sense Americans that make this country great? Why exploit people's innate, natural fear that they are going to take away every fear that they have and take care of everything, promises of everything for free? It is impossible. They will never be able to deliver it.</p><p>It is because the Democrats, well, they are being led by a new crop of radical leftists. This is their power base. They make you dependent, you reelect them, then you are voting back in the very benefits they are promising to give you. Establishment Democrats, even as bad as they are, they are even terrified now of losing to the far left base that they want to win reelection. They're going to be literally running on those programs.</p><p>It is why extremist like Speaker of the House Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I didn't misspeak, are leading the party. Pelosi is really speaker in name only. It's why every day, she somehow finds a way to top her previous bad idea with one that is even worse. The latest, dismissing efforts by the president to reform the V.A. system to help our vets, saying everything is fine.</p><p>Well, thankfully, the president has been fixing it. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Especially when it comes to the V.A., all I can think of is that classic refrain that my parents always taught me growing up, is that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The idea that this thing that isn't broken, this thing that provides the highest quality care to our veterans somehow needs to be fixed, optimized, tinkered with it until we don't even recognize it anymore.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: It's not just Speaker Ocasio-Cortez, her radical cohort, Congresswoman Omar, who by the way, again embroiled in scandal. Remember, first it was a series of anti-Semitic remarks. By the way, what Bernie said last night about Israel, a downright disgrace for every Democrat. Downplaying, in this case, Congressman Omar, 9/11 terrorist attacks, now it has been revealed at the Minnesota congresswoman attacked the soldiers, the ones that died fighting in the 1993 Blackhawk Down Operation, posting in a Twitter thread, oh, about 19 U.S. soldiers dying in the battle of Mogadishu, quote: In his selective memory, he forgets to also mention the thousands of Somalis killed by American forces that day. #nottodaysatan .</p><p>Where is that accountability? Where is the outrage? Where the Democratic leaders? This is their party. And where is the media in this country?</p><p>Now, if this was a Republican, they would have gone insane right now, but we are here to do the work the media doesn't do, and that is to expose how radicals and how radical this party has become.</p><p>And they don't even understand simple, basic, fundamental things like the law, the Constitution, separation of powers, coequal branches of government, or any of the real consequences of their actions like the Green New Deal, which comrade Bill de Blasio, he's ramping up right here in New York City, can't wait for this to happen, wanting to take the city back to the Stone Age, that is Fred Flintstone for those of you that are young at home, with Bill de Blasio's face on it, with a ban, quote, inefficient steel and glass skyscrapers, because they're bad for the environment.</p><p>So what exactly does Bill de Blasio want to build with? I guess we can't use trees because that would pillage the forest. Do Democrats not understand that these materials they want to ban, along with oil and gas, fossil fuels, it is the lifeblood of our economy and every economy around the globe? It drives wages. It drives opportunity for people in this country. It's why we are putting this big New Green Deal disaster on trial, because Democrats want to roll back all of the success of the Trump agenda.</p><p>Are you better off than you were to two and a half years ago? I think the answer is obviously yes. Like for example, we are now energy independent in America for the first time in 75 years. Not relying on countries that hate our guts for the lifeblood of our economy, and now we are net exporter of energy.</p><p>Did you see this? Forecasters are revisiting their first quarter GDP estimates. S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq closing again at record highs. All while Democrats want to recreate, you know, what? Erode the entire middle class, send us back to Fred Flintstone's era, Dino the dinosaur?</p><p>They will retreat to their rich, expensive enclaves surrounded by walls and gates. The success of the forgotten men and women, the men and women of this country that go to work, pay their taxes, obey the laws, raise their kids, really? They are getting guaranteed from them? I don't think so.</p><p>It is going to be coming from your able-bodied, hardworking Americans, who they are chasing out of big cities. And if you leave New York, New Jersey, California, great, don't bring those stupid policies with you when you go to Texas or the Carolinas, or Nashville, or Tennessee, or Florida. You want to build a better future for your kids and grandkids.</p><p>It's that entrepreneurial spirit, the freedom to find what you are made to do, your purpose in life, your God-given talents. That is what has driven success in this country and what has led this nation to become the greatest civilization God has ever given man.</p><p>Somebody who knows all about that all too well, he is The New Voice, by the way, of -- The New Voice CEO, our friend, Mr. 99999, Herman Cain.</p><p>How are you, sir?</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, THE NEW VOICE CEO: I'm doing fine, Sean.</p><p>I want to add one word to all of those radical ideas that you delineated, and you are absolutely right, you can add one more word. They are radical and impractical. Not one of them is practical relative to cost or relative to the Constitution.</p><p>So, you can add that the next time you do a monologue, where he identify all of these crazy, radical ideas.</p><p>HANNITY: From Herman Cain, impractical. Got it. We'll put that on the list.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HANNITY: All right. You were going to the Fed, I was happy about you going to the Fed. You and I have joked over the years.</p><p>CAIN: Thank you.</p><p>HANNITY: You know, when you are running for president, you talk about all of a sudden, you start getting hammered with allegations, allegations. And you even said, I don't have the money to fight back. I don't have it -- it's not available.</p><p>CAIN: Right.</p><p>HANNITY: And people are saying that, oh, that started up because it stopped the day you got out of the race. Pretty interesting, right?</p><p>CAIN: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: It was so important.</p><p>CAIN: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: Is that part of the reason? I know you have given five reasons, but I want to give you a chance to respond.</p><p>CAIN: Those accusations had nothing to do with my decision. My decision was driven by, one, during the phase one of this process, collecting all the information, and also finding out from administration staffers the things that I could and I could not do. And when I started to look at the list of things that I could not do, that's like taking a stallion, keeping him in the stable, and not let him run.</p><p>I couldn't do the things that I enjoy. I enjoy The New Voice, I enjoy my show, I enjoy speaking, I enjoy my website. I enjoy working with people.</p><p>And most importantly, Sean, just like you --</p><p>HANNITY: You're a business guy.</p><p>CAIN: -- I enjoy educating people about the power of capitalism and how socialism has never worked since the history of man. If I have become the Federal Reserve governor, I would have been limited in terms of what I could talk about and tell people the truth. Whereas in this environment, I am unlimited in being able to say what I want, when I want, to whomever I want when it comes to the truth.</p><p>That's why I made the decision not to do it.</p><p>HANNITY: OK. By the way, I have known you for many years. It's true. It is -- how many people, by the way, and this is just breaking, I just got this, Trump says that he opposed to White House aides testifying to Congress.</p><p>OK, this president now has given more documents, never once like Obama and past presidents, not one time, did he invoke executive privilege. He never fired Mueller, never fired Rosenstein. All of these things.</p><p>Now they want to just go on a fishing expedition. You know what? Enough. I don't think the president should lift a finger to help those people that won't lift a finger to help the country or serve their constituents.</p><p>They've done the investigating. They lost. They're a bunch of crybabies. It's like election 2016 all over again.</p><p>CAIN: If I'm the CEO of a company, which I have been many times, and I'm a CEO of my company now. People that are part of my organization --</p><p>HANNITY: Godfather Pizza, Coke, pretty big companies.</p><p>CAIN: They're pretty big company.</p><p>HANNITY: You are rich.</p><p>CAIN: People that work for me, they are not allowed to go out and represent their company. And so, the president represents the country, he represents the administration.</p><p>And for them to say they want to be able to interrogate aides is absolutely ridiculous. But this fits in with all of the other radical, impractical ideas. In this particular case, I would suggest that the president just simply say no. There isn't anything they can do about it.</p><p>HANNITY: Not a darn thing. And you know what? I think the president --</p><p>CAIN: No.</p><p>HANNITY: -- is right. He's drawn a line in the sand.</p><p>CAIN: No.</p><p>HANNITY: Oh, well, collusion and Russia, oh, that didn't work. Taxes, let's go -- let's empower the IRS for our political enemies. Oh, OK.</p><p>CAIN: Right. That's what they're doing.</p><p>HANNITY: Let's cooperate with that nonsense. Let's step on the First Amendment while we're at it, and ask lawyers for the president that they've got to testify.</p><p>Sorry, it's called attorney-client privilege. Grow up, learn something.</p><p>CAIN: Right.</p><p>HANNITY: Thank you. Herman Cain, good to see you, my friend.</p><p>When we come back, Dan Bongino, Geraldo Rivera, they will weigh in on Bernie Sanders wanting felons to vote from behind bars, including terrorists.</p><p>Also, we sent Lawrence Jones back to San Francisco. Wait until you see this video. It is -- look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Hillary Clinton needs to be investigated, she needs to be indicted, and she needs to be in jail.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: We will talk about Rush Limbaugh's comments on Hillary Clinton, yes, if we have equal justice under the law. All of that, straight ahead, as we continue.</p><p>HANNITY: All right. As we explained in the monologue, Senator Bernie Sanders open to having felons, including yeah, the Boston marathon bomber terrorist, sex offenders, vote from behind bars, murderers.</p><p>Well, today, the co-hosts of \"The View\", they tried to tackle this topic. Kind of as usual, things went off the rails, but interesting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris to go on TV and say the Boston terrorist debtors any rights in this country after killing three people and injuring 264 in 2013, I think it's disgraceful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, yes, if they let them out, he gets those rights back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I don't agree if this terrorist were to let out - -</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, he should not get out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think he should be given the death penalty. That's where I am out with this. Act of terror on American soil.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does that include in your mind domestic terrorists?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, terrorism is terrorism. Yes, of course.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: And in now deleted tweet, Hollywood liberal superstar Cher blasting the idea, writing, quote: Does Bernie Sanders really people in prison who are murderers, rapists, child molesters, the Boston bombers, deserve the right to vote?</p><p>I think Cher is watching the show because this is twice now in two weeks that we have highlighted her views, being on the right side.</p><p>All right. Joining us now with reaction, FOX News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera, FOX News contributor, former Secret Service agent, Dan Bongino.</p><p>Guys, welcome.</p><p>Geraldo, you know, I don't mind prison reform. When I saw Alice Marie Johnson (ph) come out of prison, her family, that made me happy, and she said, thank you, America, for a second chance. She was a one-time offender, drugs, and she said, I won't let you down. I want to find all of the Alice Marie Johnsons in prison and let them out.</p><p>But the marathon bomber, terrorists, murderers, pedophiles, no way.</p><p>GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: You know, the president, President Trump passed the First Step Act, really meaningful criminal justice reform that reduced the use of mandatory minimum sentences, provided jobs training, education, alcohol and drug rehab, that's real criminal justice reform.</p><p>To propose that convicts be granted their right to vote before he or she has served their time behind bars, paid their blood debt to society, is an obscenity. It is grotesque, and it is deeply disappointing.</p><p>I'm starting to look at Bernie Sanders and saying, you know, that feisty old guy, he's got charisma, he's got what it takes come he's the best one of the Democratic field. Now I look at him and I'm reminded of all of that crazy Bernie talk from a couple of years ago.</p><p>HANNITY: Geraldo, that's the difference between me and you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RIVERA: It is an insult.</p><p>HANNITY: It is. It is an insult.</p><p>Listen, you give up your rights. If you inflict harm on a child, if you are pedophile, murderer, terrorist, and I'm like, where is this party, Dan Bongino? And the comments of Congresswoman Omar, really come about Blackhawk Down and what happened to Americans, you know, her Satan comment? No criticism from the Democratic Party or leadership. They're incapable of it.</p><p>DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sean, can you believe what happened in these conversations? I mean, we are on your cable television show in front of white, 3 million plus people, actually having a conversation about the Boston bomber, a savage man beast who built this six-liter pressure cooker bomb build with ball bearings and nails, placed eight feet away from an 8- year-old kid and many others, by the way, watched it detonate, and then fled, led the police on a chase and shot up basically an entire city.</p><p>We're actually having a conversation on your show about the leading Democrat, many states, Bernie Sanders advocating for this piece of human waste to vote. Can you imagine politicians pandering to this savage for a vote in Bernie's America, that's the kind of place you'll be looking at? His words by the way, he supports this not us. This is unbelievable.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: Geraldo, I assume you probably at some point in your 50-year illustrious career and some of the greatest investigative work ever done Willowbrook, I looked at those old tapes recently. It's amazing the work you did and how many - how you changed.</p><p>RIVERA: Thanks.</p><p>HANNITY: The mental health system in this country. OK. What's happening? This is twice in two weeks, one on immigration and then one's here. Have you been talking to her? This is got be a Geraldo influence in here somewhere because you are friends with everyone.</p><p>RIVERA: No, but you know there is a pragmatic idealism to you Sean that people don't get. Your ideas work. For Bernie Sanders it seems to me a panicky move to make sure that none of the other candidates and there are now almost two dozen of them outflanks him to the left. So, Bernie is going to make sure that he's the furthest left, a candidate could possibly be. What's the craziest idea that you can come up with?</p><p>I've got the idea; the Boston bomber has the right to vote on who is going to be representing him in the commonwealth of Massachusetts or wherever he's in deep isolation solitary right now. It is a bizarre idea that has nothing to do with ordinary, normal, prudent, voting Americans. That's what I can't figure out. When does this craziness get you the kind of following that you need to beat the President who has really done a great job with the economy? And as I mentioned criminal justice has passed meaningful reform, the first meaningful reform in a decade.</p><p>HANNITY: Listen, all of that and breaking an economic record after the economic record Dan Bongino and add to that you know what America is fear to get on the world stage. I know that is liberals want to go on apology tours and drop $150 billion in cash and other currency, on the tarmac for the mullahs of Iran. I prefer America that is feared and peace through strength. That's what I prefer.</p><p>DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. And so, would most sane rational voters out there. But Sean, Geraldo is right on this one. I know we debate a lot, but he nailed it. You know the effort here on the left is to separate yourself and distinct - to make yourself distinct from Donald Trump and in order to do that, it's a series of insane ideas, it's a liberal forest fire right now, it's going to consume the Democrat Party. One guy wants a 70 percent tax rate. The other one wants a 90 percent tax rate.</p><p>HANNITY: By the way, Dan.</p><p>BONGINO: I'm pretty sure there'll be arguing for no money at all. Let's confiscate everything. I mean I've never seen anything like this.</p><p>HANNITY: By the way when - Geraldo is right, it's became the influence of a younger adopted brother. When he's wrong. He's on his own.</p><p>RIVERA: That's you.</p><p>HANNITY: Good to see you both. When we come back. All right. Two brothers involved in the Jussie Smollett case; they're now suing Smollett's attorneys for defamation. Trace Gallagher, full report. You won't believe Hillary Clinton what she's actually saying about President Trump. It's so ridiculous, it's actually funny. And Rush Limbaugh's statements, she should be indicted and in jail. His evidence has been overwhelming incontrovertible. Gregg Jarrett and Sara Carter next.</p><p>HANNITY: New developments tonight in the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax as the Empire actor faces a fresh new lawsuit in this ongoing saga. Here with the very latest from our West Coast Newsroom again tonight, Fox News Correspondent, Trace Gallagher. Trace, this never ends.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Sean. Yes, it never ends. The Osundairo brothers are suing Jussie Smollett 's attorneys Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian because they continue to lie saying the brother is quoting here, \"let a criminally homophobic racist and violent attack against Mr. Smollett\". Here's the brother's lawyer. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Chicagoan brothers told the truth. They could have remained silent, but instead they told the truth to the police and with their right hand in the air, they told the truth to the grand jury.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: The Osundairo say their reputations and livelihoods have taken a hit and they can barely make ends meet. The brothers say Smollett hired them to stage a hate crime hoax and gave them money to purchase certain items and there is surveillance video of them buying rope, gasoline, ski masks and caps that resemble President Trump's Make America Great Again hats. Jussie Smollett maintains the brothers attacked him without cause and his attorneys called the lawsuit against them comical quoting while we know this ridiculous lawsuit will soon be dismissed because it lacks any legal footing. We look forward to exposing the fraud, the Osundairo brothers and their attorneys have committed on the public. Prosecutors dropped the charges against Jussie Smollett, but also said that does not mean he didn't do it. Sean.</p><p>HANNITY: All right, Trace Gallagher in our West Coast Newsroom. Yet another big story, we are following tonight. Hillary Clinton today actually suggesting President Trump is getting a free pass on obstruction of justice. She ever heard of the phrase people glass houses shouldn't throw stones. You can't make this up. But here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: Any other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted. But because of the rule in the Justice Department that you can't indict a sitting President. As I read it basically what I thought it was saying is, look, we think he obstructed justice. Here are 11 examples of why we think he obstructed justice. But we're under the Control of the Justice Department and their rule is you can indict.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: The Attorney General, Madam Secretary actually said the decision was in no way based on any consideration of whether you can or cannot indict a sitting President. No, that was the office legal counsel, Rod Rosenstein, the guy that signed the fourth FISA, the third renewal and the same one that also appointed Mueller took them seconds.</p><p>They didn't have the evidence at all. But we have evidence on you. Joining us now the author of the Russian Hoax, the illicit scheme to clear Hillary Clinton and frame Donald Trump. Boy, he's been right. Fox News Contributor and Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett, also investigative reporter Sara Carter is with us. You know, Rush Limbaugh said, we're going to play this in a minute Gregg.</p><p>By every standard, the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible. She even sent out Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State and note to State Department employees don't use your private devices for State Department materials. She signs it. Private server classified top secret. Information marked as such on her - on that secret server in a bathroom closet, we believe hacked by at least six foreign intelligence agencies.</p><p>Now, that's the underlying crime. Why did she delete 33,000 subpoenaed emails, bleach bit and beat up the devices and pull out some cards that would be an intent of obstruction? Meeting all the criteria and standard Donald Trump wishing that he wants to fire Mueller, Rosenstein and it doesn't rise to the level.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, AUTHOR, RUSSIAN HOAX: We always knew that Hillary Clinton was a lousy candidate. Now we know she's a lousy lawyer. There was no legal basis for obstruction of justice. Her hypocrisy as you point out is really breathtaking here. She's the queen of obstruction of justice destroying 33,000 emails and devices under subpoena. You know honestly if she were smart and she is not to be sure she'd put a sock in it, because criticizing the attorney general who holds potential your fate in his hands is really unwise, it's just plain stupid.</p><p>I mean William Barr might decide you know what I'm not just going to investigate the FBI, now I'm going to investigate Hillary Clinton for obstruction of justice reopen the email scandal, 110 different felonies and I'm going to look into her role in selling uranium assets to Russia at the same time $45 million is flowing into her foundation. So, you know she ought to keep her mouth shut or she'll get herself in deeper trouble than she already should be in.</p><p>HANNITY: And by the way they're calling for unredacted materials. Apparently, there is a reference in there to Bill and Monica and tapes in Russia. I don't know.</p><p>JARRETT: There is.</p><p>HANNITY: But it's neither here nor there. Sara, the important thing is that on the law that if we're going to have a constitutional republic, equal justice, equal application of our laws, yes, all of those people that rigged her investigation should be in trouble. And we know it's rigged. People involved in it. Page, Strzok, everyone else saying yes, Loretta Lynch did it. What did she know, and she know it? What did Obama know? But more importantly then we've got to find out who tried to rig the presidential election with the phony Russian dossier that the New York Times is now saying might have been a disinformation campaign to influence the election and then we've got to find out who used the dirty dossier that she paid for to bludgeon the president with lies and conspiracy theories to remove him,</p><p>SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. That's exactly what I was going to say Sean. This is what's so important. She obviously believes in something which is a two-tiered justice system one in which Hillary Clinton feels she can get away with everything with obstruction just as you said. I mean under the law, obstruction is tampering with witnesses, destroying evidence. I mean this is everything that she did under the law and then she turns, and she throws it at President Trump saying well, he could have been indicted if he wasn't a sitting President. Here is someone who feels that they are above the law. And this is someone that is going to be investigated and all the people that supported her are going to be investigated as well. If Attorney General William Barr does his job and Michael Horowitz does his job, people will be indicted, and it won't be President Trump.</p><p>HANNITY: You all know what's coming. It is going to be an avalanche, but when. Stay tuned. Just relax. Expect in May a lot of things to happen. By the way, we're going to play Rush Limbaugh saying, yes, Hillary should be indicted and convicted and put in jail.</p><p>The evidence is incontrovertible overwhelming, but we believe in due process presumption of innocence. All right. Before we get to Rush, the drug human feces crisis out of control within walking distance of Nancy Pelosi's home and office. We sent Lawrence Jones back to the liberal city to see how bad things really are. His report, Rush's comments, all coming up.</p><p>HANNITY: Based on that media report and the Washington Examiner report about maybe a redacted portion of the Mueller Report had the insinuation that there are tapes of Bill Clinton, with Monica Lewinsky on the telephone. Let's leave it at that, wouldn't that mean that the Clintons were compromised. Then we have the whole Uranium One thing, then we have the Russian dossier and we have Bill Clinton being paid twice as normal speaking fees. And don't forget she signed off on the uranium deal. OK, we have a big story.</p><p>We only have 25 percent of the story, but we have been telling you about the human feces' crisis, needle crises plaguing San Francisco. There is even an online map that shows where feces is reported to have been found since 2011. We sent Lawrence Jones back to the city by the bay to see what's going on. Here's what he found.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: There is feces everywhere, homeless people, needles, is that the norm around here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Unfortunately, it is. It's devolved. The city has become so much worse in the last 10 years. That's a disgrace.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I see a lot of people in the area and they're all like you know had needles pumping up in their arms just outside.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody is shooting up right up the street. They don't care. Selling dope, crack, whatever.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a bad situation. I don't really know what the solution is going to be.</p><p>JONES: So, what do you see on a typical day with the people.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Drug use. People shoot up right in the middle of the street. It's crazy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: While the kids are crossing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kids.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Families are going through.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everything. All over the floor, all over the ground.</p><p>JONES: Is it really safe for kids to play in the playground, when you see all of this waste, human waste and needles everywhere?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wouldn't bring my kids to the playground. I wouldn't bring my kids here.</p><p>JONES: About how many pounds of feces.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At least five to 10.</p><p>JONES: And the needles</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 10 to 20. Every day.</p><p>JONES: Every day.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Man, that can vary. It could be anywhere from five to 10 or 20, it depends on what route you take.</p><p>JONES: And piles of poop?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Man, I'd ask that the biggest thing is the smell.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have my grandkids here. You know I'm scared to let them walk on. Sometimes I have to pick him up and carry him. I don't want him to misstep on the needle.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our political leaders are not dealing with this. They're not dealing with this. And I think it's corrupt.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This isn't normal. This isn't normal. It's crazy</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: Wow. Joining us now Fox News Contributor Lawrence Jones, author of The Case for Trump, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow, Victor Davis Hanson is with us. All right, as we're speaking Lawrence, I'm going to show some of the video. They have people daily cleaning this up. This is the needles and real feces and everybody you talk to says what</p><p>JONES: Everybody is sick of it and it's become the new normal, Sean. I mean the moment I walked out of the van, the camera truck within five steps, I saw my first needle and you're looking at people that are doped up, they're on the street. It was like a scene out of The Walking Dead. These people were like zombies. We saw drug exchanges. We saw packages where drugs were clearly there, needles every single block. You see all the light orange capsules that protect the needles that are literally all over the street.</p><p>And Sean, this is just not like a rough neighborhood. This is - the tech companies, the big tech companies are surrounding this. Right.</p><p>HANNITY: How far from Nancy Pelosi's House and office. I don't know it's within walking distance about how far</p><p>JONES: Miles away. We didn't pass her house, but we know just based on the map Google. I mean she wasn't too far.</p><p>HANNITY: Victor Davis Hanson, this is the thing she can't go to her millionaire friends and say, let's all chip in. She's a multi, multi, multi-millionaire. She can't say let's build a facility, people to go to the bathroom and maybe get drug treatment or warm meal, a shower. She can't do that. Won't do that?</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW: No, it's surreal what's happened. Sean, the wealthiest generation, the history of civilization. This is $3 trillion or $4 trillion in market capitalization between Silicon Valley and San Francisco. Supposedly, the most sophisticated and clever. They created - they inherited the most beautiful city in the world. They made it in 20 years into a medieval mess. And I'm not just being metaphorical.</p><p>When I read medieval chroniclers about cities in Europe in the dark ages and late middle dark ages, you start to see the same pattern. There is a nob hill, there is a Pacific Heights, Presidio Heights, Twin Peaks and these people live in high elevations, they have banquet halls, they have their private security nights then outside the city walls and places to make the comparison. The Tenderloin or the market, you have peasantry, urban peasants and they live among dong and awful and amid disease and that's exactly what's going on in San Francisco, the common denominator between San Francisco today and the medieval city, the past is there is no middle class, high regulations, illegal immigration, zoning, environmental radicalism drove people out of San Francisco. They can't afford to live there, and they grow in general California as well.</p><p>HANNITY: Within walking distance.</p><p>HANSON: These people could not be shielded from the consequences.</p><p>JONES: There is no excuse.</p><p>HANSON: Liberals are only - with your money and our money. Lawrence, great job. Thank you. Victor Davis Hanson, great job. All right. Rush on fire tonight talking about Hillary's ridiculous comments from earlier today and what should happen to the Former Secretary of State and Presidential. You don't want to miss this. Next.</p><p>HANNITY: All right. Rush Limbaugh join the story with Martha MacCallum, and he had a few choice words for hypocrite Hillary. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, HOST, THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW: Hillary Clinton needs to be investigated. She needs to be indicted and she needs to be in jail. You're talking about sour grapes. This is a woman who has been rejected by the American people twice, rejected by her party in 2008. She had to rig the primaries against Crazy Bernie in 2016 to get the nomination. She is the last person who ought to be listened to about what ought to happen to Donald Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: Exactly, it's called the Constitutional Republic Rule of Law, equal application and equal justice. All right. We're getting there. Let not your heart be troubled. We'll never be the destroy-Trump media mob. Jason Chaffetz in for Laura Ingraham tonight.</p><p>Congressman, good to see you again. Great job.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Despite those gains, the index rose just 0.2 per cent, dragged down by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac240563-ddb6-408e-9816-da21357b13b8\"> handful of mega-cap stocks</url> at the top of the market.</p><p>Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 the largest companies in the S&amp;P 500 \u2014 all fell, led by Amazon, which slid 1.8 per cent.</p><p>The five stocks hold greater sway over the market than during the tech boom of 2000, representing more than a fifth of the blue-chip index \u2014 much higher than the 18 per cent peak share of Microsoft, Cisco, General Electric, Intel and ExxonMobil two decades ago.</p><p>This dominance of a small cluster of companies has begun to unnerve investors. \u201cThe concentration concerns me,\u201d said Lee Ferridge, head of macro strategy for North America at State Street Global Markets. \u201cI look at these stocks and wonder how high they can go.\u201d</p><p>The five mega-caps have all outperformed the broader market this year as investors have rushed to the safety of large, growth-oriented companies with revenue from online businesses through the pandemic. Amazon, the best performer of the group, is up 70 per cent this year.</p><p>The two largest, Apple and Microsoft, fall within the tech sector and have helped fuel its strong performance since the year began. Technology is the biggest sector in the S&amp;P 500 and has gained 15 per cent this year while the broader index is flat.</p><p>\u201cIt is a top-heavy market,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which runs the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>Microsoft and Apple together represent more than 11 per cent of the S&amp;P 500 \u2014 a level of concentration that has not been seen in nearly four decades. In 1982, IBM and AT&amp;T made up a similar proportion of the benchmark, Mr Silverblatt noted.</p><p>Some analysts say fears of concentration are overplayed. Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist for Credit Suisse, noted that the top five companies captured 14 per cent of the benchmark\u2019s profits \u2014 a bigger contribution, relative to market cap, than in 2000 \u2014 and were delivering strong earnings growth.</p><p>Still, some warn that any turn in tech stocks could weigh heavily on the broader market. One catalyst could be greater regulation for large tech groups that dominate the industries they serve.</p><p>A tougher regulatory environment would be an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to big tech groups, said Todd Jablonski, chief investment officer for Principal Portfolio Strategies. But he added that for now, the prospect of a determined crackdown seemed remote, as there was no \u201cco-ordinated plan [among policymakers] to execute on a regulatory agenda\u201d.</p><p>The result is \u201cthere is no better business model than mega-cap tech\u201d, he said. \u201cCloud computing, media streaming, and the delivery of [consumer] goods are tailor-made models for a life with Covid-19.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-95aeb21d8ade48f882e7cbf4b85657aa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DK-CTV1-JB77-K00M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"535\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002C1P</classCode><className>EXXON MOBIL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp;

It was downgraded early this morning to a tropical storm, but not right before hitting the Carolina coast as a category one hurricane. The storm made landfall last night near Ocean Aisle Beach, North Carolina.</p><p>Strong wind and downpours knocking out power to thousands of customers.</p><p>Dozens forced to flee when the systems stocked a series of house fires as well.</p><p>Democrats and the White House officials calling the latest round of talks on a COVID-19 relief bill productive, but there are apparently still some differences to work out.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals says it has started late-stage clinical trials of its COVID-19 antibody drug cocktail.

A look at what's driving markets here at home and abroad. Joining me right is E.R. Shares CEO Joe Shulman. Pacer's ETF Distributor President Sean O'Hara and Walser Wealth Management President Rebecca Walser.</p><p>Rebecca, let's kick it off with you, investors are keeping a close eye on a potential sale of TikTok to Microsoft this morning. President Trump set a September 15 deadline for the deal.</p><p>How do you see it Rebecca? Does this have implications beyond just TikTok and Microsoft?</p><p>REBECCA WALSER, PRESIDENT OF WALSER WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Absolutely, and I - - I just loved that piece that, Maria, that you just did. It's kind of ironic that China is saying a smash and grab when that's what we've been saying for quite a while about their Chinese espionage of U.S. tech and data.</p><p>But anyways, I want to quickly say, Maria, this is a great opportunity for Microsoft and I think it's being really underestimated. You know, Microsoft, as you know, has tried many times to get into the social media game or to the consumer data gathering game and hasn't had much success with a lot of their endeavors, and this is a way for them to get 32 plus million -- 14 -- you know -- lots of users, over 30 percent now are -- only 30 percent are teenagers, so you've got about 14 or 15 total U.S. users of July -- as of July this past month and a lot of them are adults.</p><p>And so, if you look at Microsoft's opportunity here, from a teenage perspective, just to focus on them for one second, Maria, what you see is Google and Alphabet has been so successful in getting teenagers to basically use Google Docs and Google Gmail through schools that they're not even using Microsoft products and this is a great way for Microsoft to get into that's space at a very young age.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and they've got the complimentary Xbox, so they've got young people there as well.</p><p>WALSER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, broader market this morning pointed to slight losses at the open. Sean, you say August is typically a volatile month for the markets. Is it the pandemic? Is that what's changed things?</p><p>SEAN O'HARA, PRESIDENT OF PACER ETFs DISTRIBUTORS: No, I mean, I think -- good morning Maria, first off, congratulations on your anniversary. What a great accomplishment. Here's to many, many, many more years. So look --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much Sean.</p><p>O'HARA: -- this market today -- this market today just can't be analyzed through the eyes of -- or lens of history or patterns or conventional wisdom. This market's being driven by one thing and one thing only in the short-run and that is the rate of change in terms of how fast we're going to reopen and whether or not the cases are going up or down with regard to COVID. That's going to be the narrative in the next 30 to 60 days that will drive this market.</p><p>We'll have Disney later on today that will report. They'll probably report a loss, but they're a great example as a barometer for the market. They're business depends on people feeling comfortable going out and being involved with big groups of people. That's what's going on with the economy and that's going to drive it.</p><p>Two more things will come into play, one is potentially the -- you know -- a reemergence of the quote, unquote, China trade issues, as we get more aggressive with them on certain issues. And then eventually the presidential election cycle will start to move forward.</p><p>It's been so nonexistent in this whole run-up and eventually the market will have to take a look at that and try to decide whether or not we'll have a change and whether there'll be a increase in taxation or an increase in regulation or we'll continue with the policies that the current administration has in place, which have been very, very favorable to the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you said Microsoft is going to be an important one for the broader markets too, right? It's a barometer?</p><p>O'HARA: Yes, I mean all of the big tech names are obviously driving this market. You know, they're all sort of tailor made for what's going on. The part of the big tech names that I don't think gets enough attention today is the cloud piece of it.</p><p>You know, more and more and more computing instances are moving to the cloud. There's a big war going on between the big three, Amazon, Google and Microsoft on the cloud side, and those parts of their business are very, very profitable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>O'HARA: The margins are so high. And so, looking forward that's one of the potential areas where Microsoft could be a big winner in this game.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, tech, of course, is on a tear. The Nasdaq closed at yet another record high yesterday as technology stocks soar at the coronavirus pandemic. Joel, what about that?</p><p>I mean, Apple, one of the composite strongest performers, that the company surged 5 percent, now at a market cap of $1.92 trillion, putting it very close to being the first company every to reach $2 trillion in market value, Joel. Where do you see tech going next?</p><p>JOEL SHULMAN, ERSHARES CEO: Well, if -- first of all, congrats again on your 25 years, it's an extraordinary accomplishment and we've all enjoyed watching you these past years.</p><p>When we think about tech --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you for that Joel.</p><p>SHULMAN: When we think about tech and we think about, you know, the big four, big five dominating the S&amp;P 500, it's really a tale of two markets. We've had basically the tech up, Amazon's leading the group, the biggest group by 68 percent, but it's more just -- it's more than just Amazon, Microsoft and Apple.</p><p>We've got Twilio, Datadog, CrowdStrike, Cloudflare. When we've got over 25 entrepreneurial companies that average more than 97 percent year-to-date.</p><p>This is a broad based move, most of it's being focused on, you know, the big three, the big five with banks, but it's much more than just those guys.</p><p>Now when we think about tech, I think there's more room to run and we've seen, you know, many companies that have suffered in this COVID era, but many -- it's been two markets, right, we've had the healthcare and tech who have really dominated in the U.S. and they've really led all markets.</p><p>But I think eyes now are shifting off-shore and we're thinking -- we're seeing, for example, even though most of the non-U.S. markets are down 10 to 15 percent year-to-date, a lot of people may not realize that last month China, Brazil, other markets were up over 10 percent and you have other markets in Europe, like Germany and Israel and so forth, Sweden, they're up 5 percent.</p><p>So, the markets are starting to shift a little bit. We've seen funds flows moving in the last few weeks from U.S. large-cap -- I'm sorry, U.S. large- cap to off-shore non-U.S.</p><p>And so, I think tech in the U.S. is going to continue to dominate. We're going to see the cloud companies, you know, dominate and we're going to see a lot of movement in I think the next few weeks to off-shore and I think all eyes are going to be on the election coming up and -- and -- and focusing on, you know, continued growth prior to November.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we've got a lot of catalysts on the horizon, that's for sure, with the election and the earnings period. Joel Shulman, Sean O'Hara and Rebecca Walser, great to see you this morning for Word on Wall Street. Thank you so much everybody.</p><p>Coming up, next up, next AFL CIO President Richard Trumka is here on what President Trump is doing to protect American workers. How do the unions see it?</p><p>And then Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will join me on the Administration's plan to help rural communities as the country battles the coronavirus.</p><p>In the 8:00 am hour don't miss Allianz Chief Economic Advisor Mohamed El- Erian on markets and investing today. He also will weigh in on the latest stimulus in Washington.</p><p>And Trump 2020 Presidential Campaign National Press Secretary Hogan Gidley on mail-in voting concerns.</p><p>And then, marking 25 years, we're taking a look back at some of my proudest moments as I remember my debut at the New York Stock Exchange 25-years-ago this morning. Don't want to miss that.</p><p>You're watching \"Mornings With Maria\" live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump signed an executive order to ensure that the Federal Government will hire American workers. It bars federal agencies from replacing American citizens or green card holders with foreign workers.</p><p>Joining me right now is the president of AFL CIO Union, Richard Trumka. Richard, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, AFL CIO UNION PRESIDENT: Thanks Maria, thanks for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This executive order by the president, good idea? What do you think?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well look, it's a good idea, we'll take the increase scrutiny, but it doesn't fix the problem, because as you noted, not only does it protect American workers, it protects green card holders.</p><p>Green card holders are foreign workers. They generally come in under the visa program at a lower wage rate and pull the wages down for everybody else. So, it misses the point, it doesn't fix the real problem. That's going to take legislative action, and unfortunately for workers Mitch McConnell hasn't shown much interest in doing things that help American workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The -- the president has been talking about the supply chains moving from China and firing up the manufacturing base in the United States, he's been talking about that quite a bit. Is this an opportunity?</p><p>TRUMKA: Is what an opportunity? To fix this right now? Well, we have an opportunity, but it's going to take a --</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, an opportunity for -- no, no, no, Richard, an opportunity for American workers, given the fact that what the Administration is trying to do is fire up the manufacturing base here by getting companies to move their supply chains out of China and into the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA: That's a good thing for American workers, unfortunately Maria, his policies don't match his rhetoric. When he passed the last tax bill, that tax bill actually incentivized people to outsource jobs not bring them in. And so, we have to change that as well.</p><p>There's a number of things that we have to do, not just talk about it, but we need the actual policy to do it and he's come up short on the policy side to make those things a reality.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What have you heard from Joe Biden in terms of this issue?</p><p>TRUMKA: About keeping America in jobs here? He wants to make sure that American jobs stay here, he's working with us on that. He had an industrial program to create jobs, an infrastructure program to help create jobs here at home. And so, we'll work with him to make sure that happens.</p><p>Joe -- Joe's a working guy. I mean, he came out of the working class, he understands us. He came out of Pennsylvania, he understands what we're about. He understands us, he's been to our union halls. He's been on our picket lines.</p><p>He actually understands what we're all about and we feel comfortable that he's going to protect American jobs and work with us on all the different policy issues that need to be taken care of, not just a single policy, it will take a number of policy things to make sure American jobs are here and American manufacturing prospers and thrives again. And we're all for --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well -- well, let me -- let me push back on that -- let me push back on that, because what did Joe Biden do under the administration when he was with President Obama for the unions? I mean, you know, President Trump, this has been his number one issue, jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA: Yes, but he's lost a lot. If you look at where he's at right now, doesn't matter, you can say it's about the pandemic, but he's lost jobs, we've lost manufacturing jobs, we've lost mining jobs, we've lost every set of jobs out there.</p><p>So, what I said is he talks about it, but his policy doesn't match it to make it happen. That's what we have to do, line up the words and policy --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it actually did happen -- it -- no, it actually did. Now, that's not true. That's actually not true, Richard. It actually did happen before the pandemic. We had probably the best job situation in a generation. We had an unemployment rate of 3.5 percent. So everything you're saying is actually missing the market, because right before the -- the -- the coronavirus --</p><p>TRUMKA: Well -- well Maria -- Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- hit, we actually did have the best economy and jobs market anybody had every seen. So, I have to push back on that because it's just simply not true.</p><p>TRUMKA: Please do. Please do, but let me push back on what you're saying. The jobs being created weren't manufacturing jobs, they weren't mining jobs, they were service jobs that paid lower wages. Yes, we had jobs, but we need to raise the wages of those jobs. That's why the growing -- that's why there's growing inequality in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wages were going up. No, wages were going up.</p><p>TRUMKA: Every year inequality has gotten worse in this country because wages aren't going up properly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, that's not true.</p><p>TRUMKA: It is true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Inequality was narrowing -- the -- no, no, it's not. I have the statistics of the statistics.</p><p>TRUMKA: Well first all --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Inequality actually began to narrow in the year before -- in the year before the coronavirus. We have to call this out. We've been talking about this, before the coronavirus this was one of the main issues that we discusses on this program. The fact that inequality was actually narrowing and that is what happened. That's what took place before the coronavirus.</p><p>So, the president's policies have been all about jobs and economic growth. And that was certainly playing out before the coronavirus. There's -- there's just no doubt about it.</p><p>Let me bring in Jon Hilsenrath here. John, go ahead.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Hi Mr. Trumka. I -- I want to turn the conversation to the role of unions in getting rid of bad apples among the ranks.</p><p>We saw the George Floyd case though very much in a minority in the George Floyd case, we saw that there could be bad apples in the police force. We've seen in -- in -- in the ranks of teachers that sometimes there are bad teachers and it's hard to get rid of bad teachers.</p><p>Do the unions play a role in protecting bad apples and does that need to change at all?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well first of all, you can get rid of bad actors, if you're seeing it, whether they're police officers or whether they're teachers. You just have to give them the proper due process and you wouldn't want anybody to be denied due process I'm sure.</p><p>We work with our employers to -- to increase the quality of education and now we're working with the police force so that we can change the culture of those police forces to make sure that they meet the needs of the community.</p><p>We want to have public safety as defined by our communities and make sure our police officers are protected and our communities are protected, so we're working with both. That's the role of the union. We can do it better than anybody else, because we have -- we are the best stable (ph) to make cultural change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, do -- do you think you are going to have the same opportunities regardless of who's in the White House in the next election, Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA: No, I think whoever's in the White House makes a lot. Look -- look, Maria, this president has been the worst on working people when it comes to policies. He took overtime away from 3.5 million people, he took a safety standard away from beryllium and silica and coal dust in the coalmines. All of those things have an affect on working people's health and safety.</p><p>The bill that he's put forth right now has nothing for worker health and safety in it. There must be protection for those essential workers and he's not showing any proclivity to give us that. When he ordered the meat packing plant back to work immediately without any health and safety plan, he showed us that he thought we were expendable, that's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lot -- lot of politics here I think. Richard, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so much. Richard Trumka. We will be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Signed, sealed and leased, Facebook betting big on New York City, signing a blockbuster deal to leave the massive and historic Farley Building in Manhattan, leasing this building.</p><p>Dagen, is this a huge win for the real estate market?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's going to be a big win New York City, but I want to point out, that is a digital rendering of the old post office, the Farley Building, which is directly across the street from the Madison Square Garden, because I walk by there every day and it is hell on earth. It is dangerous around that area, the road on the backside of that building on 9th Avenue has pot holes the size of Rhode Island.</p><p>It is impossible to drive down. It is a massive construction zone, so yay for Facebook, but this city has a long way to go, cleaning up. Again, the shootings this year so far have topped all the shootings from 2019, crime, filth, danger, you name it.</p><p>Hopefully, if you have more employees come in, maybe they don't bring their blue voting tendencies with them and vote in somebody who can actually run this city for the better.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And that -- that area, I used to work right there when I was working at CNN, because CNN used to be at Penn Plaza.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I remember that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A block away from that -- from -- from -- from that Farley Building, and you know, it's such a gorgeous building. It is interesting that Facebook that would choose this building, it's historic and -- and beautiful, and such a huge amount of space.</p><p>Many of Facebook's employees doing their jobs remotely, with the option to work from home forever. So, this new deal raises the question, when is Facebook bringing employees back to the office, you know?</p><p>John, what doo you think?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you know, I want to echo what -- what Dagen said about safety, not just in New York, but all over the country. We just ran a story that -- that I wrote yesterday about how homicide is rising at double-digit rates across the country, 24 percent so far this year in cities all over the landscape.</p><p>You know, if cities are going to flourish, in particular New York is the countries biggest city, they have to get the -- they have to restore public safety and for a lot of reasons public safety is under -- is in jeopardy right now. So -- so, I mean, that's a real issue and it needs more attention. And like I say, it's happening all over the country and almost every city that we looked at.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can I add something to that John?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll -- I'll tell you, Dagen, when -- yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, go ahead Maria, what were you going to ask me?</p><p>BARTIROMO: When -- when you and I started talking about this a couple of years ago, we -- we brought it to our viewers attention, the fact that we knew that all of these criminals would be going to be getting off and getting on the -- and be returning to the streets. We didn't even expect it to be as bad as it is today. And we -- we called it, that it would be bad, but this is even worse than I expected, I have to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, and to -- to John's point, what John covered in that -- that journal article is about how shootings and homicides have spiked but other types of violent crime like rape have not and it -- that is -- that is unique to the pandemic in many ways, where people are stuck at home, they're not going -- they're not going out, rapes are not happening, burglary, breaking and entering not happening, but it's gangs that are taking over the streets.</p><p>But what -- the reason that I get so angry about New York City is because this has been years in the making. It is bail reform, it's the cops being told by the city council and the district attorney that you are not going to enforce quality of life crimes. It is a mayor who is useless, who has turned his back on police officers, thereby turning his back on all of the people of New York City.</p><p>So, when I get angry about New York, I'm angry for our co-worker who was attacked and robbed on the way to work in the last two weeks. I'm angry that I have to basically duck and run every time I walk out of my building coming to work.</p><p>So, there are a lot of issues, but you know what, these progressive leaders, these left wing liberals who have driven these cities into hell holes, they do bear a great deal of the responsibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, so what does Mayor De Blasio do, he gets his paint brush with a group and they start paint Black Lives Matter on 5th Avenue. How does that help what's going on?</p><p>Where you going to jump in here Lou?</p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH: Yes, I was going to say, I mean I don't want to diminish your personal experiences because these are real problems, but isn't it now, this is the kind of move that makes things change, the progressive, a company run by progressives, we know there's been conservative bias there I mean through and through. Now them being in the center of this, doesn't that bring attention to the problems that you --</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": And (INAUDIBLE) one last point.</p><p>BASENESE: You have all brought about so -- so early in the process.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point. All right --</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Not if they can blame Trump. Not if they can blame Trump, because that's what's going on.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Hey -- hey, guys, I just want to throw --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I want to throw in one point just to even out this conversation.</p><p>Yes, many -- most American cities are run by Democrats. But when we looked at the data, cities with Republican mayors are also seeing homicides rise. It's a complicated issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I made that distinction.</p><p>HILSENRATH: All I want to say is, it's not -- it's not just politics. Politics, I'm sure, having something to do with it, but there's more going on. If you look at a city like Jacksonville or Omaha or Tulsa, they also have homicide rising in double digit rates. And I just -- I just think that it's a big issue and it needs to be looked at expansively. Politics might have something to do with it, but it's not the whole story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Don't let them off the hook.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, that's fair enough.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Don't -- Jon, I made that distinction -- I made that distinction between what the pandemic has caused --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the horrors wrought on the people of cities like Chicago under left wing leadership and New York City under left wing leadership. I'm angry because I live here and we're being trampled on and ignored and harassed and we are victims of crime every single day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, Dagen, San Francisco as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, you know, you do have policies --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, hold on a second, (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sanctuary city policies, open border policies and you have to consider the policies of some of these cities that are run by Democrats.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Jacksonville has more murders than San Francisco and Seattle combined.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Expanding telehealth services. President Trump signed executive orders to improve access to doctors amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The order builds upon a series of actions we've all taken to make telehealth available to all. We ensured that Medicare covers telehealth visits at no additional cost. That's no additional cost and copayments can be waived for telehealth services. We are working very hard also on prescription drug prices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.</p><p>Mr. Secretary, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining me.</p><p>ALEX AZAR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: Good morning, Maria. Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, great idea on telehealth services. Obviously we need it given this shutdown. Tell us if you believe that this is as effective as meeting with a doctor.</p><p>AZAR: Well, absolutely it's as effective in many circumstances. Now, there will be times where you need to go in and see the doctor, but this unleashes a whole new way of delivering care in America that brings us really into the 21st century. You know, as part of President Trump's historic response to the coronavirus, he ordered me and the Department of Health and Human Services to unshackle healthcare from so many of the artificial regulatory barriers that had stood in the way of better care, lower cost and more choice for people. And telemedicine is one of those area.</p><p>You know now, as part of the coronavirus response, from your home you can connect with your doctor, your hospital. You can get so many services delivered, so much diagnosis to take place. Prescription to happen from there. And what he's ordered is that as much of that as we can do by regulation to keep that going even after the coronavirus.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do doctors feel about this? Are they looking at a decline in revenue and is that causing them to do anything different? I mean I know that some doctors are readily available and are, you know, agreeable to do things on the phone and certainly to be in touch on text and e-mails, but not everybody. So how does one reach the doctor and what do the doctors have to say about this?</p><p>AZAR: Well, I've been traveling all around the country. I've met with hospitals and doctors and patients and telehealth has just, in a few short months, become so embedded in the work flow of how we deliver healthcare. I think if somebody tried to unwind the clock, they'd face a revolution at this point.</p><p>Patients find it more convenient. Doctors are finding it convenient. You know, the key is, they can get paid now for those services.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>AZAR: So whether it's the phone call, the Skype or the FaceTime, that's a critical difference.</p><p>We're going to have to have Congress step up to the plate, though, because there are still in statute many artificial restrictions that have kept healthcare from developing into a modern system. But, you know, we went from 14,000 Medicare telehealth visits a week to 1.7 million a week by the end of April.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>AZAR: So this is something that our seniors and the rest of us are not going to want to give back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's terrific.</p><p>All right, I want to ask you about this supply chain concerns from China. But before I go there, Secretary, what can you tell us about the coronavirus in terms of these worries over spikes. Where are we right now in terms of this -- in terms of this virus? Are you expecting a second spike in the fall?</p><p>AZAR: I don't really think it's useful to talk about second waves or that kind of thing. Was we're seeing is emerging outbreaks and effective tactics that can actually get -- get those -- get at those outbreaks. If we all do our part, if we wear face coverings, practice social distancing, use good personal hygiene, avoid scenarios, situations where we can't do those things, like overcrowded bars or overcrowded indoor restaurants and household gatherings of too many people, if we all do our part, we can remain open, but turn around these infection rates.</p><p>We've seen it in Phoenix. We've seen it in other communities. And now the majority of our states are in -- in a plateau or declining position, but we still have to be very vigilant, all of us, and we have to look for early signs of outbreaks and tackle them right away across the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it leads me to the question about masks. \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting the FDA's effort to shore up supplies has resulted in masks coming into the country of varying quality.</p><p>Secretary, some states have stopped using some of these masks because the FDA sparked confusion about which Chinese masks can be trusted.</p><p>So, what should we think when we've got all of these foreign masks coming in and maybe the ones from China can't be trusted.</p><p>AZAR: Well, I think that's actually an example of the flexibility and regulatory nimbleness that Commissioner Hahn has brought to the FDA. You know, this is -- this actually dates back to March when we were in the throes of the outbreak there in New York and Connecticut and New Jersey and facing shortages of supplies of N-95 masks. And what the FDA said was these KN-95 masks, which come from China, it set up alternative regulatory pathways for them to come into the country, including if it was a reputable operator, if the product was approved in reputable countries, other than China, or if there was independent data validation behind it.</p><p>What we found, though, was that on inspection some of the manufacturers were not reliable and they had not actually gotten that independent test verification. FDA quickly removed those products from the market.</p><p>So I think it just shows that FDA has, under President Trump's direction, been very nimble, very adaptable to meet this unprecedented pandemic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This -- this whole worry about getting things from China that we need so much, whether it's prescription drugs and 70 percent of the active ingredients in our prescription drugs made in China, or this mask issue, how long do you expect it to take to start firing up our supply chains in the U.S. so that we could actually produce some of these things here and we don't have to be reliant on Chinese goods?</p><p>AZAR: Yes. So, Maria, in terms of personal protective equipment, the president's used the Defense Production Act and we're already scaling up domestic manufacturing capability, domestic raw ingredient, active ingredient capabilities for those.</p><p>In terms of pharmaceuticals, you know, we had a really historic announcement last week where we're going to be standing up the Kodak facility there in Rochester, New York, of active -- of active ingredient manufacturer. We're going to really work with our world leading biopharmaceutical industry to onshore more generic manufacturing, more active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing.</p><p>And a lot of that's going to be possible, as you know, Maria, thanks to the president's historic tax reforms that got rid of the confiscatory taxes the United States had that forced drug companies really to manufacture in other countries. Now that the president has fixed that, we can onshore capital investment, onshore jobs. And we've seen that across the pharma industry. It will take some time, but the president's committing to onshoring the pharmaceutical and PPE manufacturing as really part of our core strategic capabilities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's a really important point. We've been talking about that as well.</p><p>So, Secretary, when looking at the spread of coronavirus, task force coordinator Deborah Birx is warning that it is extraordinarily widespread and that rural areas need to take precautions. Tell me about the issues in rural areas. How concerned are you about where the virus is headed? We've been talking about crowded big cities, and now we're hearing that people who have left the cities and are in the country are also contracting this virus.</p><p>AZAR: Yes, I do think it's important that everybody be vigilant. I -- you know, since so much of the outbreak initially was focused in the New York metro area and even some of the recent outbreaks have -- we tend to talk about big metro areas like a Phoenix or a Miami or a Dallas or Houston. But it's misleading to -- to -- to think that it is contained just in those areas. People travel into areas. They go on vacation. They come back to rural communities. And we have so much asymptomatic spreading of disease, I think the message is for all of us, it doesn't matter if you're in a small town in -- in rural America, wear face coverings, practice social distancing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>AZAR: Use good personal hygiene. Don't go into bar settings that are overcrowded where you're not going to be able to do these things. Don't have family gatherings of large number of people at your house because these are the tools we have as individuals to keep our country open --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>AZAR: To allow us to be back to work, back to school, back to healthcare, back to worship.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean --</p><p>AZAR: And we if don't, you end up with shutdowns.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It just -- it just sounds like we're going to be living with this for a while.</p><p>Secretary, several companies, of course, have been tapped to aid the White House in terms of the Operation Warp Speed. Will the U.S. be ready to distribute once a vaccine is approved?</p><p>AZAR: Oh, absolutely. We'll harness the existing CDC systems of distribution for vaccine, the commercial systems of distribution and, of course, we're bringing the entire logistics capabilities of the Defense Department to bear and the unique partnership of Operation Warp Speed. So, absolutely.</p><p>But, you know, Maria, you -- we were talking a bit about the steps that we as individuals can take here with the -- with the current outbreak that's we're seeing. But, you know, just -- we're just months away from tremendous promise here in terms of therapeutics and vaccines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>AZAR: You know, we already have Remdesivir, steroids, convalescent plasma thanks to the president's leadership.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right.</p><p>AZAR: We have monoclonal antibodies that should come in the next several months.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true. Secretary --</p><p>AZAR: We've got a contract for 70,000 to 300,000 doses just from Regeneron by the end of September, early fall.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>AZAR: So, so many advances that we -- should have us all very optimistic about the months ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary, we'll leave it on that optimistic note. Thank you, Secretary Alex Azar.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Bottom lines taking a hit. Many public companies seeing declines this quarter but not Akamai Technologies. The cloud services and cyber security providers latest earnings and revenue beating expectations with more people working from home and utilizing e-commerce due the coronavirus.</p><p>Joining me right now is the CEO of Akamai, Tom Leighton.</p><p>And, Tom, it's great to have you this morning. Welcome back. Good to see you.</p><p>What has this shutdown done for business? Tell us the impact that Akamai has been seeing in the six -- three to six months.</p><p>TOM LEIGHTON, CEO, AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES: Akamai's business has been very strong because we support a lot of the major websites, commerce companies, video companies, you know, work from home kinds of companies that are being used a lot right now. Pretty much everybody relies on the Internet for everything and Akamai helps make the Internet be fast, reliable and secure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And cloud computing has also been a big part of your business. Tell me about that given that we're seeing that part of technology also rise pretty substantially from a business standpoint, is cloud computing part of it?</p><p>LEIGHTON: A big part of it. In fact, most everything we do involves computing at the edge of the cloud, close to the end user, so the end user can buy what they want really quickly, can get a great quality video experience and can be really productive working from home.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tom, I know that another business that you support is TikTok. So I want to get your thoughts on what's going on this morning in terms of this battle to acquire TikTok that Microsoft is under.</p><p>Stay with us. We'll take a short break and then I'll get your thoughts on TikTok when we come back.</p><p>Tom Leighton is with us this morning, the CEO of Akamai.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>And we are talking with Akamai CEO Tom Leighton this morning.</p><p>And, Tom, I want to get your take on really how well positioned Akamai is in this environment, leveraged to some of the major trends happening in consumer and enterprise technology, in particular growth in online gaming, namely video moving online. What's your take on the TikTok situation given the fact that the president is threatening, look, if a deal is not done soon with Microsoft he's going to ban it from the United States.</p><p>LEIGHTON: Well, I think a deal could make a lot of sense and, you know, it could provide, you know, value to both companies and help resolve whatever regulatory issues there may be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you talked on the conference call about one of the reasons for the third quarter guidance was this uncertainty around TikTok, as well as other issues.</p><p>How significant is this to your business?</p><p>LEIGHTON: Well, in India, as you know, there were several dozen apps that were banned and, as a result of that, you know, we'll be receiving $15 million less revenue per quarter. And that was factored into our guidance. I think the impact, if something were to happen in the U.S. like that is far, far less as we said on the call. And, actually, you know, we're optimistic that things can be worked out and that could provide some upside.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your global service footprint positions you inside 1,400 networks, 120 different countries. Are there trends you can share with us during the summertime? Do things slow down in the summertime in terms of streaming and these things that, obviously, drive your business?</p><p>LEIGHTON: Yes, generally the summer season is a little bit lighter in traffic. Of course traffic grows a lot every year and is even, you know, more growth this year. But summer is a light season. I think people are outside. You know, school is not in session and so there's a little bit less usage in the summer than the rest of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So tell us, Tom, where the growth comes from, let's call it the next three years at Akamai. A lot of analysts out there expecting you to continue to gain global market share and, obviously, your stock price has been performing that way. Where is the growth coming from at Akamai going forward?</p><p>LEIGHTON: Yes, we are continuing to gain share and that is an important driver for growth. I think the really exciting growth potential is in our security business. It's now running at over $1 billion a year and growing at 28 percent. And the demand there is stronger than ever. You know, one of the interesting, you know, and unfortunate things about the pandemic is the rate of attacks have gone way up, just exploded as, you know, threat actors are trying to take advantage of the distraction of -- by the -- caused by the pandemic and people working from home and their vulnerabilities, and so that's creating a lot of demand for our security services and we're making lots of investment to stay ahead of the threat actors and protect the world's major enterprises.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And the bad actors are China and Russia, I guess, largely speaking.</p><p>Tom, it's great to have you this morning. Thank you, sir.</p><p>Tom Leighton joining us from Akamai.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020080402cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HD-1VH1-DXH2-6428-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7254\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>President Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alex Azar</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Akamai</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.

You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.  Stay tuned  to hear what the Apple chief had to say about the change coming to Silicon  Valley.</p><p>And a real life Santa Claus spreading holiday cheer at a Vermont Walmart.

Your top  stories at 7:30 a.m.  Eastern.  </p><p>Futures pointing to a lower open this morning.  78 point loss on the Dow  Futures right now, this after a week of red for the major market gauges.   The Dow and NASDAQ last week both falling more than two percent.  The S&amp;P  500 down more than 1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>In Europe we had a little bit of green in England and now the French  markets have turned to the plus side as well.  The DAX Index in Germany  still slightly lower to start this week.  </p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight, gains across the board there, the  biggest winner, the Shanghai up almost one percent.  </p><p>Facebook at war, why CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly has the company on red  alert.

The heart-warming story ahead.  </p><p>And a fizzing success, we introduce you to two sisters who are making a  splash with their own line of bath bombs.  You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.  Stay tuned  to hear what the Apple chief had to say about the change coming to Silicon  Valley.</p><p>And a real life Santa Claus spreading holiday cheer at a Vermont Walmart.

You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.

Your top  stories at 7:30 a.m.  Eastern.  </p><p>Futures pointing to a lower open this morning.  78 point loss on the Dow  Futures right now, this after a week of red for the major market gauges.   The Dow and NASDAQ last week both falling more than two percent.  The S&amp;P  500 down more than 1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>In Europe we had a little bit of green in England and now the French  markets have turned to the plus side as well.

The heart-warming story ahead.  </p><p>And a fizzing success, we introduce you to two sisters who are making a  splash with their own line of bath bombs.  You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.  Stay tuned  to hear what the Apple chief had to say about the change coming to Silicon  Valley.</p><p>And a real life Santa Claus spreading holiday cheer at a Vermont Walmart.

You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.  Stay tuned  to hear what the Apple chief had to say about the change coming to Silicon  Valley.</p><p>And a real life Santa Claus spreading holiday cheer at a Vermont Walmart.   That story later this hour.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, November 19th.  Your top  stories at 7:30 a.m.  Eastern.  </p><p>Futures pointing to a lower open this morning.  78 point loss on the Dow  Futures right now, this after a week of red for the major market gauges.   The Dow and NASDAQ last week both falling more than two percent.  The S&amp;P  500 down more than 1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>In Europe we had a little bit of green in England and now the French  markets have turned to the plus side as well.  The DAX Index in Germany  still slightly lower to start this week.  </p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight, gains across the board there, the  biggest winner, the Shanghai up almost one percent.  </p><p>Facebook at war, why CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly has the company on red  alert.  What it could mean for the company's future and its stocks price.  </p><p>And leaving the crew, the CEO of J. Crew leaving the company, being in that  position for a little more than a year.  We have the details.  That was  Susan Li going hmm.  </p><p>Plus, 'tis the season, the White House preparing to celebrate for the  holidays and one mystery Santa makes some shoppers very happy at a Wal-Mart  in Vermont.  The heart-warming story ahead.  </p><p>And a fizzing success, we introduce you to two sisters who are making a  splash with their own line of bath bombs.  You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p> Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p> Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p> And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p> And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p> Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p> But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p> So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p> CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p> LI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p> Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p> ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p> And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p> He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p> And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p> LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p> LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p> And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p> But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p> How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p> Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p> And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p> So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p> So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p> So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p> So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p> And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p> Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p> We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p> John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p> Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p> CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p> Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p> And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p> And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p> LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p> Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p> FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p> But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p> Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p> LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p> But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p> Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p> Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p> And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p> CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p> LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p> CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p> LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p> CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p> LI:  You know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p> Coming up -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p> Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p> Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p> Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p> ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p> Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p> So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p> LI:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p> LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p> GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p> LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p> GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p> It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p> GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p> So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p> So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p> GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p> GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p> What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p> And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p> GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p> GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p> Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.  Stay tuned  to hear what the Apple chief had to say about the change coming to Silicon  Valley.</p><p> And a real life Santa Claus spreading holiday cheer at a Vermont Walmart.   That story later this hour.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, November 19th.

The heart-warming story ahead.  </p><p> And a fizzing success, we introduce you to two sisters who are making a  splash with their own line of bath bombs.  You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p> To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p> LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p> BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p> But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p> BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p> So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p> BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p> But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p> BASENESE:  OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p> Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p> BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p> But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p> BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p> BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p> BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p> LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p> Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p> BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p> BASENESE Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p> Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p> And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p> All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p> All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p> Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p> CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p> LI:  How did it start?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p> ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p> LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p> I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p> I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p> I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p> LI:  Offer some.  </p><p> CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p> I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p> LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p> I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p> LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p> I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p> I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p> CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p> Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p> Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p> And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p> And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p> Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p> But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p> So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p> CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p> LI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p> Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p> ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p> And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p> He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p> And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p> LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p> LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p> And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p> But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p> How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p> Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p> And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p> So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p> So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p> So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p> So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p> And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p> Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p> We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p> John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p> Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p> CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p> Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p> And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p> And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p> LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p> Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p> FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p> But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p> Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p> LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p> But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p> Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p> Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p> And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p> CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p> LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p> CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p> LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p> CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p> LI:  You know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p> Coming up -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p> Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p> Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p> Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p> ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p> Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p> So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p> LI:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p> LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p> GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p> LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p> GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p> It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p> GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p> So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p> So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p> GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p> GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p> What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p> And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p> GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p> GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p> Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.

The heart-warming story ahead.  </p><p> And a fizzing success, we introduce you to two sisters who are making a  splash with their own line of bath bombs.  You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p> To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p> LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p> BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p> But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p> BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p> So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p> BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p> But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p> BASENESE:  OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p> Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p> BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p> But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p> BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p> BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p> BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p> LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p> Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p> BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p> BASENESE Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p> Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p> And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p> All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p> All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p> Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p> CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p> LI:  How did it start?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p> ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p> LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p> I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p> I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p> I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p> LI:  Offer some.  </p><p> CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p> I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p> LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p> I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p> LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p> I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p> I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p> CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.

You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.

Your top  stories at 7:30 a.m.  Eastern.  </p><p>Futures pointing to a lower open this morning.  78 point loss on the Dow  Futures right now, this after a week of red for the major market gauges.

The heart-warming story ahead.  </p><p>And a fizzing success, we introduce you to two sisters who are making a  splash with their own line of bath bombs.  You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.  Stay tuned  to hear what the Apple chief had to say about the change coming to Silicon  Valley.</p><p>And a real life Santa Claus spreading holiday cheer at a Vermont Walmart.   That story later this hour.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, November 19th.  Your top  stories at 7:30 a.m.  Eastern.  </p><p>Futures pointing to a lower open this morning.  78 point loss on the Dow  Futures right now, this after a week of red for the major market gauges.

You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.

Your top  stories at 7:30 a.m.  Eastern.  </p><p>Futures pointing to a lower open this morning.  78 point loss on the Dow  Futures right now, this after a week of red for the major market gauges.

The heart-warming story ahead.  </p><p>And a fizzing success, we introduce you to two sisters who are making a  splash with their own line of bath bombs.  You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a week of red for all your major market indicators. Dow and Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week. The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session. But now the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight. All four major markets there to the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for alleged financial violations. The automaker looking to remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation but he says it is coming anyway. The tech giant already struggling with orders for its new iPhones. Suppliers are paying the price. We break down all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter. Welcome, one and all. What's on your mind?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we shouldn't have unfair trade practices. We've seen how in the past they've refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft. Now they're not even willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair trading relationship. Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table. Maybe this is art of the deal and then they'll be more reasonable later. I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: But I'm scare when you're using the term \"cold war\". This is a new cold war and it's been opened in 2018. And they're calling chaos at APEC. I mean they've never seen this before. And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking up. And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting like everyone gets along and essentially lying? Like oh, we love each other.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS: Isn't that what diplomacy is?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world what's really going on.</p><p>CARTER: Right. I think it's really fascinating too that people are willing to be patient with this process. Like I've been having some conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we do. They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know, it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now. And I think that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about this. Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as unfairly singling out their trade practices. This is the first time in the summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci --</p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL: Practicing my APEC wave here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- no. If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb. There you go.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: Good, good. I need shoulder surgery. But go ahead. I'm sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Your reaction -- China, the United States. Where do we go from here in terms of the trade relationship?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: So I'm going to say something outrageous. I actually think that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly. And if it's not next week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the concessions that were made that were minor concessions. And so this has typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning. He comes out guns a-blazing. He's boxing away. If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he does. And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President. I know his personality well enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his administration that he's tied up these trade deals. And then he'll want to work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.</p><p>LI: So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me --</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: Were you doing this?</p><p>LI: Well, you know, working on it, at great risk. Great risk --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI: -- because of it. But basically from my sources in Asia, they said that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to Papua New Guinea. So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by not showing respect.</p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't you?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: Well, I mean -- you know, that could be. I think it's a combination of different things. Just the unbelievable schedule that he had leading up into the midterms. I think that they probably held him back from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting anybody. I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think the trade deal gets done. But I don't think anybody should be upset that he didn't make it to APEC.</p><p>FREEMAN: Ok. So we've talked a lot about the President's time line. And this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent fight with the Chinese in your view. That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side? There's this sense that China thinks in decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to deal as well.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: I absolutely think that. If you know where their market is Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things are true. And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.</p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the Chinese government. It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop up those banks. And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the President likes -- I think both presidents like each other. So my guess is this thing will get done. If not next week, shortly thereafter.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox. So listen to this. I want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT: The Democrats right now are focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat. I think the real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time. And Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party. That's not good for the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the speakership.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: As many votes as she needs. As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud. Because it -- it seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she may need the votes. And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want. And they can posture any way that they want. She's an absolutely ruthless killer. I say that in the most complementary, most admirable way.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not literally.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: No, I'm saying metaphorically. But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE) in. She's definitely going to be the House Speaker. So -- and by the way, I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.</p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are being sharpened metaphorically. And she is going to be the House Speaker. So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or you'd rather not?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or anywhere else in the country. And ultimately she is one of the greatest fundraisers in modern Democratic history.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit for the midterm elections. She raised a ton of money and she mobilized people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave. It wasn't a blue ripple. If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been way worse.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to get to this -- speaking of the President. He was sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday. So listen to this, Anthony, and then react.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I like her a lot. I respect her a lot. She's very smart. I want her to get much tougher and we'll see what happens there.</p><p>We get along well. There are certain things I love what he does and there are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on. John will move on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: When will John Kelly move on?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: Look at me. It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right. But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot like George Steinbrenner. So all of us that are aficionados of sports going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens, that's like incoming, take cover. You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him. But he said that with, you know, the attorney general. And he has said that on many different occasions. And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough for him to say let's see what happens, ok. I was gone before he could say let's see what happens.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Who's going to be the next attorney general?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: I don't know. I mean hope it's Chris Christie. You know, I think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial. And I see, you know, there's some --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just made a face.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot. I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's father.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: I got it. I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris. And so I would like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he would also run the department properly.</p><p>CARTER: There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves. Do you think all of this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening? Or are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things up?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an entrepreneur. He's been an entrepreneur his whole life. If you study entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship, there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning until they get the team right.</p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders. If you're a golf guy, you hire golf course builders. He thought ok, I going into the government, I hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very loyal to him or his agenda. And so now he's got to shift the deck and reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.</p><p>LI: So who's going to be the chief of staff? A budget guy? Do you think it will be Mick Mulvaney?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: I don't know. I like him a lot. I think he would be great. Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff. I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of death for both of them. They're probably going to call me later and say stop talking about me on TV. You know, I don't know but I like both those guys.</p><p>FREEMAN: I mean your experience, I understand --</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN: PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days. But --</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk -- Jim. But, you know --</p><p>FREEMAN: Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things there. I mean --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't think this is a given.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: Name one good thing that he's done.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, for example --</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax cut.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?</p><p>FREEMAN: I would say both of them. But I would say Kelly deserves some credit here as the chief of staff.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really comes out, ok. I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I. So we're going to see --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I did.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: -- the aftermath of this whole thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. Because I want to -- that's the narrative.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: He hasn't been fair to the President. I mean just read what he talks about -- read what he says about the President.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office. And I think that people who know the President push back on that.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: I pushed back on that very hard, ok. And I don't even care that John fired me. That's ridiculous. That won't be the last time I've been fired. It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok. I'm a bit of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok. He hurt the morale inside the White House, ok. And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the President.</p><p>Forget about me. Let's say that I wasn't. but I'm just talking about other people inside the White House.</p><p>FREEMAN: But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: They're playing the music, brother. See that? I'm going to get out of here. We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?</p><p>LI: Make a twist, more wrist action.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: I just want to make sure. Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: Holding back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest. More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman. Cheryl Casone has the details on this developing story -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: It is. And we're hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news. Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal investigation found significant acts of misconduct. Japanese media reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also arrested. Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company from near bankruptcy. He is also chairman and chief executive of France's Renault. Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their records clean of complaints by customers and employers. According to a new study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of brokers. Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates the brokerages. FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok. There is this. Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University. It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school. The money can allow students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.</p><p>And those are your headlines. A lot of cash -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are beneath him.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, pretty much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He has to socialize with billionaires.</p><p>CASONE: Millionaire whatever. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just really quickly. This is money well spent. Running for president, maybe not so much.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. I think he's going to look at that and find that there's not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and social liberalism.</p><p>LI: And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on sugary sodas. He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through things like that.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on gun control issues. And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some ways. He knows how to balance a budget. But that means taking things away from people.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go. But I just -- I don't see it.</p><p>CARTER: I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology. So I don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.</p><p>LI: Or a running mate potentially?</p><p>CARTER: An interesting idea, for sure.</p><p>LI: You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the Iowa State Fair. That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up --</p><p>FREEMAN: Always good advice.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales. Why strong corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors' spirits.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's take a look at futures. They're pointing to a lower open on Wall Street with technology on the decline. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin Gibbs. Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come back to technology stocks?</p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P: No, we've been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks. There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced growth stocks. And part of that is because technology is actually going to have massively slowing growth next year. They're actually going to have below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from as well as better valuations.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and Procter &amp; Gamble.</p><p>LI: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's where the money was.</p><p>LI: And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman bought a stake recently. But I was really a little shocked by reading the Goldman Sachs report this weekend. They're predicting GDP to be 3.5 percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005. Next year in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.</p><p>GIBBS: Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year this year. But it's really tough to keep up that pace. And we're even seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit growth this year and 8 percent next year. And so it's just harder and harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.</p><p>LI: But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?</p><p>GIBBS: Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people start looking at 2019. It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh, wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year. There's going to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy. We're not talking about a recession or anything. It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a little.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. I think that does raise a question, whether people are too cautious. The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings growth, the multiples are not that huge. Maybe on some of the tech names, but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?</p><p>GIBBS: No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward valuations and PEs. And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings. That is not super cheap. That's actually in line with about your sort of three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up. We could certainly go up, you know, 10 percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation. But we could also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6 percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets for this market -- in this territory.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want to mention retail really quickly. A big list of companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L. Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.</p><p>GIBBS: Victoria's Secret.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there. Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector? Will it give us a window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS: Yes. This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going to see, look for guidance for the holiday season. Right now forecast for retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever. We're looking at about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes to online.</p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit. The people that sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up and that type of thing. So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going to be an interesting year. Yes, this is a very important week for those holiday sales.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little outdated. The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell. Anyway, that was my two cents.</p><p>GIBBS: Agreed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I put you on the spot -- Erin. But let's hope for a nice holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.</p><p>GIBBS: Yes, they did. And they've been struggling. And they -- again, it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them. These big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good to see you -- Erin. Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology. Stay tuned to hear what the Apple chief had to say about the change coming to Silicon Valley.</p><p>And a real life Santa Claus spreading holiday cheer at a Vermont Walmart.

You got to stay tuned for that.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: I am not a big fan of regulation. I'm a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free market's not working. And it hasn't worked here. And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory. Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou Basenese. Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?</p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH: Look, he's being honest like, big tech blew it. They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it. And you know, I think it's unfair for Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after users' data and protected it, it's Apple. Now, you flip over to Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are predicated on exploiting user data. So, you know, built by association.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, Lou -- I mean, OK. So, yes, it's a different business model. I think we have to understand that first of all. And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to be able to go on the offensive at this point. He's -- yes, he's more of a hardware maker. Were as others sell free services, they take your data. So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.</p><p>BASENESE: Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic. There's no reason to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this. If you remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too. And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.</p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex. They do look after our user data. Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data based on data images and key words you use. I mean, is there no information that's not safe from Facebook? I mean, that's the kind of thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people from getting to your data.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: To be fair though, I mean, to say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a little bit of fear mongering, right? Because if they're putting this together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a value exchange that's happening. And we're acting a little bit like it's on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.</p><p>BASENESE: No, I agree with you. There's got to be an exchange, right? You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some privacy. But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your protections kick in?</p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering. But at the end of the day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses. I mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple is at 0.4 percent. So, you know, it's just built into that model and we have to figure out. Tim Cook said it, it didn't work. The free market didn't work here. Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out where that balance is.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall Street Journal. I think we could argue whether the market's working or not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working? We've seen these reports. They didn't -- they want to share a little less information lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd like to see. What kind of condition is Apple in right now?</p><p>BASENESE: Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium. Less transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing. And you know, I think this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models. So we've had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.</p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple. They're really making this pivot to show that their services business. I mean, their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business. So it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right? That's going to be make or break for Apple. And we're not going to get the data on whether they sold enough iPhones. And I really don't think that's as important as how much money they've made per customer and from that those services businesses.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.</p><p>BASENESE: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times story last week. It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg adopts a more aggressive style. Here's part of it. Mr. Zuckerberg's new approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key executives from the company. At times, it is created tensions with his long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. Lou, your take on this.</p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been? If you're running the company, he was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every year. And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a cocktail, join the party, where have you been. That all of these -- that all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since day one.</p><p>BASENESE: Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there. I mean, remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal? I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere to be found for days. I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership here. So look, I'm glad. If he's really genuine about going to war, it's about time. Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early. It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for years. LI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That was the business model. That's how they grew to the size that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.</p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my home address is and why you need my phone number. At every -- at every moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the service is for free. Well, it's not free. They're using your data and they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade. But -- well, also, I think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.</p><p>BASENESE: Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right? And I think you're right, it's --</p><p>FREEMAN: Should they?</p><p>BASENESE: I think they should, absolutely. I mean, look, the New York Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right? Saying that this was known well in advance and what if Facebook --</p><p>FREEMAN: yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in 2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of media that our customers are consuming.</p><p>BASENESE: Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of materiality. And I would tell you that every single shareholder would argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material. So that's not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the public.</p><p>MCDOWELL: James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this, I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at --</p><p>FREEMAN: Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- that we would never know about any of this.</p><p>FREEMAN: (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. It's a little bit rich.</p><p>LI: But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg. There's no love lost between those two. You know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including Facebook.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are, do they get that liability waiver? That's something that congress could easily do, just pointing that out.</p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good to see you. Come back soon sir.</p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great conversation.</p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the holiday season's biggest shopping day.</p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its journey to Washington today, more coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long. Cheryl Casone has the details. Hi, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, quick relationship to tell you about, Dagen. James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months on the job. Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the company should evolve. J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping season without their CEO. Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure to appoint somebody new.</p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the National Christmas Tree at the White House today. The nearly 20-foot tall, 800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured in the Blue Room. It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00 Eastern Time. It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however. They're going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's nice list. An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later. I get goose bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the Christmas spirit walking amongst us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items, the mystery man said Santa Claus can. Store officials are not going to say how much the secret Santa spent but good for him. No bah humbug at that Wal-Mart, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I did not know, sadly. It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.</p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business, all before they're old enough for college. We'll speak to these two entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even enter college. Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in their mom's kitchen. And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year. Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and Isabel Bercaw. Good to see you both.</p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS: Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How old were you when you started this business?</p><p>C. BERCAW: We were about 10 and 11. Yes, it was pretty crazy.</p><p>LI: How did it start?</p><p>C. BERCAW: Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all the time. But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would stain the tub. And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside our bath bombs which was the surprise.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?</p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS: It could be like a toy or message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry. And it always coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb. And we have bath bombs for everybody. So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and kids a alike. Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI: But how did you think we could turn this into a business? You were 10 and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW: Yes, we first started at a local art fairs. But then a local salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in his salon.</p><p>I. BERCAW: And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this. And now, I just want to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco, Target, just to name a couple. So it's gone beyond like the local salon owner.</p><p>C. BERCAW: Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW: Yes. We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right now. No question that we haven't had a lot of help. You know, our parents help us and our business partners help us and everything.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, Lee can help you. Because she is a marketing and branding wizard, if you need any free advice. Lee?</p><p>LI: Offer some.</p><p>CARTER: I would love to do that separately. But I'm curious, you said that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been exploring this idea on how you can grow your business. Tell us a little bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that you've gotten along the way.</p><p>I. BERCAW: I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other people and know that they've been there as well. Because when you're starting a business it's really hard work. And there's a lot of fun as well. But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it? So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.</p><p>LI: Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?</p><p>C. BERCAW: We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so supportive and just let us go with this. So, thanks mom and dad.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of more regular jobs?</p><p>C. BERCAW: Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background. And our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this. So they kind of work very well together.</p><p>I. BERCAW: And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to follow in their footsteps.</p><p>LI: Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to college?</p><p>C. BERCAW: Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW: Yes. If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target and Costco that I was talking about?</p><p>C. BERCAW: Yes, we recently launched with Costco. We're in Ulta as well and CVS, so.</p><p>I. BERCAW: And we just got a target end cap where all these new products will be available. So, they're brand-new additions to our line.</p><p>CARTER: Really exciting.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bless you both. And Happy holidays. A Happy Thanksgiving to both of you. Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.</p><p>C. BERCAW: Thank you so much for having us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely. Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\". We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018111902cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSB-2M51-JB20-G2N6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7565\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 19, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000292A</classCode><className>COSTCO WHOLESALE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS452311 WAREHOUSE CLUBS &amp; SUPERCENTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC5399 MISC.

This hour, Twitter at a record low. We're going to give you the takeover odds. Microsoft investing $100 million in Uber. Why that spells trouble for Google.</p><p>And republican presidential candidate Jim Gilmore is the 17th to announce. He's going to be joining me here to tell us why he is number one. Risk &amp; Reward starts now.</p><p>Hackers can go after airplanes, cars, government data, corporate e-mail like Sony. Now, Chinese hackers may have hit the University of Connecticut exposing thousands of student's social security and credit card details. Fortalice CEO former White House CIO, Theresa Payton is with me now. Theresa, I want to know, of course, how this happen, but why? Why the University of Connecticut? Why students?</p><p>THERESA PAYTON, FORTALICE CEO: Well, here is the thing. The hackers have realized, hey, where is the next treasure trove that I can go after that might be a little easier to break into than the banks and some of the other companies and industries that have been hit hard. And they think, ah, colleges and universities.</p><p>I can steal a research and I can steal everything about a student not just their major, but if they've applied for financial aid, they have their parent's information, the student's information. All of the financial data that they need to not only masquerade as the student, potentially also as their parents who are on these forms.</p><p>It sounds like they've been in there almost two years as well. So, who knows how much information the bad guys got away with this time?</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Now, the hack was discovered in March but probably happened back in September 2013. So, intruders had lot of opportunities to use data that they stole. Why did it take so long to pinpoint?</p><p>PAYTON: Well, what's happening with the hackers they've changed tactics. They're not as nosy as they used to be when they break-in and they don't try and run out the door with all of the crown jewels at the same time. They watch how the systems work, they watch how the system security works, and then they will find different ways to try and sneak around that.</p><p>They may have used credentials of legitimate employees at the university or legitimate vendor credentials. And they may have used that to actually slip the data out the door -- just quietly and under sort of the guys of legitimate credentials.</p><p>We don't know because that investigation is still ongoing. You know, the other piece, too, is they may never be able to trust this network again. The fact that they were in this long they can hide themselves in files, in system files, the operating system, and they can actually be there and come back time and time again. So, it's going to be very difficult to get the bad guys out of this network.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Now, how do we know, Theresa, that it's China?</p><p>PAYTON: We don't really know for sure until the investigation concludes. And I always caution organizations when they say it's (AUDIO GAP) or Russia or they pick a country to (AUDIO GAP). Look, I can send traffic from any country in the world that I want to so that you think the traffic is originating in that country.</p><p>A lots of hackers know that China is in the forefront of discussions and so they may be sending their traffic from China. Until the forensics continues and they look at different things like what was the native language of the hackers? What types of tools and techniques did they use because each one in the cyber syndicates kind of has their own fingerprint method, if you will. And that really has not happened yet. And until it does we don't know for sure that it was China.</p><p>BOLTON: So, do you think we're just going to see more and more of these kinds of attacks?</p><p>PAYTON: Absolutely. I think what every organization needs to realize -- if you are connected to the Internet and you have one piece of data that's of value to hackers. They will find a way to monetize it or use you as a disguise to hack somebody else.</p><p>These hacks are going to continue until we start taking matters into our own hands. For starters, these kids who are just starting their lives this pivotal moment they have got to not just trust on free credit reporting, they have to freeze their credits.</p><p>From a university standpoint, they want to be open minds open and trusting. They have to go back and look at what's valuable information here and start locking that off whether it's from vendors looking at user access controls. They need to start locking up this data and every organization should take a lesson from today and ask some critical questions of themselves, how safe is our data and who might be after it?</p><p>BOLTON: And we know that the engineering school helped you to discover it. So, I guess more schools as well will be tapping in-house resources. Theresa Payton, thank you as always. Fortalice CEO, former White House CIO.</p><p>Well, staying on the scene, less a week after the White House said, it would not retaliate against China for hacking. President Obama plotting to take action. This is according to The New York Times.</p><p>Retired Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cowan with me now. So, Colonel, why this reversal of opinion and of action?</p><p>BILL COWAN, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST: Probably a lot of pressure from him, Deirdre. About the fact that 22 million of people's information private data got hacked including my own as a guy who used to have a security clearance. So, I think the White House -- a lot of pressure from Congress, pressure from the public, the White House is deciding they have to do something.</p><p>At this point, they're thinking about doing something. They haven't quite said they will do anything.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Colonel, China has maintained -- it did nothing. I mean, they've actually come out with a statement saying, \"It was not us.\" So, what can the Obama administration really do? Will there will be a symbolic response? Or will there be something a little bit more aggressive?</p><p>COWAN: No. I think it will be symbolic and vast because they don't want to get in some kind of tit for tat. A spot with the Chinese who have all - - as much leverage over us certainly as we do over them in the financial sector, the business sector. So, my guess is, excuse my term here, but maybe we'll bitch slap them a little bit but we may not do much more than that.</p><p>But the real thing, Deirdre, I believe is, when something like this happens and the White House tried to pretend that China didn't do it -- I think they knew almost from the outset that it was China. When something like this happens the only way we counter these kinds of things is fast, aggressive, unquestionable response of the same nature of what they did to us.</p><p>BOLTON: So, I hear what you're saying. In other words, we have to make it uncomfortable for anyone attacking us. So, at least they think twice about doing it again.</p><p>COWAN: That's exactly right. And you know what, as your previous guest was just saying, it's the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians, it might be some kid in the basement in Toronto who's learned how to make cyber-attack on us. But if we're not able to stand up decisively and firmly almost immediately upon knowing who it was and do something to them, they are going to continue to do this to us forever.</p><p>BOLTON: Colonel, we're so glad you're with us. Bill Cowan joining us there. Retiring -- retired rather, lieutenant colonel there with us on this very latest with cyber security.</p><p>Well, speaking of tech but from a different aspect, Microsoft recent investment part of why Uber has a valuation of more than $50 billion.</p><p>Doug MacMillan is here. He broke the story for The Wall Street Journal. So, Doug, Microsoft and Uber, are they new BFF?</p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER: Maybe not BFF as much as they are business partners. You know, Uber has been pushing to build its own technology and its own maps. And we've heard as part of the latest financing round, they disclosed that they've been looking for big technology partners to help them do that.</p><p>Now, Microsoft is really not known as the cutting edge of maps but they are one of the few large technology companies that does have assets and expertise and engineers who are working on maps specifically in Bing mapping division.</p><p>Now, last month or actually in June, Uber announces it's acquiring some of those Bing assets. But apparently, Microsoft and Uber have also worked out an arrangement where Microsoft is going to invest in Uber. So, we don't know if they're going to work together going forward but they're now definitely partners with Microsoft owning a very, you know, a hard to come by stake in Uber.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Hard to come by a stake in Uber. You said a few things in there. I just want to know looking at it from Microsoft's angle, does it somehow legitimize or show that Microsoft is in a current field especially -- I don't know, I'm just thinking the Windows 10 upgrade or using yet, had to be free because no one would pay for it. So, does this bring Microsoft back towards cutting edge companies?</p><p>MACMILLAN: I wouldn't go that far. But it definitely calls to mind, in earlier Microsoft investment -- the former CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, invested in Facebook when that company was only at a $15 billion valuation. That investment turned out to be very lucrative for Microsoft.</p><p>But with that stake, now being work something like $2.5 billion on its own. So, perhaps Microsoft by investing in Uber could potentially have a good financials when fallen also for its current Satya Nadella can make him kind of look smart and look like he's connected to kind of one of the cutting edge companies here in Silicon Valley.</p><p>BOLTON: And this also challenges Uber, right? Because we know that Uber made an initial investment in Uber back in the day. But now Google has also moving towards its own self- driving a cars, so it just seems like Uber has to find another big tech partners that can write big checks.</p><p>MACMILLAN: Yes. This is one of the most interesting stories about Uber. As one of its earliest investors and closest partners is now also increasingly looking like a competitor. So, with Uber trying to distance itself more from Google, there is definitely an element of, you know, is Uber taking money from Microsoft because of this \"enemy of my enemy is my friend\" principle. We don't know the story of that but definitely it's a juicy story line.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Well, diplomacy important even among tech companies. Doug MacMillan, thank you so much. Great scoop for The Wall Street Journal. We want to bring you up-to-date with some breaking news</p><p>Debt ravage of Puerto Rico officially in default. Moody is saying, you paid $628,000 but that is a fraction of the 58 million that was due, that is the default in our book. So, Moody's is in fact saying that Puerto Rico has defaulted and you do have of course, Puerto Rican officials saying, we don't want to default, we do not want a debt spiral to start.</p><p>We will bring you up-to-date with the very latest headlines and reaction.</p><p>In the meantime, tech billionaire Elon Musk warning against using robots in the military. But our next guest says he is making a big mistake. We'll tell you why.</p><p>Plus, the first GOP presidential debate is on Thursday. One of the candidates is joining us tonight with his plan for America. Stay tuned.</p><p>BOLTON: Here are some of the stories we are following for you at this hour. Twitter shares touching a record low as the company went public. You'll recall November 2014, but shares plunged today and they are down below $30 a share for the first time in more than a year. Some say, this makes it a takeover target.</p><p>President Obama unveiling a major climate change plan. It aimed at large reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the nation's coal burning power plants. The EPA is estimating the plan would cost around $8.5 billion.</p><p>Vice President Joe Biden has begun to actively explore a possible presidential campaign. The New York Times columnist reporting that Biden had been holding meetings such as his residents about jumping in to challenge Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire. He could pose the biggest threat of any democrat as the front runner to Hillary Clinton.</p><p>U.S. oil worth noting here settling at 45.17 a barrel, the lowest in more than four months. Continuing a trend of a reduction of about 50 percent since the fall.</p><p>Well, the future of modern warfare is like any other industry, technology will play a big role. Last week, where than 1,000 researchers including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking signed a letter to the U.N. asking for a ban on the development and use of autonomous weapons or killer robots.</p><p>My next guest says they will actually save lives. The author of \"Ghost Fleet,\" P.W. Singer with me now. So, P.W., thanks so much for joining us. Why do you disagree with those who signed the letter, those are some of our best and brightest minds?</p><p>P.W. SINGER, \"GHOST FLEET\" AUTHOR: I don't disagree with this sentiment that they want it cause positive change in the world. I think what I disagree with is the idea of how effective this effort is going to be. The book that we did documents right now at least 21 different cases of working on this kind of weaponry in the U.S. in China, et cetera.</p><p>And the reason the militaries are working on this is not because they think it's cool, it's not because of, you know, some kind of terminator vision. Because they think it's going to be useful. And so, if this effort is going to win out, this letter writing campaign it's going to have to overcome the idea of use.</p><p>The other thing to mention here is of course, it's not just the military that's working on robotics and autonomy, its private business. Its companies like Google and Amazon and the like. And so, if it's playing out in the civilian sector it's going to happen, it's going to move over in the war too.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. But how can we estimate or how can we make it so that only the right armies -- this sound like a crazy question -- are building this and not the wrong ones? I mean, who's the judge?</p><p>SINGER: Well, I think you've just put your finger on the problem. Every single technology in history has been used for both good and bad whether it's a stone or whether it's a drone. With drone we've seen everything from the U.S. military to ISIS fly to them.</p><p>I think what makes these technologies so challenging is that they have very low barriers to entry right now. And so, for looking at a future conflict be it a small war or a big war with the China or Russia, all the different players are going to have this technology. And that's a very big difference for the U.S. that weak for in Ghost Fleet. Is what does it mean to go on to a war where you're not a generation the head of the other side in technology.</p><p>BOLTON: And as for when we see this kind technology in the battlefield? When is it?</p><p>SINGER: Well, we're already seeing robotics in the battlefield right now. You know, for example, in the war against the ISIS everyone from the U.S. military to the Syrian military to ISIS itself have flown drones. I think if you're looking forward to the 2020s period, you're going to see technology that's more and more autonomous.</p><p>And by that, I mean, not just the cars that we drive on highways or Amazon delivery drones but also the drones that are out there in the battlefield. And, you know, for example, the U.S. Navy has already tested out a drone that took off and landed from an aircraft carrier on its own. The toughest human pilot task. That of course is going to move into a future war.</p><p>Same thing, China has three different long range strike programs that are droned, that are not unmanned. If we were to fight them they would be using this kind of technologies. So, the bottom line here is that, if there was a World War, which we explore in this book, it would be one where you'd see a mix of man and machine.</p><p>And of course, it's not just robotics systems in and of themselves. It's that the manned systems will become more robotic. A lot like how we have cars right now that can parallel park themselves.</p><p>The U.S. Navy is building a new warship...</p><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p>SINGER: ... that it has about one-tenth the size of the crew in the past. Because the war ship is so highly robotics.</p><p>BOLTON: P.W., glad to have you with us. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Great book. P.W. Singer joining us there, he is the author of \"Ghost Fleet.\"</p><p>Well, stock you saw in the red today. We're going to look at the correlation between earnings and performance. SO, you had 65 companies in the NASDAQ, 100 reporting. Stocks swinging up or down at an average of more 5 percent immediately after reporting results.</p><p>All in the last three weeks, the highest volatility, if you like, on that front since 2012.</p><p>Bob Rice is here. Managing partner at Tangent Capital, author of \"The Alternative Answer.\" Bob, one minute on the clock. Please explain correlate.</p><p>BOB RICE, TANGENT CAPITAL MANAGING PARTNER: So, correlation is a very simple but very important concept. You know, just free first to how closely a given stocks movement track the movement of the larger index.</p><p>And so, when you're in the period of high correlation, you can really think of it like a flock of birds. One bird turns a little bit they all turn a little bit. One turns dramatically they all turn dramatically. The opposite of that is when all stocks have different kinds they are in the early minds and they act as you see here like a herd of cats instead.</p><p>So, that's a low correlation environment. And the reason this is important is we seem to be transitioning from a high correlation to a low correlation right now, and that matters. Because over the last few years, frankly, it hasn't made that much difference exactly which stocks you own because they all acted alike. They were highly correlated.</p><p>We're moving now to a different period, (inaudible) correlation, you're going to have to be a lot more careful about what's exactly in your portfolio.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. With 10 seconds to go, leave bulls and bears aside, we're going to do cats and birds here. But, Bob, most importantly, why is this happening now?</p><p>RICE: Well, I think it's because you're seeing peeling back of quantitative easing than we were very cheap flooded with easy money, all boats were...</p><p>BOLTON: For nine years.</p><p>RICE: Yes. We're coming up with that tie. Now, it's starting to be different. And you can see it very clearly in what you were saying in the intro there. Up until very recently it didn't really matter whether stock beat its earnings estimate or disappointed. It was still in the flock of birds. It behaves like the rest of the flock. All of a sudden it matters dramatically. If you beat your earnings estimates you do way better than the average. If you disappoint you do way worse. And that's what is important for investors to start paying attention too.</p><p>To see that the investor can do that.</p><p>BOLTON: The number one thing an inventor can do then going into this environment. Diversification I imagine.</p><p>RICE: Well, yes. But over diversification because now matters exactly which ones you're in. And so, you want to be in more concentrated higher conviction portfolios and not so much super broad based ETFs and indexes.</p><p>BOLTON: Bob Rice, we thank you as always. Bob Rice joining us there, managing partner at Tangent Capital, also the author of \"The Alternative Answer.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of volatility, the Greek stock market reopened for the first time in five weeks. It was a blood bath dropping more than 20 percent, just a few minutes into the open, banking stocks hit the worst.</p><p>With us now to discuss this kind of volatility, Jason Rosiak. He is senior managing director at Pacific Asset Management. Jason, thanks for coming in.</p><p>JASON ROSIAK, PACIFIC ASSET MANAGEMENT SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR: Thank you very much.</p><p>BOLTON: So, we're just hearing from Bob Rice about correlation, perhaps this breaks lots of volatility whether it's Greece, whether it's China, whether it's Iran, there are certainly a lot of hot spots in the world. What are you doing with your money?</p><p>ROSIAK: Right now it's being at the core for a bottom's up firm. So, one of the things that we're looking at is corporate credit and the focus is on fundamentals and coverage. And so, with Greece right now, for instance, the stock market was down by 16 percent today, challenging but that's just an underlying risk associated with what's going on there in the volatility.</p><p>BOLTON: So, not the average person can as of this moment go out and buy a Greek debt? But it sounds like you're saying for professional investors this is an opportunity?</p><p>ROSIAK: It's not for Greek debt but for corporate debt in the U.S. side. So, what we do is we focus on bank loans. And bank loans are floating arrangements that usually general names that PetSmart, Chuck E. Cheese, those types of names that are U.S.-based focused yield anywhere between 3 to 6 percent. The floating rates don't have to worry about duration risk. And it's a noble...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: So, let's say the Fed moves in either September or December as fed for the future are indicating. What does this mean?</p><p>ROSIAK: So, for this asset class which is nice, is not -- it doesn't have duration. So, therefore, it's dependent on the corporate underlying how they react and how they fundamentally performed. So, unlike other asset classes that generally speaking, people use in inflationary or high rising rates environment whether it be you're sitting in tips or you're sit in real estate or commodities, there is a lot of volatility there.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>ROSIAK: In the taper tension you had commodities go down by about 4 percent, and TIPS go down by 7 percent, or as bank loans.</p><p>BOLTON: And TIPS, Inflation Protective Securities.</p><p>ROSIAK: Correct.</p><p>BOLTON: For those who do not follow as closely as you do. The best idea you've heard of in the past few weeks?</p><p>ROSIAK: Best idea, we still like corporate credit. We like triple B investment-grade credit fairly these are amounts of spread involved there. And it's better than owning interest-rate sensitive or commodities sensitive type of assets.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Jason, come back. We want to continue the conversation another time. Jason Rosiak joining me there. Senior managing director at Pacific Asset Management.</p><p>When we come back, Uber may be recruiting your grandparents. We are not joking. Older drivers may be safer drivers. First though, former Governor Jim Gilmore may have announced the 17th kisses. He's going to end up as number one. He is my guest, next.</p><p>BOLTON: There are 17 republican candidates running for president in 2016. With us now the very latest contender, former Virginia Governor, Jim Gilmore with us from D.C.</p><p>Governor, glad to have you with us.</p><p>JIM GILMORE, FORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR: Thank you, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: You are entering a crowded GOP field. What do you hope to gain and why now?</p><p>GILMORE: Well, I hope to gain the ability to turn the country around from the decline that it's in, wherein a decline in our national security in our safety of Americans and the American interests. We're in a decline in the economy. The economy has never really recovered from the recession. We're really not doing well enough.</p><p>And I think I have the credentials in order to being turn this around. All my life I have fought on behalf of my state in my country. I'm a United States army veteran. I was the chairman of the National Commission on Terrorism for the United States. I was the governor during the 9/11 attack.</p><p>I've been the governor of a state and band I stood had to deal with budgets and create jobs and do things. So, I've always been in a position I think to really help this. And right now I see a decline in America that I think I can reverse.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Governor, I want to pick up on exactly what you just said, this background as an army intelligence officer, we talked about cyber on this program every single day. What is the number one thing that could be changed right now to better protect America? Does it need to hire more engineers? What does the budget need to look like? How can we improve cyber security of our businesses and our citizens right now?</p><p>GILMORE: Well, we're going to have to recognize with presidential leadership exactly the nature of the society we live in. When I was the governor I was known as the technology governor because I've really pushed forward on all of our policies and programs and also cyber issues.</p><p>We have to recognize that opposition people really try to and do us right now. Look at the Chinese situation. They've gone in now and invaded our records with people who have security clearances and there's been an absolutely no repercussions.</p><p>This is an example once again, of the decline of the United States because of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. We need to make it that America is back. The best way to do that is to remove the sequester limits from our defense department to get full or move forward once again in the restoration of American strength.</p><p>And of course, that's going to require of the American economy.</p><p>BOLTON: So, to spend more on defense. If you could change one thing, let's say, you're elected, what would you do the first order of business?</p><p>GILMORE: The first order of business is to restore the American economy. Right now we are discouraging business. You heard Hillary Clinton actually talk about trying to attack business in this country and income equality and all those kinds of warm ball of marches kind of ideas.</p><p>What you have to do is to make a renewal once again of the free enterprise system in this country. And that means that we have to actually to put in policies that don't discourage investment but restoring investment in this country. Investment means more productivity. More productivity means more jobs. And more jobs means higher wages.</p><p>And we're not going to be able to have a real national security until we restore the American economy to give a better quality of life of the American people and a stronger economy to protect ourselves in this dangerous world.</p><p>BOLTON: Governor, you used to be chairman as well of the Republican National party, the republican National Committee. I want to ask you what do you make of Donald Trump? There are so many pundits, so many republicans who keep waiting for his campaign to run out of steam but it's not. Is he what the American public wants?</p><p>GILMORE: I think that he's struck a nerve, a resentment, and anger in among the American people. I thought about it a lot. I don't have any real interest in that. What I have an interest in is actually making the country better and responding to this anger and to this resentment with genuine positive programs.</p><p>And that's what why I've talked to you about here today. If we put forward a program that gives a tax cut to working Americans that combines all business activity and charges at 15 percent tax rate, if we eliminate the debt tax, our economists have told us that what that will do is get the economy moving again. Get us up to growth over 4 percent, do something that really create some dynamic excitement in this economy.</p><p>That's the kind of anger and resentment because people know that the people in Washington are not doing anything to move the country forward. That's why I think I'm qualified to do. That's what I want to achieve. I want to reverse this decline from the Obama-Clinton policy, that's why I've entered the presidential race.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Governor, we're glad to have you with us. Thank you for the time. Former Virginia Governor and 2016 presidential candidate, Jim Gilmore.</p><p>Well, will Trump maintain his number one spot? Tune in right after this show at 6 p.m. Eastern Time sharp. Charles Payne has Fox's exclusive latest poll numbers.</p><p>When we come back, though Twitter getting crushed, some say it is a live takeover target. We're going to give you a short list of would-be buyers.</p><p>But first, Uber is announcing a partnership with the AARP to recruit older drivers. We'll talk about the fact whether it a PR sons or a real business initiative.</p><p>BOLTON: Twitter shares closed at the all-time low. Jack Hidary is here. He is the former CEO of Dice.com. Ari Zaldan is here as well. The CEO of Quantum Networks. Welcome to you both.</p><p>JACK HIDARY, FORMER DICE.COM CEO: Great to see you.</p><p>BOLTON: Great to see you. So, is Twitter in play? Aye (ph) or nay?</p><p>HIDARY: Twitter is in trouble.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>HIDARY: Twitter does not know where it's going. It's headless, stateless, does not have a leader right now, there's no captain of the ship. And also it doesn't know what it's doing because it is a 300 million monthly active users has not grown effectively in two years.</p><p>BOLTON: And to you point, there is no CEO, I mean, jack Dorsey is there, one of the original founders but he had said...</p><p>HIDARY: But he's also the CEO of Square. Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. I mean, it's clear that he is a part-time or transitional. So, $30 actually per share is a number that I saw a lot of analysts come up with it and say, you know what, this starts to look cheap enough for someone to buy. What is your take?</p><p>ARI ZOLDAN, QUANTUM NETWORKS CEO: Right. Yes. I think $30 is a great buy. I don't think it's cheap but I think it's a good buy. And I think to push back a little bit, they will get a CEO and I think they're get a really good CEO. The question is when. But you're right. Right now it's sort of in between times. So, I think there's a lot of questions out on the street.</p><p>HIDARY: But when the CEO comes the question is, what's their strategy, right? What kind of practice is it? Why is it not growing even though every show, including this one, talks Twitter all the time.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, I think it's great for journalist and I love it. I'm an addict. I say that openly, but it's true that if you're not in media and you're not reading I don't know why you would do if you're not in this field.</p><p>HIDARY: SO, WhatsApp is growing, Snapchat is growing by leaps and bounds. Yet, twitter just remains flat. So, there is a real crisis in terms of how do you grow this. You can't grow. You're not going to grow revenues and profit either.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. And of course, you know, as you say, Facebook hot on the heels with its own app. Uber is partnering with AARP. I don't know if you saw that Simpsons clip there. But is this idea the older drivers are safer drivers? PR, real business strategy, what do you think?</p><p>ZOLDAN: No, real business. It's real and I think it's great. You know, it's not cutie. I think it's very real. You have a million Uber rides per day, a 160,000 drivers out there on behalf of Uber. And you have a demographic that's older, a lot of them are unemployed but they're also great drivers. So, it's a perfect strategic fit.</p><p>BOLTON: Jack, over there.</p><p>ZOLDAN: This is part of a larger trend which is, people is going to be driving their own cars less and less. This is going to be major calamity in terms of the car. Rental companies in terms of giving car sales.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, Uber even started that leasing arm. Did you see that?</p><p>HIDARY: That's right.</p><p>BOLTON: So, they probably are even anticipating exactly what you're saying.</p><p>HIDARY: Yes. So, they need more drivers. They're looking for pools and demographic. The drivers will agree, this is going to be a great demographic for them to grow into. They're going to have to get two to three million rides per day. They need more drivers to get there.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Speaking of more driving. At least in New York City that means less walking which makes me think of the maybe shaking up its fitness requirements saying, you know what, if you're strong you can be a little heavier, if you can still do the work you're supposed to do basically you don't care.</p><p>HIDARY: Well, you know, this is a fundamental shift from one or twice a year checking in a physical, right? That's the way we've always thought about health and health checking. We go for the physical, annual physical in a nay it's been twice a year to now continuous modeling.</p><p>So, this is a Fitbit tracker right here. Other people use the Apple watch, of course. The navy is choosing the Fitbit tracker right now to give it to their sailors and say, hey, 24/7, let's actually get a general bigger picture sense of how you're doing health wise and that of course connect with the phone which gives you all those metrics and data. That's what they're looking for, the overall messaging of the data not just once a year physicals.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Yes. I happen to be but I think this stuff is great. And it's also an accessory. I think it has part of a lifestyle obviously. And look, you know, I'm not a good case study for you're an authorize (ph) than I am. But I think I agree checking in once or twice I don't it's going to do. I think this technology is great but I think an overall lifestyle change for the navy I think would be a good move.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Here hear. There we go. Hold those thought. We're going to take a quick break. We'll be right back with Jack and Ari. Of course, we just want to let you know, there is some breaking news here on GM ignition switch death and injuries now totaling 398 faulty ignition switches responsible for at least 124 deaths, 274 injuries.</p><p>This is a according to a fund set up to compensate victims. The fund just finished processing these papers. More than 4,000 claims it had received by the January 1st deadline. Those numbers just being released now.</p><p>When we come back, actress Jessica Alba's sunscreen customers are getting burnt. What her response means for her clients and her competitors.</p><p>First stuff, an app that makes your next set of eyeglasses much easier to get. We will introduce you to the CEO who has seen the future in 2020.</p><p>BOLTON: More than 75 percent of adults in the U.S. use some form of vision correction. Opternative is trying to make getting contacts or glasses easier, users' take an online exam. They receive a prescription within 24 hours off from their homes.</p><p>Co-founder and CEO Aaron Dallek is with me now. So, Aaron, do people get equally accurate results as going to an eye doctor's office?</p><p>AARON DALLEK, OPTERNATIVE CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Yes. They do. Opternative is clinically proven to be statistically equivalent to the traditional refractive eye exam done in the doctor's office.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Now, you're located in 27 states and counting. What was that process like to get approved in each state?</p><p>DALLEK: So, we worked with our lawyers and we've registered with the FDA. And we've made sure that we follow all the regulations in all of the states and we've hired ophthalmologists licensed in all of these states to make it so that we can practice in these states.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Warby Parker is a big online eyeglass brand. It's kind of like Tom shoes but for glasses. Do you see that company as competition?</p><p>DALLEK: Warby Parker is a great online retailer and one of many that we hope to partner with in helping your customers and helping our customers get glasses using our test.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, you see them more as a complementary service versus being an outright competitor. I do know that your service requires computer and a Smartphone. So, you have plans to target under serve or impoverished areas, maybe people in places that don't have tablets that are ready?</p><p>DALLEK: Yes. Absolutely. We're looking to make our technology available to as many people as possible make it available so proctors can help people who can't go through the exam on their own, help people in other countries, help people in the U.S. who under served. So, it's very important part of our business.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Now as far as protecting the data we know medical information among the most personal, how high on your list is privacy?</p><p>DALLEK: Security is a top priority. We are officially HIPA compliant and we use top level enterprise security to insure all of our patient data is secure and encrypted at every level.</p><p>BOLTON: Aaron, we're glad to have with us. Thanks for joining us. Aaron Dallek, he is the Opternative co-founder and CEO.</p><p>When we come back, Jessica Alba is feeling the heat. Some of her sunscreens, some customer say, they're getting burned. Spells opportunity for competing brand. And the city of brotherly love apparently not so love being to the treatment of a hitchhiking robot. We will give you the details.</p><p>BOLTON: Jessica Alba on its company getting burned for its sunscreen. Customers taking to social media claiming that the ecofriendly cream doesn't work. Jack Hidary back with me now as of Ari Zoldan. So, are social media sites Twitter, Instagram, anything else just becoming the new yelp, the new consumer reports?</p><p>HIDARY: You know, in this age of Internet transparency is number one. You have to be transparent. You could be led by a superstar, you could be led a great show, it doesn't matter. You need to be super transparent with your customer base.</p><p>BOLTON: We're looking at these kids who are sunburned.</p><p>HIDARY: Oh, my, God.</p><p>BOLTON: And I mean, even more...</p><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: ... sort of when it's a child you think like, ah.</p><p>HIDARY: The hospitality as you know as well from trip adviser, right. You get two or three bad reviews in trip advisory, your hotel, your airlines, your resort could be done for it. And so, many industries now are very responsive because of social media and because of side trip advisor, that's now coming to the consumer price as well.</p><p>BOLTON: But I hear what you're saying she named the company honest, so she set a higher bar for her.</p><p>HIDARY: Exactly. And there's good present for that. Look at honesty very successful but they had to go against Snapple, a much bigger company using the transparency. The same thing with Canbar (ph). Canbar is so successful today in part because of its transparent packaging literally saying we will tell you what's inside.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>HIDARY: The other guys -- exactly. The other guys are concealing what's inside. So, there is a lot of good precedent for going with honest concept but then you have to live up to it.</p><p>BOLTON: Ari, what is your take?</p><p>ZOLDAN: And you have to be -- right. And you have to be honest about it.</p><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Yes, I agree with Jack. I think today the fact that every one that has an Internet connection means everyone has a voice for every products and every service that they buy. So, you know, they become either an advocate or proponent, you know, for the actual product.</p><p>BOLTON: So, if you're with crisis management for the Honest company, what would you tell her right now?</p><p>ZOLDAN: I think she has to be forward. She has to honest about it just like come after whether she was in actually -- if she was intimately involved with the process or not. And I think she has to be very outspoken about it. And I think that the media especially the public I think they appreciate that that.</p><p>HIDARY: Yes, I agree. They maybe and she was in the zinc component right now.</p><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p>HIDARY: So, if you look at other kinds of, you know, honest oriented suntan lotions they have a higher zinc component. It could be they lower the zinc component that's why you're seeing those.</p><p>BOLTON: That's what I've read.</p><p>HIDARY: Red burns. So, they have to get to the bottom and then come forward and share that and engage to the community because if not, you have situations like Market Basket. This is $4-billion supermarket chain and they fire the CEO, they technically could fire the CEO, the customers, the vendors, the entire chain shut down for 30 days to protest and say, bring back that CEO, we want them.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Strong, speaking of engagement, engaging the users. You've write in the drone.</p><p>HIDARY: We did.</p><p>BOLTON: Speaking of engaging, aircraft is swerving to avoid a drone in South Jersey. Because we know that all of the anti-drone people are going to say, see, this is why you can't have drones, this is why you can't move for all of this.</p><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: But, in essence it is actually a fair point. I mean, the pilot of a smaller aircraft basically almost had an accident with the drone.</p><p>HIDARY: Yes. You know, we have to deal with drones. Drones are reality.</p><p>BOLTON: They're here.</p><p>HIDARY: Drones are very useful. This happens to be a drone with a camera right here in front could take pictures of real estate could be helpful to farmers, could be helpful to lots of different industry. This is not just for recreational use but actually for industrial use as well.</p><p>So, drones are here and they offer a lot of value. The question is, how are we going to regulate them? Right now there is a lot of ambiguity around that. We need to find a way to both protect people's privacy and also have a way to have drone's out there.</p><p>BOLTON: But now pretend that they don't exist. I saw an even crazier things which is somebody at the FAA is looking at this possibility...</p><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: ... drones so that drones it does not -- they can't fly above a certain air space. That to me seems crazier than just establishing the kind of channel.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Right. Could you imagine that this is only the first generation like we're just scratching the surface.</p><p>HIDARY: That's right.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Can you imagine what is this going to look like in three months, in three years, or 30 years, talking about, you know, just thinking about the sophistication of it. So, obviously a regulation is extremely important whether it's in the form of geo fencing of figuring how to protect your area and your air space.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>ZOLDAN: I think is the big topic of the conversation.</p><p>BOLTON: We know Amazon.com obviously lobbying hard...</p><p>HIDARY: For prime add.</p><p>BOLTON: ... to have a -- yes, just a sky highway.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Right. And then you have paparazzi's now using drones as well to go in -- the question is, are you going to have a drone to drawn combat. Are you going to have some drones defending and other drones trying to look at.</p><p>BOLTON: A new stage of video games.</p><p>HIDARY: Exactly.</p><p>BOLTON: Jack Hidary, thank you so much. Ari Zoldan joining me there for a great conversation. Thank you both. We have a quick break to take. When we come back we were on top of it when it broke. Now it is literally broke. Find out how the hitchhiking robot made its way across all kinds of countries and then met its demise in the city of brotherly love.</p><p>BOLTON: Here are some of the top stories trending on foxbusiness.com. right now. Kraft recalling 36,000 cases of singles cheese. A few customers complained of choking on the plastic wrapping. It is the second recall for Kraft. In March, more than 240,000 packages of macaroni and cheese was recalled over worry that some boxes contained metal pieces.</p><p>From food to autos, July sales strong on track with the industry yearly estimate. If current levels are maintained, sales will hit a 14-year high. Trucks and SUVs the most popular of this month. Ford saw the best July since 2006.</p><p>And the CEO that cut his $1 million salary. So, all of his employees could have a minimum wage of $70,000 a year, seem hard times. The company is losing talents. They say the system rewards slackers and provides no incentives for innovation. The CEO is now renting out his house to make ends meet.</p><p>For the latest on news and analysis, go to foxbusiness.com.</p><p>Well, the Canadian built HitchBOT began its coast to coast trip on the U.S., that was July 17th. It made it all across Canada and Europe. But when it came to Philadelphia, the second leg of the trip beginning in Massachusetts, you can just track how it is there along with other landmarks.</p><p>But you can see in the city of Brotherly Love, none at all. The hitchBOT was found destroyed on the side of the road just 300 miles into its U.S. trip.</p><p>We are so glad you joined us here on Risk &amp; Reward.

This hour, Twitter at a record low. We're going to give you the takeover odds. Microsoft investing $100 million in Uber. Why that spells trouble for Google.</p><p/><p>And republican presidential candidate Jim Gilmore is the 17th to announce. He's going to be joining me here to tell us why he is number one. Risk &amp; Reward starts now.</p><p/><p>Hackers can go after airplanes, cars, government data, corporate e-mail like Sony. Now, Chinese hackers may have hit the University of Connecticut exposing thousands of student's social security and credit card details. Fortalice CEO former White House CIO, Theresa Payton is with me now. Theresa, I want to know, of course, how this happen, but why? Why the University of Connecticut? Why students?</p><p/><p>THERESA PAYTON, FORTALICE CEO: Well, here is the thing. The hackers have realized, hey, where is the next treasure trove that I can go after that might be a little easier to break into than the banks and some of the other companies and industries that have been hit hard. And they think, ah, colleges and universities.</p><p/><p>I can steal a research and I can steal everything about a student not just their major, but if they've applied for financial aid, they have their parent's information, the student's information. All of the financial data that they need to not only masquerade as the student, potentially also as their parents who are on these forms.</p><p/><p>It sounds like they've been in there almost two years as well. So, who knows how much information the bad guys got away with this time?</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Now, the hack was discovered in March but probably happened back in September 2013. So, intruders had lot of opportunities to use data that they stole. Why did it take so long to pinpoint?</p><p/><p>PAYTON: Well, what's happening with the hackers they've changed tactics. They're not as nosy as they used to be when they break-in and they don't try and run out the door with all of the crown jewels at the same time. They watch how the systems work, they watch how the system security works, and then they will find different ways to try and sneak around that.</p><p/><p>They may have used credentials of legitimate employees at the university or legitimate vendor credentials. And they may have used that to actually slip the data out the door -- just quietly and under sort of the guys of legitimate credentials.</p><p/><p>We don't know because that investigation is still ongoing. You know, the other piece, too, is they may never be able to trust this network again. The fact that they were in this long they can hide themselves in files, in system files, the operating system, and they can actually be there and come back time and time again. So, it's going to be very difficult to get the bad guys out of this network.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Now, how do we know, Theresa, that it's China?</p><p/><p>PAYTON: We don't really know for sure until the investigation concludes. And I always caution organizations when they say it's (AUDIO GAP) or Russia or they pick a country to (AUDIO GAP). Look, I can send traffic from any country in the world that I want to so that you think the traffic is originating in that country.</p><p/><p>A lots of hackers know that China is in the forefront of discussions and so they may be sending their traffic from China. Until the forensics continues and they look at different things like what was the native language of the hackers? What types of tools and techniques did they use because each one in the cyber syndicates kind of has their own fingerprint method, if you will. And that really has not happened yet. And until it does we don't know for sure that it was China.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, do you think we're just going to see more and more of these kinds of attacks?</p><p/><p>PAYTON: Absolutely. I think what every organization needs to realize -- if you are connected to the Internet and you have one piece of data that's of value to hackers. They will find a way to monetize it or use you as a disguise to hack somebody else.</p><p/><p>These hacks are going to continue until we start taking matters into our own hands. For starters, these kids who are just starting their lives this pivotal moment they have got to not just trust on free credit reporting, they have to freeze their credits.</p><p/><p>From a university standpoint, they want to be open minds open and trusting. They have to go back and look at what's valuable information here and start locking that off whether it's from vendors looking at user access controls. They need to start locking up this data and every organization should take a lesson from today and ask some critical questions of themselves, how safe is our data and who might be after it?</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And we know that the engineering school helped you to discover it. So, I guess more schools as well will be tapping in-house resources. Theresa Payton, thank you as always. Fortalice CEO, former White House CIO.</p><p/><p>Well, staying on the scene, less a week after the White House said, it would not retaliate against China for hacking. President Obama plotting to take action. This is according to The New York Times.</p><p/><p>Retired Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cowan with me now. So, Colonel, why this reversal of opinion and of action?</p><p/><p>BILL COWAN, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST: Probably a lot of pressure from him, Deirdre. About the fact that 22 million of people's information private data got hacked including my own as a guy who used to have a security clearance. So, I think the White House -- a lot of pressure from Congress, pressure from the public, the White House is deciding they have to do something.</p><p/><p>At this point, they're thinking about doing something. They haven't quite said they will do anything.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, Colonel, China has maintained -- it did nothing. I mean, they've actually come out with a statement saying, \"It was not us.\" So, what can the Obama administration really do? Will there will be a symbolic response? Or will there be something a little bit more aggressive?</p><p/><p>COWAN: No. I think it will be symbolic and vast because they don't want to get in some kind of tit for tat. A spot with the Chinese who have all - - as much leverage over us certainly as we do over them in the financial sector, the business sector. So, my guess is, excuse my term here, but maybe we'll bitch slap them a little bit but we may not do much more than that.</p><p/><p>But the real thing, Deirdre, I believe is, when something like this happens and the White House tried to pretend that China didn't do it -- I think they knew almost from the outset that it was China. When something like this happens the only way we counter these kinds of things is fast, aggressive, unquestionable response of the same nature of what they did to us.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, I hear what you're saying. In other words, we have to make it uncomfortable for anyone attacking us. So, at least they think twice about doing it again.</p><p/><p>COWAN: That's exactly right. And you know what, as your previous guest was just saying, it's the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians, it might be some kid in the basement in Toronto who's learned how to make cyber-attack on us. But if we're not able to stand up decisively and firmly almost immediately upon knowing who it was and do something to them, they are going to continue to do this to us forever.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Colonel, we're so glad you're with us. Bill Cowan joining us there. Retiring -- retired rather, lieutenant colonel there with us on this very latest with cyber security.</p><p/><p>Well, speaking of tech but from a different aspect, Microsoft recent investment part of why Uber has a valuation of more than $50 billion.</p><p/><p>Doug MacMillan is here. He broke the story for The Wall Street Journal. So, Doug, Microsoft and Uber, are they new BFF?</p><p/><p>DOUG MACMILLAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER: Maybe not BFF as much as they are business partners. You know, Uber has been pushing to build its own technology and its own maps. And we've heard as part of the latest financing round, they disclosed that they've been looking for big technology partners to help them do that.</p><p/><p>Now, Microsoft is really not known as the cutting edge of maps but they are one of the few large technology companies that does have assets and expertise and engineers who are working on maps specifically in Bing mapping division.</p><p/><p>Now, last month or actually in June, Uber announces it's acquiring some of those Bing assets. But apparently, Microsoft and Uber have also worked out an arrangement where Microsoft is going to invest in Uber. So, we don't know if they're going to work together going forward but they're now definitely partners with Microsoft owning a very, you know, a hard to come by stake in Uber.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Hard to come by a stake in Uber. You said a few things in there. I just want to know looking at it from Microsoft's angle, does it somehow legitimize or show that Microsoft is in a current field especially -- I don't know, I'm just thinking the Windows 10 upgrade or using yet, had to be free because no one would pay for it. So, does this bring Microsoft back towards cutting edge companies?</p><p/><p>MACMILLAN: I wouldn't go that far. But it definitely calls to mind, in earlier Microsoft investment -- the former CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, invested in Facebook when that company was only at a $15 billion valuation. That investment turned out to be very lucrative for Microsoft.</p><p/><p>But with that stake, now being work something like $2.5 billion on its own. So, perhaps Microsoft by investing in Uber could potentially have a good financials when fallen also for its current Satya Nadella can make him kind of look smart and look like he's connected to kind of one of the cutting edge companies here in Silicon Valley.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And this also challenges Uber, right? Because we know that Uber made an initial investment in Uber back in the day. But now Google has also moving towards its own self- driving a cars, so it just seems like Uber has to find another big tech partners that can write big checks.</p><p/><p>MACMILLAN: Yes. This is one of the most interesting stories about Uber. As one of its earliest investors and closest partners is now also increasingly looking like a competitor. So, with Uber trying to distance itself more from Google, there is definitely an element of, you know, is Uber taking money from Microsoft because of this \"enemy of my enemy is my friend\" principle. We don't know the story of that but definitely it's a juicy story line.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Well, diplomacy important even among tech companies. Doug MacMillan, thank you so much. Great scoop for The Wall Street Journal. We want to bring you up-to-date with some breaking news</p><p/><p>Debt ravage of Puerto Rico officially in default. Moody is saying, you paid $628,000 but that is a fraction of the 58 million that was due, that is the default in our book. So, Moody's is in fact saying that Puerto Rico has defaulted and you do have of course, Puerto Rican officials saying, we don't want to default, we do not want a debt spiral to start.</p><p/><p>We will bring you up-to-date with the very latest headlines and reaction.</p><p/><p>In the meantime, tech billionaire Elon Musk warning against using robots in the military. But our next guest says he is making a big mistake. We'll tell you why.</p><p/><p>Plus, the first GOP presidential debate is on Thursday. One of the candidates is joining us tonight with his plan for America. Stay tuned.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Here are some of the stories we are following for you at this hour. Twitter shares touching a record low as the company went public. You'll recall November 2014, but shares plunged today and they are down below $30 a share for the first time in more than a year. Some say, this makes it a takeover target.</p><p/><p>President Obama unveiling a major climate change plan. It aimed at large reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the nation's coal burning power plants. The EPA is estimating the plan would cost around $8.5 billion.</p><p/><p>Vice President Joe Biden has begun to actively explore a possible presidential campaign. The New York Times columnist reporting that Biden had been holding meetings such as his residents about jumping in to challenge Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire. He could pose the biggest threat of any democrat as the front runner to Hillary Clinton.</p><p/><p>U.S. oil worth noting here settling at 45.17 a barrel, the lowest in more than four months. Continuing a trend of a reduction of about 50 percent since the fall.</p><p/><p>Well, the future of modern warfare is like any other industry, technology will play a big role. Last week, where than 1,000 researchers including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking signed a letter to the U.N. asking for a ban on the development and use of autonomous weapons or killer robots.</p><p/><p>My next guest says they will actually save lives. The author of \"Ghost Fleet,\" P.W. Singer with me now. So, P.W., thanks so much for joining us. Why do you disagree with those who signed the letter, those are some of our best and brightest minds?</p><p/><p>P.W. SINGER, \"GHOST FLEET\" AUTHOR: I don't disagree with this sentiment that they want it cause positive change in the world. I think what I disagree with is the idea of how effective this effort is going to be. The book that we did documents right now at least 21 different cases of working on this kind of weaponry in the U.S. in China, et cetera.</p><p/><p>And the reason the militaries are working on this is not because they think it's cool, it's not because of, you know, some kind of terminator vision. Because they think it's going to be useful. And so, if this effort is going to win out, this letter writing campaign it's going to have to overcome the idea of use.</p><p/><p>The other thing to mention here is of course, it's not just the military that's working on robotics and autonomy, its private business. Its companies like Google and Amazon and the like. And so, if it's playing out in the civilian sector it's going to happen, it's going to move over in the war too.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. But how can we estimate or how can we make it so that only the right armies -- this sound like a crazy question -- are building this and not the wrong ones? I mean, who's the judge?</p><p/><p>SINGER: Well, I think you've just put your finger on the problem. Every single technology in history has been used for both good and bad whether it's a stone or whether it's a drone. With drone we've seen everything from the U.S. military to ISIS fly to them.</p><p/><p>I think what makes these technologies so challenging is that they have very low barriers to entry right now. And so, for looking at a future conflict be it a small war or a big war with the China or Russia, all the different players are going to have this technology. And that's a very big difference for the U.S. that weak for in Ghost Fleet. Is what does it mean to go on to a war where you're not a generation the head of the other side in technology.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And as for when we see this kind technology in the battlefield? When is it?</p><p/><p>SINGER: Well, we're already seeing robotics in the battlefield right now. You know, for example, in the war against the ISIS everyone from the U.S. military to the Syrian military to ISIS itself have flown drones. I think if you're looking forward to the 2020s period, you're going to see technology that's more and more autonomous.</p><p/><p>And by that, I mean, not just the cars that we drive on highways or Amazon delivery drones but also the drones that are out there in the battlefield. And, you know, for example, the U.S. Navy has already tested out a drone that took off and landed from an aircraft carrier on its own. The toughest human pilot task. That of course is going to move into a future war.</p><p/><p>Same thing, China has three different long range strike programs that are droned, that are not unmanned. If we were to fight them they would be using this kind of technologies. So, the bottom line here is that, if there was a World War, which we explore in this book, it would be one where you'd see a mix of man and machine.</p><p/><p>And of course, it's not just robotics systems in and of themselves. It's that the manned systems will become more robotic. A lot like how we have cars right now that can parallel park themselves.</p><p/><p>The U.S. Navy is building a new warship...</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p/><p>SINGER: ... that it has about one-tenth the size of the crew in the past. Because the war ship is so highly robotics.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: P.W., glad to have you with us. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Great book. P.W. Singer joining us there, he is the author of \"Ghost Fleet.\"</p><p/><p>Well, stock you saw in the red today. We're going to look at the correlation between earnings and performance. SO, you had 65 companies in the NASDAQ, 100 reporting. Stocks swinging up or down at an average of more 5 percent immediately after reporting results.</p><p/><p>All in the last three weeks, the highest volatility, if you like, on that front since 2012.</p><p/><p>Bob Rice is here. Managing partner at Tangent Capital, author of \"The Alternative Answer.\" Bob, one minute on the clock. Please explain correlate.</p><p/><p>BOB RICE, TANGENT CAPITAL MANAGING PARTNER: So, correlation is a very simple but very important concept. You know, just free first to how closely a given stocks movement track the movement of the larger index.</p><p/><p>And so, when you're in the period of high correlation, you can really think of it like a flock of birds. One bird turns a little bit they all turn a little bit. One turns dramatically they all turn dramatically. The opposite of that is when all stocks have different kinds they are in the early minds and they act as you see here like a herd of cats instead.</p><p/><p>So, that's a low correlation environment. And the reason this is important is we seem to be transitioning from a high correlation to a low correlation right now, and that matters. Because over the last few years, frankly, it hasn't made that much difference exactly which stocks you own because they all acted alike. They were highly correlated.</p><p/><p>We're moving now to a different period, (inaudible) correlation, you're going to have to be a lot more careful about what's exactly in your portfolio.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. With 10 seconds to go, leave bulls and bears aside, we're going to do cats and birds here. But, Bob, most importantly, why is this happening now?</p><p/><p>RICE: Well, I think it's because you're seeing peeling back of quantitative easing than we were very cheap flooded with easy money, all boats were...</p><p/><p>BOLTON: For nine years.</p><p/><p>RICE: Yes. We're coming up with that tie. Now, it's starting to be different. And you can see it very clearly in what you were saying in the intro there. Up until very recently it didn't really matter whether stock beat its earnings estimate or disappointed. It was still in the flock of birds. It behaves like the rest of the flock. All of a sudden it matters dramatically. If you beat your earnings estimates you do way better than the average. If you disappoint you do way worse. And that's what is important for investors to start paying attention too.</p><p/><p>To see that the investor can do that.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: The number one thing an inventor can do then going into this environment. Diversification I imagine.</p><p/><p>RICE: Well, yes. But over diversification because now matters exactly which ones you're in. And so, you want to be in more concentrated higher conviction portfolios and not so much super broad based ETFs and indexes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Bob Rice, we thank you as always. Bob Rice joining us there, managing partner at Tangent Capital, also the author of \"The Alternative Answer.\"</p><p/><p>Well, speaking of volatility, the Greek stock market reopened for the first time in five weeks. It was a blood bath dropping more than 20 percent, just a few minutes into the open, banking stocks hit the worst.</p><p/><p>With us now to discuss this kind of volatility, Jason Rosiak. He is senior managing director at Pacific Asset Management. Jason, thanks for coming in.</p><p/><p>JASON ROSIAK, PACIFIC ASSET MANAGEMENT SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR: Thank you very much.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, we're just hearing from Bob Rice about correlation, perhaps this breaks lots of volatility whether it's Greece, whether it's China, whether it's Iran, there are certainly a lot of hot spots in the world. What are you doing with your money?</p><p/><p>ROSIAK: Right now it's being at the core for a bottom's up firm. So, one of the things that we're looking at is corporate credit and the focus is on fundamentals and coverage. And so, with Greece right now, for instance, the stock market was down by 16 percent today, challenging but that's just an underlying risk associated with what's going on there in the volatility.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, not the average person can as of this moment go out and buy a Greek debt? But it sounds like you're saying for professional investors this is an opportunity?</p><p/><p>ROSIAK: It's not for Greek debt but for corporate debt in the U.S. side. So, what we do is we focus on bank loans. And bank loans are floating arrangements that usually general names that PetSmart, Chuck E. Cheese, those types of names that are U.S.-based focused yield anywhere between 3 to 6 percent. The floating rates don't have to worry about duration risk. And it's a noble...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, let's say the Fed moves in either September or December as fed for the future are indicating. What does this mean?</p><p/><p>ROSIAK: So, for this asset class which is nice, is not -- it doesn't have duration. So, therefore, it's dependent on the corporate underlying how they react and how they fundamentally performed. So, unlike other asset classes that generally speaking, people use in inflationary or high rising rates environment whether it be you're sitting in tips or you're sit in real estate or commodities, there is a lot of volatility there.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p/><p>ROSIAK: In the taper tension you had commodities go down by about 4 percent, and TIPS go down by 7 percent, or as bank loans.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And TIPS, Inflation Protective Securities.</p><p/><p>ROSIAK: Correct.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: For those who do not follow as closely as you do. The best idea you've heard of in the past few weeks?</p><p/><p>ROSIAK: Best idea, we still like corporate credit. We like triple B investment-grade credit fairly these are amounts of spread involved there. And it's better than owning interest-rate sensitive or commodities sensitive type of assets.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Jason, come back. We want to continue the conversation another time. Jason Rosiak joining me there. Senior managing director at Pacific Asset Management.</p><p/><p>When we come back, Uber may be recruiting your grandparents. We are not joking. Older drivers may be safer drivers. First though, former Governor Jim Gilmore may have announced the 17th kisses. He's going to end up as number one. He is my guest, next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: There are 17 republican candidates running for president in 2016. With us now the very latest contender, former Virginia Governor, Jim Gilmore with us from D.C.</p><p/><p>Governor, glad to have you with us.</p><p/><p>JIM GILMORE, FORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR: Thank you, Deirdre.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: You are entering a crowded GOP field. What do you hope to gain and why now?</p><p/><p>GILMORE: Well, I hope to gain the ability to turn the country around from the decline that it's in, wherein a decline in our national security in our safety of Americans and the American interests. We're in a decline in the economy. The economy has never really recovered from the recession. We're really not doing well enough.</p><p/><p>And I think I have the credentials in order to being turn this around. All my life I have fought on behalf of my state in my country. I'm a United States army veteran. I was the chairman of the National Commission on Terrorism for the United States. I was the governor during the 9/11 attack.</p><p/><p>I've been the governor of a state and band I stood had to deal with budgets and create jobs and do things. So, I've always been in a position I think to really help this. And right now I see a decline in America that I think I can reverse.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, Governor, I want to pick up on exactly what you just said, this background as an army intelligence officer, we talked about cyber on this program every single day. What is the number one thing that could be changed right now to better protect America? Does it need to hire more engineers? What does the budget need to look like? How can we improve cyber security of our businesses and our citizens right now?</p><p/><p>GILMORE: Well, we're going to have to recognize with presidential leadership exactly the nature of the society we live in. When I was the governor I was known as the technology governor because I've really pushed forward on all of our policies and programs and also cyber issues.</p><p/><p>We have to recognize that opposition people really try to and do us right now. Look at the Chinese situation. They've gone in now and invaded our records with people who have security clearances and there's been an absolutely no repercussions.</p><p/><p>This is an example once again, of the decline of the United States because of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. We need to make it that America is back. The best way to do that is to remove the sequester limits from our defense department to get full or move forward once again in the restoration of American strength.</p><p/><p>And of course, that's going to require of the American economy.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, to spend more on defense. If you could change one thing, let's say, you're elected, what would you do the first order of business?</p><p/><p>GILMORE: The first order of business is to restore the American economy. Right now we are discouraging business. You heard Hillary Clinton actually talk about trying to attack business in this country and income equality and all those kinds of warm ball of marches kind of ideas.</p><p/><p>What you have to do is to make a renewal once again of the free enterprise system in this country. And that means that we have to actually to put in policies that don't discourage investment but restoring investment in this country. Investment means more productivity. More productivity means more jobs. And more jobs means higher wages.</p><p/><p>And we're not going to be able to have a real national security until we restore the American economy to give a better quality of life of the American people and a stronger economy to protect ourselves in this dangerous world.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Governor, you used to be chairman as well of the Republican National party, the republican National Committee. I want to ask you what do you make of Donald Trump? There are so many pundits, so many republicans who keep waiting for his campaign to run out of steam but it's not. Is he what the American public wants?</p><p/><p>GILMORE: I think that he's struck a nerve, a resentment, and anger in among the American people. I thought about it a lot. I don't have any real interest in that. What I have an interest in is actually making the country better and responding to this anger and to this resentment with genuine positive programs.</p><p/><p>And that's what why I've talked to you about here today. If we put forward a program that gives a tax cut to working Americans that combines all business activity and charges at 15 percent tax rate, if we eliminate the debt tax, our economists have told us that what that will do is get the economy moving again. Get us up to growth over 4 percent, do something that really create some dynamic excitement in this economy.</p><p/><p>That's the kind of anger and resentment because people know that the people in Washington are not doing anything to move the country forward. That's why I think I'm qualified to do. That's what I want to achieve. I want to reverse this decline from the Obama-Clinton policy, that's why I've entered the presidential race.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Governor, we're glad to have you with us. Thank you for the time. Former Virginia Governor and 2016 presidential candidate, Jim Gilmore.</p><p/><p>Well, will Trump maintain his number one spot? Tune in right after this show at 6 p.m. Eastern Time sharp.

We'll talk about the fact whether it a PR sons or a real business initiative.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Twitter shares closed at the all-time low. Jack Hidary is here. He is the former CEO of Dice.com. Ari Zaldan is here as well. The CEO of Quantum Networks. Welcome to you both.</p><p/><p>JACK HIDARY, FORMER DICE.COM CEO: Great to see you.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Great to see you. So, is Twitter in play? Aye (ph) or nay?</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Twitter is in trouble.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Twitter does not know where it's going. It's headless, stateless, does not have a leader right now, there's no captain of the ship. And also it doesn't know what it's doing because it is a 300 million monthly active users has not grown effectively in two years.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And to you point, there is no CEO, I mean, jack Dorsey is there, one of the original founders but he had said...</p><p/><p>HIDARY: But he's also the CEO of Square. Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes. I mean, it's clear that he is a part-time or transitional. So, $30 actually per share is a number that I saw a lot of analysts come up with it and say, you know what, this starts to look cheap enough for someone to buy. What is your take?</p><p/><p>ARI ZOLDAN, QUANTUM NETWORKS CEO: Right. Yes. I think $30 is a great buy. I don't think it's cheap but I think it's a good buy. And I think to push back a little bit, they will get a CEO and I think they're get a really good CEO. The question is when. But you're right. Right now it's sort of in between times. So, I think there's a lot of questions out on the street.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: But when the CEO comes the question is, what's their strategy, right? What kind of practice is it? Why is it not growing even though every show, including this one, talks Twitter all the time.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Well, I think it's great for journalist and I love it. I'm an addict. I say that openly, but it's true that if you're not in media and you're not reading I don't know why you would do if you're not in this field.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: SO, WhatsApp is growing, Snapchat is growing by leaps and bounds. Yet, twitter just remains flat. So, there is a real crisis in terms of how do you grow this. You can't grow. You're not going to grow revenues and profit either.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. And of course, you know, as you say, Facebook hot on the heels with its own app. Uber is partnering with AARP. I don't know if you saw that Simpsons clip there. But is this idea the older drivers are safer drivers? PR, real business strategy, what do you think?</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: No, real business. It's real and I think it's great. You know, it's not cutie. I think it's very real. You have a million Uber rides per day, a 160,000 drivers out there on behalf of Uber. And you have a demographic that's older, a lot of them are unemployed but they're also great drivers. So, it's a perfect strategic fit.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Jack, over there.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: This is part of a larger trend which is, people is going to be driving their own cars less and less. This is going to be major calamity in terms of the car. Rental companies in terms of giving car sales.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Well, Uber even started that leasing arm. Did you see that?</p><p/><p>HIDARY: That's right.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, they probably are even anticipating exactly what you're saying.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes. So, they need more drivers. They're looking for pools and demographic. The drivers will agree, this is going to be a great demographic for them to grow into. They're going to have to get two to three million rides per day. They need more drivers to get there.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Speaking of more driving. At least in New York City that means less walking which makes me think of the maybe shaking up its fitness requirements saying, you know what, if you're strong you can be a little heavier, if you can still do the work you're supposed to do basically you don't care.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Well, you know, this is a fundamental shift from one or twice a year checking in a physical, right? That's the way we've always thought about health and health checking. We go for the physical, annual physical in a nay it's been twice a year to now continuous modeling.</p><p/><p>So, this is a Fitbit tracker right here. Other people use the Apple watch, of course. The navy is choosing the Fitbit tracker right now to give it to their sailors and say, hey, 24/7, let's actually get a general bigger picture sense of how you're doing health wise and that of course connect with the phone which gives you all those metrics and data. That's what they're looking for, the overall messaging of the data not just once a year physicals.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: Yes. I happen to be but I think this stuff is great. And it's also an accessory. I think it has part of a lifestyle obviously. And look, you know, I'm not a good case study for you're an authorize (ph) than I am. But I think I agree checking in once or twice I don't it's going to do. I think this technology is great but I think an overall lifestyle change for the navy I think would be a good move.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Here hear. There we go. Hold those thought. We're going to take a quick break. We'll be right back with Jack and Ari. Of course, we just want to let you know, there is some breaking news here on GM ignition switch death and injuries now totaling 398 faulty ignition switches responsible for at least 124 deaths, 274 injuries.</p><p/><p>This is a according to a fund set up to compensate victims. The fund just finished processing these papers. More than 4,000 claims it had received by the January 1st deadline. Those numbers just being released now.</p><p/><p>When we come back, actress Jessica Alba's sunscreen customers are getting burnt. What her response means for her clients and her competitors.</p><p/><p>First stuff, an app that makes your next set of eyeglasses much easier to get. We will introduce you to the CEO who has seen the future in 2020.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: More than 75 percent of adults in the U.S. use some form of vision correction. Opternative is trying to make getting contacts or glasses easier, users' take an online exam. They receive a prescription within 24 hours off from their homes.</p><p/><p>Co-founder and CEO Aaron Dallek is with me now. So, Aaron, do people get equally accurate results as going to an eye doctor's office?</p><p/><p>AARON DALLEK, OPTERNATIVE CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Yes. They do. Opternative is clinically proven to be statistically equivalent to the traditional refractive eye exam done in the doctor's office.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Now, you're located in 27 states and counting. What was that process like to get approved in each state?</p><p/><p>DALLEK: So, we worked with our lawyers and we've registered with the FDA. And we've made sure that we follow all the regulations in all of the states and we've hired ophthalmologists licensed in all of these states to make it so that we can practice in these states.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Warby Parker is a big online eyeglass brand. It's kind of like Tom shoes but for glasses. Do you see that company as competition?</p><p/><p>DALLEK: Warby Parker is a great online retailer and one of many that we hope to partner with in helping your customers and helping our customers get glasses using our test.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. So, you see them more as a complementary service versus being an outright competitor. I do know that your service requires computer and a Smartphone. So, you have plans to target under serve or impoverished areas, maybe people in places that don't have tablets that are ready?</p><p/><p>DALLEK: Yes. Absolutely. We're looking to make our technology available to as many people as possible make it available so proctors can help people who can't go through the exam on their own, help people in other countries, help people in the U.S. who under served. So, it's very important part of our business.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Now as far as protecting the data we know medical information among the most personal, how high on your list is privacy?</p><p/><p>DALLEK: Security is a top priority. We are officially HIPA compliant and we use top level enterprise security to insure all of our patient data is secure and encrypted at every level.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Aaron, we're glad to have with us. Thanks for joining us. Aaron Dallek, he is the Opternative co-founder and CEO.</p><p/><p>When we come back, Jessica Alba is feeling the heat. Some of her sunscreens, some customer say, they're getting burned. Spells opportunity for competing brand. And the city of brotherly love apparently not so love being to the treatment of a hitchhiking robot. We will give you the details.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Jessica Alba on its company getting burned for its sunscreen. Customers taking to social media claiming that the ecofriendly cream doesn't work. Jack Hidary back with me now as of Ari Zoldan. So, are social media sites Twitter, Instagram, anything else just becoming the new yelp, the new consumer reports?</p><p/><p>HIDARY: You know, in this age of Internet transparency is number one. You have to be transparent. You could be led by a superstar, you could be led a great show, it doesn't matter. You need to be super transparent with your customer base.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: We're looking at these kids who are sunburned.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Oh, my, God.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And I mean, even more...</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: ... sort of when it's a child you think like, ah.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: The hospitality as you know as well from trip adviser, right. You get two or three bad reviews in trip advisory, your hotel, your airlines, your resort could be done for it. And so, many industries now are very responsive because of social media and because of side trip advisor, that's now coming to the consumer price as well.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: But I hear what you're saying she named the company honest, so she set a higher bar for her.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Exactly. And there's good present for that. Look at honesty very successful but they had to go against Snapple, a much bigger company using the transparency. The same thing with Canbar (ph). Canbar is so successful today in part because of its transparent packaging literally saying we will tell you what's inside.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: The other guys -- exactly. The other guys are concealing what's inside. So, there is a lot of good precedent for going with honest concept but then you have to live up to it.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Ari, what is your take?</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: And you have to be -- right. And you have to be honest about it.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: Yes, I agree with Jack. I think today the fact that every one that has an Internet connection means everyone has a voice for every products and every service that they buy. So, you know, they become either an advocate or proponent, you know, for the actual product.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, if you're with crisis management for the Honest company, what would you tell her right now?</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: I think she has to be forward. She has to honest about it just like come after whether she was in actually -- if she was intimately involved with the process or not. And I think she has to be very outspoken about it. And I think that the media especially the public I think they appreciate that that.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes, I agree. They maybe and she was in the zinc component right now.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: So, if you look at other kinds of, you know, honest oriented suntan lotions they have a higher zinc component. It could be they lower the zinc component that's why you're seeing those.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: That's what I've read.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Red burns. So, they have to get to the bottom and then come forward and share that and engage to the community because if not, you have situations like Market Basket. This is $4-billion supermarket chain and they fire the CEO, they technically could fire the CEO, the customers, the vendors, the entire chain shut down for 30 days to protest and say, bring back that CEO, we want them.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Strong, speaking of engagement, engaging the users. You've write in the drone.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: We did.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Speaking of engaging, aircraft is swerving to avoid a drone in South Jersey. Because we know that all of the anti-drone people are going to say, see, this is why you can't have drones, this is why you can't move for all of this.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: But, in essence it is actually a fair point. I mean, the pilot of a smaller aircraft basically almost had an accident with the drone.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes. You know, we have to deal with drones. Drones are reality.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: They're here.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Drones are very useful. This happens to be a drone with a camera right here in front could take pictures of real estate could be helpful to farmers, could be helpful to lots of different industry. This is not just for recreational use but actually for industrial use as well.</p><p/><p>So, drones are here and they offer a lot of value. The question is, how are we going to regulate them? Right now there is a lot of ambiguity around that. We need to find a way to both protect people's privacy and also have a way to have drone's out there.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: But now pretend that they don't exist. I saw an even crazier things which is somebody at the FAA is looking at this possibility...</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: ... drones so that drones it does not -- they can't fly above a certain air space. That to me seems crazier than just establishing the kind of channel.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: Right. Could you imagine that this is only the first generation like we're just scratching the surface.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: That's right.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: Can you imagine what is this going to look like in three months, in three years, or 30 years, talking about, you know, just thinking about the sophistication of it. So, obviously a regulation is extremely important whether it's in the form of geo fencing of figuring how to protect your area and your air space.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: I think is the big topic of the conversation.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: We know Amazon.com obviously lobbying hard...</p><p/><p>HIDARY: For prime add.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: ... to have a -- yes, just a sky highway.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: Right. And then you have paparazzi's now using drones as well to go in -- the question is, are you going to have a drone to drawn combat. Are you going to have some drones defending and other drones trying to look at.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: A new stage of video games.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Exactly.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Jack Hidary, thank you so much. Ari Zoldan joining me there for a great conversation. Thank you both. We have a quick break to take. When we come back we were on top of it when it broke. Now it is literally broke. Find out how the hitchhiking robot made its way across all kinds of countries and then met its demise in the city of brotherly love.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Here are some of the top stories trending on foxbusiness.com. right now. Kraft recalling 36,000 cases of singles cheese. A few customers complained of choking on the plastic wrapping. It is the second recall for Kraft. In March, more than 240,000 packages of macaroni and cheese was recalled over worry that some boxes contained metal pieces.</p><p/><p>From food to autos, July sales strong on track with the industry yearly estimate. If current levels are maintained, sales will hit a 14-year high. Trucks and SUVs the most popular of this month. Ford saw the best July since 2006.</p><p/><p>And the CEO that cut his $1 million salary. So, all of his employees could have a minimum wage of $70,000 a year, seem hard times. The company is losing talents. They say the system rewards slackers and provides no incentives for innovation. The CEO is now renting out his house to make ends meet.</p><p/><p>For the latest on news and analysis, go to foxbusiness.com.</p><p/><p>Well, the Canadian built HitchBOT began its coast to coast trip on the U.S., that was July 17th. It made it all across Canada and Europe. But when it came to Philadelphia, the second leg of the trip beginning in Massachusetts, you can just track how it is there along with other landmarks.</p><p/><p>But you can see in the city of Brotherly Love, none at all. The hitchBOT was found destroyed on the side of the road just 300 miles into its U.S. trip.</p><p/><p>We are so glad you joined us here on Risk &amp; Reward.

This hour, Twitter at a record low.  We're  going to give you the takeover odds.  Microsoft investing $100 million in  Uber.  Why that spells trouble for Google.</p><p>And republican presidential candidate Jim Gilmore is the 17th to announce.   He's going to be joining me here to tell us why he is number one.  Risk &amp;  Reward starts now.  </p><p>Hackers can go after airplanes, cars, government data, corporate e-mail  like Sony.  Now, Chinese hackers may have hit the University of Connecticut  exposing thousands of student's social security and credit card details.   Fortalice CEO former White House CIO, Theresa Payton is with me now.   Theresa, I want to know, of course, how this happen, but why? Why the  University of Connecticut? Why students?</p><p>THERESA PAYTON, FORTALICE CEO:  Well, here is the thing.  The hackers have  realized, hey, where is the next treasure trove that I can go after that  might be a little easier to break into than the banks and some of the other  companies and industries that have been hit hard.  And they think, ah,  colleges and universities.</p><p>I can steal a research and I can steal everything about a student not just  their major, but if they've applied for financial aid, they have their  parent's information, the student's information.  All of the financial data  that they need to not only masquerade as the student, potentially also as  their parents who are on these forms.  </p><p>It sounds like they've been in there almost two years as well.  So, who  knows how much information the bad guys got away with this time? </p><p>BOLTON:  OK.  Now, the hack was discovered in March but probably happened  back in September 2013.  So, intruders had lot of opportunities to use data  that they stole.  Why did it take so long to pinpoint? </p><p>PAYTON:  Well, what's happening with the hackers they've changed tactics.   They're not as nosy as they used to be when they break-in and they don't  try and run out the door with all of the crown jewels at the same time.   They watch how the systems work, they watch how the system security works,  and then they will find different ways to try and sneak around that.  </p><p>They may have used credentials of legitimate employees at the university or  legitimate vendor credentials.  And they may have used that to actually  slip the data out the door -- just quietly and under sort of the guys of  legitimate credentials.  </p><p>We don't know because that investigation is still ongoing.  You know, the  other piece, too, is they may never be able to trust this network again.   The fact that they were in this long they can hide themselves in files, in  system files, the operating system, and they can actually be there and come  back time and time again.  So, it's going to be very difficult to get the  bad guys out of this network.</p><p>BOLTON:  OK.  Now, how do we know, Theresa, that it's China? </p><p>PAYTON:  We don't really know for sure until the investigation concludes.   And I always caution organizations when they say it's (AUDIO GAP) or Russia  or they pick a country to (AUDIO GAP).  Look, I can send traffic from any  country in the world that I want to so that you think the traffic is  originating in that country.</p><p>A lots of hackers know that China is in the forefront of discussions and so  they may be sending their traffic from China.  Until the forensics  continues and they look at different things like what was the native  language of the hackers? What types of tools and techniques did they use  because each one in the cyber syndicates kind of has their own fingerprint  method, if you will.  And that really has not happened yet.  And until it  does we don't know for sure that it was China.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, do you think we're just going to see more and more of these  kinds of attacks? </p><p>PAYTON:  Absolutely.  I think what every organization needs to realize --  if you are connected to the Internet and you have one piece of data that's  of value to hackers.  They will find a way to monetize it or use you as a  disguise to hack somebody else.  </p><p>These hacks are going to continue until we start taking matters into our  own hands.  For starters, these kids who are just starting their lives this  pivotal moment they have got to not just trust  on free credit reporting,  they have to freeze their credits.  </p><p>From a university standpoint, they want to be open minds open and trusting.   They have to go back and look at what's valuable information here and start  locking that off whether it's from vendors looking at user access controls.   They need to start locking up this data and every organization should take  a lesson from today and ask some critical questions of themselves, how safe  is our data and who might be after it? </p><p>BOLTON:  And we know that the engineering school helped you to discover it.   So, I guess more schools as well will be tapping in-house resources.   Theresa Payton, thank you as always.  Fortalice CEO, former White House  CIO.</p><p>Well, staying on the scene, less a week after the White House said, it  would not retaliate against China for hacking.  President Obama plotting to  take action.  This is according to The New York Times.  </p><p>Retired Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cowan with me now.  So, Colonel, why this  reversal of opinion and of action? </p><p>BILL COWAN, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST:  Probably a lot of pressure from  him, Deirdre.  About the fact that 22 million of people's information  private data got hacked including my own as a guy who used to have a  security clearance.  So, I think the White House -- a lot of pressure from  Congress, pressure from the public, the White House is deciding they have  to do something.  </p><p>At this point, they're thinking about doing something.  They haven't quite  said they will do anything.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, Colonel, China has maintained -- it did nothing.  I mean,  they've actually come out with a statement saying, \"It was not us.\" So,  what can the Obama administration really do? Will there will be a symbolic  response? Or will there be something a little bit more aggressive? </p><p>COWAN:  No.  I think it will be symbolic and vast because they don't want  to get in some kind of tit for tat.  A spot with the Chinese who have all - - as much leverage over us certainly as we do over them in the financial  sector, the business sector.  So, my guess is, excuse my term here, but  maybe we'll bitch slap them a little bit but we may not do much more than  that.</p><p>But the real thing, Deirdre, I believe is, when something like this happens  and the White House tried to pretend that China didn't do it -- I think  they knew almost from the outset that it was China.  When something like  this happens the only way we counter these kinds of things is fast,  aggressive, unquestionable response of the same nature of what they did to  us.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, I hear what you're saying.  In other words, we have to make it  uncomfortable for anyone attacking us.  So, at least they think twice about  doing it again.  </p><p>COWAN:  That's exactly right.  And you know what, as your previous guest  was just saying, it's the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians, it might be  some kid in the basement in Toronto who's learned how to make cyber-attack  on us.  But if we're not able to stand up decisively and firmly almost  immediately upon knowing who it was and do something to them, they are  going to continue to do this to us forever.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Colonel, we're so glad you're with us.  Bill Cowan joining us  there.  Retiring -- retired rather, lieutenant colonel there with us on  this very latest with cyber security.  </p><p>Well, speaking of tech but from a different aspect, Microsoft recent  investment part of why Uber has a valuation of more than $50 billion.</p><p>Doug MacMillan is here.  He broke the story for The Wall Street Journal.   So, Doug, Microsoft and Uber, are they new BFF? </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER:  Maybe not BFF as much as  they are business partners.  You know, Uber has been pushing to build its  own technology and its own maps.  And we've heard as part of the latest  financing round, they disclosed that they've been looking for big  technology partners to help them do that.  </p><p>Now, Microsoft is really not known as the cutting edge of maps but they are  one of the few large technology companies that does have assets and  expertise and engineers who are working on maps specifically in Bing  mapping division.  </p><p>Now, last month or actually in June, Uber announces it's acquiring some of  those Bing assets.  But apparently, Microsoft and Uber have also worked out  an arrangement where Microsoft is going to invest in Uber.  So, we don't  know if they're going to work together going forward but they're now  definitely partners with Microsoft owning a very, you know, a hard to come  by stake in Uber.  </p><p>BOLTON:  OK.  Hard to come by a stake in Uber.  You said a few things in  there.  I just want to know looking at it from Microsoft's angle, does it  somehow legitimize or show that Microsoft is in a current field especially  -- I don't know, I'm just thinking the Windows 10 upgrade or using yet, had  to be free because no one would pay for it.  So, does this bring Microsoft  back towards cutting edge companies? </p><p>MACMILLAN:  I wouldn't go that far.  But it definitely calls to mind, in  earlier Microsoft investment -- the former CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer,  invested in Facebook when that company was only at a $15 billion valuation.   That investment turned out to be very lucrative for Microsoft.</p><p>But with that stake, now being work something like $2.5 billion on its own.   So, perhaps Microsoft by investing in Uber could potentially have a good  financials when fallen also for its current Satya Nadella can make him kind  of look smart and look like he's connected to kind of one of the cutting  edge companies here in Silicon Valley.</p><p>BOLTON:  And this also challenges Uber, right? Because we know that Uber  made an initial investment in Uber back in the day.  But now Google has  also moving towards its own self- driving a cars, so it just seems like  Uber has to find another big tech partners that can write big checks.  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  Yes.  This is one of the most interesting stories about Uber.   As one of its earliest investors and closest partners is now also  increasingly looking like a competitor.  So, with Uber trying to  distance  itself more from Google, there is definitely an element of, you know, is  Uber taking money from Microsoft because of this \"enemy of my enemy is my  friend\" principle.  We don't know the story of that but definitely it's a  juicy story line.  </p><p>BOLTON:  All right.  Well, diplomacy important even among tech companies.   Doug MacMillan, thank you so much.  Great scoop for The Wall Street  Journal.  We want to bring you up-to-date with some breaking news </p><p>Debt ravage of Puerto Rico officially in default.  Moody is saying, you  paid $628,000 but that is a fraction of the 58 million that was due, that  is the default in our book.  So, Moody's is in fact saying that Puerto Rico  has defaulted and you do have of course, Puerto Rican officials saying, we  don't want to default, we do not want a debt spiral to start.  </p><p>We will bring you up-to-date with the very latest headlines and reaction.</p><p>In the meantime, tech billionaire Elon Musk warning against using robots in  the military.  But our next guest says he is making a big mistake.  We'll  tell you why.  </p><p>Plus, the first GOP presidential debate is on Thursday.  One of the  candidates is joining us tonight with his plan for America.  Stay tuned.     </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Here are some of the stories we are following for you at this  hour.  Twitter shares touching a record low as the company went public.   You'll recall November 2014, but shares plunged today and they are down  below $30 a share for the first time in more than a year.  Some say, this  makes it a takeover target.</p><p>President Obama unveiling a major climate change plan.  It aimed at large  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the nation's coal burning power  plants.  The EPA is estimating the plan would cost around $8.5 billion.  </p><p>Vice President Joe Biden has begun to actively explore a possible  presidential campaign.  The New York Times columnist reporting that Biden  had been holding meetings such as his residents about jumping in to  challenge Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire.  He could pose the  biggest threat of any democrat as the front runner to Hillary Clinton.  </p><p>U.S. oil worth noting here settling at 45.17 a barrel, the lowest in more  than four months.  Continuing a trend of a reduction of about 50 percent  since the fall.  </p><p>Well, the future of modern warfare is like any other industry, technology  will play a big role.  Last week, where than 1,000 researchers including  Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking signed a letter to the U.N. asking for a ban  on the development and use of autonomous weapons or killer robots.</p><p>My next guest says they will actually save lives.  The author of \"Ghost  Fleet,\" P.W. Singer with me now.  So, P.W., thanks so much for joining us.   Why do you disagree with those who signed the letter, those are some of our  best and brightest minds? </p><p>P.W. SINGER, \"GHOST FLEET\" AUTHOR:  I don't disagree with this sentiment  that they want it cause positive change in the world.  I think what I  disagree with is the idea of how effective this effort is going to be.  The  book that we did documents right now at least 21 different cases of working  on this kind of weaponry in the U.S. in China, et cetera.</p><p>And the reason the militaries are working on this is not because they think  it's cool, it's not because of, you know, some kind of terminator vision.   Because they think it's going to be useful.  And so, if this effort is  going to win out, this letter writing campaign it's going to have to  overcome the idea of use.</p><p>The other thing to mention here is of course, it's not just the military  that's working on robotics and autonomy, its private business.  Its  companies like Google and Amazon and the like.  And so, if it's playing out  in the civilian sector it's going to happen, it's going to move over in the  war too.  </p><p>BOLTON:  OK.  But how can we estimate or how can we make it so that only  the right armies -- this sound like a crazy question -- are building this  and not the wrong ones? I mean, who's the judge? </p><p>SINGER:  Well, I think you've just put your finger on the problem.  Every  single technology in history has been used for both good and bad whether  it's a stone or whether it's a drone.  With drone we've seen everything  from the U.S. military to ISIS fly to them.</p><p>I think what makes these technologies so challenging is that they have very  low barriers to entry right now.  And so, for looking at a future conflict  be it a small war or a big war with the China or Russia, all the different  players are going to have this technology.  And that's a very big  difference for the U.S. that weak for in Ghost Fleet.  Is what does it mean  to go on to a war where you're not a generation the head of the other side  in technology.</p><p>BOLTON:  And as for when we see this kind technology in the battlefield?  When is it? </p><p>SINGER:  Well, we're already seeing robotics in the battlefield right now.   You know, for example, in the war against the ISIS everyone from the U.S.  military to the Syrian military to ISIS itself have flown drones.  I think  if you're looking forward to the 2020s period, you're going to see  technology that's more and more autonomous.</p><p>And by that, I mean, not just the cars that we drive on highways or Amazon  delivery drones but also the drones that are out there in the battlefield.   And, you know, for example, the U.S. Navy has already tested out a drone  that took off and landed from an aircraft carrier on its own.  The toughest  human pilot task.  That of course is going to move into a future war.  </p><p>Same thing, China has three different long range strike programs that are  droned, that are not unmanned.  If we were to fight them they would be  using this kind of technologies.  So, the bottom line here is that, if  there was a World War, which we explore in this book, it would be one where  you'd see a mix of man and machine.</p><p>And of course, it's not just robotics systems in and of themselves.  It's  that the manned systems will become more robotic.  A lot like how we have  cars right now that can parallel park themselves.</p><p>The U.S. Navy is building a new warship...</p><p>BOLTON:  Right.</p><p>SINGER:  ... that it has about one-tenth the size of the crew in the past.   Because the war ship is so highly robotics.  </p><p>BOLTON:  P.W., glad to have you with us.  Thank you for sharing your  thoughts.  Great book.  P.W. Singer joining us there, he is the author of  \"Ghost Fleet.\"</p><p>Well, stock you saw in the red today.  We're going to look at the  correlation between earnings and performance.  SO, you had 65 companies in  the NASDAQ, 100 reporting.  Stocks swinging up or down at an average of  more 5 percent immediately after reporting results.  </p><p>All in the last three weeks, the highest volatility, if you like, on that  front since 2012.  </p><p>Bob Rice is here.  Managing partner at Tangent Capital, author of \"The  Alternative Answer.\" Bob, one minute on the clock.  Please explain  correlate.</p><p>BOB RICE, TANGENT CAPITAL MANAGING PARTNER:  So, correlation is a very  simple but very important concept.  You know, just free first to how  closely a given stocks movement track the movement of the larger index.  </p><p>And so, when you're in the period of high correlation, you can really think  of it like a flock of birds.  One bird turns a little bit they all turn a  little bit.  One turns dramatically they all turn dramatically.  The  opposite of that is when all stocks have different kinds they are in the  early minds and they act as you see here like a herd of cats instead.  </p><p>So, that's a low correlation environment.  And the reason this is important  is we seem to be transitioning from a high correlation to a low correlation  right now, and that matters.  Because over the last few years, frankly, it  hasn't made that much difference exactly which stocks you own because they  all acted alike.  They were highly correlated.  </p><p>We're moving now to a different period, (inaudible) correlation, you're  going to have to be a lot more careful about what's exactly in your  portfolio.  </p><p>BOLTON:  All right.  With 10 seconds to go, leave bulls and bears aside,  we're going to do cats and birds here.  But, Bob, most importantly, why is  this happening now? </p><p>RICE:  Well, I think it's because you're seeing peeling back of  quantitative easing than we were very cheap flooded with easy money, all  boats were...</p><p>BOLTON:  For nine years.</p><p>RICE:  Yes.  We're coming up with that tie.  Now, it's starting to be  different.  And you can see it very clearly in what you were saying in the  intro there.  Up until very recently it didn't really matter whether stock  beat its earnings estimate or disappointed.  It was still in the flock of  birds.  It behaves like the rest of the flock.  All of a sudden it matters  dramatically.  If you beat your earnings estimates you do way better than  the average.  If you disappoint you do way worse.  And that's what is  important for investors to start paying attention too.  </p><p>To see that the investor can do that.  </p><p>BOLTON:  The number one thing an inventor can do then going into this  environment.  Diversification I imagine.</p><p>RICE:  Well, yes.  But over diversification because now matters exactly  which ones you're in.  And so, you want to be in more concentrated higher  conviction portfolios and not so much super broad based ETFs and indexes.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Bob Rice, we thank you as always.  Bob Rice joining us there,  managing partner at Tangent Capital, also the author of \"The Alternative  Answer.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of volatility, the Greek stock market reopened for the first  time in five weeks.  It was a blood bath dropping more than 20 percent,  just a few minutes into the open, banking stocks hit the worst.  </p><p>With us now to discuss this kind of volatility, Jason Rosiak.  He is senior  managing director at Pacific Asset Management.  Jason, thanks for coming  in.</p><p>JASON ROSIAK, PACIFIC ASSET MANAGEMENT SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR:  Thank you  very much.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, we're just hearing from Bob Rice about correlation, perhaps  this breaks lots of volatility whether it's Greece, whether it's China,  whether it's Iran, there are certainly a lot of hot spots in the world.   What are you doing with your money?</p><p>ROSIAK:  Right now it's being at the core for a bottom's up firm.  So, one  of the things that we're looking at is corporate credit and the focus is on  fundamentals and coverage.  And so, with Greece right now, for instance,  the stock market was down by 16 percent today, challenging but that's just  an underlying risk associated with what's going on there in the volatility.  </p><p>BOLTON:  So, not the average person can as of this moment go out and buy a  Greek debt? But it sounds like you're saying for professional investors  this is an opportunity? </p><p>ROSIAK:  It's not for Greek debt but for corporate debt in the U.S. side.   So, what we do is we focus on bank loans.  And bank loans are floating  arrangements that usually general names that PetSmart, Chuck E.  Cheese,  those types of names that are U.S.-based focused yield anywhere between 3  to 6 percent.  The floating rates don't have to worry about duration risk.   And it's a noble...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  So, let's say the Fed moves in either September or December as fed  for the future are indicating.  What does this mean? </p><p>ROSIAK:  So, for this asset class which is nice, is not -- it doesn't have  duration.  So, therefore, it's dependent on the corporate underlying how  they react and how they fundamentally performed.  So, unlike other asset  classes that generally speaking, people use in  inflationary or high rising  rates environment whether it be you're sitting in tips or you're sit in  real estate or commodities, there is a lot of volatility there.</p><p>BOLTON:  OK.</p><p>ROSIAK:  In the taper tension you had commodities go down by about 4  percent, and TIPS go down by 7 percent, or as bank loans.  </p><p>BOLTON:  And TIPS, Inflation Protective Securities.</p><p>ROSIAK:  Correct.</p><p>BOLTON:  For those who do not follow as closely as you do.  The best idea  you've heard of in the past few weeks? </p><p>ROSIAK:  Best idea, we still like corporate credit.  We like triple B  investment-grade credit fairly these are amounts of spread involved there.   And it's better than owning interest-rate sensitive or commodities  sensitive type of assets.  </p><p>BOLTON:  All right.  Jason, come back.  We want to continue the  conversation another time.  Jason Rosiak joining me there.  Senior managing  director at Pacific Asset Management.  </p><p>When we come back, Uber may be recruiting your grandparents.  We are not  joking.  Older drivers may be safer drivers.  First though, former Governor  Jim Gilmore may have announced the 17th kisses.  He's going to end up as  number one.  He is my guest, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  There are 17 republican candidates running for president in 2016.   With us now the very latest contender, former Virginia Governor, Jim  Gilmore with us from D.C.</p><p>Governor, glad to have you with us.</p><p>JIM GILMORE, FORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR:  Thank you, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON:  You are entering a crowded GOP field.  What do you hope to gain  and why now? </p><p>GILMORE:  Well, I hope to gain the ability to turn the country around from  the decline that it's in, wherein a decline in our national security in our  safety of Americans and the American interests.  We're in a decline in the  economy.  The economy has never really recovered from the recession.  We're  really not doing well enough.</p><p>And I think I have the credentials in order to being turn this around.  All  my life I have fought on behalf of my state in my country.  I'm a United  States army veteran.  I was the chairman of the National Commission on  Terrorism for the United States.  I was the governor during the 9/11  attack.</p><p>I've been the governor of a state and band I stood had to deal with budgets  and create jobs and do things.  So, I've always been in a position I think  to really help this.  And right now I see a decline in America that I think  I can reverse.  </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Governor, I want to pick up on exactly what you just said,  this background as an army intelligence officer, we talked about cyber on  this program every single day.  What is the number one thing that could be  changed right now to better protect America? Does it need to hire more  engineers? What does the budget need to look like? How can we improve cyber  security of our businesses and our citizens right now? </p><p>GILMORE:  Well, we're going to have to recognize with presidential  leadership exactly the nature of the society we live in.  When I was the  governor I was known as the technology governor because I've really pushed  forward on all of our policies and programs and also cyber issues.</p><p>We have to recognize that opposition people really try to and do us right  now.  Look at the Chinese situation.  They've gone in now and invaded our  records with people who have security clearances and there's been an  absolutely no repercussions.</p><p>This is an example once again, of the decline of the United States because  of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy.  We need to make it that America is  back.  The best way to do that is to remove the sequester limits from our  defense department to get full or move forward once again in the  restoration of American strength.</p><p>And of course, that's going to require of the American economy. </p><p>BOLTON: So, to spend more on defense. If you could change one thing, let's  say, you're elected, what would you do the first order of business? </p><p>GILMORE: The first order of business is to restore the American economy.  Right now we are discouraging business. You heard Hillary Clinton actually  talk about trying to attack business in this country and income equality  and all those kinds of warm ball of marches kind of ideas.</p><p>What you have to do is to make a renewal once again of the free enterprise  system in this country. And that means that we have to actually to put in  policies that don't discourage investment but restoring investment in this  country. Investment means more productivity. More productivity means more  jobs. And more jobs means higher wages.</p><p>And we're not going to be able to have a real national security until we  restore the American economy to give a better quality of life of the  American people and a stronger economy to protect ourselves in this  dangerous world.</p><p>BOLTON: Governor, you used to be chairman as well of the Republican  National party, the republican National Committee. I want to ask you what  do you make of Donald Trump? There are so many pundits, so many republicans  who keep waiting for his campaign to run out of steam but it's not. Is he  what the American public wants? </p><p>GILMORE: I think that he's struck a nerve, a resentment, and anger in among  the American people. I thought about it a lot. I don't have any real  interest in that. What I have an interest in is actually making the country  better and responding to this anger and to this resentment with genuine  positive programs. </p><p>And that's what why I've talked to you about here today. If we put forward  a program that gives a tax cut to working Americans that combines all  business activity and charges at 15 percent tax rate, if we eliminate the  debt tax, our economists have told us that what that will do is get the  economy moving again. Get us up to growth over 4 percent, do something that  really create some dynamic excitement in this economy. </p><p>That's the kind of anger and resentment because people know that the people  in Washington are not doing anything to move the country forward. That's  why I think I'm qualified to do. That's what I want to achieve. I want to  reverse this decline from the Obama-Clinton policy, that's why I've entered  the presidential race. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Governor, we're glad to have you with us. Thank you for  the time. Former Virginia Governor and 2016 presidential candidate, Jim  Gilmore.</p><p>Well, will Trump maintain his number one spot? Tune in right after this  show at 6 p.m. Eastern Time sharp. Charles Payne has Fox's exclusive latest  poll numbers. </p><p>When we come back, though Twitter getting crushed, some say it is a live  takeover target. We're going to give you a short list of would-be buyers.</p><p>But first, Uber is announcing a partnership with the AARP to recruit older  drivers. We'll talk about the fact whether it a PR sons or a real business  initiative.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Twitter shares closed at the all-time low. Jack Hidary is here. He  is the former CEO of Dice.com. Ari Zaldan is here as well. The CEO of  Quantum Networks. Welcome to you both.</p><p>JACK HIDARY, FORMER DICE.COM CEO: Great to see you.</p><p>BOLTON: Great to see you. So, is Twitter in play? Aye (ph) or nay? </p><p>HIDARY: Twitter is in trouble.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>HIDARY: Twitter does not know where it's going. It's headless, stateless,  does not have a leader right now, there's no captain of the ship. And also  it doesn't know what it's doing because it is a 300 million monthly active  users has not grown effectively in two years.</p><p>BOLTON: And to you point, there is no CEO, I mean, jack Dorsey is there,  one of the original founders but he had said...</p><p>HIDARY: But he's also the CEO of Square. Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. I mean, it's clear that he is a part-time or transitional. So,  $30 actually per share is a number that I saw a lot of analysts come up  with it and say, you know what, this starts to look cheap enough for  someone to buy. What is your take?</p><p>ARI ZOLDAN, QUANTUM NETWORKS CEO: Right. Yes. I think $30 is a great buy. I  don't think it's cheap but I think it's a good buy. And I think to push  back a little bit, they will get a CEO and I think they're get a really  good CEO. The question is when. But you're right. Right now it's sort of in  between times. So, I think there's a lot of questions out on the street. </p><p>HIDARY: But when the CEO comes the question is, what's their strategy,  right? What kind of practice is it? Why is it not growing even though every  show, including this one, talks Twitter all the time. </p><p>BOLTON: Well, I think it's great for journalist and I love it. I'm an  addict. I say that openly, but it's true that if you're not in media and  you're not reading I don't know why you would do if you're not in this  field. </p><p>HIDARY: SO, WhatsApp is growing, Snapchat is growing by leaps and bounds.  Yet, twitter just remains flat. So, there is a real crisis in terms of how  do you grow this. You can't grow. You're not going to grow revenues and  profit either.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. And of course, you know, as you say, Facebook hot on the heels  with its own app. Uber is partnering with AARP. I don't know if you saw  that Simpsons clip there. But is this idea the older drivers are safer  drivers? PR, real business strategy, what do you think? </p><p>ZOLDAN: No, real business. It's real and I think it's great. You know, it's  not cutie. I think it's very real. You have a million Uber rides per day, a  160,000 drivers out there on behalf of Uber. And you have a demographic  that's older, a lot of them are unemployed but they're also great drivers.  So, it's a perfect strategic fit.</p><p>BOLTON: Jack, over there.</p><p>ZOLDAN: This is part of a larger trend which is, people is going to be  driving their own cars less and less. This is going to be major calamity in  terms of the car. Rental companies in terms of giving car sales. </p><p>BOLTON: Well, Uber even started that leasing arm. Did you see that?</p><p>HIDARY: That's right.</p><p>BOLTON: So, they probably are even anticipating exactly what you're saying. </p><p>HIDARY: Yes. So, they need more drivers. They're looking for pools and  demographic. The drivers will agree, this is going to be a great  demographic for them to grow into. They're going to have to get two to  three million rides per day. They need more drivers to get there. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Speaking of more driving. At least in New York City that  means less walking which makes me think of the maybe shaking up its fitness  requirements saying, you know what, if you're strong you can be a little  heavier, if you can still do the work you're supposed to do basically you  don't care.</p><p>HIDARY: Well, you know, this is a fundamental shift from one or twice a  year checking in a physical, right? That's the way we've always thought  about health and health checking. We go for the physical, annual physical  in a nay it's been twice a year to now continuous modeling.</p><p>So, this is a Fitbit tracker right here. Other people use the Apple watch,  of course. The navy is choosing the Fitbit tracker right now to give it to  their sailors and say, hey, 24/7, let's actually get a general bigger  picture sense of how you're doing health wise and that of course connect  with the phone which gives you all those metrics and data. That's what  they're looking for, the overall messaging of the data not just once a year  physicals. </p><p>ZOLDAN: Yes. I happen to be but I think this stuff is great. And it's also  an accessory. I think it has part of a lifestyle obviously. And look, you  know, I'm not a good case study for you're an authorize (ph) than I am. But  I think I agree checking in once or twice I don't it's going to do. I think  this technology is great but I think an overall lifestyle change for the  navy I think would be a good move. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Here hear. There we go. Hold those thought. We're going  to take a quick break. We'll be right back with Jack and Ari. Of course, we  just want to let you know, there is some breaking news here on GM ignition  switch death and injuries now totaling 398 faulty ignition switches  responsible for at least 124 deaths, 274 injuries.</p><p>This is a according to a fund set up to compensate victims. The fund just  finished processing these papers. More than 4,000 claims it had received by  the January 1st deadline. Those numbers just being released now.</p><p>When we come back, actress Jessica Alba's sunscreen customers are getting  burnt. What her response means for her clients and her competitors.</p><p>First stuff, an app that makes your next set of eyeglasses much easier to  get. We will introduce you to the CEO who has seen the future in 2020.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: More than 75 percent of adults in the U.S. use some form of vision  correction. Opternative is trying to make getting contacts or glasses  easier, users' take an online exam. They receive a prescription within 24  hours off from their homes.</p><p>Co-founder and CEO Aaron Dallek is with me now. So, Aaron, do people get  equally accurate results as going to an eye doctor's office? </p><p>AARON DALLEK, OPTERNATIVE CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Yes. They do. Opternative is  clinically proven to be statistically equivalent to the traditional  refractive eye exam done in the doctor's office. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. Now, you're located in 27 states and counting. What was that  process like to get approved in each state? </p><p>DALLEK: So, we worked with our lawyers and we've registered with the FDA.  And we've made sure that we follow all the regulations in all of the states  and we've hired ophthalmologists licensed in all of these states to make it  so that we can practice in these states. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Warby Parker is a big online eyeglass brand. It's kind  of like Tom shoes but for glasses. Do you see that company as competition? </p><p>DALLEK: Warby Parker is a great online retailer and one of many that we  hope to partner with in helping your customers and helping our customers  get glasses using our test. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, you see them more as a complementary service versus being  an outright competitor. I do know that your service requires computer and a  Smartphone. So, you have plans to target under serve or impoverished areas,  maybe people in places that don't have tablets that are ready? </p><p>DALLEK: Yes. Absolutely. We're looking to make our technology available to  as many people as possible make it available so proctors can help people  who can't go through the exam on their own, help people in other countries,  help people in the U.S. who under served. So, it's very important part of  our business.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Now as far as protecting the data we know medical  information among the most personal, how high on your list is privacy? </p><p>DALLEK: Security is a top priority. We are officially HIPA compliant and we  use top level enterprise security to insure all of our patient data is  secure and encrypted at every level. </p><p>BOLTON: Aaron, we're glad to have with us. Thanks for joining us. Aaron  Dallek, he is the Opternative co-founder and CEO. </p><p>When we come back, Jessica Alba is feeling the heat. Some of her  sunscreens, some customer say, they're getting burned. Spells opportunity  for competing brand. And the city of brotherly love apparently not so love  being to the treatment of a hitchhiking robot. We will give you the  details.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Jessica Alba on its company getting burned for its sunscreen.  Customers taking to social media claiming that the ecofriendly cream  doesn't work. Jack Hidary back with me now as of Ari Zoldan. So, are social  media sites Twitter, Instagram, anything else just becoming the new yelp,  the new consumer reports? </p><p>HIDARY: You know, in this age of Internet transparency is number one. You  have to be transparent. You could be led by a superstar, you could be led a  great show, it doesn't matter. You need to be super transparent with your  customer base. </p><p>BOLTON: We're looking at these kids who are sunburned.</p><p>HIDARY: Oh, my, God.</p><p>BOLTON: And I mean, even more...</p><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: ... sort of when it's a child you think like, ah.</p><p>HIDARY: The hospitality as you know as well from trip adviser, right. You  get two or three bad reviews in trip advisory, your hotel, your airlines,  your resort could be done for it. And so, many industries now are very  responsive because of social media and because of side trip advisor, that's  now coming to the consumer price as well. </p><p>BOLTON: But I hear what you're saying she named the company honest, so she  set a higher bar for her. </p><p>HIDARY: Exactly. And there's good present for that. Look at honesty very  successful but they had to go against Snapple, a much bigger company using  the transparency. The same thing with Canbar (ph). Canbar is so successful  today in part because of its transparent packaging literally saying we will  tell you what's inside.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>HIDARY: The other guys -- exactly. The other guys are concealing what's  inside. So, there is a lot of good precedent for going with honest concept  but then you have to live up to it. </p><p>BOLTON: Ari, what is your take?</p><p>ZOLDAN: And you have to be -- right. And you have to be honest about it. </p><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Yes, I agree with Jack. I think today the fact that every one that  has an Internet connection means everyone has a voice for every products  and every service that they buy. So, you know, they become either an  advocate or proponent, you know, for the actual product.</p><p>BOLTON: So, if you're with crisis management for the Honest company, what  would you tell her right now? </p><p>ZOLDAN: I think she has to be forward. She has to honest about it just like  come after whether she was in actually -- if she was intimately involved  with the process or not. And I think she has to be very outspoken about it.  And I think that the media especially the public I think they appreciate  that that. </p><p>HIDARY: Yes, I agree. They maybe and she was in the zinc component right  now.</p><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p>HIDARY: So, if you look at other kinds of, you know, honest oriented suntan  lotions they have a higher zinc component. It could be they lower the zinc  component that's why you're seeing those.</p><p>BOLTON: That's what I've read.</p><p>HIDARY: Red burns. So, they have to get to the bottom and then come forward  and share that and engage to the community because if not, you have  situations like Market Basket. This is $4-billion supermarket chain and  they fire the CEO, they technically could fire the CEO, the customers, the  vendors, the entire chain shut down for 30 days to protest and say, bring  back that CEO, we want them.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Strong, speaking of engagement, engaging the users.  You've write in the drone.</p><p>HIDARY: We did.</p><p>BOLTON: Speaking of engaging, aircraft is swerving to avoid a drone in  South Jersey. Because we know that all of the anti-drone people are going  to say, see, this is why you can't have drones, this is why you can't move  for all of this.</p><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: But, in essence it is actually a fair point. I mean, the pilot of a  smaller aircraft basically almost had an accident with the drone. </p><p>HIDARY: Yes. You know, we have to deal with drones. Drones are reality.</p><p>BOLTON: They're here.</p><p>HIDARY: Drones are very useful. This happens to be a drone with a camera  right here in front could take pictures of real estate could be helpful to  farmers, could be helpful to lots of different industry. This is not just  for recreational use but actually for industrial use as well. </p><p>So, drones are here and they offer a lot of value. The question is, how are  we going to regulate them? Right now there is a lot of ambiguity around  that. We need to find a way to both protect people's privacy and also have  a way to have drone's out there. </p><p>BOLTON: But now pretend that they don't exist. I saw an even crazier things  which is somebody at the FAA is looking at this possibility...</p><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: ... drones so that drones it does not -- they can't fly above a  certain air space. That to me seems crazier than just establishing the kind  of channel.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Right. Could you imagine that this is only the first generation  like we're just scratching the surface.</p><p>HIDARY: That's right.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Can you imagine what is this going to look like in three months, in  three years, or 30 years, talking about, you know, just thinking about the  sophistication of it. So, obviously a regulation is extremely important  whether it's in the form of geo fencing of figuring how to protect your  area and your air space. </p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>ZOLDAN: I think is the big topic of the conversation.</p><p>BOLTON: We know Amazon.com obviously lobbying hard...</p><p>HIDARY: For prime add.</p><p>BOLTON: ... to have a -- yes, just a sky highway.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Right. And then you have paparazzi's now using drones as well to go  in -- the question is, are you going to have a drone to drawn combat. Are  you going to have some drones defending and other drones trying to look at.</p><p>BOLTON: A new stage of video games.</p><p>HIDARY: Exactly.</p><p>BOLTON: Jack Hidary, thank you so much. Ari Zoldan joining me there for a  great conversation. Thank you both. We have a quick break to take. When we  come back we were on top of it when it broke. Now it is literally broke.  Find out how the hitchhiking robot made its way across all kinds of  countries and then met its demise in the city of brotherly love.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Here are some of the top stories trending on foxbusiness.com. right  now. Kraft recalling 36,000 cases of singles cheese. A few customers  complained of choking on the plastic wrapping. It is the second recall for  Kraft. In March, more than 240,000 packages of macaroni and cheese was  recalled over worry that some boxes contained metal pieces.</p><p>From food to autos, July sales strong on track with the industry yearly  estimate. If current levels are maintained, sales will hit a 14-year high.  Trucks and SUVs the most popular of this month. Ford saw the best July  since 2006. </p><p>And the CEO that cut his $1 million salary. So, all of his employees could  have a minimum wage of $70,000 a year, seem hard times. The company is  losing talents. They say the system rewards slackers and provides no  incentives for innovation. The CEO is now renting out his house to make  ends meet. </p><p>For the latest on news and analysis, go to foxbusiness.com.</p><p>Well, the Canadian built HitchBOT began its coast to coast trip on the  U.S., that was July 17th. It made it all across Canada and Europe. But when  it came to Philadelphia, the second leg of the trip beginning in  Massachusetts, you can just track how it is there along with other  landmarks. </p><p>But you can see in the city of Brotherly Love, none at all. The hitchBOT  was found destroyed on the side of the road just 300 miles into its U.S.  trip. </p><p>We are so glad you joined us here on Risk &amp; Reward.

So, who knows how much information the bad guys got away with this time?</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Now, the hack was discovered in March but probably happened back in September 2013. So, intruders had lot of opportunities to use data that they stole. Why did it take so long to pinpoint?</p><p/><p>PAYTON: Well, what's happening with the hackers they've changed tactics. They're not as nosy as they used to be when they break-in and they don't try and run out the door with all of the crown jewels at the same time. They watch how the systems work, they watch how the system security works, and then they will find different ways to try and sneak around that.</p><p/><p>They may have used credentials of legitimate employees at the university or legitimate vendor credentials. And they may have used that to actually slip the data out the door -- just quietly and under sort of the guys of legitimate credentials.</p><p/><p>We don't know because that investigation is still ongoing. You know, the other piece, too, is they may never be able to trust this network again. The fact that they were in this long they can hide themselves in files, in system files, the operating system, and they can actually be there and come back time and time again. So, it's going to be very difficult to get the bad guys out of this network.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Now, how do we know, Theresa, that it's China?</p><p/><p>PAYTON: We don't really know for sure until the investigation concludes. And I always caution organizations when they say it's (AUDIO GAP) or Russia or they pick a country to (AUDIO GAP). Look, I can send traffic from any country in the world that I want to so that you think the traffic is originating in that country.</p><p/><p>A lots of hackers know that China is in the forefront of discussions and so they may be sending their traffic from China. Until the forensics continues and they look at different things like what was the native language of the hackers? What types of tools and techniques did they use because each one in the cyber syndicates kind of has their own fingerprint method, if you will. And that really has not happened yet. And until it does we don't know for sure that it was China.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, do you think we're just going to see more and more of these kinds of attacks?</p><p/><p>PAYTON: Absolutely. I think what every organization needs to realize -- if you are connected to the Internet and you have one piece of data that's of value to hackers. They will find a way to monetize it or use you as a disguise to hack somebody else.</p><p/><p>These hacks are going to continue until we start taking matters into our own hands. For starters, these kids who are just starting their lives this pivotal moment they have got to not just trust on free credit reporting, they have to freeze their credits.</p><p/><p>From a university standpoint, they want to be open minds open and trusting. They have to go back and look at what's valuable information here and start locking that off whether it's from vendors looking at user access controls. They need to start locking up this data and every organization should take a lesson from today and ask some critical questions of themselves, how safe is our data and who might be after it?</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And we know that the engineering school helped you to discover it. So, I guess more schools as well will be tapping in-house resources. Theresa Payton, thank you as always. Fortalice CEO, former White House CIO.</p><p/><p>Well, staying on the scene, less a week after the White House said, it would not retaliate against China for hacking. President Obama plotting to take action. This is according to The New York Times.</p><p/><p>Retired Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cowan with me now. So, Colonel, why this reversal of opinion and of action?</p><p/><p>BILL COWAN, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST: Probably a lot of pressure from him, Deirdre. About the fact that 22 million of people's information private data got hacked including my own as a guy who used to have a security clearance. So, I think the White House -- a lot of pressure from Congress, pressure from the public, the White House is deciding they have to do something.</p><p/><p>At this point, they're thinking about doing something. They haven't quite said they will do anything.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, Colonel, China has maintained -- it did nothing. I mean, they've actually come out with a statement saying, \"It was not us.\" So, what can the Obama administration really do? Will there will be a symbolic response? Or will there be something a little bit more aggressive?</p><p/><p>COWAN: No. I think it will be symbolic and vast because they don't want to get in some kind of tit for tat. A spot with the Chinese who have all - - as much leverage over us certainly as we do over them in the financial sector, the business sector. So, my guess is, excuse my term here, but maybe we'll bitch slap them a little bit but we may not do much more than that.</p><p/><p>But the real thing, Deirdre, I believe is, when something like this happens and the White House tried to pretend that China didn't do it -- I think they knew almost from the outset that it was China. When something like this happens the only way we counter these kinds of things is fast, aggressive, unquestionable response of the same nature of what they did to us.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, I hear what you're saying. In other words, we have to make it uncomfortable for anyone attacking us. So, at least they think twice about doing it again.</p><p/><p>COWAN: That's exactly right. And you know what, as your previous guest was just saying, it's the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians, it might be some kid in the basement in Toronto who's learned how to make cyber-attack on us. But if we're not able to stand up decisively and firmly almost immediately upon knowing who it was and do something to them, they are going to continue to do this to us forever.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Colonel, we're so glad you're with us. Bill Cowan joining us there. Retiring -- retired rather, lieutenant colonel there with us on this very latest with cyber security.</p><p/><p>Well, speaking of tech but from a different aspect, Microsoft recent investment part of why Uber has a valuation of more than $50 billion.</p><p/><p>Doug MacMillan is here. He broke the story for The Wall Street Journal. So, Doug, Microsoft and Uber, are they new BFF?</p><p/><p>DOUG MACMILLAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER: Maybe not BFF as much as they are business partners. You know, Uber has been pushing to build its own technology and its own maps. And we've heard as part of the latest financing round, they disclosed that they've been looking for big technology partners to help them do that.</p><p/><p>Now, Microsoft is really not known as the cutting edge of maps but they are one of the few large technology companies that does have assets and expertise and engineers who are working on maps specifically in Bing mapping division.</p><p/><p>Now, last month or actually in June, Uber announces it's acquiring some of those Bing assets. But apparently, Microsoft and Uber have also worked out an arrangement where Microsoft is going to invest in Uber. So, we don't know if they're going to work together going forward but they're now definitely partners with Microsoft owning a very, you know, a hard to come by stake in Uber.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Hard to come by a stake in Uber. You said a few things in there. I just want to know looking at it from Microsoft's angle, does it somehow legitimize or show that Microsoft is in a current field especially -- I don't know, I'm just thinking the Windows 10 upgrade or using yet, had to be free because no one would pay for it. So, does this bring Microsoft back towards cutting edge companies?</p><p/><p>MACMILLAN: I wouldn't go that far. But it definitely calls to mind, in earlier Microsoft investment -- the former CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, invested in Facebook when that company was only at a $15 billion valuation. That investment turned out to be very lucrative for Microsoft.</p><p/><p>But with that stake, now being work something like $2.5 billion on its own. So, perhaps Microsoft by investing in Uber could potentially have a good financials when fallen also for its current Satya Nadella can make him kind of look smart and look like he's connected to kind of one of the cutting edge companies here in Silicon Valley.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And this also challenges Uber, right? Because we know that Uber made an initial investment in Uber back in the day. But now Google has also moving towards its own self- driving a cars, so it just seems like Uber has to find another big tech partners that can write big checks.</p><p/><p>MACMILLAN: Yes. This is one of the most interesting stories about Uber. As one of its earliest investors and closest partners is now also increasingly looking like a competitor. So, with Uber trying to distance itself more from Google, there is definitely an element of, you know, is Uber taking money from Microsoft because of this \"enemy of my enemy is my friend\" principle. We don't know the story of that but definitely it's a juicy story line.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Well, diplomacy important even among tech companies. Doug MacMillan, thank you so much. Great scoop for The Wall Street Journal. We want to bring you up-to-date with some breaking news</p><p/><p>Debt ravage of Puerto Rico officially in default. Moody is saying, you paid $628,000 but that is a fraction of the 58 million that was due, that is the default in our book. So, Moody's is in fact saying that Puerto Rico has defaulted and you do have of course, Puerto Rican officials saying, we don't want to default, we do not want a debt spiral to start.</p><p/><p>We will bring you up-to-date with the very latest headlines and reaction.</p><p/><p>In the meantime, tech billionaire Elon Musk warning against using robots in the military. But our next guest says he is making a big mistake. We'll tell you why.</p><p/><p>Plus, the first GOP presidential debate is on Thursday. One of the candidates is joining us tonight with his plan for America. Stay tuned.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Here are some of the stories we are following for you at this hour. Twitter shares touching a record low as the company went public. You'll recall November 2014, but shares plunged today and they are down below $30 a share for the first time in more than a year. Some say, this makes it a takeover target.</p><p/><p>President Obama unveiling a major climate change plan. It aimed at large reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the nation's coal burning power plants. The EPA is estimating the plan would cost around $8.5 billion.</p><p/><p>Vice President Joe Biden has begun to actively explore a possible presidential campaign. The New York Times columnist reporting that Biden had been holding meetings such as his residents about jumping in to challenge Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire. He could pose the biggest threat of any democrat as the front runner to Hillary Clinton.</p><p/><p>U.S. oil worth noting here settling at 45.17 a barrel, the lowest in more than four months. Continuing a trend of a reduction of about 50 percent since the fall.</p><p/><p>Well, the future of modern warfare is like any other industry, technology will play a big role. Last week, where than 1,000 researchers including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking signed a letter to the U.N. asking for a ban on the development and use of autonomous weapons or killer robots.</p><p/><p>My next guest says they will actually save lives. The author of \"Ghost Fleet,\" P.W. Singer with me now. So, P.W., thanks so much for joining us. Why do you disagree with those who signed the letter, those are some of our best and brightest minds?</p><p/><p>P.W. SINGER, \"GHOST FLEET\" AUTHOR: I don't disagree with this sentiment that they want it cause positive change in the world. I think what I disagree with is the idea of how effective this effort is going to be. The book that we did documents right now at least 21 different cases of working on this kind of weaponry in the U.S. in China, et cetera.</p><p/><p>And the reason the militaries are working on this is not because they think it's cool, it's not because of, you know, some kind of terminator vision. Because they think it's going to be useful. And so, if this effort is going to win out, this letter writing campaign it's going to have to overcome the idea of use.</p><p/><p>The other thing to mention here is of course, it's not just the military that's working on robotics and autonomy, its private business. Its companies like Google and Amazon and the like. And so, if it's playing out in the civilian sector it's going to happen, it's going to move over in the war too.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. But how can we estimate or how can we make it so that only the right armies -- this sound like a crazy question -- are building this and not the wrong ones? I mean, who's the judge?</p><p/><p>SINGER: Well, I think you've just put your finger on the problem. Every single technology in history has been used for both good and bad whether it's a stone or whether it's a drone. With drone we've seen everything from the U.S. military to ISIS fly to them.</p><p/><p>I think what makes these technologies so challenging is that they have very low barriers to entry right now. And so, for looking at a future conflict be it a small war or a big war with the China or Russia, all the different players are going to have this technology. And that's a very big difference for the U.S. that weak for in Ghost Fleet. Is what does it mean to go on to a war where you're not a generation the head of the other side in technology.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And as for when we see this kind technology in the battlefield? When is it?</p><p/><p>SINGER: Well, we're already seeing robotics in the battlefield right now. You know, for example, in the war against the ISIS everyone from the U.S. military to the Syrian military to ISIS itself have flown drones. I think if you're looking forward to the 2020s period, you're going to see technology that's more and more autonomous.</p><p/><p>And by that, I mean, not just the cars that we drive on highways or Amazon delivery drones but also the drones that are out there in the battlefield. And, you know, for example, the U.S. Navy has already tested out a drone that took off and landed from an aircraft carrier on its own. The toughest human pilot task. That of course is going to move into a future war.</p><p/><p>Same thing, China has three different long range strike programs that are droned, that are not unmanned. If we were to fight them they would be using this kind of technologies. So, the bottom line here is that, if there was a World War, which we explore in this book, it would be one where you'd see a mix of man and machine.</p><p/><p>And of course, it's not just robotics systems in and of themselves. It's that the manned systems will become more robotic. A lot like how we have cars right now that can parallel park themselves.</p><p/><p>The U.S. Navy is building a new warship...</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p/><p>SINGER: ... that it has about one-tenth the size of the crew in the past. Because the war ship is so highly robotics.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: P.W., glad to have you with us. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Great book. P.W. Singer joining us there, he is the author of \"Ghost Fleet.\"</p><p/><p>Well, stock you saw in the red today. We're going to look at the correlation between earnings and performance. SO, you had 65 companies in the NASDAQ, 100 reporting. Stocks swinging up or down at an average of more 5 percent immediately after reporting results.</p><p/><p>All in the last three weeks, the highest volatility, if you like, on that front since 2012.</p><p/><p>Bob Rice is here. Managing partner at Tangent Capital, author of \"The Alternative Answer.\" Bob, one minute on the clock. Please explain correlate.</p><p/><p>BOB RICE, TANGENT CAPITAL MANAGING PARTNER: So, correlation is a very simple but very important concept. You know, just free first to how closely a given stocks movement track the movement of the larger index.</p><p/><p>And so, when you're in the period of high correlation, you can really think of it like a flock of birds. One bird turns a little bit they all turn a little bit. One turns dramatically they all turn dramatically. The opposite of that is when all stocks have different kinds they are in the early minds and they act as you see here like a herd of cats instead.</p><p/><p>So, that's a low correlation environment. And the reason this is important is we seem to be transitioning from a high correlation to a low correlation right now, and that matters. Because over the last few years, frankly, it hasn't made that much difference exactly which stocks you own because they all acted alike. They were highly correlated.</p><p/><p>We're moving now to a different period, (inaudible) correlation, you're going to have to be a lot more careful about what's exactly in your portfolio.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. With 10 seconds to go, leave bulls and bears aside, we're going to do cats and birds here. But, Bob, most importantly, why is this happening now?</p><p/><p>RICE: Well, I think it's because you're seeing peeling back of quantitative easing than we were very cheap flooded with easy money, all boats were...</p><p/><p>BOLTON: For nine years.</p><p/><p>RICE: Yes. We're coming up with that tie. Now, it's starting to be different. And you can see it very clearly in what you were saying in the intro there. Up until very recently it didn't really matter whether stock beat its earnings estimate or disappointed. It was still in the flock of birds. It behaves like the rest of the flock. All of a sudden it matters dramatically. If you beat your earnings estimates you do way better than the average. If you disappoint you do way worse. And that's what is important for investors to start paying attention too.</p><p/><p>To see that the investor can do that.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: The number one thing an inventor can do then going into this environment. Diversification I imagine.</p><p/><p>RICE: Well, yes. But over diversification because now matters exactly which ones you're in. And so, you want to be in more concentrated higher conviction portfolios and not so much super broad based ETFs and indexes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Bob Rice, we thank you as always. Bob Rice joining us there, managing partner at Tangent Capital, also the author of \"The Alternative Answer.\"</p><p/><p>Well, speaking of volatility, the Greek stock market reopened for the first time in five weeks. It was a blood bath dropping more than 20 percent, just a few minutes into the open, banking stocks hit the worst.</p><p/><p>With us now to discuss this kind of volatility, Jason Rosiak. He is senior managing director at Pacific Asset Management. Jason, thanks for coming in.</p><p/><p>JASON ROSIAK, PACIFIC ASSET MANAGEMENT SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR: Thank you very much.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, we're just hearing from Bob Rice about correlation, perhaps this breaks lots of volatility whether it's Greece, whether it's China, whether it's Iran, there are certainly a lot of hot spots in the world. What are you doing with your money?</p><p/><p>ROSIAK: Right now it's being at the core for a bottom's up firm. So, one of the things that we're looking at is corporate credit and the focus is on fundamentals and coverage. And so, with Greece right now, for instance, the stock market was down by 16 percent today, challenging but that's just an underlying risk associated with what's going on there in the volatility.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, not the average person can as of this moment go out and buy a Greek debt? But it sounds like you're saying for professional investors this is an opportunity?</p><p/><p>ROSIAK: It's not for Greek debt but for corporate debt in the U.S. side. So, what we do is we focus on bank loans. And bank loans are floating arrangements that usually general names that PetSmart, Chuck E. Cheese, those types of names that are U.S.-based focused yield anywhere between 3 to 6 percent. The floating rates don't have to worry about duration risk. And it's a noble...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, let's say the Fed moves in either September or December as fed for the future are indicating. What does this mean?</p><p/><p>ROSIAK: So, for this asset class which is nice, is not -- it doesn't have duration. So, therefore, it's dependent on the corporate underlying how they react and how they fundamentally performed. So, unlike other asset classes that generally speaking, people use in inflationary or high rising rates environment whether it be you're sitting in tips or you're sit in real estate or commodities, there is a lot of volatility there.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p/><p>ROSIAK: In the taper tension you had commodities go down by about 4 percent, and TIPS go down by 7 percent, or as bank loans.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And TIPS, Inflation Protective Securities.</p><p/><p>ROSIAK: Correct.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: For those who do not follow as closely as you do. The best idea you've heard of in the past few weeks?</p><p/><p>ROSIAK: Best idea, we still like corporate credit. We like triple B investment-grade credit fairly these are amounts of spread involved there. And it's better than owning interest-rate sensitive or commodities sensitive type of assets.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Jason, come back. We want to continue the conversation another time. Jason Rosiak joining me there. Senior managing director at Pacific Asset Management.</p><p/><p>When we come back, Uber may be recruiting your grandparents. We are not joking. Older drivers may be safer drivers. First though, former Governor Jim Gilmore may have announced the 17th kisses. He's going to end up as number one. He is my guest, next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: There are 17 republican candidates running for president in 2016. With us now the very latest contender, former Virginia Governor, Jim Gilmore with us from D.C.</p><p/><p>Governor, glad to have you with us.</p><p/><p>JIM GILMORE, FORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR: Thank you, Deirdre.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: You are entering a crowded GOP field. What do you hope to gain and why now?</p><p/><p>GILMORE: Well, I hope to gain the ability to turn the country around from the decline that it's in, wherein a decline in our national security in our safety of Americans and the American interests. We're in a decline in the economy. The economy has never really recovered from the recession. We're really not doing well enough.</p><p/><p>And I think I have the credentials in order to being turn this around. All my life I have fought on behalf of my state in my country. I'm a United States army veteran. I was the chairman of the National Commission on Terrorism for the United States. I was the governor during the 9/11 attack.</p><p/><p>I've been the governor of a state and band I stood had to deal with budgets and create jobs and do things. So, I've always been in a position I think to really help this. And right now I see a decline in America that I think I can reverse.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, Governor, I want to pick up on exactly what you just said, this background as an army intelligence officer, we talked about cyber on this program every single day. What is the number one thing that could be changed right now to better protect America? Does it need to hire more engineers? What does the budget need to look like? How can we improve cyber security of our businesses and our citizens right now?</p><p/><p>GILMORE: Well, we're going to have to recognize with presidential leadership exactly the nature of the society we live in. When I was the governor I was known as the technology governor because I've really pushed forward on all of our policies and programs and also cyber issues.</p><p/><p>We have to recognize that opposition people really try to and do us right now. Look at the Chinese situation. They've gone in now and invaded our records with people who have security clearances and there's been an absolutely no repercussions.</p><p/><p>This is an example once again, of the decline of the United States because of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. We need to make it that America is back. The best way to do that is to remove the sequester limits from our defense department to get full or move forward once again in the restoration of American strength.</p><p/><p>And of course, that's going to require of the American economy.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, to spend more on defense. If you could change one thing, let's say, you're elected, what would you do the first order of business?</p><p/><p>GILMORE: The first order of business is to restore the American economy. Right now we are discouraging business. You heard Hillary Clinton actually talk about trying to attack business in this country and income equality and all those kinds of warm ball of marches kind of ideas.</p><p/><p>What you have to do is to make a renewal once again of the free enterprise system in this country. And that means that we have to actually to put in policies that don't discourage investment but restoring investment in this country. Investment means more productivity. More productivity means more jobs. And more jobs means higher wages.</p><p/><p>And we're not going to be able to have a real national security until we restore the American economy to give a better quality of life of the American people and a stronger economy to protect ourselves in this dangerous world.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Governor, you used to be chairman as well of the Republican National party, the republican National Committee. I want to ask you what do you make of Donald Trump? There are so many pundits, so many republicans who keep waiting for his campaign to run out of steam but it's not. Is he what the American public wants?</p><p/><p>GILMORE: I think that he's struck a nerve, a resentment, and anger in among the American people. I thought about it a lot. I don't have any real interest in that. What I have an interest in is actually making the country better and responding to this anger and to this resentment with genuine positive programs.</p><p/><p>And that's what why I've talked to you about here today. If we put forward a program that gives a tax cut to working Americans that combines all business activity and charges at 15 percent tax rate, if we eliminate the debt tax, our economists have told us that what that will do is get the economy moving again. Get us up to growth over 4 percent, do something that really create some dynamic excitement in this economy.</p><p/><p>That's the kind of anger and resentment because people know that the people in Washington are not doing anything to move the country forward. That's why I think I'm qualified to do. That's what I want to achieve. I want to reverse this decline from the Obama-Clinton policy, that's why I've entered the presidential race.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Governor, we're glad to have you with us. Thank you for the time. Former Virginia Governor and 2016 presidential candidate, Jim Gilmore.</p><p/><p>Well, will Trump maintain his number one spot? Tune in right after this show at 6 p.m. Eastern Time sharp. Charles Payne has Fox's exclusive latest poll numbers.</p><p/><p>When we come back, though Twitter getting crushed, some say it is a live takeover target. We're going to give you a short list of would-be buyers.</p><p/><p>But first, Uber is announcing a partnership with the AARP to recruit older drivers. We'll talk about the fact whether it a PR sons or a real business initiative.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Twitter shares closed at the all-time low. Jack Hidary is here. He is the former CEO of Dice.com. Ari Zaldan is here as well. The CEO of Quantum Networks. Welcome to you both.</p><p/><p>JACK HIDARY, FORMER DICE.COM CEO: Great to see you.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Great to see you. So, is Twitter in play? Aye (ph) or nay?</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Twitter is in trouble.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Twitter does not know where it's going. It's headless, stateless, does not have a leader right now, there's no captain of the ship. And also it doesn't know what it's doing because it is a 300 million monthly active users has not grown effectively in two years.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And to you point, there is no CEO, I mean, jack Dorsey is there, one of the original founders but he had said...</p><p/><p>HIDARY: But he's also the CEO of Square. Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes. I mean, it's clear that he is a part-time or transitional. So, $30 actually per share is a number that I saw a lot of analysts come up with it and say, you know what, this starts to look cheap enough for someone to buy. What is your take?</p><p/><p>ARI ZOLDAN, QUANTUM NETWORKS CEO: Right. Yes. I think $30 is a great buy. I don't think it's cheap but I think it's a good buy. And I think to push back a little bit, they will get a CEO and I think they're get a really good CEO. The question is when. But you're right. Right now it's sort of in between times. So, I think there's a lot of questions out on the street.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: But when the CEO comes the question is, what's their strategy, right? What kind of practice is it? Why is it not growing even though every show, including this one, talks Twitter all the time.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Well, I think it's great for journalist and I love it. I'm an addict. I say that openly, but it's true that if you're not in media and you're not reading I don't know why you would do if you're not in this field.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: SO, WhatsApp is growing, Snapchat is growing by leaps and bounds. Yet, twitter just remains flat. So, there is a real crisis in terms of how do you grow this. You can't grow. You're not going to grow revenues and profit either.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. And of course, you know, as you say, Facebook hot on the heels with its own app. Uber is partnering with AARP. I don't know if you saw that Simpsons clip there. But is this idea the older drivers are safer drivers? PR, real business strategy, what do you think?</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: No, real business. It's real and I think it's great. You know, it's not cutie. I think it's very real. You have a million Uber rides per day, a 160,000 drivers out there on behalf of Uber. And you have a demographic that's older, a lot of them are unemployed but they're also great drivers. So, it's a perfect strategic fit.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Jack, over there.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: This is part of a larger trend which is, people is going to be driving their own cars less and less. This is going to be major calamity in terms of the car. Rental companies in terms of giving car sales.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Well, Uber even started that leasing arm. Did you see that?</p><p/><p>HIDARY: That's right.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, they probably are even anticipating exactly what you're saying.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes. So, they need more drivers. They're looking for pools and demographic. The drivers will agree, this is going to be a great demographic for them to grow into. They're going to have to get two to three million rides per day. They need more drivers to get there.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Speaking of more driving. At least in New York City that means less walking which makes me think of the maybe shaking up its fitness requirements saying, you know what, if you're strong you can be a little heavier, if you can still do the work you're supposed to do basically you don't care.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Well, you know, this is a fundamental shift from one or twice a year checking in a physical, right? That's the way we've always thought about health and health checking. We go for the physical, annual physical in a nay it's been twice a year to now continuous modeling.</p><p/><p>So, this is a Fitbit tracker right here. Other people use the Apple watch, of course. The navy is choosing the Fitbit tracker right now to give it to their sailors and say, hey, 24/7, let's actually get a general bigger picture sense of how you're doing health wise and that of course connect with the phone which gives you all those metrics and data. That's what they're looking for, the overall messaging of the data not just once a year physicals.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: Yes. I happen to be but I think this stuff is great. And it's also an accessory. I think it has part of a lifestyle obviously. And look, you know, I'm not a good case study for you're an authorize (ph) than I am. But I think I agree checking in once or twice I don't it's going to do. I think this technology is great but I think an overall lifestyle change for the navy I think would be a good move.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Here hear. There we go. Hold those thought. We're going to take a quick break. We'll be right back with Jack and Ari. Of course, we just want to let you know, there is some breaking news here on GM ignition switch death and injuries now totaling 398 faulty ignition switches responsible for at least 124 deaths, 274 injuries.</p><p/><p>This is a according to a fund set up to compensate victims. The fund just finished processing these papers. More than 4,000 claims it had received by the January 1st deadline. Those numbers just being released now.</p><p/><p>When we come back, actress Jessica Alba's sunscreen customers are getting burnt. What her response means for her clients and her competitors.</p><p/><p>First stuff, an app that makes your next set of eyeglasses much easier to get. We will introduce you to the CEO who has seen the future in 2020.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: More than 75 percent of adults in the U.S. use some form of vision correction. Opternative is trying to make getting contacts or glasses easier, users' take an online exam. They receive a prescription within 24 hours off from their homes.</p><p/><p>Co-founder and CEO Aaron Dallek is with me now. So, Aaron, do people get equally accurate results as going to an eye doctor's office?</p><p/><p>AARON DALLEK, OPTERNATIVE CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Yes. They do. Opternative is clinically proven to be statistically equivalent to the traditional refractive eye exam done in the doctor's office.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Now, you're located in 27 states and counting. What was that process like to get approved in each state?</p><p/><p>DALLEK: So, we worked with our lawyers and we've registered with the FDA. And we've made sure that we follow all the regulations in all of the states and we've hired ophthalmologists licensed in all of these states to make it so that we can practice in these states.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Warby Parker is a big online eyeglass brand. It's kind of like Tom shoes but for glasses. Do you see that company as competition?</p><p/><p>DALLEK: Warby Parker is a great online retailer and one of many that we hope to partner with in helping your customers and helping our customers get glasses using our test.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. So, you see them more as a complementary service versus being an outright competitor. I do know that your service requires computer and a Smartphone. So, you have plans to target under serve or impoverished areas, maybe people in places that don't have tablets that are ready?</p><p/><p>DALLEK: Yes. Absolutely. We're looking to make our technology available to as many people as possible make it available so proctors can help people who can't go through the exam on their own, help people in other countries, help people in the U.S. who under served. So, it's very important part of our business.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Now as far as protecting the data we know medical information among the most personal, how high on your list is privacy?</p><p/><p>DALLEK: Security is a top priority. We are officially HIPA compliant and we use top level enterprise security to insure all of our patient data is secure and encrypted at every level.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Aaron, we're glad to have with us. Thanks for joining us. Aaron Dallek, he is the Opternative co-founder and CEO.</p><p/><p>When we come back, Jessica Alba is feeling the heat. Some of her sunscreens, some customer say, they're getting burned. Spells opportunity for competing brand. And the city of brotherly love apparently not so love being to the treatment of a hitchhiking robot. We will give you the details.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Jessica Alba on its company getting burned for its sunscreen. Customers taking to social media claiming that the ecofriendly cream doesn't work. Jack Hidary back with me now as of Ari Zoldan. So, are social media sites Twitter, Instagram, anything else just becoming the new yelp, the new consumer reports?</p><p/><p>HIDARY: You know, in this age of Internet transparency is number one. You have to be transparent. You could be led by a superstar, you could be led a great show, it doesn't matter. You need to be super transparent with your customer base.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: We're looking at these kids who are sunburned.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Oh, my, God.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And I mean, even more...</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: ... sort of when it's a child you think like, ah.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: The hospitality as you know as well from trip adviser, right. You get two or three bad reviews in trip advisory, your hotel, your airlines, your resort could be done for it. And so, many industries now are very responsive because of social media and because of side trip advisor, that's now coming to the consumer price as well.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: But I hear what you're saying she named the company honest, so she set a higher bar for her.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Exactly. And there's good present for that. Look at honesty very successful but they had to go against Snapple, a much bigger company using the transparency. The same thing with Canbar (ph). Canbar is so successful today in part because of its transparent packaging literally saying we will tell you what's inside.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: The other guys -- exactly. The other guys are concealing what's inside. So, there is a lot of good precedent for going with honest concept but then you have to live up to it.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Ari, what is your take?</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: And you have to be -- right. And you have to be honest about it.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: Yes, I agree with Jack. I think today the fact that every one that has an Internet connection means everyone has a voice for every products and every service that they buy. So, you know, they become either an advocate or proponent, you know, for the actual product.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, if you're with crisis management for the Honest company, what would you tell her right now?</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: I think she has to be forward. She has to honest about it just like come after whether she was in actually -- if she was intimately involved with the process or not. And I think she has to be very outspoken about it. And I think that the media especially the public I think they appreciate that that.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes, I agree. They maybe and she was in the zinc component right now.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: So, if you look at other kinds of, you know, honest oriented suntan lotions they have a higher zinc component. It could be they lower the zinc component that's why you're seeing those.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: That's what I've read.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Red burns. So, they have to get to the bottom and then come forward and share that and engage to the community because if not, you have situations like Market Basket. This is $4-billion supermarket chain and they fire the CEO, they technically could fire the CEO, the customers, the vendors, the entire chain shut down for 30 days to protest and say, bring back that CEO, we want them.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Strong, speaking of engagement, engaging the users. You've write in the drone.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: We did.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Speaking of engaging, aircraft is swerving to avoid a drone in South Jersey. Because we know that all of the anti-drone people are going to say, see, this is why you can't have drones, this is why you can't move for all of this.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: But, in essence it is actually a fair point. I mean, the pilot of a smaller aircraft basically almost had an accident with the drone.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes. You know, we have to deal with drones. Drones are reality.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: They're here.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Drones are very useful. This happens to be a drone with a camera right here in front could take pictures of real estate could be helpful to farmers, could be helpful to lots of different industry. This is not just for recreational use but actually for industrial use as well.</p><p/><p>So, drones are here and they offer a lot of value. The question is, how are we going to regulate them? Right now there is a lot of ambiguity around that. We need to find a way to both protect people's privacy and also have a way to have drone's out there.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: But now pretend that they don't exist. I saw an even crazier things which is somebody at the FAA is looking at this possibility...</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: ... drones so that drones it does not -- they can't fly above a certain air space. That to me seems crazier than just establishing the kind of channel.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: Right. Could you imagine that this is only the first generation like we're just scratching the surface.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: That's right.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: Can you imagine what is this going to look like in three months, in three years, or 30 years, talking about, you know, just thinking about the sophistication of it. So, obviously a regulation is extremely important whether it's in the form of geo fencing of figuring how to protect your area and your air space.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: I think is the big topic of the conversation.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: We know Amazon.com obviously lobbying hard...</p><p/><p>HIDARY: For prime add.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: ... to have a -- yes, just a sky highway.</p><p/><p>ZOLDAN: Right. And then you have paparazzi's now using drones as well to go in -- the question is, are you going to have a drone to drawn combat. Are you going to have some drones defending and other drones trying to look at.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: A new stage of video games.</p><p/><p>HIDARY: Exactly.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Jack Hidary, thank you so much. Ari Zoldan joining me there for a great conversation. Thank you both. We have a quick break to take. When we come back we were on top of it when it broke. Now it is literally broke. Find out how the hitchhiking robot made its way across all kinds of countries and then met its demise in the city of brotherly love.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Here are some of the top stories trending on foxbusiness.com. right now. Kraft recalling 36,000 cases of singles cheese. A few customers complained of choking on the plastic wrapping. It is the second recall for Kraft. In March, more than 240,000 packages of macaroni and cheese was recalled over worry that some boxes contained metal pieces.</p><p/><p>From food to autos, July sales strong on track with the industry yearly estimate. If current levels are maintained, sales will hit a 14-year high. Trucks and SUVs the most popular of this month. Ford saw the best July since 2006.</p><p/><p>And the CEO that cut his $1 million salary. So, all of his employees could have a minimum wage of $70,000 a year, seem hard times. The company is losing talents. They say the system rewards slackers and provides no incentives for innovation. The CEO is now renting out his house to make ends meet.</p><p/><p>For the latest on news and analysis, go to foxbusiness.com.</p><p/><p>Well, the Canadian built HitchBOT began its coast to coast trip on the U.S., that was July 17th. It made it all across Canada and Europe. But when it came to Philadelphia, the second leg of the trip beginning in Massachusetts, you can just track how it is there along with other landmarks.</p><p/><p>But you can see in the city of Brotherly Love, none at all. The hitchBOT was found destroyed on the side of the road just 300 miles into its U.S. trip.</p><p/><p>We are so glad you joined us here on Risk &amp; Reward.

This hour, Twitter at a record low.  We're  going to give you the takeover odds.  Microsoft investing $100 million in  Uber.  Why that spells trouble for Google.</p><p>And republican presidential candidate Jim Gilmore is the 17th to announce.   He's going to be joining me here to tell us why he is number one.  Risk &amp;  Reward starts now.  </p><p>Hackers can go after airplanes, cars, government data, corporate e-mail  like Sony.  Now, Chinese hackers may have hit the University of Connecticut  exposing thousands of student's social security and credit card details.   Fortalice CEO former White House CIO, Theresa Payton is with me now.   Theresa, I want to know, of course, how this happen, but why? Why the  University of Connecticut? Why students?</p><p>THERESA PAYTON, FORTALICE CEO:  Well, here is the thing.  The hackers have  realized, hey, where is the next treasure trove that I can go after that  might be a little easier to break into than the banks and some of the other  companies and industries that have been hit hard.  And they think, ah,  colleges and universities.</p><p>I can steal a research and I can steal everything about a student not just  their major, but if they've applied for financial aid, they have their  parent's information, the student's information.  All of the financial data  that they need to not only masquerade as the student, potentially also as  their parents who are on these forms.  </p><p>It sounds like they've been in there almost two years as well.  So, who  knows how much information the bad guys got away with this time? </p><p>BOLTON:  OK.  Now, the hack was discovered in March but probably happened  back in September 2013.  So, intruders had lot of opportunities to use data  that they stole.  Why did it take so long to pinpoint? </p><p>PAYTON:  Well, what's happening with the hackers they've changed tactics.   They're not as nosy as they used to be when they break-in and they don't  try and run out the door with all of the crown jewels at the same time.   They watch how the systems work, they watch how the system security works,  and then they will find different ways to try and sneak around that.  </p><p>They may have used credentials of legitimate employees at the university or  legitimate vendor credentials.  And they may have used that to actually  slip the data out the door -- just quietly and under sort of the guys of  legitimate credentials.  </p><p>We don't know because that investigation is still ongoing.  You know, the  other piece, too, is they may never be able to trust this network again.   The fact that they were in this long they can hide themselves in files, in  system files, the operating system, and they can actually be there and come  back time and time again.  So, it's going to be very difficult to get the  bad guys out of this network.</p><p>BOLTON:  OK.  Now, how do we know, Theresa, that it's China? </p><p>PAYTON:  We don't really know for sure until the investigation concludes.   And I always caution organizations when they say it's (AUDIO GAP) or Russia  or they pick a country to (AUDIO GAP).  Look, I can send traffic from any  country in the world that I want to so that you think the traffic is  originating in that country.</p><p>A lots of hackers know that China is in the forefront of discussions and so  they may be sending their traffic from China.  Until the forensics  continues and they look at different things like what was the native  language of the hackers? What types of tools and techniques did they use  because each one in the cyber syndicates kind of has their own fingerprint  method, if you will.  And that really has not happened yet.  And until it  does we don't know for sure that it was China.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, do you think we're just going to see more and more of these  kinds of attacks? </p><p>PAYTON:  Absolutely.  I think what every organization needs to realize --  if you are connected to the Internet and you have one piece of data that's  of value to hackers.  They will find a way to monetize it or use you as a  disguise to hack somebody else.  </p><p>These hacks are going to continue until we start taking matters into our  own hands.  For starters, these kids who are just starting their lives this  pivotal moment they have got to not just trust  on free credit reporting,  they have to freeze their credits.  </p><p>From a university standpoint, they want to be open minds open and trusting.   They have to go back and look at what's valuable information here and start  locking that off whether it's from vendors looking at user access controls.   They need to start locking up this data and every organization should take  a lesson from today and ask some critical questions of themselves, how safe  is our data and who might be after it? </p><p>BOLTON:  And we know that the engineering school helped you to discover it.   So, I guess more schools as well will be tapping in-house resources.   Theresa Payton, thank you as always.  Fortalice CEO, former White House  CIO.</p><p>Well, staying on the scene, less a week after the White House said, it  would not retaliate against China for hacking.  President Obama plotting to  take action.  This is according to The New York Times.  </p><p>Retired Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cowan with me now.  So, Colonel, why this  reversal of opinion and of action? </p><p>BILL COWAN, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST:  Probably a lot of pressure from  him, Deirdre.  About the fact that 22 million of people's information  private data got hacked including my own as a guy who used to have a  security clearance.  So, I think the White House -- a lot of pressure from  Congress, pressure from the public, the White House is deciding they have  to do something.  </p><p>At this point, they're thinking about doing something.  They haven't quite  said they will do anything.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, Colonel, China has maintained -- it did nothing.  I mean,  they've actually come out with a statement saying, \"It was not us.\" So,  what can the Obama administration really do? Will there will be a symbolic  response? Or will there be something a little bit more aggressive? </p><p>COWAN:  No.  I think it will be symbolic and vast because they don't want  to get in some kind of tit for tat.  A spot with the Chinese who have all - - as much leverage over us certainly as we do over them in the financial  sector, the business sector.  So, my guess is, excuse my term here, but  maybe we'll bitch slap them a little bit but we may not do much more than  that.</p><p>But the real thing, Deirdre, I believe is, when something like this happens  and the White House tried to pretend that China didn't do it -- I think  they knew almost from the outset that it was China.  When something like  this happens the only way we counter these kinds of things is fast,  aggressive, unquestionable response of the same nature of what they did to  us.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, I hear what you're saying.  In other words, we have to make it  uncomfortable for anyone attacking us.  So, at least they think twice about  doing it again.  </p><p>COWAN:  That's exactly right.  And you know what, as your previous guest  was just saying, it's the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians, it might be  some kid in the basement in Toronto who's learned how to make cyber-attack  on us.  But if we're not able to stand up decisively and firmly almost  immediately upon knowing who it was and do something to them, they are  going to continue to do this to us forever.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Colonel, we're so glad you're with us.  Bill Cowan joining us  there.  Retiring -- retired rather, lieutenant colonel there with us on  this very latest with cyber security.  </p><p>Well, speaking of tech but from a different aspect, Microsoft recent  investment part of why Uber has a valuation of more than $50 billion.</p><p>Doug MacMillan is here.  He broke the story for The Wall Street Journal.   So, Doug, Microsoft and Uber, are they new BFF? </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER:  Maybe not BFF as much as  they are business partners.  You know, Uber has been pushing to build its  own technology and its own maps.  And we've heard as part of the latest  financing round, they disclosed that they've been looking for big  technology partners to help them do that.  </p><p>Now, Microsoft is really not known as the cutting edge of maps but they are  one of the few large technology companies that does have assets and  expertise and engineers who are working on maps specifically in Bing  mapping division.  </p><p>Now, last month or actually in June, Uber announces it's acquiring some of  those Bing assets.  But apparently, Microsoft and Uber have also worked out  an arrangement where Microsoft is going to invest in Uber.  So, we don't  know if they're going to work together going forward but they're now  definitely partners with Microsoft owning a very, you know, a hard to come  by stake in Uber.  </p><p>BOLTON:  OK.  Hard to come by a stake in Uber.  You said a few things in  there.  I just want to know looking at it from Microsoft's angle, does it  somehow legitimize or show that Microsoft is in a current field especially  -- I don't know, I'm just thinking the Windows 10 upgrade or using yet, had  to be free because no one would pay for it.  So, does this bring Microsoft  back towards cutting edge companies? </p><p>MACMILLAN:  I wouldn't go that far.  But it definitely calls to mind, in  earlier Microsoft investment -- the former CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer,  invested in Facebook when that company was only at a $15 billion valuation.   That investment turned out to be very lucrative for Microsoft.</p><p>But with that stake, now being work something like $2.5 billion on its own.   So, perhaps Microsoft by investing in Uber could potentially have a good  financials when fallen also for its current Satya Nadella can make him kind  of look smart and look like he's connected to kind of one of the cutting  edge companies here in Silicon Valley.</p><p>BOLTON:  And this also challenges Uber, right? Because we know that Uber  made an initial investment in Uber back in the day.  But now Google has  also moving towards its own self- driving a cars, so it just seems like  Uber has to find another big tech partners that can write big checks.  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  Yes.  This is one of the most interesting stories about Uber.   As one of its earliest investors and closest partners is now also  increasingly looking like a competitor.  So, with Uber trying to  distance  itself more from Google, there is definitely an element of, you know, is  Uber taking money from Microsoft because of this \"enemy of my enemy is my  friend\" principle.  We don't know the story of that but definitely it's a  juicy story line.  </p><p>BOLTON:  All right.  Well, diplomacy important even among tech companies.   Doug MacMillan, thank you so much.  Great scoop for The Wall Street  Journal.  We want to bring you up-to-date with some breaking news </p><p>Debt ravage of Puerto Rico officially in default.  Moody is saying, you  paid $628,000 but that is a fraction of the 58 million that was due, that  is the default in our book.  So, Moody's is in fact saying that Puerto Rico  has defaulted and you do have of course, Puerto Rican officials saying, we  don't want to default, we do not want a debt spiral to start.  </p><p>We will bring you up-to-date with the very latest headlines and reaction.</p><p>In the meantime, tech billionaire Elon Musk warning against using robots in  the military.  But our next guest says he is making a big mistake.  We'll  tell you why.  </p><p>Plus, the first GOP presidential debate is on Thursday.  One of the  candidates is joining us tonight with his plan for America.  Stay tuned.     </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Here are some of the stories we are following for you at this  hour.  Twitter shares touching a record low as the company went public.   You'll recall November 2014, but shares plunged today and they are down  below $30 a share for the first time in more than a year.  Some say, this  makes it a takeover target.</p><p>President Obama unveiling a major climate change plan.  It aimed at large  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the nation's coal burning power  plants.  The EPA is estimating the plan would cost around $8.5 billion.  </p><p>Vice President Joe Biden has begun to actively explore a possible  presidential campaign.  The New York Times columnist reporting that Biden  had been holding meetings such as his residents about jumping in to  challenge Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire.  He could pose the  biggest threat of any democrat as the front runner to Hillary Clinton.  </p><p>U.S. oil worth noting here settling at 45.17 a barrel, the lowest in more  than four months.  Continuing a trend of a reduction of about 50 percent  since the fall.  </p><p>Well, the future of modern warfare is like any other industry, technology  will play a big role.  Last week, where than 1,000 researchers including  Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking signed a letter to the U.N. asking for a ban  on the development and use of autonomous weapons or killer robots.</p><p>My next guest says they will actually save lives.  The author of \"Ghost  Fleet,\" P.W. Singer with me now.  So, P.W., thanks so much for joining us.   Why do you disagree with those who signed the letter, those are some of our  best and brightest minds? </p><p>P.W. SINGER, \"GHOST FLEET\" AUTHOR:  I don't disagree with this sentiment  that they want it cause positive change in the world.  I think what I  disagree with is the idea of how effective this effort is going to be.  The  book that we did documents right now at least 21 different cases of working  on this kind of weaponry in the U.S. in China, et cetera.</p><p>And the reason the militaries are working on this is not because they think  it's cool, it's not because of, you know, some kind of terminator vision.   Because they think it's going to be useful.  And so, if this effort is  going to win out, this letter writing campaign it's going to have to  overcome the idea of use.</p><p>The other thing to mention here is of course, it's not just the military  that's working on robotics and autonomy, its private business.  Its  companies like Google and Amazon and the like.  And so, if it's playing out  in the civilian sector it's going to happen, it's going to move over in the  war too.  </p><p>BOLTON:  OK.  But how can we estimate or how can we make it so that only  the right armies -- this sound like a crazy question -- are building this  and not the wrong ones? I mean, who's the judge? </p><p>SINGER:  Well, I think you've just put your finger on the problem.  Every  single technology in history has been used for both good and bad whether  it's a stone or whether it's a drone.  With drone we've seen everything  from the U.S. military to ISIS fly to them.</p><p>I think what makes these technologies so challenging is that they have very  low barriers to entry right now.  And so, for looking at a future conflict  be it a small war or a big war with the China or Russia, all the different  players are going to have this technology.  And that's a very big  difference for the U.S. that weak for in Ghost Fleet.  Is what does it mean  to go on to a war where you're not a generation the head of the other side  in technology.</p><p>BOLTON:  And as for when we see this kind technology in the battlefield?  When is it? </p><p>SINGER:  Well, we're already seeing robotics in the battlefield right now.   You know, for example, in the war against the ISIS everyone from the U.S.  military to the Syrian military to ISIS itself have flown drones.  I think  if you're looking forward to the 2020s period, you're going to see  technology that's more and more autonomous.</p><p>And by that, I mean, not just the cars that we drive on highways or Amazon  delivery drones but also the drones that are out there in the battlefield.   And, you know, for example, the U.S. Navy has already tested out a drone  that took off and landed from an aircraft carrier on its own.  The toughest  human pilot task.  That of course is going to move into a future war.  </p><p>Same thing, China has three different long range strike programs that are  droned, that are not unmanned.  If we were to fight them they would be  using this kind of technologies.  So, the bottom line here is that, if  there was a World War, which we explore in this book, it would be one where  you'd see a mix of man and machine.</p><p>And of course, it's not just robotics systems in and of themselves.  It's  that the manned systems will become more robotic.  A lot like how we have  cars right now that can parallel park themselves.</p><p>The U.S. Navy is building a new warship...</p><p>BOLTON:  Right.</p><p>SINGER:  ... that it has about one-tenth the size of the crew in the past.   Because the war ship is so highly robotics.  </p><p>BOLTON:  P.W., glad to have you with us.  Thank you for sharing your  thoughts.  Great book.  P.W. Singer joining us there, he is the author of  \"Ghost Fleet.\"</p><p>Well, stock you saw in the red today.  We're going to look at the  correlation between earnings and performance.  SO, you had 65 companies in  the NASDAQ, 100 reporting.  Stocks swinging up or down at an average of  more 5 percent immediately after reporting results.  </p><p>All in the last three weeks, the highest volatility, if you like, on that  front since 2012.  </p><p>Bob Rice is here.  Managing partner at Tangent Capital, author of \"The  Alternative Answer.\" Bob, one minute on the clock.  Please explain  correlate.</p><p>BOB RICE, TANGENT CAPITAL MANAGING PARTNER:  So, correlation is a very  simple but very important concept.  You know, just free first to how  closely a given stocks movement track the movement of the larger index.  </p><p>And so, when you're in the period of high correlation, you can really think  of it like a flock of birds.  One bird turns a little bit they all turn a  little bit.  One turns dramatically they all turn dramatically.  The  opposite of that is when all stocks have different kinds they are in the  early minds and they act as you see here like a herd of cats instead.  </p><p>So, that's a low correlation environment.  And the reason this is important  is we seem to be transitioning from a high correlation to a low correlation  right now, and that matters.  Because over the last few years, frankly, it  hasn't made that much difference exactly which stocks you own because they  all acted alike.  They were highly correlated.  </p><p>We're moving now to a different period, (inaudible) correlation, you're  going to have to be a lot more careful about what's exactly in your  portfolio.  </p><p>BOLTON:  All right.  With 10 seconds to go, leave bulls and bears aside,  we're going to do cats and birds here.  But, Bob, most importantly, why is  this happening now? </p><p>RICE:  Well, I think it's because you're seeing peeling back of  quantitative easing than we were very cheap flooded with easy money, all  boats were...</p><p>BOLTON:  For nine years.</p><p>RICE:  Yes.  We're coming up with that tie.  Now, it's starting to be  different.  And you can see it very clearly in what you were saying in the  intro there.  Up until very recently it didn't really matter whether stock  beat its earnings estimate or disappointed.  It was still in the flock of  birds.  It behaves like the rest of the flock.  All of a sudden it matters  dramatically.  If you beat your earnings estimates you do way better than  the average.  If you disappoint you do way worse.  And that's what is  important for investors to start paying attention too.  </p><p>To see that the investor can do that.  </p><p>BOLTON:  The number one thing an inventor can do then going into this  environment.  Diversification I imagine.</p><p>RICE:  Well, yes.  But over diversification because now matters exactly  which ones you're in.  And so, you want to be in more concentrated higher  conviction portfolios and not so much super broad based ETFs and indexes.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Bob Rice, we thank you as always.  Bob Rice joining us there,  managing partner at Tangent Capital, also the author of \"The Alternative  Answer.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of volatility, the Greek stock market reopened for the first  time in five weeks.  It was a blood bath dropping more than 20 percent,  just a few minutes into the open, banking stocks hit the worst.  </p><p>With us now to discuss this kind of volatility, Jason Rosiak.  He is senior  managing director at Pacific Asset Management.  Jason, thanks for coming  in.</p><p>JASON ROSIAK, PACIFIC ASSET MANAGEMENT SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR:  Thank you  very much.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, we're just hearing from Bob Rice about correlation, perhaps  this breaks lots of volatility whether it's Greece, whether it's China,  whether it's Iran, there are certainly a lot of hot spots in the world.   What are you doing with your money?</p><p>ROSIAK:  Right now it's being at the core for a bottom's up firm.  So, one  of the things that we're looking at is corporate credit and the focus is on  fundamentals and coverage.  And so, with Greece right now, for instance,  the stock market was down by 16 percent today, challenging but that's just  an underlying risk associated with what's going on there in the volatility.  </p><p>BOLTON:  So, not the average person can as of this moment go out and buy a  Greek debt? But it sounds like you're saying for professional investors  this is an opportunity? </p><p>ROSIAK:  It's not for Greek debt but for corporate debt in the U.S. side.   So, what we do is we focus on bank loans.  And bank loans are floating  arrangements that usually general names that PetSmart, Chuck E.  Cheese,  those types of names that are U.S.-based focused yield anywhere between 3  to 6 percent.  The floating rates don't have to worry about duration risk.   And it's a noble...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  So, let's say the Fed moves in either September or December as fed  for the future are indicating.  What does this mean? </p><p>ROSIAK:  So, for this asset class which is nice, is not -- it doesn't have  duration.  So, therefore, it's dependent on the corporate underlying how  they react and how they fundamentally performed.  So, unlike other asset  classes that generally speaking, people use in  inflationary or high rising  rates environment whether it be you're sitting in tips or you're sit in  real estate or commodities, there is a lot of volatility there.</p><p>BOLTON:  OK.</p><p>ROSIAK:  In the taper tension you had commodities go down by about 4  percent, and TIPS go down by 7 percent, or as bank loans.  </p><p>BOLTON:  And TIPS, Inflation Protective Securities.</p><p>ROSIAK:  Correct.</p><p>BOLTON:  For those who do not follow as closely as you do.  The best idea  you've heard of in the past few weeks? </p><p>ROSIAK:  Best idea, we still like corporate credit.  We like triple B  investment-grade credit fairly these are amounts of spread involved there.   And it's better than owning interest-rate sensitive or commodities  sensitive type of assets.  </p><p>BOLTON:  All right.  Jason, come back.  We want to continue the  conversation another time.  Jason Rosiak joining me there.  Senior managing  director at Pacific Asset Management.  </p><p>When we come back, Uber may be recruiting your grandparents.  We are not  joking.  Older drivers may be safer drivers.  First though, former Governor  Jim Gilmore may have announced the 17th kisses.  He's going to end up as  number one.  He is my guest, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  There are 17 republican candidates running for president in 2016.   With us now the very latest contender, former Virginia Governor, Jim  Gilmore with us from D.C.</p><p>Governor, glad to have you with us.</p><p>JIM GILMORE, FORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR:  Thank you, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON:  You are entering a crowded GOP field.  What do you hope to gain  and why now? </p><p>GILMORE:  Well, I hope to gain the ability to turn the country around from  the decline that it's in, wherein a decline in our national security in our  safety of Americans and the American interests.  We're in a decline in the  economy.  The economy has never really recovered from the recession.  We're  really not doing well enough.</p><p>And I think I have the credentials in order to being turn this around.  All  my life I have fought on behalf of my state in my country.  I'm a United  States army veteran.  I was the chairman of the National Commission on  Terrorism for the United States.  I was the governor during the 9/11  attack.</p><p>I've been the governor of a state and band I stood had to deal with budgets  and create jobs and do things.  So, I've always been in a position I think  to really help this.  And right now I see a decline in America that I think  I can reverse.  </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Governor, I want to pick up on exactly what you just said,  this background as an army intelligence officer, we talked about cyber on  this program every single day.  What is the number one thing that could be  changed right now to better protect America? Does it need to hire more  engineers? What does the budget need to look like? How can we improve cyber  security of our businesses and our citizens right now? </p><p>GILMORE:  Well, we're going to have to recognize with presidential  leadership exactly the nature of the society we live in.  When I was the  governor I was known as the technology governor because I've really pushed  forward on all of our policies and programs and also cyber issues.</p><p>We have to recognize that opposition people really try to and do us right  now.  Look at the Chinese situation.  They've gone in now and invaded our  records with people who have security clearances and there's been an  absolutely no repercussions.</p><p>This is an example once again, of the decline of the United States because  of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy.  We need to make it that America is  back.  The best way to do that is to remove the sequester limits from our  defense department to get full or move forward once again in the  restoration of American strength.</p><p>And of course, that's going to require of the American economy. </p><p>BOLTON: So, to spend more on defense. If you could change one thing, let's  say, you're elected, what would you do the first order of business? </p><p>GILMORE: The first order of business is to restore the American economy.  Right now we are discouraging business. You heard Hillary Clinton actually  talk about trying to attack business in this country and income equality  and all those kinds of warm ball of marches kind of ideas.</p><p>What you have to do is to make a renewal once again of the free enterprise  system in this country. And that means that we have to actually to put in  policies that don't discourage investment but restoring investment in this  country. Investment means more productivity. More productivity means more  jobs. And more jobs means higher wages.</p><p>And we're not going to be able to have a real national security until we  restore the American economy to give a better quality of life of the  American people and a stronger economy to protect ourselves in this  dangerous world.</p><p>BOLTON: Governor, you used to be chairman as well of the Republican  National party, the republican National Committee. I want to ask you what  do you make of Donald Trump? There are so many pundits, so many republicans  who keep waiting for his campaign to run out of steam but it's not. Is he  what the American public wants? </p><p>GILMORE: I think that he's struck a nerve, a resentment, and anger in among  the American people. I thought about it a lot. I don't have any real  interest in that. What I have an interest in is actually making the country  better and responding to this anger and to this resentment with genuine  positive programs. </p><p>And that's what why I've talked to you about here today. If we put forward  a program that gives a tax cut to working Americans that combines all  business activity and charges at 15 percent tax rate, if we eliminate the  debt tax, our economists have told us that what that will do is get the  economy moving again. Get us up to growth over 4 percent, do something that  really create some dynamic excitement in this economy. </p><p>That's the kind of anger and resentment because people know that the people  in Washington are not doing anything to move the country forward. That's  why I think I'm qualified to do. That's what I want to achieve. I want to  reverse this decline from the Obama-Clinton policy, that's why I've entered  the presidential race. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Governor, we're glad to have you with us. Thank you for  the time. Former Virginia Governor and 2016 presidential candidate, Jim  Gilmore.</p><p>Well, will Trump maintain his number one spot? Tune in right after this  show at 6 p.m. Eastern Time sharp. Charles Payne has Fox's exclusive latest  poll numbers. </p><p>When we come back, though Twitter getting crushed, some say it is a live  takeover target. We're going to give you a short list of would-be buyers.</p><p>But first, Uber is announcing a partnership with the AARP to recruit older  drivers. We'll talk about the fact whether it a PR sons or a real business  initiative.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Twitter shares closed at the all-time low. Jack Hidary is here. He  is the former CEO of Dice.com. Ari Zaldan is here as well. The CEO of  Quantum Networks. Welcome to you both.</p><p>JACK HIDARY, FORMER DICE.COM CEO: Great to see you.</p><p>BOLTON: Great to see you. So, is Twitter in play? Aye (ph) or nay? </p><p>HIDARY: Twitter is in trouble.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>HIDARY: Twitter does not know where it's going. It's headless, stateless,  does not have a leader right now, there's no captain of the ship. And also  it doesn't know what it's doing because it is a 300 million monthly active  users has not grown effectively in two years.</p><p>BOLTON: And to you point, there is no CEO, I mean, jack Dorsey is there,  one of the original founders but he had said...</p><p>HIDARY: But he's also the CEO of Square. Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. I mean, it's clear that he is a part-time or transitional. So,  $30 actually per share is a number that I saw a lot of analysts come up  with it and say, you know what, this starts to look cheap enough for  someone to buy. What is your take?</p><p>ARI ZOLDAN, QUANTUM NETWORKS CEO: Right. Yes. I think $30 is a great buy. I  don't think it's cheap but I think it's a good buy. And I think to push  back a little bit, they will get a CEO and I think they're get a really  good CEO. The question is when. But you're right. Right now it's sort of in  between times. So, I think there's a lot of questions out on the street. </p><p>HIDARY: But when the CEO comes the question is, what's their strategy,  right? What kind of practice is it? Why is it not growing even though every  show, including this one, talks Twitter all the time. </p><p>BOLTON: Well, I think it's great for journalist and I love it. I'm an  addict. I say that openly, but it's true that if you're not in media and  you're not reading I don't know why you would do if you're not in this  field. </p><p>HIDARY: SO, WhatsApp is growing, Snapchat is growing by leaps and bounds.  Yet, twitter just remains flat. So, there is a real crisis in terms of how  do you grow this. You can't grow. You're not going to grow revenues and  profit either.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. And of course, you know, as you say, Facebook hot on the heels  with its own app. Uber is partnering with AARP. I don't know if you saw  that Simpsons clip there. But is this idea the older drivers are safer  drivers? PR, real business strategy, what do you think? </p><p>ZOLDAN: No, real business. It's real and I think it's great. You know, it's  not cutie. I think it's very real. You have a million Uber rides per day, a  160,000 drivers out there on behalf of Uber. And you have a demographic  that's older, a lot of them are unemployed but they're also great drivers.  So, it's a perfect strategic fit.</p><p>BOLTON: Jack, over there.</p><p>ZOLDAN: This is part of a larger trend which is, people is going to be  driving their own cars less and less. This is going to be major calamity in  terms of the car. Rental companies in terms of giving car sales. </p><p>BOLTON: Well, Uber even started that leasing arm. Did you see that?</p><p>HIDARY: That's right.</p><p>BOLTON: So, they probably are even anticipating exactly what you're saying. </p><p>HIDARY: Yes. So, they need more drivers. They're looking for pools and  demographic. The drivers will agree, this is going to be a great  demographic for them to grow into. They're going to have to get two to  three million rides per day. They need more drivers to get there. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Speaking of more driving. At least in New York City that  means less walking which makes me think of the maybe shaking up its fitness  requirements saying, you know what, if you're strong you can be a little  heavier, if you can still do the work you're supposed to do basically you  don't care.</p><p>HIDARY: Well, you know, this is a fundamental shift from one or twice a  year checking in a physical, right? That's the way we've always thought  about health and health checking. We go for the physical, annual physical  in a nay it's been twice a year to now continuous modeling.</p><p>So, this is a Fitbit tracker right here. Other people use the Apple watch,  of course. The navy is choosing the Fitbit tracker right now to give it to  their sailors and say, hey, 24/7, let's actually get a general bigger  picture sense of how you're doing health wise and that of course connect  with the phone which gives you all those metrics and data. That's what  they're looking for, the overall messaging of the data not just once a year  physicals. </p><p>ZOLDAN: Yes. I happen to be but I think this stuff is great. And it's also  an accessory. I think it has part of a lifestyle obviously. And look, you  know, I'm not a good case study for you're an authorize (ph) than I am. But  I think I agree checking in once or twice I don't it's going to do. I think  this technology is great but I think an overall lifestyle change for the  navy I think would be a good move. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Here hear. There we go. Hold those thought. We're going  to take a quick break. We'll be right back with Jack and Ari. Of course, we  just want to let you know, there is some breaking news here on GM ignition  switch death and injuries now totaling 398 faulty ignition switches  responsible for at least 124 deaths, 274 injuries.</p><p>This is a according to a fund set up to compensate victims. The fund just  finished processing these papers. More than 4,000 claims it had received by  the January 1st deadline. Those numbers just being released now.</p><p>When we come back, actress Jessica Alba's sunscreen customers are getting  burnt. What her response means for her clients and her competitors.</p><p>First stuff, an app that makes your next set of eyeglasses much easier to  get. We will introduce you to the CEO who has seen the future in 2020.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: More than 75 percent of adults in the U.S. use some form of vision  correction. Opternative is trying to make getting contacts or glasses  easier, users' take an online exam. They receive a prescription within 24  hours off from their homes.</p><p>Co-founder and CEO Aaron Dallek is with me now. So, Aaron, do people get  equally accurate results as going to an eye doctor's office? </p><p>AARON DALLEK, OPTERNATIVE CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Yes. They do. Opternative is  clinically proven to be statistically equivalent to the traditional  refractive eye exam done in the doctor's office. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. Now, you're located in 27 states and counting. What was that  process like to get approved in each state? </p><p>DALLEK: So, we worked with our lawyers and we've registered with the FDA.  And we've made sure that we follow all the regulations in all of the states  and we've hired ophthalmologists licensed in all of these states to make it  so that we can practice in these states. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Warby Parker is a big online eyeglass brand. It's kind  of like Tom shoes but for glasses. Do you see that company as competition? </p><p>DALLEK: Warby Parker is a great online retailer and one of many that we  hope to partner with in helping your customers and helping our customers  get glasses using our test. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, you see them more as a complementary service versus being  an outright competitor. I do know that your service requires computer and a  Smartphone. So, you have plans to target under serve or impoverished areas,  maybe people in places that don't have tablets that are ready? </p><p>DALLEK: Yes. Absolutely. We're looking to make our technology available to  as many people as possible make it available so proctors can help people  who can't go through the exam on their own, help people in other countries,  help people in the U.S. who under served. So, it's very important part of  our business.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Now as far as protecting the data we know medical  information among the most personal, how high on your list is privacy? </p><p>DALLEK: Security is a top priority. We are officially HIPA compliant and we  use top level enterprise security to insure all of our patient data is  secure and encrypted at every level. </p><p>BOLTON: Aaron, we're glad to have with us. Thanks for joining us. Aaron  Dallek, he is the Opternative co-founder and CEO. </p><p>When we come back, Jessica Alba is feeling the heat. Some of her  sunscreens, some customer say, they're getting burned. Spells opportunity  for competing brand. And the city of brotherly love apparently not so love  being to the treatment of a hitchhiking robot. We will give you the  details.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Jessica Alba on its company getting burned for its sunscreen.  Customers taking to social media claiming that the ecofriendly cream  doesn't work. Jack Hidary back with me now as of Ari Zoldan. So, are social  media sites Twitter, Instagram, anything else just becoming the new yelp,  the new consumer reports? </p><p>HIDARY: You know, in this age of Internet transparency is number one. You  have to be transparent. You could be led by a superstar, you could be led a  great show, it doesn't matter. You need to be super transparent with your  customer base. </p><p>BOLTON: We're looking at these kids who are sunburned.</p><p>HIDARY: Oh, my, God.</p><p>BOLTON: And I mean, even more...</p><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: ... sort of when it's a child you think like, ah.</p><p>HIDARY: The hospitality as you know as well from trip adviser, right. You  get two or three bad reviews in trip advisory, your hotel, your airlines,  your resort could be done for it. And so, many industries now are very  responsive because of social media and because of side trip advisor, that's  now coming to the consumer price as well. </p><p>BOLTON: But I hear what you're saying she named the company honest, so she  set a higher bar for her. </p><p>HIDARY: Exactly. And there's good present for that. Look at honesty very  successful but they had to go against Snapple, a much bigger company using  the transparency. The same thing with Canbar (ph). Canbar is so successful  today in part because of its transparent packaging literally saying we will  tell you what's inside.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>HIDARY: The other guys -- exactly. The other guys are concealing what's  inside. So, there is a lot of good precedent for going with honest concept  but then you have to live up to it. </p><p>BOLTON: Ari, what is your take?</p><p>ZOLDAN: And you have to be -- right. And you have to be honest about it. </p><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Yes, I agree with Jack. I think today the fact that every one that  has an Internet connection means everyone has a voice for every products  and every service that they buy. So, you know, they become either an  advocate or proponent, you know, for the actual product.</p><p>BOLTON: So, if you're with crisis management for the Honest company, what  would you tell her right now? </p><p>ZOLDAN: I think she has to be forward. She has to honest about it just like  come after whether she was in actually -- if she was intimately involved  with the process or not. And I think she has to be very outspoken about it.  And I think that the media especially the public I think they appreciate  that that. </p><p>HIDARY: Yes, I agree. They maybe and she was in the zinc component right  now.</p><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p>HIDARY: So, if you look at other kinds of, you know, honest oriented suntan  lotions they have a higher zinc component. It could be they lower the zinc  component that's why you're seeing those.</p><p>BOLTON: That's what I've read.</p><p>HIDARY: Red burns. So, they have to get to the bottom and then come forward  and share that and engage to the community because if not, you have  situations like Market Basket. This is $4-billion supermarket chain and  they fire the CEO, they technically could fire the CEO, the customers, the  vendors, the entire chain shut down for 30 days to protest and say, bring  back that CEO, we want them.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Strong, speaking of engagement, engaging the users.  You've write in the drone.</p><p>HIDARY: We did.</p><p>BOLTON: Speaking of engaging, aircraft is swerving to avoid a drone in  South Jersey. Because we know that all of the anti-drone people are going  to say, see, this is why you can't have drones, this is why you can't move  for all of this.</p><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: But, in essence it is actually a fair point. I mean, the pilot of a  smaller aircraft basically almost had an accident with the drone. </p><p>HIDARY: Yes. You know, we have to deal with drones. Drones are reality.</p><p>BOLTON: They're here.</p><p>HIDARY: Drones are very useful. This happens to be a drone with a camera  right here in front could take pictures of real estate could be helpful to  farmers, could be helpful to lots of different industry. This is not just  for recreational use but actually for industrial use as well. </p><p>So, drones are here and they offer a lot of value. The question is, how are  we going to regulate them? Right now there is a lot of ambiguity around  that. We need to find a way to both protect people's privacy and also have  a way to have drone's out there. </p><p>BOLTON: But now pretend that they don't exist. I saw an even crazier things  which is somebody at the FAA is looking at this possibility...</p><p>HIDARY: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: ... drones so that drones it does not -- they can't fly above a  certain air space. That to me seems crazier than just establishing the kind  of channel.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Right. Could you imagine that this is only the first generation  like we're just scratching the surface.</p><p>HIDARY: That's right.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Can you imagine what is this going to look like in three months, in  three years, or 30 years, talking about, you know, just thinking about the  sophistication of it. So, obviously a regulation is extremely important  whether it's in the form of geo fencing of figuring how to protect your  area and your air space. </p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>ZOLDAN: I think is the big topic of the conversation.</p><p>BOLTON: We know Amazon.com obviously lobbying hard...</p><p>HIDARY: For prime add.</p><p>BOLTON: ... to have a -- yes, just a sky highway.</p><p>ZOLDAN: Right. And then you have paparazzi's now using drones as well to go  in -- the question is, are you going to have a drone to drawn combat. Are  you going to have some drones defending and other drones trying to look at.</p><p>BOLTON: A new stage of video games.</p><p>HIDARY: Exactly.</p><p>BOLTON: Jack Hidary, thank you so much. Ari Zoldan joining me there for a  great conversation. Thank you both. We have a quick break to take. When we  come back we were on top of it when it broke. Now it is literally broke.  Find out how the hitchhiking robot made its way across all kinds of  countries and then met its demise in the city of brotherly love.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Here are some of the top stories trending on foxbusiness.com. right  now. Kraft recalling 36,000 cases of singles cheese. A few customers  complained of choking on the plastic wrapping. It is the second recall for  Kraft. In March, more than 240,000 packages of macaroni and cheese was  recalled over worry that some boxes contained metal pieces.</p><p>From food to autos, July sales strong on track with the industry yearly  estimate. If current levels are maintained, sales will hit a 14-year high.  Trucks and SUVs the most popular of this month. Ford saw the best July  since 2006. </p><p>And the CEO that cut his $1 million salary. So, all of his employees could  have a minimum wage of $70,000 a year, seem hard times. The company is  losing talents. They say the system rewards slackers and provides no  incentives for innovation. The CEO is now renting out his house to make  ends meet. </p><p>For the latest on news and analysis, go to foxbusiness.com.</p><p>Well, the Canadian built HitchBOT began its coast to coast trip on the  U.S., that was July 17th. It made it all across Canada and Europe. But when  it came to Philadelphia, the second leg of the trip beginning in  Massachusetts, you can just track how it is there along with other  landmarks. </p><p>But you can see in the city of Brotherly Love, none at all. The hitchBOT  was found destroyed on the side of the road just 300 miles into its U.S.  trip. </p><p>We are so glad you joined us here on Risk &amp; Reward.

Deirdre Bolton gets us out  of this. Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST: All right. Melissa and David.  Thank you so much. We have breaking news to bring you here right away. A  senate IRS targeting report has been released. My colleague, Gerri Willis,  has been on the story. So, Gerri, what is the latest?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GERRI WILLIS, THE WILLIS REPORT SHOW HOST: So, Deirdre, that's right. We  just got report moments ago. And here is what we're finding the big take  away, the IRS was delinquent in providing effective control, guidance and  direction in the processing of those tax-exempt application for 501-c3  status. That's what we're learning tonight. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And let me tell you, the report describes the culture within the IRS Exempt  Organizations Unit. We had no idea how dysfunctional it was. Listen to  this. Top management was never aware of five year delays in some of the  processing at some of these organizations applications. </p><p>In addition to that, people within the unit were improperly trained. They  didn't know the kind of material they were looking at, what they were  supposed to do, what the law regarding tax-exempt organizations was  supposed to be. There was in siding. People were managing folks were  halfway across the country, 2,000 miles away, that made it more difficult.</p><p>In addition to that, there were people who worked from home four days a  week, and it was difficult to get all the information flowing.  This made  it possible for Lois Lerner because she was very liberal in her outlook on  life, it made it possible for her to have her political point of view  represented and that's exactly what happened here, according to this  report.</p><p>They surveyed 1.5 million documents and 32 interviews with IRS employees,  staff and others. </p><p>BOLTON: So, Gerri, quick question here, I mean, as far as the staff views,  what are, for example, republicans saying to this because many feel like,  OK, some of the groups that are even right of center were clearly targeted. </p><p>WILLIS: That's right. And as you know, the president recently said they  were not.  But this report says, yes, they were. That the IRS systemically  selected tea party groups for targeting, and as I said, Lois Lerner had a  big role in this. Orrin Hatch today saying that he found evidence, and he  is the chairman of this committee that the administration's political  agenda guided the IRS actions; they're calling this gross mismanagement.</p><p>When you read the details of how the section was run, Deirdre, I don't  think there's a company you cover in technology that is run that way. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. And as you said, the president, this could go all the way up to  a PR problem for President Obama. </p><p>WILLIS: Well, the big question of course has been, has this targeting been  directed from the White House? Even though Orrin Hatch concludes that  that's what was happening, I saw none of it in the report. </p><p>So, we're still waiting to see if that's in fact the case, and that's the  big takeaway question so many people have at this time. But let me tell  you. Tonight, the Senate Finance Committee painting a picture of complete  disarray in this exempt organizations unit.</p><p>And I have to tell you, it sounds like they weren't just delinquent and  ineffective at controlling and guiding their employees, they didn't know  what they were supposed to be doing, it sounds like. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. Gerri, we are going to depend on you for updates. In the  meantime, thank you very much for bringing us breaking news on that Senate  Finance Committee report. </p><p>I want to get you to the markets because stocks close higher but  essentially went nowhere. If you look at the levels, oil prices slid. We  want to get you down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Lori  Rothman is there. Lori, what stood out to you about today's session?  </p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, the hundred-point  rally we had early fizzling certainly stood out. So, both said and done the  Dow is down 10 points to close at 17,540. You hit the nail with that  decline in oil prices. So, it looks like four days the down days for the  Dow. </p><p>The NASDAQ did post gains, about 34 points by the close. Lot of that had to  do with finally a turnaround in shares of Apple. Apple shares up 6/10 of a  percent, up for the first time in five days, down 14 percent still since  April. </p><p>We've been talking about the massive amounts of market value. Apple's given  up about $100 billion in that time period. Disney was another weight on the  Dow, 24 hours later after disappointing earnings report, disappointing  revenue to be exact. Apparently, people are cutting the cord, so the cable  business is of serious concern. </p><p>Disney also warning of mysterious dollar hit, $500 million hit next year to  the company because of our strong U.S. dollar. Twitter shares also hit a  new low today. A lot of speculation who will be the new CEO and when that  person will be appointed. Off almost 3 percent in the regular session. Also  Rico reported that Google, an acquisition by Google of Twitter is highly  unlikely. </p><p>After the bell, we just heard the latest earnings from Tesla, the electric  carmaker shares down around. They've been as low as 8 percent in the after- hours which is better than expected report. But here is the problem, Elon  Musk, CEO, lowered vehicle sales expectations. </p><p>He did promise 55,000 electric vehicles sold this year and he lowered that  mark, 50 to 55,000. So, that pretty much sums up the day, Deirdre. I'll  send it back over to you.</p><p>BOLTON: Lori, thank you so much. I'm going to pick up right where you left  off on Tesla. Lori just told you beat on the top and the bottom lines. But  this big question, can Elon Musk's company develop and deliver 55,000 cars,  you heard her say. It seems like not.</p><p>I want to bring in the president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo,  Jon Rettinger. So, Jon, first and foremost, what do you make of the  earnings, we'll talk about production in a minute. </p><p>JON RETTINGER, TECHNOBUFFALO PRESIDENT AND EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Sure. So, I  think people were disappointed by not hitting the sales number at 55,000  numbers. Numbers has been touted. We're supposed to have the model x this  year, the model x kept getting delayed. Now we're hearing we're going to  have it start shipping toward the end of the year. </p><p>But we heard blames of making sure that they were -- the partners were  going to be able to ship on time. And I think we're losing about 10 percent  of your total estimated sales is a big hit for the company. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. It certainly is indeed. And I mean, what do you make of Tesla,  right? Tesla is supposed to be next generation in Siri. We have Elon Musk  touting it as bigger, better, faster, stronger, but, I mean, other car  companies can meet their production standards?  </p><p>RETTINGER: Yes. So, Tesla is one of those companies that is being led by a  modern-day Steve Jobs. You have this reality extortion field. People love  the company but it follows no sense of logic with how the stock goes. I  want them to hear a few things that we didn't get from the earnings call. </p><p>Tesla has taken over 29,000 orders for the model x but has given no  estimation when its designs is going to go live. Cars are going to ship in  a few months. We don't even know what they've ordered at this point. I  would like to hear more about their power low, their home battery solution.  We don't know much about that. </p><p>Tesla has been promising autonomous drive called autopilot in the model x.  We're hearing very little about that other than it's been delayed. So,  there are a lot of question marks for the company, not to mention the  specter of their model 3, the affordable BMW 3 killer supposed to hitting  sometime in 2017. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. And, Jon, I mean, I know you are a fan, you have you driven  one, you have come on the show and talked about it. What does it mean for  the future? How much does it hurt Tesla to have this missed delivery for  the 55,000 cars?  </p><p>RETTINGER: If they deliver the Model X as expected and the car comes out to  the rave reviews that the Model S had, than almost 100 consumer reports  rating, it's not going to hurt the company long-term at all. But that is a  big but. </p><p>Every delay for the model X makes the expectations for that much higher. If  there is one problem with that car, if there's a battery explosion or  battery leak, it's going to spell big potential trouble. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Jon, thanks so much for your input. Jon Rettinger  joining us there, president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo.</p><p>Switching gears puts on regulated energy theme, President Obama going all- out over the next several weeks to build support in Congress for a nuclear  deal. Take a listen to a speech that he gave at American University.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: Congressional rejection  of this deal leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to  preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option. Another war  in the Middle East. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Joining me now is Phil Flynn, senior market analyst for the Price  Futures Group, also author of The Energy Report. So, Phil, we have  alternative energy to talk about, traditional as well, I'd like to start  with that, what do you think of the president's remarks?  </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP SENIOR MARKET ANALYST &amp; THE ENERGY REPORT  AUTHOR: Well, I think, you know, once again, the president is saying my way  or the highway. You know, if you look at how he always flames the debate.  It's either my way or we're going to have a war, there's no other  alternative. And that's not true. </p><p>You know, the truth is that there are many other alternatives. Number one,  for example, continuing the sanctions on Iran. They seem to be working  pretty darn well. That's what brought Iran to the table. But the president  always seems to do this. He always sees his vision is the only right one,  anybody who disagrees with him is the bad guy. </p><p>They don't understand. They want a war. And the truth of the matter is  there are other options, there's not just two. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, as far as that goes, Iran, top six in the world's largest  crude oil producers, what is the effect if this deal goes through this  nuclear deal on the oil market? </p><p>FLYNN: Well, I think we should look at both sides of it. First of all, if  it goes through, obviously we're going to be giving Iran what, $58 billion?  You know, maybe some of that is going to go into their energy industry to  try to bring that back online. </p><p>Maybe some of it will go to terrorism. You know, who knows? Because they  are the biggest state sponsored country of terrorism. But let's look at the  other side. What if Congress doesn't do this deal? What if they reject this  deal? And the president is saying, hey, guess what, guys, if you don't get  this deal, we're going to war.</p><p>What is it going to do to the cost of oil? It may cause a price spike  because the markets are going to believe the president and they are going  to be afraid that a war is going to be just around the corner. So, it could  do a lot of damage, you know. So, I think it's dangerous the way this  debate is being framed. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Phil, we'll be checking in with you, I'm sure over the  next few weeks. Phil Flynn joining us there, senior market analyst for the  Price Futures Group, author of The Energy Report, with us there from  Chicago.</p><p>Stocks as you know, you heard from Lori, closing off their highs. Apple has  had a volatile few days, Bank of America today cutting its price target  from 142 to 130, changing the recommendation from a buy to a neutral. </p><p>Jason Rotman with me now. He is president of Lido Isle Advisors. He is a  bull. Mark Luschini joining me, a chief investment strategist at Janney  Montgomery Scott. He is an apple bear. Welcome to you both. Jason, would  you buy at these levels? It seems like, yes. </p><p>JASON ROTMAN, LIDO ISLE ADVISORS PRESIDENT: Absolutely. Absolutely,  Deirdre. I mean, the thing is, I would buy and I would continue to buy. In  other words, dollar cost average if the price continues to go down. Here's  one major reason, OK? </p><p>This is what is not really being talked about a lot, for whatever reason, I  don't know. 73 percent of the installed user base of Apple still has not  upgraded to the latest models. So, Apple is basically still crushing it in  my humble opinion, and 73 percent of the people still have not upgraded. </p><p>So, I think at the end of the day, it's going to be a Merry Christmas, it's  going to be a happy Hanukkah, it's going to be a happy holiday season for  Apple. I think now is the time to -- now is the time to buy on the dip.</p><p>BOLTON: Mark, I know you disagree. Again, what are you most worried about  with Apple? We know as far as hand set sales in China, Apple is number  three, behind Xiaomi and Huawei. Is this your concern or is it something  else? </p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Well,  it's really two things in terms of my concern. Now, one fundamental and one  technical. On the fundamental front, it's one of the things you just  mentioned, and that is of course China, in the slowdown there. And  obviously with the meltdown in equity prices, the impact on the wealth  affect there among Chinese consumers. </p><p>On the U.S. front or at least phone sales front is more to do with the fact  that perhaps the new disciplined consumer is less likely to upgrade to that  new iPhone 6 if they've had a recent iPhone 5 purchase. And as a  consequence, may continue to defer that purchase. From a technical  standpoint, we've seen no less than three previous time to the price points  reaching that 130 to $134 level that the price has been turned away. </p><p>And this was the most recent one which in our view, was going to lead to  potential irritation in the share price. Ultimately, it turned out to be  worse. We turn back our position in the portfolio to $125 about two weeks  ago and we stayed sidelined for the time being. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. Mark, point well made. Jason, I know as you said, you're still  a buyer. Where does Apple go from here? What other tricks fundamentally  does it have up its sleeve? Is it Apple TV? Are there certain products that  you think will be catalysts?  </p><p>ROTMAN: Yes. That's a really great question. And really I'm going to  respond with two major points. Number one, technically, Apple has fallen  below its 200-day moving average, 17 times only since the past 30 to 60  days to rebound above it, I think this is going to be no different.  </p><p>Now, to answer your question from a fundamental standpoint. We're coming in  to a holiday season. Again, 73 percent of the people have not upgraded yet.  I adamantly disagree with the fact or the theory that people are less  likely to upgrade from 5 to 6, I don't think that makes any sense. </p><p>People are going to need to upgrade and Apple is a brilliant marketing  company, they're going to have a  huge holiday season. I think now is the  time to buy for that reason alone. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. We will leave it there. We thank you for your time for  your insights.</p><p>ROTMAN: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Jason Rotman joining us there. Mark Luschini as well. We thank you  both.</p><p>When we come back, democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee calling on Tim Cook  of Apple to release employee diversity data. Our next guest says Silicon  Valley companies are being unfairly targeted on this issue.</p><p>Then you may be out of luck because of Suck. Forget your credit score?  According to a new Facebook patent filed. Your Facebook friend's credit  scores could keep you from borrowing money. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Some of the stories we're following for you right now. Debris,  including part of an aircraft wing, is confirmed to be from the missing  Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane. It has been more than a year since the plane  disappeared with 239 people on board.</p><p>The FBI is investigating the security of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail  server. This is the one that she used when she was Secretary of State. The  probe comes days after watchdogs from the state department and the  intelligence community asked the Justice Department to explore whether or  not classified material was improperly shared or stored on the e-mail  account. </p><p>Security regulators are approving a final rule that requires public  companies to disclose the ratios between annual comp of CEO's and median  pay of employees. As you see, consider this change for years, it is finally  here.</p><p>And Representative Barbara Lee, a democrat from California calling on tech  companies including Apple to release federal data on diversity of their  workforces. Lee was in Silicon Valley this week turning up the heat on the  tech community to hire more African-Americans.</p><p>Well, last spring, the tech community did sneak into release details on the  demographics of its employees. Yahoo, Google, LinkedIn among the first to  publish stats. One of the reasons they did, a push from our next guest. </p><p>Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr. is with me now. He is an instrumental voice in  this push for diversity. He is with me on the phone. Reverend, so glad  you're with us. You have encouraged tech companies to share more  information, calling on Congress to backup that call. Why is it so  important for all of these companies to share their data in your view? </p><p>JESSE JACKSON SR., RAINBOWPUSH COALITION FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT: Hey, Deirdre.  A lot of these employers are in our country. They're the fastest growth  industry and they've been from the government and upon consumers. </p><p>We're not sending out Apple sending them out of the top 25 from 189 board  members, 36 women were African-American, we have Latinos. And just to last  year, about Twitter 49 blacks men, 16 Latinos, Facebook, 1600 employees,  140 blacks, just 7 blacks from the west different employees. </p><p>Twitter, I mean, Yahoo have 6,000 employees, 138 are black. So, it's not a  pretty picture. </p><p>BOLTON: It's not a pretty picture. And even Nancy Lee, and I'm going to  look at my notes here, reverend, to read the quote, \"Google's director of  people operation told the San Jose Mercury news last spring. When we look  around at the industry, we think we're doing OK, but it is not something we  want to tout.\"</p><p>In your view, what is the number one most practical way that you think that  tech companies can improve? How can they reach out to different  communities, and therefore, recruit with a wider net?  </p><p>JACKSON SR: With the set goals, targets and timetables, almost the least  accepted federal standard, these comes as CEO 1 and contract compliance  laws are very important. The government then land for them to file the  yield 1 report. It's just that we should publish again as what they have  come in the last year. </p><p>But they all have a great difference of people's color from their boards  and the women. In the six weeks I went three steps with it, unlike three  blacks and three Latinos, employment is around 2 percent. And I think that  enforcing laws of fair practices for these companies is important. </p><p>BOLTON: Reverend, is it more important to have diversity in the rank and  file, or is it more important in management to set an example? </p><p>JACKSON SR: Well, both examples, both of the employers, there are qualified  people at every level. They spend more time looking for each one of the  workers from India, from Asia, than training young people right here at  home. And that's a big piece of consideration. </p><p>There is no talent deficit. There is an6 opportunity deficit. And besides  each of those etiquette which we advocate very much at RainbowPush and  engineers, the biggest employee base is now in take. </p><p>It's ad agencies, it's marketing. It's non-tech workers, that they are  hovering around 2 percent in those categories. Some of them from the exempt  from any other obligation, they stand up to what's just and fair. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. Well, we're glad to have your thoughts on that. Reverend Jesse  Jackson Sr., joining us there from the RainbowPush Coalition.</p><p>Our next guest takes an opposite view. Kevin Jackson is with me now. He's a  former management consultant to some of the world's largest companies. He  is with me now from St. Louis. </p><p>So, Kevin, what about this argument that the best people have to be found  and perhaps there's just ways to get more people in that original pool?  </p><p>KEVIN JACKSON, FORMER MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, first of  all, everything Jesse Jackson just said is nonsense. The fact of the matter  is, it's people like him that aren't getting qualified blacks jobs because  if you're going to hire a black person, you got to understand you're  bringing Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, the Department of Justice, the EEOC,  the Department of Labor, and everybody else with you to that job. So,  that's issue number one. And issue number two...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BOLTON: Just to stop you there, Kevin, what do you mean by that? That in  other words, one employee has too much baggage to even focus on his or her  job hunt?  </p><p>JACKSON: That's exactly right. If you hire a white kid, that white kid  can't do anything, he can get racist e-mails, calling him cracker or  anything else he wants. And he can't do anything. He can go HR, and all he  can do is just -- they'll laugh together, but they won't have a lawsuit. </p><p>But let a black kid get anything or black person at a company, have  anything that isn't even related to him, and you've got everybody Jesse  Jackson, and everybody coming to the fore to try to profiteer because  that's what's happened in American's business. American business...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: So, Kevin, essentially you're saying if employers are unwilling or  less willing to hire minorities because they're afraid of potential  lawsuits, in case something goes wrong?  </p><p>JACKSON: Absolutely. And they won't tell you that but that's a fact. And  then the other part of it about what Jesse Jackson is looking at. He gave  you all kinds of statistics about how many blacks, how many women, how many  browns, or whatever. </p><p>How about we focus on how many people are truly qualified for jobs. The  fact is, Google, Yahoo, and everybody he said will hire the best person if  they're pink, if they're purple, if they're striped. They don't care. And  that's the problem that Jesse Jackson has in waging a lawsuit against these  people.</p><p>It's he knows they want the best people. It's the companies that allow this  gangster type of mentality to occur that says you've got to have a certain  number of blacks, whites, or whatever. I want qualified people. Business  wants qualified people and they don't want the racial strife that comes  with Jesse Jackson and his ilk. So, that's all that America is looking for. </p><p>BOLTON: So, Kevin, to your point, the H1-B Visas that he referenced and  that is to say, that allows U.S. companies to reach out and keep students  who are here from India, China, or Russia, wherever, there are 3 to 4  million jobs that go unfilled every month in the U.S. because there is a  dearth of either math or engineering or science skills. So, maybe that's  where we start is more with education? </p><p>JACKSON: Well, the fact of the matter is, if Google, the best people are in  the United States, I guarantee you, Google, Yahoo, Apple and all those  companies want them. They will do a job fair, they don't care what those  people look like, what they sound like, they will translate for them.  They'll do whatever it takes to get the best employees.</p><p>And if there's 3 million H1-B 1's contrary to what Obama or Jesse Jackson  or the race pimps tell you, they will hire them and those people are  waiting because they're the best employees. And that's the problem is the - - the education system in America is not producing the best employees  anymore. </p><p>Instead, what we're doing is we're coddling people. We're saying, hey, use  this EEOC guidelines and all this other nonsense that business -- that  doesn't further business. Use those guidelines to get people hired but  don't hire the best. That's why those jobs are unfilled. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Kevin Jackson, good clear view. We're so glad to have  you with us. Joining us there from St. Louis.</p><p>So, when we come back, Facebook, your friend's credit, well, they could  affect your own. A patent just filed has our next guest second-guessing his  friend requests.</p><p>And Lexus, finally unveiling video of a prototype of a hover board. Social  media is questioning its authenticity. Weigh in, tell us. Is it real? Is it  Fake? You can tweet to us @deirdrebolton, to me directly or to the show  @riskrewardfbn.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Next time you want to loan your Facebook friends may be important,  more important than the papers you give to the bank. Social network filed  for a new patent that would allow creditors to assess your creditworthiness  based on the credit ratings of the people in your social network.</p><p>John Ulzheimer is with me now. He is CreditSesame.com president of consumer  education. John, first and foremost, what do you make of this idea? What if  I was a musician and my former career, now I'm an investment banker, but if  my creative friends are still broke, I'm penalized?  </p><p>JOHN ULZHEIMER, CREDITSESAME.COM PRESIDENT: Well, the challenge that you  face is that there's this hypothesis in the world of social media/risk  management that birds of a feather tend to flock together. </p><p>And if you have a large or disproportionate number of friends or  connections on social media that indicate that they're high risk, then the  likelihood of you being high risk, again, in their hypothesis is going to  be much more likely, and therefore they may actually consider that when  determining whether or not to do business with you and under what terms. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. But maybe times have changed, right? And I want to play  for you, John, we had Mark Luschini as a guest. He's a co-founder of  PayPal. Here's what he told me about the new credit environment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Credit  works fairly well for established consumers' financial products. But if  you're a young person fresh off the college bench, you're about to move tax  brackets most likely. And the FICO score looks back and says, well, you  know, just hold it up there. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, in that sense, we know that Mark Luschini with a firm is  actually loaning money to people with computer science degrees and other  indicators, that even if they don't have money at that time, they will have  it. </p><p>ULZHEIMER: Yes, that's right.  And it's a very good point. The CSPV defines  those people as the invisible. Meaning that they don't have any sort of  established credit history, other than probably some student loans and  maybe some collections from their former apartment complexes. </p><p>And it's true that credit scoring systems are much more effective when you  have a long history, a robust credit history to look back onto determine  whether you're going to be a subsequent risk going forward than the smaller  the credit report. </p><p>And if you have no credit report, lenders still want to do business with  you. And so, that's when they were going to start looking for the secondary  and tertiary types of data sources to determine whether or not to do  business. </p><p>Look, your Facebook score is never going to replace your Equifax credit  report and your advantage score and your FICO score and your Transunion  credit report, simply isn't going to do it. </p><p>But, where it can be very effective is, for example, my niece who is about  to graduate from school, probably has very little credit history and is  going want to lease an apartment, is going to want to buy a car, is going  to buy a house someday. </p><p>And to penalize her because she has no robust credit history, without  perhaps, looking how quality her connections are on Facebook. It seems to  be a little bit unfair and actually can work in someone's favor. This isn't  always going to work against somebody, it can actually work in your favor  in many instances.  </p><p>BOLTON: All right. John, great to have you with us. I should mention as  well, Facebook, other big tech companies they filed for patents that they  don't use, maybe this is just filing to file it.</p><p>When we come back, Disney's stock dropping more than 9 percent. Netflix  going to an all-time high, a new media battle is brewing. </p><p>My panel guest will tell you which companies as they think will come out on  top. Netflix also announcing a one year paid paternity leave and maternity  leave for all employees, will other companies follow suit? We'll talk about  it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: The first republican presidential debate of 2016 tomorrow night on  Fox News. Donald Trump is the most successful candidate, if you measure by  social media reads. Speaking of the Donald, some people say the number who  watch the debate may, in fact, top the final episode of Trump's last  celebrity apprentice. </p><p>With me now from Cleveland where the debate will take place is Blake  Burman. So, Blake, what's Trump saying ahead of the big night?  </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Believe it or not, Deirdre, Donald  Trump is actually lowering expectations a bit. You just mentioned that  \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" the final episode of the last show had six million  viewers, a little more than that. </p><p>Some feel the debate here tomorrow night could actually top that. For a  little bit of perspective context there, the first primary debates of 2011,  four years ago, were about half that, but they didn't have the Trump  factor. Why so many people will be tuning in tomorrow night. </p><p>Still, though, Donald Trump lowering expectations talking about how he is  not a debater at all while these politicians as he calls them are. I want  you to take a little listen real quick to what he told Trish Regan this  afternoon about lowering those expectations, here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to set the bar so low, I  want to set that bar so low, you have you no idea. But we'll see what  happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: So, he said, we'll see what happens. He talked about lowering the  bar, laughing it off a little bit. We'll see what happens tomorrow night.  Donald Trump did say earlier today as well as he has last night that he  wants to approach this debate in a civil manner. But he also said, Deirdre,  if he's attacked, he would fight back. We'll see when that happens. </p><p>BOLTON: Yes. I was going to say...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURMAN: Who that happens thought in, how Donald Trump has thought.</p><p>BOLTON: ... yes. That seems like likely as in scale of 10 out of 10.</p><p>BURMAN: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Blake Burman joining me there from Cleveland, Ohio. Thank you very  much, Blake. </p><p>Well, for more on tomorrow's GOP debate, social media power, Matt Witheiler  from FlyBridge Capital Partners is here, as is Russ Frushtick, the  editorial director at  Product Hunt. Glad to have you both here. </p><p>So, what do you think about this debate? Let's just talk about it from a  media perspective, perhaps a number of viewers outpacing \"The Apprentice\"?  </p><p>MATT WITHEILER, FLYBRIDGE CAPITAL GENERAL PARTNER: Isn't really that  surprising? I mean, everybody I know who's going to watch and is playing  some form of drinking game involving Trump at some point. So, I think that  it actually will be a ratings boon for Fox. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. And, Russ, from a social media perspective, you heard  him say, I want to lower expectations so much.</p><p>RUSS FRUSHTICK, PRODUCT HUNTS EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: So, do you think he knows he's going to bomb but he's still just  counting on Twitter, Facebook and the rest for his messages? </p><p>FRUSHTICK: Well, first of all, he's being very humble. I mean, that's what  a good politician should lower expectations before a debate and then they  come out and make a big splash, I think he'll definitely do that here.  Whether it's a successful splash, helping his campaign, I don't know, but  he certainly has a lot of social media power. </p><p>BOLTON: He does indeed. I mean, and he has this sort of upwards of 23  percent reach, you know, the next candidate is Jeb Bush, around 12 percent.  So, love him or hate him. His message and his quote and quote, \"Authentic  brand,\" seems to be resonating even with some of it is ironic. </p><p>WITHEILER: Yes. I think that's right. I think he's going to drive a big  audience, whether you are for him or against him. It's really bringing  everybody to the table for this debate. </p><p>And so, they will be a tell-tale performance for him, and that will he be  able to convince people who, historically, have been anti-Trump to come on  his side of the camp it. And it will really depend on how he performs.  </p><p>BOLTON: Speaking of branding, going a little bit bigger, Disney versus  Netflix. If you had to put money on either one, who's your dog in the race?  </p><p>FRUSHTICK: Disney. Absolutely Disney.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>FRUSHTICK: I mean, Netflix is a good company and has a good product. Disney  is in it for the long haul. If you're look for a long-term investment,  they've been building these franchises like \"Star Wars\" and Marvel for the  last 10 years. </p><p>BOLTON: Yes. But they pay for that, I mean, it's like $4 billion a pop, $4  million a pop, sorry. </p><p>WITHEILER: Yes. No, that's exactly right. It's very expensive but at the  same time, they are getting a huge return for that. Because that content  that they produced is undistributed on Netflix. And so, when you think  about shows like \"Daredevil,\" which is a Marvel property which is owned by  Disney that's on Netflix, Disney is kind of taking revenue from one pocket  which is the network content pocket and paying it over to Netflix. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. Netflix also announcing an unlimited year of maternity and  paternity leave, essentially they also have unlimited vacation. But  essentially saying, listen, we trust you to be professional. You know what  time you can take and when. To me this spoke of the talent war?  </p><p>FRUSHTICK: It is part of it. I think another part of it is the -- this sort  of a very obvious strategy in the Silicon Valley space where it's like, oh,  you have unlimited time to take off, so people generally are very  conservative with how they use their time. </p><p>If you have three weeks, you're going to take three weeks. So, I think this  might be a good PR win for them, but also maybe a little bit of  gamesmanship in terms of how people use their maternity leave. </p><p>BOLTON: Right. In other words, nobody really wants to take more than his or  her peer, right?  </p><p>WITHEILER: Yes, I think that's right. And I think that from a PR  perspective, what it's really doing is it's winning Netflix a lot of points  with the millennial generation who wants culture and work life balance. And  Netflix doesn't want to lose employees because recruiting a new employee is  much harder and more expensive than retaining somebody. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Hold those thoughts. We're going to continue the  conservation. I'm going to be back with Matt and Russ in just a little bit  of time.</p><p>Allegations of overpricing, social media activists calling whole foods out  again. This time, though, for something as overpriced and zany as what  you're looking at right now on your screens.</p><p>And with two million views already on YouTube, Lexus's new hover board  getting a lot of publicity. Is it real? Tell us what you think. Tweet to us  @deirdrebolton, @riskrewardfbn.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Chances are you have engaged with Taboola's content before. The  platform recommends editorial and sponsored articles across many highly  trafficked web sites. The goal? Help publishers monetize their content  while creating a personalized experience for the user.</p><p>Co-founder and CEO, Adam Singolda is with me now. Adam, glad to have you  with us. </p><p>ADAM SINGOLDA, TABOOLA FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Thanks for having me. </p><p>BOLTON: I have often heard your company described as a search engine in  reverse? Is that accurate?  </p><p>SINGOLDA: Yes, I think it is. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. And for what reason, how does it work, how does it make what I  consume better targeted for me? </p><p>SINGOLDA: So, you know, I started the company eight years ago living with  my parents and trying to watch TV and I couldn't find anything to watch.  And I thought, you know people should not be looking for TV shows, TV shows  should be looking for me. </p><p>And I started the company, you know, with the vision to connect people with  content they may like they never knew existed, which is in reverse to what  you do with a search engine when you know exactly what you want to read. </p><p>So, with us, information hopefully it's finding you before you knew you  were supposed searching for it. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. And as far as my data, what happens? How do you find me?  </p><p>SINGOLDA: So, we work with some of the biggest media companies in the  world. From USA Today that we're announcing today, Gannett, Business  Insider, and many, many others. And at the bottom of the article do you  know how you usually see other articles you may like. We do that which  allows us to see what decisions are making when they finish consuming the  content.</p><p>BOLTON: So, in theory, it also gives sellers of products or services better  information on how and who to target? </p><p>SINGOLDA: Right. So, we're looking at all the information that's out there  definitely. You know, all the media companies we're working with and we're  trying to -- there are millions of different options trying to unless they  second decide what are the two or three things you may like and never knew  existed. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Now, mobile is so important right now. I know you have,  as you referenced here, the deal with Gannett, how does it all fit  together?  </p><p>SINGOLDA: So, in general, what we're announcing today is it's exciting in  two ways. On the one side from the business perspective, we're announcing  that we expect to generate between 45 to $55 million in the next three  years to come with Gannett and USA Today. </p><p>And the second one which is perhaps even more exciting is where with the  industry is going where you buy. You know, I started the company eight  years ago thinking personalization is the difference between me and you,  and I think that was wrong.</p><p>If you think about the way you consume the web, think about when you wake  up in the morning and you drink your coffee on the big screen, how do you  behave consuming the news versus if you're on your way with your mobile  from a Facebook app, how is that different? </p><p>So, we envision the web, the future of the web to be sort of a dragon with  many, many heads. Whereby each head is an experience -- a different  experience of the web that is telling not only to me but to me right now. </p><p>BOLTON: To the activity that you're currently doing.</p><p>SINGOLDA: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: It makes all the sense in the world. Congratulations on the deal  with Gannett. We're glad to have you with. Adam Singolda joining me there.  He is the co-founder and CEO of Taboola.</p><p>If you build it, they will come, that seems to be the device and mantra.  We're going to show you the new plans for the tallest residential tower in  the world.</p><p>And then, asparagus grows after allegation of overpricing, social media  activists now accusing whole foods of selling $6 asparagus water. Find out  how the company reacted, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Elon Musk is saying that storage, the battery business could  generate, quote, \"A few billion dollars in 2017.\"</p><p>I am back right now with Matt Witheiler and Russ Frushtick. Thanks, guys,  for staying with me. So, what do make, we know that as far as the Tesla and  deliveries of cars, Elon Musk missed the target. But he's saying, wait,  wait, wait, there's my battery business, it's going to rocket. Yea or nay,  what do you say? </p><p>FRUSHTICK: Yes, I agree that there is more life there. You definitely don't  want to get into a fight where you're fighting against manufacturing and  the other big companies getting into this electronic -- electric car space.  But, you know, that's the issue, like they haven't been hitting their  numbers. So, it's not the best production. </p><p>BOLTON: Matt, we know that engineers do not hold these metrics against Elon  Musk. Almost anyone in the tech community that I speak with would lie down  in traffic for him because they say he puts his money where his mouth is.  OK, finally, sometimes he makes mistakes on numbers but the spirit is in  the right place? </p><p>WITHEILER: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: It that good enough for investors?</p><p>WITHEILER: I think it's good enough for its employees, it's good enough for  investors that the price of which Tesla had priced that. Big question in my  mind. It's easy to point to a shiny new object in battery business don't be  distracted by the actual numbers in cars, but it's very speculative in my  mind. </p><p>BOLTON: Yes, because the stock is already up, something like 30 percent  year-to-date. So, if you're an investor you do want something back for  that. All right. Speaking of a different kind of fuel, whole foods  apparently, selling asparagus water, which was essentially three stocks of  asparagus in a jar colored asparagus water. </p><p>This is supposed to be just in one store brand with California. But  hopefully it's really has this PR issues, price gouging nationwide, they're  not the only shop I should say to be facing this. Is this more  disappointing because hopefully this somehow supposed to be pure? </p><p>FRUSHTICK: I guess that's only their brand. They want to portray this pure  brand. But like, it also doesn't tell to surprise us. Every time I go to  the supermarket there is another crazy fruit and like a jar, oh, it's carry  water now.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. You will live to be 700 years old if you drink this. Matt,  what is your take?</p><p>WITHEILER: Yes, exactly. Didn't you drink it this morning...</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, there you go.</p><p>WITHEILER: ... before you even go to work? Now, I think that given the  problems that whole foods has had in New York with the Attorney General  here in allegations of  price kind of manipulation on how much they were  charging for products, this did not comment a good time for whole foods.</p><p>That being said, I'm pretty sure this was a prank and whoever is  responsible probably won't take it too long.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: And I look the company's response. If you think something is not  been weighed properly, just bring it back. We were joking, right?</p><p>WITHEILER: Exactly.</p><p>BOLTON: Like here's my half donut that should have been weighed or...</p><p>WITHEILER: My half drinks asparagus water.</p><p>BOLTON: There you go, there you go. Power and health to us all. Thank you  both for joining me there. Matt Witheiler, a general partner joining us  from FlyBridge Capital Partners, Russ Frushtick, editorial director at  Product Hunts.</p><p>Well, move over Marty McFly because Lexus introducing a real hover board.  So, they say, tweet us now. Tell us, real or fake, @deirdrebolton  @riskrewardfbn. What do you think?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Some of the top stories trending right now at foxbusiness.com.  Target, Walmart, 7-Eleven soon may have less junk at checkout counters.  Center for Science and the public interest calling for the removal of those  items because they cause obesity and can lead to diabetes. Fruits,  vegetables, and granola bars are suggested replacement. </p><p>On the health theme, Fitbit reporting its first quarterly numbers as a  public company. Wearables tech company earnings soaring. The company is  selling 4.5 million devices this quarter, up nearly three million from the  prior year. </p><p>And, Connecticut, the nation's most expensive place to die. New probate  fees resulting in relative receiving bills of up to a million dollars last  week to settle the estate of their loved one. </p><p>Well, speaking of transitions, we do want to let you know that \"Back to the  Future 2,\" made some people dream of a real hover board. Lexus is saying it  did. Take a look at this video, releasing a full video of pro-skate  boarder. They say it's real.

Deirdre Bolton gets us out of this. Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST: All right. Melissa and David. Thank you so much. We have breaking news to bring you here right away. A senate IRS targeting report has been released. My colleague, Gerri Willis, has been on the story. So, Gerri, what is the latest?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GERRI WILLIS, THE WILLIS REPORT SHOW HOST: So, Deirdre, that's right. We just got report moments ago. And here is what we're finding the big take away, the IRS was delinquent in providing effective control, guidance and direction in the processing of those tax-exempt application for 501-c3 status. That's what we're learning tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And let me tell you, the report describes the culture within the IRS Exempt Organizations Unit. We had no idea how dysfunctional it was. Listen to this. Top management was never aware of five year delays in some of the processing at some of these organizations applications.</p><p>In addition to that, people within the unit were improperly trained. They didn't know the kind of material they were looking at, what they were supposed to do, what the law regarding tax-exempt organizations was supposed to be. There was in siding. People were managing folks were halfway across the country, 2,000 miles away, that made it more difficult.</p><p>In addition to that, there were people who worked from home four days a week, and it was difficult to get all the information flowing. This made it possible for Lois Lerner because she was very liberal in her outlook on life, it made it possible for her to have her political point of view represented and that's exactly what happened here, according to this report.</p><p>They surveyed 1.5 million documents and 32 interviews with IRS employees, staff and others.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Gerri, quick question here, I mean, as far as the staff views, what are, for example, republicans saying to this because many feel like, OK, some of the groups that are even right of center were clearly targeted.</p><p>WILLIS: That's right. And as you know, the president recently said they were not. But this report says, yes, they were. That the IRS systemically selected tea party groups for targeting, and as I said, Lois Lerner had a big role in this. Orrin Hatch today saying that he found evidence, and he is the chairman of this committee that the administration's political agenda guided the IRS actions; they're calling this gross mismanagement.</p><p>When you read the details of how the section was run, Deirdre, I don't think there's a company you cover in technology that is run that way.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. And as you said, the president, this could go all the way up to a PR problem for President Obama.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, the big question of course has been, has this targeting been directed from the White House? Even though Orrin Hatch concludes that that's what was happening, I saw none of it in the report.</p><p>So, we're still waiting to see if that's in fact the case, and that's the big takeaway question so many people have at this time. But let me tell you. Tonight, the Senate Finance Committee painting a picture of complete disarray in this exempt organizations unit.</p><p>And I have to tell you, it sounds like they weren't just delinquent and ineffective at controlling and guiding their employees, they didn't know what they were supposed to be doing, it sounds like.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Gerri, we are going to depend on you for updates. In the meantime, thank you very much for bringing us breaking news on that Senate Finance Committee report.</p><p>I want to get you to the markets because stocks close higher but essentially went nowhere. If you look at the levels, oil prices slid. We want to get you down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Lori Rothman is there. Lori, what stood out to you about today's session?</p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, the hundred-point rally we had early fizzling certainly stood out. So, both said and done the Dow is down 10 points to close at 17,540. You hit the nail with that decline in oil prices. So, it looks like four days the down days for the Dow.</p><p>The NASDAQ did post gains, about 34 points by the close. Lot of that had to do with finally a turnaround in shares of Apple. Apple shares up 6/10 of a percent, up for the first time in five days, down 14 percent still since April.</p><p>We've been talking about the massive amounts of market value. Apple's given up about $100 billion in that time period. Disney was another weight on the Dow, 24 hours later after disappointing earnings report, disappointing revenue to be exact. Apparently, people are cutting the cord, so the cable business is of serious concern.</p><p>Disney also warning of mysterious dollar hit, $500 million hit next year to the company because of our strong U.S. dollar. Twitter shares also hit a new low today. A lot of speculation who will be the new CEO and when that person will be appointed. Off almost 3 percent in the regular session. Also Rico reported that Google, an acquisition by Google of Twitter is highly unlikely.</p><p>After the bell, we just heard the latest earnings from Tesla, the electric carmaker shares down around. They've been as low as 8 percent in the after- hours which is better than expected report. But here is the problem, Elon Musk, CEO, lowered vehicle sales expectations.</p><p>He did promise 55,000 electric vehicles sold this year and he lowered that mark, 50 to 55,000. So, that pretty much sums up the day, Deirdre. I'll send it back over to you.</p><p>BOLTON: Lori, thank you so much. I'm going to pick up right where you left off on Tesla. Lori just told you beat on the top and the bottom lines. But this big question, can Elon Musk's company develop and deliver 55,000 cars, you heard her say. It seems like not.</p><p>I want to bring in the president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo, Jon Rettinger. So, Jon, first and foremost, what do you make of the earnings, we'll talk about production in a minute.</p><p>JON RETTINGER, TECHNOBUFFALO PRESIDENT AND EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Sure. So, I think people were disappointed by not hitting the sales number at 55,000 numbers. Numbers has been touted. We're supposed to have the model x this year, the model x kept getting delayed. Now we're hearing we're going to have it start shipping toward the end of the year.</p><p>But we heard blames of making sure that they were -- the partners were going to be able to ship on time. And I think we're losing about 10 percent of your total estimated sales is a big hit for the company.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. It certainly is indeed. And I mean, what do you make of Tesla, right? Tesla is supposed to be next generation in Siri. We have Elon Musk touting it as bigger, better, faster, stronger, but, I mean, other car companies can meet their production standards?</p><p>RETTINGER: Yes. So, Tesla is one of those companies that is being led by a modern-day Steve Jobs. You have this reality extortion field. People love the company but it follows no sense of logic with how the stock goes. I want them to hear a few things that we didn't get from the earnings call.</p><p>Tesla has taken over 29,000 orders for the model x but has given no estimation when its designs is going to go live. Cars are going to ship in a few months. We don't even know what they've ordered at this point. I would like to hear more about their power low, their home battery solution. We don't know much about that.</p><p>Tesla has been promising autonomous drive called autopilot in the model x. We're hearing very little about that other than it's been delayed. So, there are a lot of question marks for the company, not to mention the specter of their model 3, the affordable BMW 3 killer supposed to hitting sometime in 2017.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. And, Jon, I mean, I know you are a fan, you have you driven one, you have come on the show and talked about it. What does it mean for the future? How much does it hurt Tesla to have this missed delivery for the 55,000 cars?</p><p>RETTINGER: If they deliver the Model X as expected and the car comes out to the rave reviews that the Model S had, than almost 100 consumer reports rating, it's not going to hurt the company long-term at all. But that is a big but.</p><p>Every delay for the model X makes the expectations for that much higher. If there is one problem with that car, if there's a battery explosion or battery leak, it's going to spell big potential trouble.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Jon, thanks so much for your input. Jon Rettinger joining us there, president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo.</p><p>Switching gears puts on regulated energy theme, President Obama going all- out over the next several weeks to build support in Congress for a nuclear deal. Take a listen to a speech that he gave at American University.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: Congressional rejection of this deal leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option. Another war in the Middle East.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Joining me now is Phil Flynn, senior market analyst for the Price Futures Group, also author of The Energy Report. So, Phil, we have alternative energy to talk about, traditional as well, I'd like to start with that, what do you think of the president's remarks?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP SENIOR MARKET ANALYST &amp; THE ENERGY REPORT AUTHOR: Well, I think, you know, once again, the president is saying my way or the highway. You know, if you look at how he always flames the debate. It's either my way or we're going to have a war, there's no other alternative. And that's not true.</p><p>You know, the truth is that there are many other alternatives. Number one, for example, continuing the sanctions on Iran. They seem to be working pretty darn well. That's what brought Iran to the table. But the president always seems to do this. He always sees his vision is the only right one, anybody who disagrees with him is the bad guy.</p><p>They don't understand. They want a war. And the truth of the matter is there are other options, there's not just two.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, as far as that goes, Iran, top six in the world's largest crude oil producers, what is the effect if this deal goes through this nuclear deal on the oil market?</p><p>FLYNN: Well, I think we should look at both sides of it. First of all, if it goes through, obviously we're going to be giving Iran what, $58 billion? You know, maybe some of that is going to go into their energy industry to try to bring that back online.</p><p>Maybe some of it will go to terrorism. You know, who knows? Because they are the biggest state sponsored country of terrorism. But let's look at the other side. What if Congress doesn't do this deal? What if they reject this deal? And the president is saying, hey, guess what, guys, if you don't get this deal, we're going to war.</p><p>What is it going to do to the cost of oil? It may cause a price spike because the markets are going to believe the president and they are going to be afraid that a war is going to be just around the corner. So, it could do a lot of damage, you know. So, I think it's dangerous the way this debate is being framed.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Phil, we'll be checking in with you, I'm sure over the next few weeks. Phil Flynn joining us there, senior market analyst for the Price Futures Group, author of The Energy Report, with us there from Chicago.</p><p>Stocks as you know, you heard from Lori, closing off their highs. Apple has had a volatile few days, Bank of America today cutting its price target from 142 to 130, changing the recommendation from a buy to a neutral.</p><p>Jason Rotman with me now. He is president of Lido Isle Advisors. He is a bull. Mark Luschini joining me, a chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. He is an apple bear. Welcome to you both. Jason, would you buy at these levels? It seems like, yes.</p><p>JASON ROTMAN, LIDO ISLE ADVISORS PRESIDENT: Absolutely. Absolutely, Deirdre. I mean, the thing is, I would buy and I would continue to buy. In other words, dollar cost average if the price continues to go down. Here's one major reason, OK?</p><p>This is what is not really being talked about a lot, for whatever reason, I don't know. 73 percent of the installed user base of Apple still has not upgraded to the latest models. So, Apple is basically still crushing it in my humble opinion, and 73 percent of the people still have not upgraded.</p><p>So, I think at the end of the day, it's going to be a Merry Christmas, it's going to be a happy Hanukkah, it's going to be a happy holiday season for Apple. I think now is the time to -- now is the time to buy on the dip.</p><p>BOLTON: Mark, I know you disagree. Again, what are you most worried about with Apple? We know as far as hand set sales in China, Apple is number three, behind Xiaomi and Huawei. Is this your concern or is it something else?</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Well, it's really two things in terms of my concern. Now, one fundamental and one technical. On the fundamental front, it's one of the things you just mentioned, and that is of course China, in the slowdown there. And obviously with the meltdown in equity prices, the impact on the wealth affect there among Chinese consumers.</p><p>On the U.S. front or at least phone sales front is more to do with the fact that perhaps the new disciplined consumer is less likely to upgrade to that new iPhone 6 if they've had a recent iPhone 5 purchase. And as a consequence, may continue to defer that purchase. From a technical standpoint, we've seen no less than three previous time to the price points reaching that 130 to $134 level that the price has been turned away.</p><p>And this was the most recent one which in our view, was going to lead to potential irritation in the share price. Ultimately, it turned out to be worse. We turn back our position in the portfolio to $125 about two weeks ago and we stayed sidelined for the time being.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Mark, point well made. Jason, I know as you said, you're still a buyer. Where does Apple go from here? What other tricks fundamentally does it have up its sleeve? Is it Apple TV? Are there certain products that you think will be catalysts?</p><p>ROTMAN: Yes. That's a really great question. And really I'm going to respond with two major points. Number one, technically, Apple has fallen below its 200-day moving average, 17 times only since the past 30 to 60 days to rebound above it, I think this is going to be no different.</p><p>Now, to answer your question from a fundamental standpoint. We're coming in to a holiday season. Again, 73 percent of the people have not upgraded yet. I adamantly disagree with the fact or the theory that people are less likely to upgrade from 5 to 6, I don't think that makes any sense.</p><p>People are going to need to upgrade and Apple is a brilliant marketing company, they're going to have a huge holiday season. I think now is the time to buy for that reason alone.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. We will leave it there. We thank you for your time for your insights.</p><p>ROTMAN: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Jason Rotman joining us there. Mark Luschini as well. We thank you both.</p><p>When we come back, democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee calling on Tim Cook of Apple to release employee diversity data. Our next guest says Silicon Valley companies are being unfairly targeted on this issue.</p><p>Then you may be out of luck because of Suck. Forget your credit score? According to a new Facebook patent filed. Your Facebook friend's credit scores could keep you from borrowing money.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Some of the stories we're following for you right now. Debris, including part of an aircraft wing, is confirmed to be from the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane. It has been more than a year since the plane disappeared with 239 people on board.</p><p>The FBI is investigating the security of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. This is the one that she used when she was Secretary of State. The probe comes days after watchdogs from the state department and the intelligence community asked the Justice Department to explore whether or not classified material was improperly shared or stored on the e-mail account.</p><p>Security regulators are approving a final rule that requires public companies to disclose the ratios between annual comp of CEO's and median pay of employees. As you see, consider this change for years, it is finally here.</p><p>And Representative Barbara Lee, a democrat from California calling on tech companies including Apple to release federal data on diversity of their workforces. Lee was in Silicon Valley this week turning up the heat on the tech community to hire more African-Americans.</p><p>Well, last spring, the tech community did sneak into release details on the demographics of its employees. Yahoo, Google, LinkedIn among the first to publish stats. One of the reasons they did, a push from our next guest.</p><p>Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr. is with me now. He is an instrumental voice in this push for diversity. He is with me on the phone. Reverend, so glad you're with us. You have encouraged tech companies to share more information, calling on Congress to backup that call. Why is it so important for all of these companies to share their data in your view?</p><p>JESSE JACKSON SR., RAINBOWPUSH COALITION FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT: Hey, Deirdre. A lot of these employers are in our country. They're the fastest growth industry and they've been from the government and upon consumers.</p><p>We're not sending out Apple sending them out of the top 25 from 189 board members, 36 women were African-American, we have Latinos. And just to last year, about Twitter 49 blacks men, 16 Latinos, Facebook, 1600 employees, 140 blacks, just 7 blacks from the west different employees.</p><p>Twitter, I mean, Yahoo have 6,000 employees, 138 are black. So, it's not a pretty picture.</p><p>BOLTON: It's not a pretty picture. And even Nancy Lee, and I'm going to look at my notes here, reverend, to read the quote, \"Google's director of people operation told the San Jose Mercury news last spring. When we look around at the industry, we think we're doing OK, but it is not something we want to tout.\"</p><p>In your view, what is the number one most practical way that you think that tech companies can improve? How can they reach out to different communities, and therefore, recruit with a wider net?</p><p>JACKSON SR: With the set goals, targets and timetables, almost the least accepted federal standard, these comes as CEO 1 and contract compliance laws are very important. The government then land for them to file the yield 1 report. It's just that we should publish again as what they have come in the last year.</p><p>But they all have a great difference of people's color from their boards and the women. In the six weeks I went three steps with it, unlike three blacks and three Latinos, employment is around 2 percent. And I think that enforcing laws of fair practices for these companies is important.</p><p>BOLTON: Reverend, is it more important to have diversity in the rank and file, or is it more important in management to set an example?</p><p>JACKSON SR: Well, both examples, both of the employers, there are qualified people at every level. They spend more time looking for each one of the workers from India, from Asia, than training young people right here at home. And that's a big piece of consideration.</p><p>There is no talent deficit. There is an6 opportunity deficit. And besides each of those etiquette which we advocate very much at RainbowPush and engineers, the biggest employee base is now in take.</p><p>It's ad agencies, it's marketing. It's non-tech workers, that they are hovering around 2 percent in those categories. Some of them from the exempt from any other obligation, they stand up to what's just and fair.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Well, we're glad to have your thoughts on that. Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr., joining us there from the RainbowPush Coalition.</p><p>Our next guest takes an opposite view. Kevin Jackson is with me now. He's a former management consultant to some of the world's largest companies. He is with me now from St. Louis.</p><p>So, Kevin, what about this argument that the best people have to be found and perhaps there's just ways to get more people in that original pool?</p><p>KEVIN JACKSON, FORMER MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, first of all, everything Jesse Jackson just said is nonsense. The fact of the matter is, it's people like him that aren't getting qualified blacks jobs because if you're going to hire a black person, you got to understand you're bringing Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, the Department of Justice, the EEOC, the Department of Labor, and everybody else with you to that job. So, that's issue number one. And issue number two...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Just to stop you there, Kevin, what do you mean by that? That in other words, one employee has too much baggage to even focus on his or her job hunt?</p><p>JACKSON: That's exactly right. If you hire a white kid, that white kid can't do anything, he can get racist e-mails, calling him cracker or anything else he wants. And he can't do anything. He can go HR, and all he can do is just -- they'll laugh together, but they won't have a lawsuit.</p><p>But let a black kid get anything or black person at a company, have anything that isn't even related to him, and you've got everybody Jesse Jackson, and everybody coming to the fore to try to profiteer because that's what's happened in American's business. American business...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: So, Kevin, essentially you're saying if employers are unwilling or less willing to hire minorities because they're afraid of potential lawsuits, in case something goes wrong?</p><p>JACKSON: Absolutely. And they won't tell you that but that's a fact. And then the other part of it about what Jesse Jackson is looking at. He gave you all kinds of statistics about how many blacks, how many women, how many browns, or whatever.</p><p>How about we focus on how many people are truly qualified for jobs. The fact is, Google, Yahoo, and everybody he said will hire the best person if they're pink, if they're purple, if they're striped. They don't care. And that's the problem that Jesse Jackson has in waging a lawsuit against these people.</p><p>It's he knows they want the best people. It's the companies that allow this gangster type of mentality to occur that says you've got to have a certain number of blacks, whites, or whatever. I want qualified people. Business wants qualified people and they don't want the racial strife that comes with Jesse Jackson and his ilk. So, that's all that America is looking for.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Kevin, to your point, the H1-B Visas that he referenced and that is to say, that allows U.S. companies to reach out and keep students who are here from India, China, or Russia, wherever, there are 3 to 4 million jobs that go unfilled every month in the U.S. because there is a dearth of either math or engineering or science skills. So, maybe that's where we start is more with education?</p><p>JACKSON: Well, the fact of the matter is, if Google, the best people are in the United States, I guarantee you, Google, Yahoo, Apple and all those companies want them. They will do a job fair, they don't care what those people look like, what they sound like, they will translate for them. They'll do whatever it takes to get the best employees.</p><p>And if there's 3 million H1-B 1's contrary to what Obama or Jesse Jackson or the race pimps tell you, they will hire them and those people are waiting because they're the best employees. And that's the problem is the - - the education system in America is not producing the best employees anymore.</p><p>Instead, what we're doing is we're coddling people. We're saying, hey, use this EEOC guidelines and all this other nonsense that business -- that doesn't further business. Use those guidelines to get people hired but don't hire the best. That's why those jobs are unfilled.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Kevin Jackson, good clear view. We're so glad to have you with us. Joining us there from St. Louis.</p><p>So, when we come back, Facebook, your friend's credit, well, they could affect your own. A patent just filed has our next guest second-guessing his friend requests.</p><p>And Lexus, finally unveiling video of a prototype of a hover board. Social media is questioning its authenticity. Weigh in, tell us. Is it real? Is it Fake? You can tweet to us @deirdrebolton, to me directly or to the show @riskrewardfbn.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Next time you want to loan your Facebook friends may be important, more important than the papers you give to the bank. Social network filed for a new patent that would allow creditors to assess your creditworthiness based on the credit ratings of the people in your social network.</p><p>John Ulzheimer is with me now. He is CreditSesame.com president of consumer education. John, first and foremost, what do you make of this idea? What if I was a musician and my former career, now I'm an investment banker, but if my creative friends are still broke, I'm penalized?</p><p>JOHN ULZHEIMER, CREDITSESAME.COM PRESIDENT: Well, the challenge that you face is that there's this hypothesis in the world of social media/risk management that birds of a feather tend to flock together.</p><p>And if you have a large or disproportionate number of friends or connections on social media that indicate that they're high risk, then the likelihood of you being high risk, again, in their hypothesis is going to be much more likely, and therefore they may actually consider that when determining whether or not to do business with you and under what terms.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. But maybe times have changed, right? And I want to play for you, John, we had Mark Luschini as a guest. He's a co-founder of PayPal. Here's what he told me about the new credit environment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Credit works fairly well for established consumers' financial products. But if you're a young person fresh off the college bench, you're about to move tax brackets most likely. And the FICO score looks back and says, well, you know, just hold it up there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, in that sense, we know that Mark Luschini with a firm is actually loaning money to people with computer science degrees and other indicators, that even if they don't have money at that time, they will have it.</p><p>ULZHEIMER: Yes, that's right. And it's a very good point. The CSPV defines those people as the invisible. Meaning that they don't have any sort of established credit history, other than probably some student loans and maybe some collections from their former apartment complexes.</p><p>And it's true that credit scoring systems are much more effective when you have a long history, a robust credit history to look back onto determine whether you're going to be a subsequent risk going forward than the smaller the credit report.</p><p>And if you have no credit report, lenders still want to do business with you. And so, that's when they were going to start looking for the secondary and tertiary types of data sources to determine whether or not to do business.</p><p>Look, your Facebook score is never going to replace your Equifax credit report and your advantage score and your FICO score and your Transunion credit report, simply isn't going to do it.</p><p>But, where it can be very effective is, for example, my niece who is about to graduate from school, probably has very little credit history and is going want to lease an apartment, is going to want to buy a car, is going to buy a house someday.</p><p>And to penalize her because she has no robust credit history, without perhaps, looking how quality her connections are on Facebook. It seems to be a little bit unfair and actually can work in someone's favor. This isn't always going to work against somebody, it can actually work in your favor in many instances.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. John, great to have you with us. I should mention as well, Facebook, other big tech companies they filed for patents that they don't use, maybe this is just filing to file it.</p><p>When we come back, Disney's stock dropping more than 9 percent. Netflix going to an all-time high, a new media battle is brewing.</p><p>My panel guest will tell you which companies as they think will come out on top. Netflix also announcing a one year paid paternity leave and maternity leave for all employees, will other companies follow suit? We'll talk about it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: The first republican presidential debate of 2016 tomorrow night on Fox News. Donald Trump is the most successful candidate, if you measure by social media reads. Speaking of the Donald, some people say the number who watch the debate may, in fact, top the final episode of Trump's last celebrity apprentice.</p><p>With me now from Cleveland where the debate will take place is Blake Burman. So, Blake, what's Trump saying ahead of the big night?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Believe it or not, Deirdre, Donald Trump is actually lowering expectations a bit. You just mentioned that \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" the final episode of the last show had six million viewers, a little more than that.</p><p>Some feel the debate here tomorrow night could actually top that. For a little bit of perspective context there, the first primary debates of 2011, four years ago, were about half that, but they didn't have the Trump factor. Why so many people will be tuning in tomorrow night.</p><p>Still, though, Donald Trump lowering expectations talking about how he is not a debater at all while these politicians as he calls them are. I want you to take a little listen real quick to what he told Trish Regan this afternoon about lowering those expectations, here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to set the bar so low, I want to set that bar so low, you have you no idea. But we'll see what happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: So, he said, we'll see what happens. He talked about lowering the bar, laughing it off a little bit. We'll see what happens tomorrow night. Donald Trump did say earlier today as well as he has last night that he wants to approach this debate in a civil manner. But he also said, Deirdre, if he's attacked, he would fight back. We'll see when that happens.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. I was going to say...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURMAN: Who that happens thought in, how Donald Trump has thought.</p><p>BOLTON: ... yes. That seems like likely as in scale of 10 out of 10.</p><p>BURMAN: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Blake Burman joining me there from Cleveland, Ohio. Thank you very much, Blake.</p><p>Well, for more on tomorrow's GOP debate, social media power, Matt Witheiler from FlyBridge Capital Partners is here, as is Russ Frushtick, the editorial director at Product Hunt. Glad to have you both here.</p><p>So, what do you think about this debate? Let's just talk about it from a media perspective, perhaps a number of viewers outpacing \"The Apprentice\"?</p><p>MATT WITHEILER, FLYBRIDGE CAPITAL GENERAL PARTNER: Isn't really that surprising? I mean, everybody I know who's going to watch and is playing some form of drinking game involving Trump at some point. So, I think that it actually will be a ratings boon for Fox.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. And, Russ, from a social media perspective, you heard him say, I want to lower expectations so much.</p><p>RUSS FRUSHTICK, PRODUCT HUNTS EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: So, do you think he knows he's going to bomb but he's still just counting on Twitter, Facebook and the rest for his messages?</p><p>FRUSHTICK: Well, first of all, he's being very humble. I mean, that's what a good politician should lower expectations before a debate and then they come out and make a big splash, I think he'll definitely do that here. Whether it's a successful splash, helping his campaign, I don't know, but he certainly has a lot of social media power.</p><p>BOLTON: He does indeed. I mean, and he has this sort of upwards of 23 percent reach, you know, the next candidate is Jeb Bush, around 12 percent. So, love him or hate him. His message and his quote and quote, \"Authentic brand,\" seems to be resonating even with some of it is ironic.</p><p>WITHEILER: Yes. I think that's right. I think he's going to drive a big audience, whether you are for him or against him. It's really bringing everybody to the table for this debate.</p><p>And so, they will be a tell-tale performance for him, and that will he be able to convince people who, historically, have been anti-Trump to come on his side of the camp it. And it will really depend on how he performs.</p><p>BOLTON: Speaking of branding, going a little bit bigger, Disney versus Netflix. If you had to put money on either one, who's your dog in the race?</p><p>FRUSHTICK: Disney. Absolutely Disney.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>FRUSHTICK: I mean, Netflix is a good company and has a good product. Disney is in it for the long haul. If you're look for a long-term investment, they've been building these franchises like \"Star Wars\" and Marvel for the last 10 years.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. But they pay for that, I mean, it's like $4 billion a pop, $4 million a pop, sorry.</p><p>WITHEILER: Yes. No, that's exactly right. It's very expensive but at the same time, they are getting a huge return for that. Because that content that they produced is undistributed on Netflix. And so, when you think about shows like \"Daredevil,\" which is a Marvel property which is owned by Disney that's on Netflix, Disney is kind of taking revenue from one pocket which is the network content pocket and paying it over to Netflix.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Netflix also announcing an unlimited year of maternity and paternity leave, essentially they also have unlimited vacation. But essentially saying, listen, we trust you to be professional. You know what time you can take and when. To me this spoke of the talent war?</p><p>FRUSHTICK: It is part of it. I think another part of it is the -- this sort of a very obvious strategy in the Silicon Valley space where it's like, oh, you have unlimited time to take off, so people generally are very conservative with how they use their time.</p><p>If you have three weeks, you're going to take three weeks. So, I think this might be a good PR win for them, but also maybe a little bit of gamesmanship in terms of how people use their maternity leave.</p><p>BOLTON: Right. In other words, nobody really wants to take more than his or her peer, right?</p><p>WITHEILER: Yes, I think that's right. And I think that from a PR perspective, what it's really doing is it's winning Netflix a lot of points with the millennial generation who wants culture and work life balance. And Netflix doesn't want to lose employees because recruiting a new employee is much harder and more expensive than retaining somebody.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Hold those thoughts. We're going to continue the conservation. I'm going to be back with Matt and Russ in just a little bit of time.</p><p>Allegations of overpricing, social media activists calling whole foods out again. This time, though, for something as overpriced and zany as what you're looking at right now on your screens.</p><p>And with two million views already on YouTube, Lexus's new hover board getting a lot of publicity. Is it real? Tell us what you think. Tweet to us @deirdrebolton, @riskrewardfbn.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Chances are you have engaged with Taboola's content before. The platform recommends editorial and sponsored articles across many highly trafficked web sites. The goal? Help publishers monetize their content while creating a personalized experience for the user.</p><p>Co-founder and CEO, Adam Singolda is with me now. Adam, glad to have you with us.</p><p>ADAM SINGOLDA, TABOOLA FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BOLTON: I have often heard your company described as a search engine in reverse? Is that accurate?</p><p>SINGOLDA: Yes, I think it is.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. And for what reason, how does it work, how does it make what I consume better targeted for me?</p><p>SINGOLDA: So, you know, I started the company eight years ago living with my parents and trying to watch TV and I couldn't find anything to watch. And I thought, you know people should not be looking for TV shows, TV shows should be looking for me.</p><p>And I started the company, you know, with the vision to connect people with content they may like they never knew existed, which is in reverse to what you do with a search engine when you know exactly what you want to read.</p><p>So, with us, information hopefully it's finding you before you knew you were supposed searching for it.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. And as far as my data, what happens? How do you find me?</p><p>SINGOLDA: So, we work with some of the biggest media companies in the world. From USA Today that we're announcing today, Gannett, Business Insider, and many, many others. And at the bottom of the article do you know how you usually see other articles you may like. We do that which allows us to see what decisions are making when they finish consuming the content.</p><p>BOLTON: So, in theory, it also gives sellers of products or services better information on how and who to target?</p><p>SINGOLDA: Right. So, we're looking at all the information that's out there definitely. You know, all the media companies we're working with and we're trying to -- there are millions of different options trying to unless they second decide what are the two or three things you may like and never knew existed.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Now, mobile is so important right now. I know you have, as you referenced here, the deal with Gannett, how does it all fit together?</p><p>SINGOLDA: So, in general, what we're announcing today is it's exciting in two ways. On the one side from the business perspective, we're announcing that we expect to generate between 45 to $55 million in the next three years to come with Gannett and USA Today.</p><p>And the second one which is perhaps even more exciting is where with the industry is going where you buy. You know, I started the company eight years ago thinking personalization is the difference between me and you, and I think that was wrong.</p><p>If you think about the way you consume the web, think about when you wake up in the morning and you drink your coffee on the big screen, how do you behave consuming the news versus if you're on your way with your mobile from a Facebook app, how is that different?</p><p>So, we envision the web, the future of the web to be sort of a dragon with many, many heads. Whereby each head is an experience -- a different experience of the web that is telling not only to me but to me right now.</p><p>BOLTON: To the activity that you're currently doing.</p><p>SINGOLDA: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: It makes all the sense in the world. Congratulations on the deal with Gannett. We're glad to have you with. Adam Singolda joining me there. He is the co-founder and CEO of Taboola.</p><p>If you build it, they will come, that seems to be the device and mantra. We're going to show you the new plans for the tallest residential tower in the world.</p><p>And then, asparagus grows after allegation of overpricing, social media activists now accusing whole foods of selling $6 asparagus water. Find out how the company reacted, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Elon Musk is saying that storage, the battery business could generate, quote, \"A few billion dollars in 2017.\"</p><p>I am back right now with Matt Witheiler and Russ Frushtick. Thanks, guys, for staying with me. So, what do make, we know that as far as the Tesla and deliveries of cars, Elon Musk missed the target. But he's saying, wait, wait, wait, there's my battery business, it's going to rocket. Yea or nay, what do you say?</p><p>FRUSHTICK: Yes, I agree that there is more life there. You definitely don't want to get into a fight where you're fighting against manufacturing and the other big companies getting into this electronic -- electric car space. But, you know, that's the issue, like they haven't been hitting their numbers. So, it's not the best production.</p><p>BOLTON: Matt, we know that engineers do not hold these metrics against Elon Musk. Almost anyone in the tech community that I speak with would lie down in traffic for him because they say he puts his money where his mouth is. OK, finally, sometimes he makes mistakes on numbers but the spirit is in the right place?</p><p>WITHEILER: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: It that good enough for investors?</p><p>WITHEILER: I think it's good enough for its employees, it's good enough for investors that the price of which Tesla had priced that. Big question in my mind. It's easy to point to a shiny new object in battery business don't be distracted by the actual numbers in cars, but it's very speculative in my mind.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, because the stock is already up, something like 30 percent year-to-date. So, if you're an investor you do want something back for that. All right. Speaking of a different kind of fuel, whole foods apparently, selling asparagus water, which was essentially three stocks of asparagus in a jar colored asparagus water.</p><p>This is supposed to be just in one store brand with California. But hopefully it's really has this PR issues, price gouging nationwide, they're not the only shop I should say to be facing this. Is this more disappointing because hopefully this somehow supposed to be pure?</p><p>FRUSHTICK: I guess that's only their brand. They want to portray this pure brand. But like, it also doesn't tell to surprise us. Every time I go to the supermarket there is another crazy fruit and like a jar, oh, it's carry water now.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. You will live to be 700 years old if you drink this. Matt, what is your take?</p><p>WITHEILER: Yes, exactly. Didn't you drink it this morning...</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, there you go.</p><p>WITHEILER: ... before you even go to work? Now, I think that given the problems that whole foods has had in New York with the Attorney General here in allegations of price kind of manipulation on how much they were charging for products, this did not comment a good time for whole foods.</p><p>That being said, I'm pretty sure this was a prank and whoever is responsible probably won't take it too long.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: And I look the company's response. If you think something is not been weighed properly, just bring it back. We were joking, right?</p><p>WITHEILER: Exactly.</p><p>BOLTON: Like here's my half donut that should have been weighed or...</p><p>WITHEILER: My half drinks asparagus water.</p><p>BOLTON: There you go, there you go. Power and health to us all. Thank you both for joining me there. Matt Witheiler, a general partner joining us from FlyBridge Capital Partners, Russ Frushtick, editorial director at Product Hunts.</p><p>Well, move over Marty McFly because Lexus introducing a real hover board. So, they say, tweet us now. Tell us, real or fake, @deirdrebolton @riskrewardfbn. What do you think?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Some of the top stories trending right now at foxbusiness.com. Target, Walmart, 7-Eleven soon may have less junk at checkout counters. Center for Science and the public interest calling for the removal of those items because they cause obesity and can lead to diabetes. Fruits, vegetables, and granola bars are suggested replacement.</p><p>On the health theme, Fitbit reporting its first quarterly numbers as a public company. Wearables tech company earnings soaring. The company is selling 4.5 million devices this quarter, up nearly three million from the prior year.</p><p>And, Connecticut, the nation's most expensive place to die. New probate fees resulting in relative receiving bills of up to a million dollars last week to settle the estate of their loved one.</p><p>Well, speaking of transitions, we do want to let you know that \"Back to the Future 2,\" made some people dream of a real hover board. Lexus is saying it did. Take a look at this video, releasing a full video of pro-skate boarder. They say it's real. Interested tie but it will not be on sale soon.</p><p>Thank you so much for joining us on Risk &amp; Reward. Glad to have you with us. Charles Payne is next.

Deirdre Bolton gets us out  of this. Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST: All right. Melissa and David.  Thank you so much. We have breaking news to bring you here right away. A  senate IRS targeting report has been released. My colleague, Gerri Willis,  has been on the story. So, Gerri, what is the latest?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GERRI WILLIS, THE WILLIS REPORT SHOW HOST: So, Deirdre, that's right. We  just got report moments ago. And here is what we're finding the big take  away, the IRS was delinquent in providing effective control, guidance and  direction in the processing of those tax-exempt application for 501-c3  status. That's what we're learning tonight. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And let me tell you, the report describes the culture within the IRS Exempt  Organizations Unit. We had no idea how dysfunctional it was. Listen to  this. Top management was never aware of five year delays in some of the  processing at some of these organizations applications. </p><p>In addition to that, people within the unit were improperly trained. They  didn't know the kind of material they were looking at, what they were  supposed to do, what the law regarding tax-exempt organizations was  supposed to be. There was in siding. People were managing folks were  halfway across the country, 2,000 miles away, that made it more difficult.</p><p>In addition to that, there were people who worked from home four days a  week, and it was difficult to get all the information flowing.  This made  it possible for Lois Lerner because she was very liberal in her outlook on  life, it made it possible for her to have her political point of view  represented and that's exactly what happened here, according to this  report.</p><p>They surveyed 1.5 million documents and 32 interviews with IRS employees,  staff and others. </p><p>BOLTON: So, Gerri, quick question here, I mean, as far as the staff views,  what are, for example, republicans saying to this because many feel like,  OK, some of the groups that are even right of center were clearly targeted. </p><p>WILLIS: That's right. And as you know, the president recently said they  were not.  But this report says, yes, they were. That the IRS systemically  selected tea party groups for targeting, and as I said, Lois Lerner had a  big role in this. Orrin Hatch today saying that he found evidence, and he  is the chairman of this committee that the administration's political  agenda guided the IRS actions; they're calling this gross mismanagement.</p><p>When you read the details of how the section was run, Deirdre, I don't  think there's a company you cover in technology that is run that way. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. And as you said, the president, this could go all the way up to  a PR problem for President Obama. </p><p>WILLIS: Well, the big question of course has been, has this targeting been  directed from the White House? Even though Orrin Hatch concludes that  that's what was happening, I saw none of it in the report. </p><p>So, we're still waiting to see if that's in fact the case, and that's the  big takeaway question so many people have at this time. But let me tell  you. Tonight, the Senate Finance Committee painting a picture of complete  disarray in this exempt organizations unit.</p><p>And I have to tell you, it sounds like they weren't just delinquent and  ineffective at controlling and guiding their employees, they didn't know  what they were supposed to be doing, it sounds like. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. Gerri, we are going to depend on you for updates. In the  meantime, thank you very much for bringing us breaking news on that Senate  Finance Committee report. </p><p>I want to get you to the markets because stocks close higher but  essentially went nowhere. If you look at the levels, oil prices slid. We  want to get you down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Lori  Rothman is there. Lori, what stood out to you about today's session?  </p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, the hundred-point  rally we had early fizzling certainly stood out. So, both said and done the  Dow is down 10 points to close at 17,540. You hit the nail with that  decline in oil prices. So, it looks like four days the down days for the  Dow. </p><p>The NASDAQ did post gains, about 34 points by the close. Lot of that had to  do with finally a turnaround in shares of Apple. Apple shares up 6/10 of a  percent, up for the first time in five days, down 14 percent still since  April. </p><p>We've been talking about the massive amounts of market value. Apple's given  up about $100 billion in that time period. Disney was another weight on the  Dow, 24 hours later after disappointing earnings report, disappointing  revenue to be exact. Apparently, people are cutting the cord, so the cable  business is of serious concern. </p><p>Disney also warning of mysterious dollar hit, $500 million hit next year to  the company because of our strong U.S. dollar. Twitter shares also hit a  new low today. A lot of speculation who will be the new CEO and when that  person will be appointed. Off almost 3 percent in the regular session. Also  Rico reported that Google, an acquisition by Google of Twitter is highly  unlikely. </p><p>After the bell, we just heard the latest earnings from Tesla, the electric  carmaker shares down around. They've been as low as 8 percent in the after- hours which is better than expected report. But here is the problem, Elon  Musk, CEO, lowered vehicle sales expectations. </p><p>He did promise 55,000 electric vehicles sold this year and he lowered that  mark, 50 to 55,000. So, that pretty much sums up the day, Deirdre. I'll  send it back over to you.</p><p>BOLTON: Lori, thank you so much. I'm going to pick up right where you left  off on Tesla. Lori just told you beat on the top and the bottom lines. But  this big question, can Elon Musk's company develop and deliver 55,000 cars,  you heard her say. It seems like not.</p><p>I want to bring in the president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo,  Jon Rettinger. So, Jon, first and foremost, what do you make of the  earnings, we'll talk about production in a minute. </p><p>JON RETTINGER, TECHNOBUFFALO PRESIDENT AND EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Sure. So, I  think people were disappointed by not hitting the sales number at 55,000  numbers. Numbers has been touted. We're supposed to have the model x this  year, the model x kept getting delayed. Now we're hearing we're going to  have it start shipping toward the end of the year. </p><p>But we heard blames of making sure that they were -- the partners were  going to be able to ship on time. And I think we're losing about 10 percent  of your total estimated sales is a big hit for the company. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. It certainly is indeed. And I mean, what do you make of Tesla,  right? Tesla is supposed to be next generation in Siri. We have Elon Musk  touting it as bigger, better, faster, stronger, but, I mean, other car  companies can meet their production standards?  </p><p>RETTINGER: Yes. So, Tesla is one of those companies that is being led by a  modern-day Steve Jobs. You have this reality extortion field. People love  the company but it follows no sense of logic with how the stock goes. I  want them to hear a few things that we didn't get from the earnings call. </p><p>Tesla has taken over 29,000 orders for the model x but has given no  estimation when its designs is going to go live. Cars are going to ship in  a few months. We don't even know what they've ordered at this point. I  would like to hear more about their power low, their home battery solution.  We don't know much about that. </p><p>Tesla has been promising autonomous drive called autopilot in the model x.  We're hearing very little about that other than it's been delayed. So,  there are a lot of question marks for the company, not to mention the  specter of their model 3, the affordable BMW 3 killer supposed to hitting  sometime in 2017. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. And, Jon, I mean, I know you are a fan, you have you driven  one, you have come on the show and talked about it. What does it mean for  the future? How much does it hurt Tesla to have this missed delivery for  the 55,000 cars?  </p><p>RETTINGER: If they deliver the Model X as expected and the car comes out to  the rave reviews that the Model S had, than almost 100 consumer reports  rating, it's not going to hurt the company long-term at all. But that is a  big but. </p><p>Every delay for the model X makes the expectations for that much higher. If  there is one problem with that car, if there's a battery explosion or  battery leak, it's going to spell big potential trouble. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Jon, thanks so much for your input. Jon Rettinger  joining us there, president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo.</p><p>Switching gears puts on regulated energy theme, President Obama going all- out over the next several weeks to build support in Congress for a nuclear  deal. Take a listen to a speech that he gave at American University.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: Congressional rejection  of this deal leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to  preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option. Another war  in the Middle East. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Joining me now is Phil Flynn, senior market analyst for the Price  Futures Group, also author of The Energy Report. So, Phil, we have  alternative energy to talk about, traditional as well, I'd like to start  with that, what do you think of the president's remarks?  </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP SENIOR MARKET ANALYST &amp; THE ENERGY REPORT  AUTHOR: Well, I think, you know, once again, the president is saying my way  or the highway. You know, if you look at how he always flames the debate.  It's either my way or we're going to have a war, there's no other  alternative. And that's not true. </p><p>You know, the truth is that there are many other alternatives. Number one,  for example, continuing the sanctions on Iran. They seem to be working  pretty darn well. That's what brought Iran to the table. But the president  always seems to do this. He always sees his vision is the only right one,  anybody who disagrees with him is the bad guy. </p><p>They don't understand. They want a war. And the truth of the matter is  there are other options, there's not just two. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, as far as that goes, Iran, top six in the world's largest  crude oil producers, what is the effect if this deal goes through this  nuclear deal on the oil market? </p><p>FLYNN: Well, I think we should look at both sides of it. First of all, if  it goes through, obviously we're going to be giving Iran what, $58 billion?  You know, maybe some of that is going to go into their energy industry to  try to bring that back online. </p><p>Maybe some of it will go to terrorism. You know, who knows? Because they  are the biggest state sponsored country of terrorism. But let's look at the  other side. What if Congress doesn't do this deal? What if they reject this  deal? And the president is saying, hey, guess what, guys, if you don't get  this deal, we're going to war.</p><p>What is it going to do to the cost of oil? It may cause a price spike  because the markets are going to believe the president and they are going  to be afraid that a war is going to be just around the corner. So, it could  do a lot of damage, you know. So, I think it's dangerous the way this  debate is being framed. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Phil, we'll be checking in with you, I'm sure over the  next few weeks. Phil Flynn joining us there, senior market analyst for the  Price Futures Group, author of The Energy Report, with us there from  Chicago.</p><p>Stocks as you know, you heard from Lori, closing off their highs. Apple has  had a volatile few days, Bank of America today cutting its price target  from 142 to 130, changing the recommendation from a buy to a neutral. </p><p>Jason Rotman with me now. He is president of Lido Isle Advisors. He is a  bull. Mark Luschini joining me, a chief investment strategist at Janney  Montgomery Scott. He is an apple bear. Welcome to you both. Jason, would  you buy at these levels? It seems like, yes. </p><p>JASON ROTMAN, LIDO ISLE ADVISORS PRESIDENT: Absolutely. Absolutely,  Deirdre. I mean, the thing is, I would buy and I would continue to buy. In  other words, dollar cost average if the price continues to go down. Here's  one major reason, OK? </p><p>This is what is not really being talked about a lot, for whatever reason, I  don't know. 73 percent of the installed user base of Apple still has not  upgraded to the latest models. So, Apple is basically still crushing it in  my humble opinion, and 73 percent of the people still have not upgraded. </p><p>So, I think at the end of the day, it's going to be a Merry Christmas, it's  going to be a happy Hanukkah, it's going to be a happy holiday season for  Apple. I think now is the time to -- now is the time to buy on the dip.</p><p>BOLTON: Mark, I know you disagree. Again, what are you most worried about  with Apple? We know as far as hand set sales in China, Apple is number  three, behind Xiaomi and Huawei. Is this your concern or is it something  else? </p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Well,  it's really two things in terms of my concern. Now, one fundamental and one  technical. On the fundamental front, it's one of the things you just  mentioned, and that is of course China, in the slowdown there. And  obviously with the meltdown in equity prices, the impact on the wealth  affect there among Chinese consumers. </p><p>On the U.S. front or at least phone sales front is more to do with the fact  that perhaps the new disciplined consumer is less likely to upgrade to that  new iPhone 6 if they've had a recent iPhone 5 purchase. And as a  consequence, may continue to defer that purchase. From a technical  standpoint, we've seen no less than three previous time to the price points  reaching that 130 to $134 level that the price has been turned away. </p><p>And this was the most recent one which in our view, was going to lead to  potential irritation in the share price. Ultimately, it turned out to be  worse. We turn back our position in the portfolio to $125 about two weeks  ago and we stayed sidelined for the time being. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. Mark, point well made. Jason, I know as you said, you're still  a buyer. Where does Apple go from here? What other tricks fundamentally  does it have up its sleeve? Is it Apple TV? Are there certain products that  you think will be catalysts?  </p><p>ROTMAN: Yes. That's a really great question. And really I'm going to  respond with two major points. Number one, technically, Apple has fallen  below its 200-day moving average, 17 times only since the past 30 to 60  days to rebound above it, I think this is going to be no different.  </p><p>Now, to answer your question from a fundamental standpoint. We're coming in  to a holiday season. Again, 73 percent of the people have not upgraded yet.  I adamantly disagree with the fact or the theory that people are less  likely to upgrade from 5 to 6, I don't think that makes any sense. </p><p>People are going to need to upgrade and Apple is a brilliant marketing  company, they're going to have a  huge holiday season. I think now is the  time to buy for that reason alone. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. We will leave it there. We thank you for your time for  your insights.</p><p>ROTMAN: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Jason Rotman joining us there. Mark Luschini as well. We thank you  both.</p><p>When we come back, democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee calling on Tim Cook  of Apple to release employee diversity data. Our next guest says Silicon  Valley companies are being unfairly targeted on this issue.</p><p>Then you may be out of luck because of Suck. Forget your credit score?  According to a new Facebook patent filed. Your Facebook friend's credit  scores could keep you from borrowing money. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Some of the stories we're following for you right now. Debris,  including part of an aircraft wing, is confirmed to be from the missing  Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane. It has been more than a year since the plane  disappeared with 239 people on board.</p><p>The FBI is investigating the security of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail  server. This is the one that she used when she was Secretary of State. The  probe comes days after watchdogs from the state department and the  intelligence community asked the Justice Department to explore whether or  not classified material was improperly shared or stored on the e-mail  account. </p><p>Security regulators are approving a final rule that requires public  companies to disclose the ratios between annual comp of CEO's and median  pay of employees. As you see, consider this change for years, it is finally  here.</p><p>And Representative Barbara Lee, a democrat from California calling on tech  companies including Apple to release federal data on diversity of their  workforces. Lee was in Silicon Valley this week turning up the heat on the  tech community to hire more African-Americans.</p><p>Well, last spring, the tech community did sneak into release details on the  demographics of its employees. Yahoo, Google, LinkedIn among the first to  publish stats. One of the reasons they did, a push from our next guest. </p><p>Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr. is with me now. He is an instrumental voice in  this push for diversity. He is with me on the phone. Reverend, so glad  you're with us. You have encouraged tech companies to share more  information, calling on Congress to backup that call. Why is it so  important for all of these companies to share their data in your view? </p><p>JESSE JACKSON SR., RAINBOWPUSH COALITION FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT: Hey, Deirdre.  A lot of these employers are in our country. They're the fastest growth  industry and they've been from the government and upon consumers. </p><p>We're not sending out Apple sending them out of the top 25 from 189 board  members, 36 women were African-American, we have Latinos. And just to last  year, about Twitter 49 blacks men, 16 Latinos, Facebook, 1600 employees,  140 blacks, just 7 blacks from the west different employees. </p><p>Twitter, I mean, Yahoo have 6,000 employees, 138 are black. So, it's not a  pretty picture. </p><p>BOLTON: It's not a pretty picture. And even Nancy Lee, and I'm going to  look at my notes here, reverend, to read the quote, \"Google's director of  people operation told the San Jose Mercury news last spring. When we look  around at the industry, we think we're doing OK, but it is not something we  want to tout.\"</p><p>In your view, what is the number one most practical way that you think that  tech companies can improve? How can they reach out to different  communities, and therefore, recruit with a wider net?  </p><p>JACKSON SR: With the set goals, targets and timetables, almost the least  accepted federal standard, these comes as CEO 1 and contract compliance  laws are very important. The government then land for them to file the  yield 1 report. It's just that we should publish again as what they have  come in the last year. </p><p>But they all have a great difference of people's color from their boards  and the women. In the six weeks I went three steps with it, unlike three  blacks and three Latinos, employment is around 2 percent. And I think that  enforcing laws of fair practices for these companies is important. </p><p>BOLTON: Reverend, is it more important to have diversity in the rank and  file, or is it more important in management to set an example? </p><p>JACKSON SR: Well, both examples, both of the employers, there are qualified  people at every level. They spend more time looking for each one of the  workers from India, from Asia, than training young people right here at  home. And that's a big piece of consideration. </p><p>There is no talent deficit. There is an6 opportunity deficit. And besides  each of those etiquette which we advocate very much at RainbowPush and  engineers, the biggest employee base is now in take. </p><p>It's ad agencies, it's marketing. It's non-tech workers, that they are  hovering around 2 percent in those categories. Some of them from the exempt  from any other obligation, they stand up to what's just and fair. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. Well, we're glad to have your thoughts on that. Reverend Jesse  Jackson Sr., joining us there from the RainbowPush Coalition.</p><p>Our next guest takes an opposite view. Kevin Jackson is with me now. He's a  former management consultant to some of the world's largest companies. He  is with me now from St. Louis. </p><p>So, Kevin, what about this argument that the best people have to be found  and perhaps there's just ways to get more people in that original pool?  </p><p>KEVIN JACKSON, FORMER MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, first of  all, everything Jesse Jackson just said is nonsense. The fact of the matter  is, it's people like him that aren't getting qualified blacks jobs because  if you're going to hire a black person, you got to understand you're  bringing Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, the Department of Justice, the EEOC,  the Department of Labor, and everybody else with you to that job. So,  that's issue number one. And issue number two...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BOLTON: Just to stop you there, Kevin, what do you mean by that? That in  other words, one employee has too much baggage to even focus on his or her  job hunt?  </p><p>JACKSON: That's exactly right. If you hire a white kid, that white kid  can't do anything, he can get racist e-mails, calling him cracker or  anything else he wants. And he can't do anything. He can go HR, and all he  can do is just -- they'll laugh together, but they won't have a lawsuit. </p><p>But let a black kid get anything or black person at a company, have  anything that isn't even related to him, and you've got everybody Jesse  Jackson, and everybody coming to the fore to try to profiteer because  that's what's happened in American's business. American business...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: So, Kevin, essentially you're saying if employers are unwilling or  less willing to hire minorities because they're afraid of potential  lawsuits, in case something goes wrong?  </p><p>JACKSON: Absolutely. And they won't tell you that but that's a fact. And  then the other part of it about what Jesse Jackson is looking at. He gave  you all kinds of statistics about how many blacks, how many women, how many  browns, or whatever. </p><p>How about we focus on how many people are truly qualified for jobs. The  fact is, Google, Yahoo, and everybody he said will hire the best person if  they're pink, if they're purple, if they're striped. They don't care. And  that's the problem that Jesse Jackson has in waging a lawsuit against these  people.</p><p>It's he knows they want the best people. It's the companies that allow this  gangster type of mentality to occur that says you've got to have a certain  number of blacks, whites, or whatever. I want qualified people. Business  wants qualified people and they don't want the racial strife that comes  with Jesse Jackson and his ilk. So, that's all that America is looking for. </p><p>BOLTON: So, Kevin, to your point, the H1-B Visas that he referenced and  that is to say, that allows U.S. companies to reach out and keep students  who are here from India, China, or Russia, wherever, there are 3 to 4  million jobs that go unfilled every month in the U.S. because there is a  dearth of either math or engineering or science skills. So, maybe that's  where we start is more with education? </p><p>JACKSON: Well, the fact of the matter is, if Google, the best people are in  the United States, I guarantee you, Google, Yahoo, Apple and all those  companies want them. They will do a job fair, they don't care what those  people look like, what they sound like, they will translate for them.  They'll do whatever it takes to get the best employees.</p><p>And if there's 3 million H1-B 1's contrary to what Obama or Jesse Jackson  or the race pimps tell you, they will hire them and those people are  waiting because they're the best employees. And that's the problem is the - - the education system in America is not producing the best employees  anymore. </p><p>Instead, what we're doing is we're coddling people. We're saying, hey, use  this EEOC guidelines and all this other nonsense that business -- that  doesn't further business. Use those guidelines to get people hired but  don't hire the best. That's why those jobs are unfilled. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Kevin Jackson, good clear view. We're so glad to have  you with us. Joining us there from St. Louis.</p><p>So, when we come back, Facebook, your friend's credit, well, they could  affect your own. A patent just filed has our next guest second-guessing his  friend requests.</p><p>And Lexus, finally unveiling video of a prototype of a hover board. Social  media is questioning its authenticity. Weigh in, tell us. Is it real? Is it  Fake? You can tweet to us @deirdrebolton, to me directly or to the show  @riskrewardfbn.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Next time you want to loan your Facebook friends may be important,  more important than the papers you give to the bank. Social network filed  for a new patent that would allow creditors to assess your creditworthiness  based on the credit ratings of the people in your social network.</p><p>John Ulzheimer is with me now. He is CreditSesame.com president of consumer  education. John, first and foremost, what do you make of this idea? What if  I was a musician and my former career, now I'm an investment banker, but if  my creative friends are still broke, I'm penalized?  </p><p>JOHN ULZHEIMER, CREDITSESAME.COM PRESIDENT: Well, the challenge that you  face is that there's this hypothesis in the world of social media/risk  management that birds of a feather tend to flock together. </p><p>And if you have a large or disproportionate number of friends or  connections on social media that indicate that they're high risk, then the  likelihood of you being high risk, again, in their hypothesis is going to  be much more likely, and therefore they may actually consider that when  determining whether or not to do business with you and under what terms. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. But maybe times have changed, right? And I want to play  for you, John, we had Mark Luschini as a guest. He's a co-founder of  PayPal. Here's what he told me about the new credit environment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Credit  works fairly well for established consumers' financial products. But if  you're a young person fresh off the college bench, you're about to move tax  brackets most likely. And the FICO score looks back and says, well, you  know, just hold it up there. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, in that sense, we know that Mark Luschini with a firm is  actually loaning money to people with computer science degrees and other  indicators, that even if they don't have money at that time, they will have  it. </p><p>ULZHEIMER: Yes, that's right.  And it's a very good point. The CSPV defines  those people as the invisible. Meaning that they don't have any sort of  established credit history, other than probably some student loans and  maybe some collections from their former apartment complexes. </p><p>And it's true that credit scoring systems are much more effective when you  have a long history, a robust credit history to look back onto determine  whether you're going to be a subsequent risk going forward than the smaller  the credit report. </p><p>And if you have no credit report, lenders still want to do business with  you. And so, that's when they were going to start looking for the secondary  and tertiary types of data sources to determine whether or not to do  business. </p><p>Look, your Facebook score is never going to replace your Equifax credit  report and your advantage score and your FICO score and your Transunion  credit report, simply isn't going to do it. </p><p>But, where it can be very effective is, for example, my niece who is about  to graduate from school, probably has very little credit history and is  going want to lease an apartment, is going to want to buy a car, is going  to buy a house someday. </p><p>And to penalize her because she has no robust credit history, without  perhaps, looking how quality her connections are on Facebook. It seems to  be a little bit unfair and actually can work in someone's favor. This isn't  always going to work against somebody, it can actually work in your favor  in many instances.  </p><p>BOLTON: All right. John, great to have you with us. I should mention as  well, Facebook, other big tech companies they filed for patents that they  don't use, maybe this is just filing to file it.</p><p>When we come back, Disney's stock dropping more than 9 percent. Netflix  going to an all-time high, a new media battle is brewing. </p><p>My panel guest will tell you which companies as they think will come out on  top. Netflix also announcing a one year paid paternity leave and maternity  leave for all employees, will other companies follow suit? We'll talk about  it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: The first republican presidential debate of 2016 tomorrow night on  Fox News. Donald Trump is the most successful candidate, if you measure by  social media reads. Speaking of the Donald, some people say the number who  watch the debate may, in fact, top the final episode of Trump's last  celebrity apprentice. </p><p>With me now from Cleveland where the debate will take place is Blake  Burman. So, Blake, what's Trump saying ahead of the big night?  </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Believe it or not, Deirdre, Donald  Trump is actually lowering expectations a bit. You just mentioned that  \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" the final episode of the last show had six million  viewers, a little more than that. </p><p>Some feel the debate here tomorrow night could actually top that. For a  little bit of perspective context there, the first primary debates of 2011,  four years ago, were about half that, but they didn't have the Trump  factor. Why so many people will be tuning in tomorrow night. </p><p>Still, though, Donald Trump lowering expectations talking about how he is  not a debater at all while these politicians as he calls them are. I want  you to take a little listen real quick to what he told Trish Regan this  afternoon about lowering those expectations, here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to set the bar so low, I  want to set that bar so low, you have you no idea. But we'll see what  happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: So, he said, we'll see what happens. He talked about lowering the  bar, laughing it off a little bit. We'll see what happens tomorrow night.  Donald Trump did say earlier today as well as he has last night that he  wants to approach this debate in a civil manner. But he also said, Deirdre,  if he's attacked, he would fight back. We'll see when that happens. </p><p>BOLTON: Yes. I was going to say...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURMAN: Who that happens thought in, how Donald Trump has thought.</p><p>BOLTON: ... yes. That seems like likely as in scale of 10 out of 10.</p><p>BURMAN: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Blake Burman joining me there from Cleveland, Ohio. Thank you very  much, Blake. </p><p>Well, for more on tomorrow's GOP debate, social media power, Matt Witheiler  from FlyBridge Capital Partners is here, as is Russ Frushtick, the  editorial director at  Product Hunt. Glad to have you both here. </p><p>So, what do you think about this debate? Let's just talk about it from a  media perspective, perhaps a number of viewers outpacing \"The Apprentice\"?  </p><p>MATT WITHEILER, FLYBRIDGE CAPITAL GENERAL PARTNER: Isn't really that  surprising? I mean, everybody I know who's going to watch and is playing  some form of drinking game involving Trump at some point. So, I think that  it actually will be a ratings boon for Fox. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. And, Russ, from a social media perspective, you heard  him say, I want to lower expectations so much.</p><p>RUSS FRUSHTICK, PRODUCT HUNTS EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: So, do you think he knows he's going to bomb but he's still just  counting on Twitter, Facebook and the rest for his messages? </p><p>FRUSHTICK: Well, first of all, he's being very humble. I mean, that's what  a good politician should lower expectations before a debate and then they  come out and make a big splash, I think he'll definitely do that here.  Whether it's a successful splash, helping his campaign, I don't know, but  he certainly has a lot of social media power. </p><p>BOLTON: He does indeed. I mean, and he has this sort of upwards of 23  percent reach, you know, the next candidate is Jeb Bush, around 12 percent.  So, love him or hate him. His message and his quote and quote, \"Authentic  brand,\" seems to be resonating even with some of it is ironic. </p><p>WITHEILER: Yes. I think that's right. I think he's going to drive a big  audience, whether you are for him or against him. It's really bringing  everybody to the table for this debate. </p><p>And so, they will be a tell-tale performance for him, and that will he be  able to convince people who, historically, have been anti-Trump to come on  his side of the camp it. And it will really depend on how he performs.  </p><p>BOLTON: Speaking of branding, going a little bit bigger, Disney versus  Netflix. If you had to put money on either one, who's your dog in the race?  </p><p>FRUSHTICK: Disney. Absolutely Disney.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>FRUSHTICK: I mean, Netflix is a good company and has a good product. Disney  is in it for the long haul. If you're look for a long-term investment,  they've been building these franchises like \"Star Wars\" and Marvel for the  last 10 years. </p><p>BOLTON: Yes. But they pay for that, I mean, it's like $4 billion a pop, $4  million a pop, sorry. </p><p>WITHEILER: Yes. No, that's exactly right. It's very expensive but at the  same time, they are getting a huge return for that. Because that content  that they produced is undistributed on Netflix. And so, when you think  about shows like \"Daredevil,\" which is a Marvel property which is owned by  Disney that's on Netflix, Disney is kind of taking revenue from one pocket  which is the network content pocket and paying it over to Netflix. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. Netflix also announcing an unlimited year of maternity and  paternity leave, essentially they also have unlimited vacation. But  essentially saying, listen, we trust you to be professional. You know what  time you can take and when. To me this spoke of the talent war?  </p><p>FRUSHTICK: It is part of it. I think another part of it is the -- this sort  of a very obvious strategy in the Silicon Valley space where it's like, oh,  you have unlimited time to take off, so people generally are very  conservative with how they use their time. </p><p>If you have three weeks, you're going to take three weeks. So, I think this  might be a good PR win for them, but also maybe a little bit of  gamesmanship in terms of how people use their maternity leave. </p><p>BOLTON: Right. In other words, nobody really wants to take more than his or  her peer, right?  </p><p>WITHEILER: Yes, I think that's right. And I think that from a PR  perspective, what it's really doing is it's winning Netflix a lot of points  with the millennial generation who wants culture and work life balance. And  Netflix doesn't want to lose employees because recruiting a new employee is  much harder and more expensive than retaining somebody. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Hold those thoughts. We're going to continue the  conservation. I'm going to be back with Matt and Russ in just a little bit  of time.</p><p>Allegations of overpricing, social media activists calling whole foods out  again. This time, though, for something as overpriced and zany as what  you're looking at right now on your screens.</p><p>And with two million views already on YouTube, Lexus's new hover board  getting a lot of publicity. Is it real? Tell us what you think. Tweet to us  @deirdrebolton, @riskrewardfbn.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Chances are you have engaged with Taboola's content before. The  platform recommends editorial and sponsored articles across many highly  trafficked web sites. The goal? Help publishers monetize their content  while creating a personalized experience for the user.</p><p>Co-founder and CEO, Adam Singolda is with me now. Adam, glad to have you  with us. </p><p>ADAM SINGOLDA, TABOOLA FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Thanks for having me. </p><p>BOLTON: I have often heard your company described as a search engine in  reverse? Is that accurate?  </p><p>SINGOLDA: Yes, I think it is. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. And for what reason, how does it work, how does it make what I  consume better targeted for me? </p><p>SINGOLDA: So, you know, I started the company eight years ago living with  my parents and trying to watch TV and I couldn't find anything to watch.  And I thought, you know people should not be looking for TV shows, TV shows  should be looking for me. </p><p>And I started the company, you know, with the vision to connect people with  content they may like they never knew existed, which is in reverse to what  you do with a search engine when you know exactly what you want to read. </p><p>So, with us, information hopefully it's finding you before you knew you  were supposed searching for it. </p><p>BOLTON: OK. And as far as my data, what happens? How do you find me?  </p><p>SINGOLDA: So, we work with some of the biggest media companies in the  world. From USA Today that we're announcing today, Gannett, Business  Insider, and many, many others. And at the bottom of the article do you  know how you usually see other articles you may like. We do that which  allows us to see what decisions are making when they finish consuming the  content.</p><p>BOLTON: So, in theory, it also gives sellers of products or services better  information on how and who to target? </p><p>SINGOLDA: Right. So, we're looking at all the information that's out there  definitely. You know, all the media companies we're working with and we're  trying to -- there are millions of different options trying to unless they  second decide what are the two or three things you may like and never knew  existed. </p><p>BOLTON: All right. Now, mobile is so important right now. I know you have,  as you referenced here, the deal with Gannett, how does it all fit  together?  </p><p>SINGOLDA: So, in general, what we're announcing today is it's exciting in  two ways. On the one side from the business perspective, we're announcing  that we expect to generate between 45 to $55 million in the next three  years to come with Gannett and USA Today. </p><p>And the second one which is perhaps even more exciting is where with the  industry is going where you buy. You know, I started the company eight  years ago thinking personalization is the difference between me and you,  and I think that was wrong.</p><p>If you think about the way you consume the web, think about when you wake  up in the morning and you drink your coffee on the big screen, how do you  behave consuming the news versus if you're on your way with your mobile  from a Facebook app, how is that different? </p><p>So, we envision the web, the future of the web to be sort of a dragon with  many, many heads. Whereby each head is an experience -- a different  experience of the web that is telling not only to me but to me right now. </p><p>BOLTON: To the activity that you're currently doing.</p><p>SINGOLDA: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: It makes all the sense in the world. Congratulations on the deal  with Gannett. We're glad to have you with. Adam Singolda joining me there.  He is the co-founder and CEO of Taboola.</p><p>If you build it, they will come, that seems to be the device and mantra.  We're going to show you the new plans for the tallest residential tower in  the world.</p><p>And then, asparagus grows after allegation of overpricing, social media  activists now accusing whole foods of selling $6 asparagus water. Find out  how the company reacted, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Elon Musk is saying that storage, the battery business could  generate, quote, \"A few billion dollars in 2017.\"</p><p>I am back right now with Matt Witheiler and Russ Frushtick. Thanks, guys,  for staying with me. So, what do make, we know that as far as the Tesla and  deliveries of cars, Elon Musk missed the target. But he's saying, wait,  wait, wait, there's my battery business, it's going to rocket. Yea or nay,  what do you say? </p><p>FRUSHTICK: Yes, I agree that there is more life there. You definitely don't  want to get into a fight where you're fighting against manufacturing and  the other big companies getting into this electronic -- electric car space.  But, you know, that's the issue, like they haven't been hitting their  numbers. So, it's not the best production. </p><p>BOLTON: Matt, we know that engineers do not hold these metrics against Elon  Musk. Almost anyone in the tech community that I speak with would lie down  in traffic for him because they say he puts his money where his mouth is.  OK, finally, sometimes he makes mistakes on numbers but the spirit is in  the right place? </p><p>WITHEILER: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: It that good enough for investors?</p><p>WITHEILER: I think it's good enough for its employees, it's good enough for  investors that the price of which Tesla had priced that. Big question in my  mind. It's easy to point to a shiny new object in battery business don't be  distracted by the actual numbers in cars, but it's very speculative in my  mind. </p><p>BOLTON: Yes, because the stock is already up, something like 30 percent  year-to-date. So, if you're an investor you do want something back for  that. All right. Speaking of a different kind of fuel, whole foods  apparently, selling asparagus water, which was essentially three stocks of  asparagus in a jar colored asparagus water. </p><p>This is supposed to be just in one store brand with California. But  hopefully it's really has this PR issues, price gouging nationwide, they're  not the only shop I should say to be facing this. Is this more  disappointing because hopefully this somehow supposed to be pure? </p><p>FRUSHTICK: I guess that's only their brand. They want to portray this pure  brand. But like, it also doesn't tell to surprise us. Every time I go to  the supermarket there is another crazy fruit and like a jar, oh, it's carry  water now.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. You will live to be 700 years old if you drink this. Matt,  what is your take?</p><p>WITHEILER: Yes, exactly. Didn't you drink it this morning...</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, there you go.</p><p>WITHEILER: ... before you even go to work? Now, I think that given the  problems that whole foods has had in New York with the Attorney General  here in allegations of  price kind of manipulation on how much they were  charging for products, this did not comment a good time for whole foods.</p><p>That being said, I'm pretty sure this was a prank and whoever is  responsible probably won't take it too long.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: And I look the company's response. If you think something is not  been weighed properly, just bring it back. We were joking, right?</p><p>WITHEILER: Exactly.</p><p>BOLTON: Like here's my half donut that should have been weighed or...</p><p>WITHEILER: My half drinks asparagus water.</p><p>BOLTON: There you go, there you go. Power and health to us all. Thank you  both for joining me there. Matt Witheiler, a general partner joining us  from FlyBridge Capital Partners, Russ Frushtick, editorial director at  Product Hunts.</p><p>Well, move over Marty McFly because Lexus introducing a real hover board.  So, they say, tweet us now. Tell us, real or fake, @deirdrebolton  @riskrewardfbn. What do you think?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Some of the top stories trending right now at foxbusiness.com.  Target, Walmart, 7-Eleven soon may have less junk at checkout counters.  Center for Science and the public interest calling for the removal of those  items because they cause obesity and can lead to diabetes. Fruits,  vegetables, and granola bars are suggested replacement. </p><p>On the health theme, Fitbit reporting its first quarterly numbers as a  public company. Wearables tech company earnings soaring. The company is  selling 4.5 million devices this quarter, up nearly three million from the  prior year. </p><p>And, Connecticut, the nation's most expensive place to die. New probate  fees resulting in relative receiving bills of up to a million dollars last  week to settle the estate of their loved one. </p><p>Well, speaking of transitions, we do want to let you know that \"Back to the  Future 2,\" made some people dream of a real hover board.

Deirdre Bolton gets us out  of this. Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST: All right. Melissa and David.  Thank you so much. We have breaking news to bring you here right away. A  senate IRS targeting report has been released. My colleague, Gerri Willis,  has been on the story. So, Gerri, what is the latest?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> GERRI WILLIS, THE WILLIS REPORT SHOW HOST: So, Deirdre, that's right. We  just got report moments ago. And here is what we're finding the big take  away, the IRS was delinquent in providing effective control, guidance and  direction in the processing of those tax-exempt application for 501-c3  status. That's what we're learning tonight. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And let me tell you, the report describes the culture within the IRS Exempt  Organizations Unit. We had no idea how dysfunctional it was. Listen to  this. Top management was never aware of five year delays in some of the  processing at some of these organizations applications. </p><p> In addition to that, people within the unit were improperly trained. They  didn't know the kind of material they were looking at, what they were  supposed to do, what the law regarding tax-exempt organizations was  supposed to be. There was in siding. People were managing folks were  halfway across the country, 2,000 miles away, that made it more difficult.</p><p> In addition to that, there were people who worked from home four days a  week, and it was difficult to get all the information flowing.  This made  it possible for Lois Lerner because she was very liberal in her outlook on  life, it made it possible for her to have her political point of view  represented and that's exactly what happened here, according to this  report.</p><p> They surveyed 1.5 million documents and 32 interviews with IRS employees,  staff and others. </p><p> BOLTON: So, Gerri, quick question here, I mean, as far as the staff views,  what are, for example, republicans saying to this because many feel like,  OK, some of the groups that are even right of center were clearly targeted. </p><p> WILLIS: That's right. And as you know, the president recently said they  were not.  But this report says, yes, they were. That the IRS systemically  selected tea party groups for targeting, and as I said, Lois Lerner had a  big role in this. Orrin Hatch today saying that he found evidence, and he  is the chairman of this committee that the administration's political  agenda guided the IRS actions; they're calling this gross mismanagement.</p><p> When you read the details of how the section was run, Deirdre, I don't  think there's a company you cover in technology that is run that way. </p><p> BOLTON: OK. And as you said, the president, this could go all the way up to  a PR problem for President Obama. </p><p> WILLIS: Well, the big question of course has been, has this targeting been  directed from the White House? Even though Orrin Hatch concludes that  that's what was happening, I saw none of it in the report. </p><p> So, we're still waiting to see if that's in fact the case, and that's the  big takeaway question so many people have at this time. But let me tell  you. Tonight, the Senate Finance Committee painting a picture of complete  disarray in this exempt organizations unit.</p><p> And I have to tell you, it sounds like they weren't just delinquent and  ineffective at controlling and guiding their employees, they didn't know  what they were supposed to be doing, it sounds like. </p><p> BOLTON: OK. Gerri, we are going to depend on you for updates. In the  meantime, thank you very much for bringing us breaking news on that Senate  Finance Committee report. </p><p> I want to get you to the markets because stocks close higher but  essentially went nowhere. If you look at the levels, oil prices slid. We  want to get you down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Lori  Rothman is there. Lori, what stood out to you about today's session?  </p><p> LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, the hundred-point  rally we had early fizzling certainly stood out. So, both said and done the  Dow is down 10 points to close at 17,540. You hit the nail with that  decline in oil prices. So, it looks like four days the down days for the  Dow. </p><p> The NASDAQ did post gains, about 34 points by the close. Lot of that had to  do with finally a turnaround in shares of Apple. Apple shares up 6/10 of a  percent, up for the first time in five days, down 14 percent still since  April. </p><p> We've been talking about the massive amounts of market value. Apple's given  up about $100 billion in that time period. Disney was another weight on the  Dow, 24 hours later after disappointing earnings report, disappointing  revenue to be exact. Apparently, people are cutting the cord, so the cable  business is of serious concern. </p><p>Disney also warning of mysterious dollar hit, $500 million hit next year to  the company because of our strong U.S. dollar. Twitter shares also hit a  new low today. A lot of speculation who will be the new CEO and when that  person will be appointed. Off almost 3 percent in the regular session. Also  Rico reported that Google, an acquisition by Google of Twitter is highly  unlikely. </p><p> After the bell, we just heard the latest earnings from Tesla, the electric  carmaker shares down around. They've been as low as 8 percent in the after- hours which is better than expected report. But here is the problem, Elon  Musk, CEO, lowered vehicle sales expectations. </p><p> He did promise 55,000 electric vehicles sold this year and he lowered that  mark, 50 to 55,000. So, that pretty much sums up the day, Deirdre. I'll  send it back over to you.</p><p> BOLTON: Lori, thank you so much. I'm going to pick up right where you left  off on Tesla. Lori just told you beat on the top and the bottom lines. But  this big question, can Elon Musk's company develop and deliver 55,000 cars,  you heard her say. It seems like not.</p><p> I want to bring in the president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo,  Jon Rettinger. So, Jon, first and foremost, what do you make of the  earnings, we'll talk about production in a minute. </p><p> JON RETTINGER, TECHNOBUFFALO PRESIDENT AND EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Sure. So, I  think people were disappointed by not hitting the sales number at 55,000  numbers. Numbers has been touted. We're supposed to have the model x this  year, the model x kept getting delayed. Now we're hearing we're going to  have it start shipping toward the end of the year. </p><p> But we heard blames of making sure that they were -- the partners were  going to be able to ship on time. And I think we're losing about 10 percent  of your total estimated sales is a big hit for the company. </p><p> BOLTON: OK. It certainly is indeed. And I mean, what do you make of Tesla,  right? Tesla is supposed to be next generation in Siri. We have Elon Musk  touting it as bigger, better, faster, stronger, but, I mean, other car  companies can meet their production standards?  </p><p> RETTINGER: Yes. So, Tesla is one of those companies that is being led by a  modern-day Steve Jobs. You have this reality extortion field. People love  the company but it follows no sense of logic with how the stock goes. I  want them to hear a few things that we didn't get from the earnings call. </p><p>Tesla has taken over 29,000 orders for the model x but has given no  estimation when its designs is going to go live. Cars are going to ship in  a few months. We don't even know what they've ordered at this point. I  would like to hear more about their power low, their home battery solution.  We don't know much about that. </p><p>Tesla has been promising autonomous drive called autopilot in the model x.  We're hearing very little about that other than it's been delayed. So,  there are a lot of question marks for the company, not to mention the  specter of their model 3, the affordable BMW 3 killer supposed to hitting  sometime in 2017. </p><p> BOLTON: OK. And, Jon, I mean, I know you are a fan, you have you driven  one, you have come on the show and talked about it. What does it mean for  the future? How much does it hurt Tesla to have this missed delivery for  the 55,000 cars?  </p><p> RETTINGER: If they deliver the Model X as expected and the car comes out to  the rave reviews that the Model S had, than almost 100 consumer reports  rating, it's not going to hurt the company long-term at all. But that is a  big but. </p><p> Every delay for the model X makes the expectations for that much higher. If  there is one problem with that car, if there's a battery explosion or  battery leak, it's going to spell big potential trouble. </p><p> BOLTON: All right. Jon, thanks so much for your input. Jon Rettinger  joining us there, president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo.</p><p> Switching gears puts on regulated energy theme, President Obama going all- out over the next several weeks to build support in Congress for a nuclear  deal. Take a listen to a speech that he gave at American University.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: Congressional rejection  of this deal leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to  preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option. Another war  in the Middle East. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON: Joining me now is Phil Flynn, senior market analyst for the Price  Futures Group, also author of The Energy Report. So, Phil, we have  alternative energy to talk about, traditional as well, I'd like to start  with that, what do you think of the president's remarks?  </p><p> PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP SENIOR MARKET ANALYST &amp; THE ENERGY REPORT  AUTHOR: Well, I think, you know, once again, the president is saying my way  or the highway. You know, if you look at how he always flames the debate.  It's either my way or we're going to have a war, there's no other  alternative. And that's not true. </p><p> You know, the truth is that there are many other alternatives. Number one,  for example, continuing the sanctions on Iran. They seem to be working  pretty darn well. That's what brought Iran to the table. But the president  always seems to do this. He always sees his vision is the only right one,  anybody who disagrees with him is the bad guy. </p><p> They don't understand. They want a war. And the truth of the matter is  there are other options, there's not just two. </p><p> BOLTON: OK. So, as far as that goes, Iran, top six in the world's largest  crude oil producers, what is the effect if this deal goes through this  nuclear deal on the oil market? </p><p> FLYNN: Well, I think we should look at both sides of it. First of all, if  it goes through, obviously we're going to be giving Iran what, $58 billion?  You know, maybe some of that is going to go into their energy industry to  try to bring that back online. </p><p> Maybe some of it will go to terrorism. You know, who knows? Because they  are the biggest state sponsored country of terrorism. But let's look at the  other side. What if Congress doesn't do this deal? What if they reject this  deal? And the president is saying, hey, guess what, guys, if you don't get  this deal, we're going to war.</p><p> What is it going to do to the cost of oil? It may cause a price spike  because the markets are going to believe the president and they are going  to be afraid that a war is going to be just around the corner. So, it could  do a lot of damage, you know. So, I think it's dangerous the way this  debate is being framed. </p><p> BOLTON: All right. Phil, we'll be checking in with you, I'm sure over the  next few weeks. Phil Flynn joining us there, senior market analyst for the  Price Futures Group, author of The Energy Report, with us there from  Chicago.</p><p> Stocks as you know, you heard from Lori, closing off their highs. Apple has  had a volatile few days, Bank of America today cutting its price target  from 142 to 130, changing the recommendation from a buy to a neutral. </p><p> Jason Rotman with me now. He is president of Lido Isle Advisors. He is a  bull. Mark Luschini joining me, a chief investment strategist at Janney  Montgomery Scott. He is an apple bear. Welcome to you both. Jason, would  you buy at these levels? It seems like, yes. </p><p> JASON ROTMAN, LIDO ISLE ADVISORS PRESIDENT: Absolutely. Absolutely,  Deirdre. I mean, the thing is, I would buy and I would continue to buy. In  other words, dollar cost average if the price continues to go down. Here's  one major reason, OK? </p><p> This is what is not really being talked about a lot, for whatever reason, I  don't know. 73 percent of the installed user base of Apple still has not  upgraded to the latest models. So, Apple is basically still crushing it in  my humble opinion, and 73 percent of the people still have not upgraded. </p><p> So, I think at the end of the day, it's going to be a Merry Christmas, it's  going to be a happy Hanukkah, it's going to be a happy holiday season for  Apple. I think now is the time to -- now is the time to buy on the dip.</p><p> BOLTON: Mark, I know you disagree. Again, what are you most worried about  with Apple? We know as far as hand set sales in China, Apple is number  three, behind Xiaomi and Huawei. Is this your concern or is it something  else? </p><p> MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Well,  it's really two things in terms of my concern. Now, one fundamental and one  technical. On the fundamental front, it's one of the things you just  mentioned, and that is of course China, in the slowdown there. And  obviously with the meltdown in equity prices, the impact on the wealth  affect there among Chinese consumers. </p><p> On the U.S. front or at least phone sales front is more to do with the fact  that perhaps the new disciplined consumer is less likely to upgrade to that  new iPhone 6 if they've had a recent iPhone 5 purchase. And as a  consequence, may continue to defer that purchase. From a technical  standpoint, we've seen no less than three previous time to the price points  reaching that 130 to $134 level that the price has been turned away. </p><p> And this was the most recent one which in our view, was going to lead to  potential irritation in the share price. Ultimately, it turned out to be  worse. We turn back our position in the portfolio to $125 about two weeks  ago and we stayed sidelined for the time being. </p><p> BOLTON: OK. Mark, point well made. Jason, I know as you said, you're still  a buyer. Where does Apple go from here? What other tricks fundamentally  does it have up its sleeve? Is it Apple TV? Are there certain products that  you think will be catalysts?  </p><p> ROTMAN: Yes. That's a really great question. And really I'm going to  respond with two major points. Number one, technically, Apple has fallen  below its 200-day moving average, 17 times only since the past 30 to 60  days to rebound above it, I think this is going to be no different.  </p><p> Now, to answer your question from a fundamental standpoint. We're coming in  to a holiday season. Again, 73 percent of the people have not upgraded yet.  I adamantly disagree with the fact or the theory that people are less  likely to upgrade from 5 to 6, I don't think that makes any sense. </p><p> People are going to need to upgrade and Apple is a brilliant marketing  company, they're going to have a  huge holiday season. I think now is the  time to buy for that reason alone. </p><p> BOLTON: All right. We will leave it there. We thank you for your time for  your insights.</p><p> ROTMAN: Thank you.</p><p> BOLTON: Jason Rotman joining us there. Mark Luschini as well. We thank you  both.</p><p> When we come back, democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee calling on Tim Cook  of Apple to release employee diversity data. Our next guest says Silicon  Valley companies are being unfairly targeted on this issue.</p><p> Then you may be out of luck because of Suck. Forget your credit score?  According to a new Facebook patent filed. Your Facebook friend's credit  scores could keep you from borrowing money. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BOLTON: Some of the stories we're following for you right now. Debris,  including part of an aircraft wing, is confirmed to be from the missing  Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane. It has been more than a year since the plane  disappeared with 239 people on board.</p><p> The FBI is investigating the security of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail  server. This is the one that she used when she was Secretary of State. The  probe comes days after watchdogs from the state department and the  intelligence community asked the Justice Department to explore whether or  not classified material was improperly shared or stored on the e-mail  account. </p><p> Security regulators are approving a final rule that requires public  companies to disclose the ratios between annual comp of CEO's and median  pay of employees. As you see, consider this change for years, it is finally  here.</p><p> And Representative Barbara Lee, a democrat from California calling on tech  companies including Apple to release federal data on diversity of their  workforces. Lee was in Silicon Valley this week turning up the heat on the  tech community to hire more African-Americans.</p><p> Well, last spring, the tech community did sneak into release details on the  demographics of its employees. Yahoo, Google, LinkedIn among the first to  publish stats. One of the reasons they did, a push from our next guest. </p><p> Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr. is with me now. He is an instrumental voice in  this push for diversity. He is with me on the phone. Reverend, so glad  you're with us. You have encouraged tech companies to share more  information, calling on Congress to backup that call. Why is it so  important for all of these companies to share their data in your view? </p><p> JESSE JACKSON SR., RAINBOWPUSH COALITION FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT: Hey, Deirdre.  A lot of these employers are in our country. They're the fastest growth  industry and they've been from the government and upon consumers. </p><p> We're not sending out Apple sending them out of the top 25 from 189 board  members, 36 women were African-American, we have Latinos. And just to last  year, about Twitter 49 blacks men, 16 Latinos, Facebook, 1600 employees,  140 blacks, just 7 blacks from the west different employees. </p><p>Twitter, I mean, Yahoo have 6,000 employees, 138 are black. So, it's not a  pretty picture. </p><p> BOLTON: It's not a pretty picture. And even Nancy Lee, and I'm going to  look at my notes here, reverend, to read the quote, \"Google's director of  people operation told the San Jose Mercury news last spring. When we look  around at the industry, we think we're doing OK, but it is not something we  want to tout.\"</p><p> In your view, what is the number one most practical way that you think that  tech companies can improve? How can they reach out to different  communities, and therefore, recruit with a wider net?  </p><p> JACKSON SR: With the set goals, targets and timetables, almost the least  accepted federal standard, these comes as CEO 1 and contract compliance  laws are very important. The government then land for them to file the  yield 1 report. It's just that we should publish again as what they have  come in the last year. </p><p> But they all have a great difference of people's color from their boards  and the women. In the six weeks I went three steps with it, unlike three  blacks and three Latinos, employment is around 2 percent. And I think that  enforcing laws of fair practices for these companies is important. </p><p> BOLTON: Reverend, is it more important to have diversity in the rank and  file, or is it more important in management to set an example? </p><p> JACKSON SR: Well, both examples, both of the employers, there are qualified  people at every level. They spend more time looking for each one of the  workers from India, from Asia, than training young people right here at  home. And that's a big piece of consideration. </p><p> There is no talent deficit. There is an6 opportunity deficit. And besides  each of those etiquette which we advocate very much at RainbowPush and  engineers, the biggest employee base is now in take. </p><p> It's ad agencies, it's marketing. It's non-tech workers, that they are  hovering around 2 percent in those categories. Some of them from the exempt  from any other obligation, they stand up to what's just and fair. </p><p> BOLTON: OK. Well, we're glad to have your thoughts on that. Reverend Jesse  Jackson Sr., joining us there from the RainbowPush Coalition.</p><p> Our next guest takes an opposite view. Kevin Jackson is with me now. He's a  former management consultant to some of the world's largest companies. He  is with me now from St. Louis. </p><p> So, Kevin, what about this argument that the best people have to be found  and perhaps there's just ways to get more people in that original pool?  </p><p> KEVIN JACKSON, FORMER MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, first of  all, everything Jesse Jackson just said is nonsense. The fact of the matter  is, it's people like him that aren't getting qualified blacks jobs because  if you're going to hire a black person, you got to understand you're  bringing Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, the Department of Justice, the EEOC,  the Department of Labor, and everybody else with you to that job. So,  that's issue number one. And issue number two...</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BOLTON: Just to stop you there, Kevin, what do you mean by that? That in  other words, one employee has too much baggage to even focus on his or her  job hunt?  </p><p> JACKSON: That's exactly right. If you hire a white kid, that white kid  can't do anything, he can get racist e-mails, calling him cracker or  anything else he wants. And he can't do anything. He can go HR, and all he  can do is just -- they'll laugh together, but they won't have a lawsuit. </p><p> But let a black kid get anything or black person at a company, have  anything that isn't even related to him, and you've got everybody Jesse  Jackson, and everybody coming to the fore to try to profiteer because  that's what's happened in American's business. American business...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BOLTON: So, Kevin, essentially you're saying if employers are unwilling or  less willing to hire minorities because they're afraid of potential  lawsuits, in case something goes wrong?  </p><p> JACKSON: Absolutely. And they won't tell you that but that's a fact. And  then the other part of it about what Jesse Jackson is looking at. He gave  you all kinds of statistics about how many blacks, how many women, how many  browns, or whatever. </p><p> How about we focus on how many people are truly qualified for jobs. The  fact is, Google, Yahoo, and everybody he said will hire the best person if  they're pink, if they're purple, if they're striped. They don't care. And  that's the problem that Jesse Jackson has in waging a lawsuit against these  people.</p><p> It's he knows they want the best people. It's the companies that allow this  gangster type of mentality to occur that says you've got to have a certain  number of blacks, whites, or whatever. I want qualified people. Business  wants qualified people and they don't want the racial strife that comes  with Jesse Jackson and his ilk. So, that's all that America is looking for. </p><p> BOLTON: So, Kevin, to your point, the H1-B Visas that he referenced and  that is to say, that allows U.S. companies to reach out and keep students  who are here from India, China, or Russia, wherever, there are 3 to 4  million jobs that go unfilled every month in the U.S. because there is a  dearth of either math or engineering or science skills. So, maybe that's  where we start is more with education? </p><p> JACKSON: Well, the fact of the matter is, if Google, the best people are in  the United States, I guarantee you, Google, Yahoo, Apple and all those  companies want them. They will do a job fair, they don't care what those  people look like, what they sound like, they will translate for them.  They'll do whatever it takes to get the best employees.</p><p> And if there's 3 million H1-B 1's contrary to what Obama or Jesse Jackson  or the race pimps tell you, they will hire them and those people are  waiting because they're the best employees. And that's the problem is the - - the education system in America is not producing the best employees  anymore. </p><p> Instead, what we're doing is we're coddling people. We're saying, hey, use  this EEOC guidelines and all this other nonsense that business -- that  doesn't further business. Use those guidelines to get people hired but  don't hire the best. That's why those jobs are unfilled. </p><p> BOLTON: All right. Kevin Jackson, good clear view. We're so glad to have  you with us. Joining us there from St. Louis.</p><p> So, when we come back, Facebook, your friend's credit, well, they could  affect your own. A patent just filed has our next guest second-guessing his  friend requests.</p><p> And Lexus, finally unveiling video of a prototype of a hover board. Social  media is questioning its authenticity. Weigh in, tell us. Is it real? Is it  Fake? You can tweet to us @deirdrebolton, to me directly or to the show  @riskrewardfbn.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BOLTON: Next time you want to loan your Facebook friends may be important,  more important than the papers you give to the bank. Social network filed  for a new patent that would allow creditors to assess your creditworthiness  based on the credit ratings of the people in your social network.</p><p> John Ulzheimer is with me now. He is CreditSesame.com president of consumer  education. John, first and foremost, what do you make of this idea? What if  I was a musician and my former career, now I'm an investment banker, but if  my creative friends are still broke, I'm penalized?  </p><p> JOHN ULZHEIMER, CREDITSESAME.COM PRESIDENT: Well, the challenge that you  face is that there's this hypothesis in the world of social media/risk  management that birds of a feather tend to flock together. </p><p> And if you have a large or disproportionate number of friends or  connections on social media that indicate that they're high risk, then the  likelihood of you being high risk, again, in their hypothesis is going to  be much more likely, and therefore they may actually consider that when  determining whether or not to do business with you and under what terms. </p><p> BOLTON: All right. But maybe times have changed, right? And I want to play  for you, John, we had Mark Luschini as a guest. He's a co-founder of  PayPal. Here's what he told me about the new credit environment.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Credit  works fairly well for established consumers' financial products. But if  you're a young person fresh off the college bench, you're about to move tax  brackets most likely. And the FICO score looks back and says, well, you  know, just hold it up there. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON: So, in that sense, we know that Mark Luschini with a firm is  actually loaning money to people with computer science degrees and other  indicators, that even if they don't have money at that time, they will have  it. </p><p> ULZHEIMER: Yes, that's right.  And it's a very good point. The CSPV defines  those people as the invisible. Meaning that they don't have any sort of  established credit history, other than probably some student loans and  maybe some collections from their former apartment complexes. </p><p> And it's true that credit scoring systems are much more effective when you  have a long history, a robust credit history to look back onto determine  whether you're going to be a subsequent risk going forward than the smaller  the credit report. </p><p> And if you have no credit report, lenders still want to do business with  you. And so, that's when they were going to start looking for the secondary  and tertiary types of data sources to determine whether or not to do  business. </p><p> Look, your Facebook score is never going to replace your Equifax credit  report and your advantage score and your FICO score and your Transunion  credit report, simply isn't going to do it. </p><p> But, where it can be very effective is, for example, my niece who is about  to graduate from school, probably has very little credit history and is  going want to lease an apartment, is going to want to buy a car, is going  to buy a house someday. </p><p> And to penalize her because she has no robust credit history, without  perhaps, looking how quality her connections are on Facebook. It seems to  be a little bit unfair and actually can work in someone's favor. This isn't  always going to work against somebody, it can actually work in your favor  in many instances.  </p><p> BOLTON: All right. John, great to have you with us. I should mention as  well, Facebook, other big tech companies they filed for patents that they  don't use, maybe this is just filing to file it.</p><p> When we come back, Disney's stock dropping more than 9 percent. Netflix  going to an all-time high, a new media battle is brewing. </p><p> My panel guest will tell you which companies as they think will come out on  top. Netflix also announcing a one year paid paternity leave and maternity  leave for all employees, will other companies follow suit? We'll talk about  it.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BOLTON: The first republican presidential debate of 2016 tomorrow night on  Fox News. Donald Trump is the most successful candidate, if you measure by  social media reads. Speaking of the Donald, some people say the number who  watch the debate may, in fact, top the final episode of Trump's last  celebrity apprentice. </p><p> With me now from Cleveland where the debate will take place is Blake  Burman. So, Blake, what's Trump saying ahead of the big night?  </p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Believe it or not, Deirdre, Donald  Trump is actually lowering expectations a bit. You just mentioned that  \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" the final episode of the last show had six million  viewers, a little more than that. </p><p> Some feel the debate here tomorrow night could actually top that. For a  little bit of perspective context there, the first primary debates of 2011,  four years ago, were about half that, but they didn't have the Trump  factor. Why so many people will be tuning in tomorrow night. </p><p> Still, though, Donald Trump lowering expectations talking about how he is  not a debater at all while these politicians as he calls them are. I want  you to take a little listen real quick to what he told Trish Regan this  afternoon about lowering those expectations, here it is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to set the bar so low, I  want to set that bar so low, you have you no idea. But we'll see what  happens.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN: So, he said, we'll see what happens. He talked about lowering the  bar, laughing it off a little bit. We'll see what happens tomorrow night.  Donald Trump did say earlier today as well as he has last night that he  wants to approach this debate in a civil manner. But he also said, Deirdre,  if he's attacked, he would fight back. We'll see when that happens. </p><p> BOLTON: Yes. I was going to say...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BURMAN: Who that happens thought in, how Donald Trump has thought.</p><p> BOLTON: ... yes. That seems like likely as in scale of 10 out of 10.</p><p> BURMAN: Yes.</p><p> BOLTON: Blake Burman joining me there from Cleveland, Ohio. Thank you very  much, Blake. </p><p> Well, for more on tomorrow's GOP debate, social media power, Matt Witheiler  from FlyBridge Capital Partners is here, as is Russ Frushtick, the  editorial director at  Product Hunt. Glad to have you both here. </p><p> So, what do you think about this debate? Let's just talk about it from a  media perspective, perhaps a number of viewers outpacing \"The Apprentice\"?  </p><p> MATT WITHEILER, FLYBRIDGE CAPITAL GENERAL PARTNER: Isn't really that  surprising? I mean, everybody I know who's going to watch and is playing  some form of drinking game involving Trump at some point. So, I think that  it actually will be a ratings boon for Fox. </p><p> BOLTON: All right. And, Russ, from a social media perspective, you heard  him say, I want to lower expectations so much.</p><p> RUSS FRUSHTICK, PRODUCT HUNTS EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Yes.</p><p> BOLTON: So, do you think he knows he's going to bomb but he's still just  counting on Twitter, Facebook and the rest for his messages? </p><p> FRUSHTICK: Well, first of all, he's being very humble. I mean, that's what  a good politician should lower expectations before a debate and then they  come out and make a big splash, I think he'll definitely do that here.  Whether it's a successful splash, helping his campaign, I don't know, but  he certainly has a lot of social media power. </p><p> BOLTON: He does indeed. I mean, and he has this sort of upwards of 23  percent reach, you know, the next candidate is Jeb Bush, around 12 percent.  So, love him or hate him. His message and his quote and quote, \"Authentic  brand,\" seems to be resonating even with some of it is ironic. </p><p> WITHEILER: Yes. I think that's right. I think he's going to drive a big  audience, whether you are for him or against him. It's really bringing  everybody to the table for this debate. </p><p> And so, they will be a tell-tale performance for him, and that will he be  able to convince people who, historically, have been anti-Trump to come on  his side of the camp it. And it will really depend on how he performs.  </p><p> BOLTON: Speaking of branding, going a little bit bigger, Disney versus  Netflix. If you had to put money on either one, who's your dog in the race?  </p><p> FRUSHTICK: Disney. Absolutely Disney.</p><p> BOLTON: Yes.</p><p> FRUSHTICK: I mean, Netflix is a good company and has a good product. Disney  is in it for the long haul. If you're look for a long-term investment,  they've been building these franchises like \"Star Wars\" and Marvel for the  last 10 years. </p><p> BOLTON: Yes. But they pay for that, I mean, it's like $4 billion a pop, $4  million a pop, sorry. </p><p> WITHEILER: Yes. No, that's exactly right. It's very expensive but at the  same time, they are getting a huge return for that. Because that content  that they produced is undistributed on Netflix. And so, when you think  about shows like \"Daredevil,\" which is a Marvel property which is owned by  Disney that's on Netflix, Disney is kind of taking revenue from one pocket  which is the network content pocket and paying it over to Netflix. </p><p> BOLTON: OK. Netflix also announcing an unlimited year of maternity and  paternity leave, essentially they also have unlimited vacation. But  essentially saying, listen, we trust you to be professional. You know what  time you can take and when. To me this spoke of the talent war?  </p><p> FRUSHTICK: It is part of it. I think another part of it is the -- this sort  of a very obvious strategy in the Silicon Valley space where it's like, oh,  you have unlimited time to take off, so people generally are very  conservative with how they use their time. </p><p> If you have three weeks, you're going to take three weeks. So, I think this  might be a good PR win for them, but also maybe a little bit of  gamesmanship in terms of how people use their maternity leave. </p><p> BOLTON: Right. In other words, nobody really wants to take more than his or  her peer, right?  </p><p> WITHEILER: Yes, I think that's right. And I think that from a PR  perspective, what it's really doing is it's winning Netflix a lot of points  with the millennial generation who wants culture and work life balance. And  Netflix doesn't want to lose employees because recruiting a new employee is  much harder and more expensive than retaining somebody. </p><p> BOLTON: All right. Hold those thoughts. We're going to continue the  conservation. I'm going to be back with Matt and Russ in just a little bit  of time.</p><p> Allegations of overpricing, social media activists calling whole foods out  again. This time, though, for something as overpriced and zany as what  you're looking at right now on your screens.</p><p> And with two million views already on YouTube, Lexus's new hover board  getting a lot of publicity. Is it real? Tell us what you think. Tweet to us  @deirdrebolton, @riskrewardfbn.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BOLTON: Chances are you have engaged with Taboola's content before. The  platform recommends editorial and sponsored articles across many highly  trafficked web sites. The goal? Help publishers monetize their content  while creating a personalized experience for the user.</p><p> Co-founder and CEO, Adam Singolda is with me now. Adam, glad to have you  with us. </p><p> ADAM SINGOLDA, TABOOLA FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Thanks for having me. </p><p> BOLTON: I have often heard your company described as a search engine in  reverse? Is that accurate?  </p><p> SINGOLDA: Yes, I think it is. </p><p> BOLTON: OK. And for what reason, how does it work, how does it make what I  consume better targeted for me? </p><p> SINGOLDA: So, you know, I started the company eight years ago living with  my parents and trying to watch TV and I couldn't find anything to watch.  And I thought, you know people should not be looking for TV shows, TV shows  should be looking for me. </p><p> And I started the company, you know, with the vision to connect people with  content they may like they never knew existed, which is in reverse to what  you do with a search engine when you know exactly what you want to read. </p><p> So, with us, information hopefully it's finding you before you knew you  were supposed searching for it. </p><p> BOLTON: OK. And as far as my data, what happens? How do you find me?  </p><p> SINGOLDA: So, we work with some of the biggest media companies in the  world. From USA Today that we're announcing today, Gannett, Business  Insider, and many, many others. And at the bottom of the article do you  know how you usually see other articles you may like. We do that which  allows us to see what decisions are making when they finish consuming the  content.</p><p> BOLTON: So, in theory, it also gives sellers of products or services better  information on how and who to target? </p><p> SINGOLDA: Right. So, we're looking at all the information that's out there  definitely. You know, all the media companies we're working with and we're  trying to -- there are millions of different options trying to unless they  second decide what are the two or three things you may like and never knew  existed. </p><p> BOLTON: All right. Now, mobile is so important right now. I know you have,  as you referenced here, the deal with Gannett, how does it all fit  together?  </p><p> SINGOLDA: So, in general, what we're announcing today is it's exciting in  two ways. On the one side from the business perspective, we're announcing  that we expect to generate between 45 to $55 million in the next three  years to come with Gannett and USA Today. </p><p> And the second one which is perhaps even more exciting is where with the  industry is going where you buy. You know, I started the company eight  years ago thinking personalization is the difference between me and you,  and I think that was wrong.</p><p> If you think about the way you consume the web, think about when you wake  up in the morning and you drink your coffee on the big screen, how do you  behave consuming the news versus if you're on your way with your mobile  from a Facebook app, how is that different? </p><p> So, we envision the web, the future of the web to be sort of a dragon with  many, many heads. Whereby each head is an experience -- a different  experience of the web that is telling not only to me but to me right now. </p><p> BOLTON: To the activity that you're currently doing.</p><p> SINGOLDA: Right.</p><p> BOLTON: It makes all the sense in the world. Congratulations on the deal  with Gannett. We're glad to have you with. Adam Singolda joining me there.  He is the co-founder and CEO of Taboola.</p><p> If you build it, they will come, that seems to be the device and mantra.  We're going to show you the new plans for the tallest residential tower in  the world.</p><p> And then, asparagus grows after allegation of overpricing, social media  activists now accusing whole foods of selling $6 asparagus water. Find out  how the company reacted, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BOLTON: Elon Musk is saying that storage, the battery business could  generate, quote, \"A few billion dollars in 2017.\"</p><p> I am back right now with Matt Witheiler and Russ Frushtick. Thanks, guys,  for staying with me. So, what do make, we know that as far as the Tesla and  deliveries of cars, Elon Musk missed the target. But he's saying, wait,  wait, wait, there's my battery business, it's going to rocket. Yea or nay,  what do you say? </p><p> FRUSHTICK: Yes, I agree that there is more life there. You definitely don't  want to get into a fight where you're fighting against manufacturing and  the other big companies getting into this electronic -- electric car space.  But, you know, that's the issue, like they haven't been hitting their  numbers. So, it's not the best production. </p><p> BOLTON: Matt, we know that engineers do not hold these metrics against Elon  Musk. Almost anyone in the tech community that I speak with would lie down  in traffic for him because they say he puts his money where his mouth is.  OK, finally, sometimes he makes mistakes on numbers but the spirit is in  the right place? </p><p> WITHEILER: Yes.</p><p> BOLTON: It that good enough for investors?</p><p> WITHEILER: I think it's good enough for its employees, it's good enough for  investors that the price of which Tesla had priced that. Big question in my  mind. It's easy to point to a shiny new object in battery business don't be  distracted by the actual numbers in cars, but it's very speculative in my  mind. </p><p> BOLTON: Yes, because the stock is already up, something like 30 percent  year-to-date. So, if you're an investor you do want something back for  that. All right. Speaking of a different kind of fuel, whole foods  apparently, selling asparagus water, which was essentially three stocks of  asparagus in a jar colored asparagus water. </p><p> This is supposed to be just in one store brand with California. But  hopefully it's really has this PR issues, price gouging nationwide, they're  not the only shop I should say to be facing this. Is this more  disappointing because hopefully this somehow supposed to be pure? </p><p> FRUSHTICK: I guess that's only their brand. They want to portray this pure  brand. But like, it also doesn't tell to surprise us. Every time I go to  the supermarket there is another crazy fruit and like a jar, oh, it's carry  water now.</p><p> BOLTON: Yes. You will live to be 700 years old if you drink this. Matt,  what is your take?</p><p> WITHEILER: Yes, exactly. Didn't you drink it this morning...</p><p> BOLTON: Yes, there you go.</p><p> WITHEILER: ... before you even go to work? Now, I think that given the  problems that whole foods has had in New York with the Attorney General  here in allegations of  price kind of manipulation on how much they were  charging for products, this did not comment a good time for whole foods.</p><p> That being said, I'm pretty sure this was a prank and whoever is  responsible probably won't take it too long.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BOLTON: And I look the company's response. If you think something is not  been weighed properly, just bring it back. We were joking, right?</p><p> WITHEILER: Exactly.</p><p> BOLTON: Like here's my half donut that should have been weighed or...</p><p> WITHEILER: My half drinks asparagus water.</p><p> BOLTON: There you go, there you go. Power and health to us all. Thank you  both for joining me there. Matt Witheiler, a general partner joining us  from FlyBridge Capital Partners, Russ Frushtick, editorial director at  Product Hunts.</p><p> Well, move over Marty McFly because Lexus introducing a real hover board.  So, they say, tweet us now. Tell us, real or fake, @deirdrebolton  @riskrewardfbn. What do you think?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BOLTON: Some of the top stories trending right now at foxbusiness.com.  Target, Walmart, 7-Eleven soon may have less junk at checkout counters.  Center for Science and the public interest calling for the removal of those  items because they cause obesity and can lead to diabetes. Fruits,  vegetables, and granola bars are suggested replacement. </p><p> On the health theme, Fitbit reporting its first quarterly numbers as a  public company. Wearables tech company earnings soaring. The company is  selling 4.5 million devices this quarter, up nearly three million from the  prior year. </p><p> And, Connecticut, the nation's most expensive place to die. New probate  fees resulting in relative receiving bills of up to a million dollars last  week to settle the estate of their loved one. </p><p> Well, speaking of transitions, we do want to let you know that \"Back to the  Future 2,\" made some people dream of a real hover board. Lexus is saying it  did. Take a look at this video, releasing a full video of pro-skate  boarder. They say it's real. Interested tie but it will not be on sale  soon. </p><p> Thank you so much for joining us on Risk &amp; Reward. Glad to have you with  us. Charles Payne is next.

Deirdre Bolton gets us out of this. Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST: All right. Melissa and David. Thank you so much. We have breaking news to bring you here right away. A senate IRS targeting report has been released. My colleague, Gerri Willis, has been on the story. So, Gerri, what is the latest?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GERRI WILLIS, THE WILLIS REPORT SHOW HOST: So, Deirdre, that's right. We just got report moments ago. And here is what we're finding the big take away, the IRS was delinquent in providing effective control, guidance and direction in the processing of those tax-exempt application for 501-c3 status. That's what we're learning tonight.</p><p/><p>And let me tell you, the report describes the culture within the IRS Exempt Organizations Unit. We had no idea how dysfunctional it was. Listen to this. Top management was never aware of five year delays in some of the processing at some of these organizations applications.</p><p/><p>In addition to that, people within the unit were improperly trained. They didn't know the kind of material they were looking at, what they were supposed to do, what the law regarding tax-exempt organizations was supposed to be. There was in siding. People were managing folks were halfway across the country, 2,000 miles away, that made it more difficult.</p><p/><p>In addition to that, there were people who worked from home four days a week, and it was difficult to get all the information flowing. This made it possible for Lois Lerner because she was very liberal in her outlook on life, it made it possible for her to have her political point of view represented and that's exactly what happened here, according to this report.</p><p/><p>They surveyed 1.5 million documents and 32 interviews with IRS employees, staff and others.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, Gerri, quick question here, I mean, as far as the staff views, what are, for example, republicans saying to this because many feel like, OK, some of the groups that are even right of center were clearly targeted.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: That's right. And as you know, the president recently said they were not. But this report says, yes, they were. That the IRS systemically selected tea party groups for targeting, and as I said, Lois Lerner had a big role in this. Orrin Hatch today saying that he found evidence, and he is the chairman of this committee that the administration's political agenda guided the IRS actions; they're calling this gross mismanagement.</p><p/><p>When you read the details of how the section was run, Deirdre, I don't think there's a company you cover in technology that is run that way.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. And as you said, the president, this could go all the way up to a PR problem for President Obama.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, the big question of course has been, has this targeting been directed from the White House? Even though Orrin Hatch concludes that that's what was happening, I saw none of it in the report.</p><p/><p>So, we're still waiting to see if that's in fact the case, and that's the big takeaway question so many people have at this time. But let me tell you. Tonight, the Senate Finance Committee painting a picture of complete disarray in this exempt organizations unit.</p><p/><p>And I have to tell you, it sounds like they weren't just delinquent and ineffective at controlling and guiding their employees, they didn't know what they were supposed to be doing, it sounds like.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Gerri, we are going to depend on you for updates. In the meantime, thank you very much for bringing us breaking news on that Senate Finance Committee report.</p><p/><p>I want to get you to the markets because stocks close higher but essentially went nowhere. If you look at the levels, oil prices slid. We want to get you down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Lori Rothman is there. Lori, what stood out to you about today's session?</p><p/><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, the hundred-point rally we had early fizzling certainly stood out. So, both said and done the Dow is down 10 points to close at 17,540. You hit the nail with that decline in oil prices. So, it looks like four days the down days for the Dow.</p><p/><p>The NASDAQ did post gains, about 34 points by the close. Lot of that had to do with finally a turnaround in shares of Apple. Apple shares up 6/10 of a percent, up for the first time in five days, down 14 percent still since April.</p><p/><p>We've been talking about the massive amounts of market value. Apple's given up about $100 billion in that time period. Disney was another weight on the Dow, 24 hours later after disappointing earnings report, disappointing revenue to be exact. Apparently, people are cutting the cord, so the cable business is of serious concern.</p><p/><p>Disney also warning of mysterious dollar hit, $500 million hit next year to the company because of our strong U.S. dollar. Twitter shares also hit a new low today. A lot of speculation who will be the new CEO and when that person will be appointed. Off almost 3 percent in the regular session. Also Rico reported that Google, an acquisition by Google of Twitter is highly unlikely.</p><p/><p>After the bell, we just heard the latest earnings from Tesla, the electric carmaker shares down around. They've been as low as 8 percent in the after- hours which is better than expected report. But here is the problem, Elon Musk, CEO, lowered vehicle sales expectations.</p><p/><p>He did promise 55,000 electric vehicles sold this year and he lowered that mark, 50 to 55,000. So, that pretty much sums up the day, Deirdre. I'll send it back over to you.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Lori, thank you so much. I'm going to pick up right where you left off on Tesla. Lori just told you beat on the top and the bottom lines. But this big question, can Elon Musk's company develop and deliver 55,000 cars, you heard her say. It seems like not.</p><p/><p>I want to bring in the president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo, Jon Rettinger. So, Jon, first and foremost, what do you make of the earnings, we'll talk about production in a minute.</p><p/><p>JON RETTINGER, TECHNOBUFFALO PRESIDENT AND EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Sure. So, I think people were disappointed by not hitting the sales number at 55,000 numbers. Numbers has been touted. We're supposed to have the model x this year, the model x kept getting delayed. Now we're hearing we're going to have it start shipping toward the end of the year.</p><p/><p>But we heard blames of making sure that they were -- the partners were going to be able to ship on time. And I think we're losing about 10 percent of your total estimated sales is a big hit for the company.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. It certainly is indeed. And I mean, what do you make of Tesla, right? Tesla is supposed to be next generation in Siri. We have Elon Musk touting it as bigger, better, faster, stronger, but, I mean, other car companies can meet their production standards?</p><p/><p>RETTINGER: Yes. So, Tesla is one of those companies that is being led by a modern-day Steve Jobs. You have this reality extortion field. People love the company but it follows no sense of logic with how the stock goes. I want them to hear a few things that we didn't get from the earnings call.</p><p/><p>Tesla has taken over 29,000 orders for the model x but has given no estimation when its designs is going to go live. Cars are going to ship in a few months. We don't even know what they've ordered at this point. I would like to hear more about their power low, their home battery solution. We don't know much about that.</p><p/><p>Tesla has been promising autonomous drive called autopilot in the model x. We're hearing very little about that other than it's been delayed. So, there are a lot of question marks for the company, not to mention the specter of their model 3, the affordable BMW 3 killer supposed to hitting sometime in 2017.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. And, Jon, I mean, I know you are a fan, you have you driven one, you have come on the show and talked about it. What does it mean for the future? How much does it hurt Tesla to have this missed delivery for the 55,000 cars?</p><p/><p>RETTINGER: If they deliver the Model X as expected and the car comes out to the rave reviews that the Model S had, than almost 100 consumer reports rating, it's not going to hurt the company long-term at all. But that is a big but.</p><p/><p>Every delay for the model X makes the expectations for that much higher. If there is one problem with that car, if there's a battery explosion or battery leak, it's going to spell big potential trouble.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Jon, thanks so much for your input. Jon Rettinger joining us there, president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo.</p><p/><p>Switching gears puts on regulated energy theme, President Obama going all- out over the next several weeks to build support in Congress for a nuclear deal. Take a listen to a speech that he gave at American University.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: Congressional rejection of this deal leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option. Another war in the Middle East.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Joining me now is Phil Flynn, senior market analyst for the Price Futures Group, also author of The Energy Report. So, Phil, we have alternative energy to talk about, traditional as well, I'd like to start with that, what do you think of the president's remarks?</p><p/><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP SENIOR MARKET ANALYST &amp; THE ENERGY REPORT AUTHOR: Well, I think, you know, once again, the president is saying my way or the highway. You know, if you look at how he always flames the debate. It's either my way or we're going to have a war, there's no other alternative. And that's not true.</p><p/><p>You know, the truth is that there are many other alternatives. Number one, for example, continuing the sanctions on Iran. They seem to be working pretty darn well. That's what brought Iran to the table. But the president always seems to do this. He always sees his vision is the only right one, anybody who disagrees with him is the bad guy.</p><p/><p>They don't understand. They want a war. And the truth of the matter is there are other options, there's not just two.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. So, as far as that goes, Iran, top six in the world's largest crude oil producers, what is the effect if this deal goes through this nuclear deal on the oil market?</p><p/><p>FLYNN: Well, I think we should look at both sides of it. First of all, if it goes through, obviously we're going to be giving Iran what, $58 billion? You know, maybe some of that is going to go into their energy industry to try to bring that back online.</p><p/><p>Maybe some of it will go to terrorism. You know, who knows? Because they are the biggest state sponsored country of terrorism. But let's look at the other side. What if Congress doesn't do this deal? What if they reject this deal? And the president is saying, hey, guess what, guys, if you don't get this deal, we're going to war.</p><p/><p>What is it going to do to the cost of oil? It may cause a price spike because the markets are going to believe the president and they are going to be afraid that a war is going to be just around the corner. So, it could do a lot of damage, you know. So, I think it's dangerous the way this debate is being framed.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Phil, we'll be checking in with you, I'm sure over the next few weeks. Phil Flynn joining us there, senior market analyst for the Price Futures Group, author of The Energy Report, with us there from Chicago.</p><p/><p>Stocks as you know, you heard from Lori, closing off their highs. Apple has had a volatile few days, Bank of America today cutting its price target from 142 to 130, changing the recommendation from a buy to a neutral.</p><p/><p>Jason Rotman with me now. He is president of Lido Isle Advisors. He is a bull. Mark Luschini joining me, a chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. He is an apple bear. Welcome to you both. Jason, would you buy at these levels? It seems like, yes.</p><p/><p>JASON ROTMAN, LIDO ISLE ADVISORS PRESIDENT: Absolutely. Absolutely, Deirdre. I mean, the thing is, I would buy and I would continue to buy. In other words, dollar cost average if the price continues to go down. Here's one major reason, OK?</p><p/><p>This is what is not really being talked about a lot, for whatever reason, I don't know. 73 percent of the installed user base of Apple still has not upgraded to the latest models. So, Apple is basically still crushing it in my humble opinion, and 73 percent of the people still have not upgraded.</p><p/><p>So, I think at the end of the day, it's going to be a Merry Christmas, it's going to be a happy Hanukkah, it's going to be a happy holiday season for Apple. I think now is the time to -- now is the time to buy on the dip.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Mark, I know you disagree. Again, what are you most worried about with Apple? We know as far as hand set sales in China, Apple is number three, behind Xiaomi and Huawei. Is this your concern or is it something else?</p><p/><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Well, it's really two things in terms of my concern. Now, one fundamental and one technical. On the fundamental front, it's one of the things you just mentioned, and that is of course China, in the slowdown there. And obviously with the meltdown in equity prices, the impact on the wealth affect there among Chinese consumers.</p><p/><p>On the U.S. front or at least phone sales front is more to do with the fact that perhaps the new disciplined consumer is less likely to upgrade to that new iPhone 6 if they've had a recent iPhone 5 purchase. And as a consequence, may continue to defer that purchase. From a technical standpoint, we've seen no less than three previous time to the price points reaching that 130 to $134 level that the price has been turned away.</p><p/><p>And this was the most recent one which in our view, was going to lead to potential irritation in the share price. Ultimately, it turned out to be worse. We turn back our position in the portfolio to $125 about two weeks ago and we stayed sidelined for the time being.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Mark, point well made. Jason, I know as you said, you're still a buyer. Where does Apple go from here? What other tricks fundamentally does it have up its sleeve? Is it Apple TV? Are there certain products that you think will be catalysts?</p><p/><p>ROTMAN: Yes. That's a really great question. And really I'm going to respond with two major points. Number one, technically, Apple has fallen below its 200-day moving average, 17 times only since the past 30 to 60 days to rebound above it, I think this is going to be no different.</p><p/><p>Now, to answer your question from a fundamental standpoint. We're coming in to a holiday season. Again, 73 percent of the people have not upgraded yet. I adamantly disagree with the fact or the theory that people are less likely to upgrade from 5 to 6, I don't think that makes any sense.</p><p/><p>People are going to need to upgrade and Apple is a brilliant marketing company, they're going to have a huge holiday season. I think now is the time to buy for that reason alone.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. We will leave it there. We thank you for your time for your insights.</p><p/><p>ROTMAN: Thank you.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Jason Rotman joining us there. Mark Luschini as well. We thank you both.</p><p/><p>When we come back, democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee calling on Tim Cook of Apple to release employee diversity data. Our next guest says Silicon Valley companies are being unfairly targeted on this issue.</p><p/><p>Then you may be out of luck because of Suck. Forget your credit score? According to a new Facebook patent filed. Your Facebook friend's credit scores could keep you from borrowing money.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Some of the stories we're following for you right now. Debris, including part of an aircraft wing, is confirmed to be from the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane. It has been more than a year since the plane disappeared with 239 people on board.</p><p/><p>The FBI is investigating the security of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. This is the one that she used when she was Secretary of State. The probe comes days after watchdogs from the state department and the intelligence community asked the Justice Department to explore whether or not classified material was improperly shared or stored on the e-mail account.</p><p/><p>Security regulators are approving a final rule that requires public companies to disclose the ratios between annual comp of CEO's and median pay of employees. As you see, consider this change for years, it is finally here.</p><p/><p>And Representative Barbara Lee, a democrat from California calling on tech companies including Apple to release federal data on diversity of their workforces. Lee was in Silicon Valley this week turning up the heat on the tech community to hire more African-Americans.</p><p/><p>Well, last spring, the tech community did sneak into release details on the demographics of its employees. Yahoo, Google, LinkedIn among the first to publish stats. One of the reasons they did, a push from our next guest.</p><p/><p>Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr. is with me now. He is an instrumental voice in this push for diversity. He is with me on the phone. Reverend, so glad you're with us. You have encouraged tech companies to share more information, calling on Congress to backup that call. Why is it so important for all of these companies to share their data in your view?</p><p/><p>JESSE JACKSON SR., RAINBOWPUSH COALITION FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT: Hey, Deirdre. A lot of these employers are in our country. They're the fastest growth industry and they've been from the government and upon consumers.</p><p/><p>We're not sending out Apple sending them out of the top 25 from 189 board members, 36 women were African-American, we have Latinos. And just to last year, about Twitter 49 blacks men, 16 Latinos, Facebook, 1600 employees, 140 blacks, just 7 blacks from the west different employees.</p><p/><p>Twitter, I mean, Yahoo have 6,000 employees, 138 are black. So, it's not a pretty picture.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: It's not a pretty picture. And even Nancy Lee, and I'm going to look at my notes here, reverend, to read the quote, \"Google's director of people operation told the San Jose Mercury news last spring. When we look around at the industry, we think we're doing OK, but it is not something we want to tout.\"</p><p/><p>In your view, what is the number one most practical way that you think that tech companies can improve? How can they reach out to different communities, and therefore, recruit with a wider net?</p><p/><p>JACKSON SR: With the set goals, targets and timetables, almost the least accepted federal standard, these comes as CEO 1 and contract compliance laws are very important. The government then land for them to file the yield 1 report. It's just that we should publish again as what they have come in the last year.</p><p/><p>But they all have a great difference of people's color from their boards and the women. In the six weeks I went three steps with it, unlike three blacks and three Latinos, employment is around 2 percent. And I think that enforcing laws of fair practices for these companies is important.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Reverend, is it more important to have diversity in the rank and file, or is it more important in management to set an example?</p><p/><p>JACKSON SR: Well, both examples, both of the employers, there are qualified people at every level. They spend more time looking for each one of the workers from India, from Asia, than training young people right here at home. And that's a big piece of consideration.</p><p/><p>There is no talent deficit. There is an6 opportunity deficit. And besides each of those etiquette which we advocate very much at RainbowPush and engineers, the biggest employee base is now in take.</p><p/><p>It's ad agencies, it's marketing. It's non-tech workers, that they are hovering around 2 percent in those categories. Some of them from the exempt from any other obligation, they stand up to what's just and fair.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Well, we're glad to have your thoughts on that. Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr., joining us there from the RainbowPush Coalition.</p><p/><p>Our next guest takes an opposite view. Kevin Jackson is with me now. He's a former management consultant to some of the world's largest companies. He is with me now from St. Louis.</p><p/><p>So, Kevin, what about this argument that the best people have to be found and perhaps there's just ways to get more people in that original pool?</p><p/><p>KEVIN JACKSON, FORMER MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, first of all, everything Jesse Jackson just said is nonsense. The fact of the matter is, it's people like him that aren't getting qualified blacks jobs because if you're going to hire a black person, you got to understand you're bringing Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, the Department of Justice, the EEOC, the Department of Labor, and everybody else with you to that job. So, that's issue number one. And issue number two...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Just to stop you there, Kevin, what do you mean by that? That in other words, one employee has too much baggage to even focus on his or her job hunt?</p><p/><p>JACKSON: That's exactly right. If you hire a white kid, that white kid can't do anything, he can get racist e-mails, calling him cracker or anything else he wants. And he can't do anything. He can go HR, and all he can do is just -- they'll laugh together, but they won't have a lawsuit.</p><p/><p>But let a black kid get anything or black person at a company, have anything that isn't even related to him, and you've got everybody Jesse Jackson, and everybody coming to the fore to try to profiteer because that's what's happened in American's business. American business...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, Kevin, essentially you're saying if employers are unwilling or less willing to hire minorities because they're afraid of potential lawsuits, in case something goes wrong?</p><p/><p>JACKSON: Absolutely. And they won't tell you that but that's a fact. And then the other part of it about what Jesse Jackson is looking at. He gave you all kinds of statistics about how many blacks, how many women, how many browns, or whatever.</p><p/><p>How about we focus on how many people are truly qualified for jobs. The fact is, Google, Yahoo, and everybody he said will hire the best person if they're pink, if they're purple, if they're striped. They don't care. And that's the problem that Jesse Jackson has in waging a lawsuit against these people.</p><p/><p>It's he knows they want the best people. It's the companies that allow this gangster type of mentality to occur that says you've got to have a certain number of blacks, whites, or whatever. I want qualified people. Business wants qualified people and they don't want the racial strife that comes with Jesse Jackson and his ilk. So, that's all that America is looking for.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, Kevin, to your point, the H1-B Visas that he referenced and that is to say, that allows U.S. companies to reach out and keep students who are here from India, China, or Russia, wherever, there are 3 to 4 million jobs that go unfilled every month in the U.S. because there is a dearth of either math or engineering or science skills. So, maybe that's where we start is more with education?</p><p/><p>JACKSON: Well, the fact of the matter is, if Google, the best people are in the United States, I guarantee you, Google, Yahoo, Apple and all those companies want them. They will do a job fair, they don't care what those people look like, what they sound like, they will translate for them. They'll do whatever it takes to get the best employees.</p><p/><p>And if there's 3 million H1-B 1's contrary to what Obama or Jesse Jackson or the race pimps tell you, they will hire them and those people are waiting because they're the best employees. And that's the problem is the - - the education system in America is not producing the best employees anymore.</p><p/><p>Instead, what we're doing is we're coddling people. We're saying, hey, use this EEOC guidelines and all this other nonsense that business -- that doesn't further business. Use those guidelines to get people hired but don't hire the best. That's why those jobs are unfilled.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Kevin Jackson, good clear view. We're so glad to have you with us. Joining us there from St. Louis.</p><p/><p>So, when we come back, Facebook, your friend's credit, well, they could affect your own. A patent just filed has our next guest second-guessing his friend requests.</p><p/><p>And Lexus, finally unveiling video of a prototype of a hover board. Social media is questioning its authenticity. Weigh in, tell us. Is it real? Is it Fake? You can tweet to us @deirdrebolton, to me directly or to the show @riskrewardfbn.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Next time you want to loan your Facebook friends may be important, more important than the papers you give to the bank. Social network filed for a new patent that would allow creditors to assess your creditworthiness based on the credit ratings of the people in your social network.</p><p/><p>John Ulzheimer is with me now. He is CreditSesame.com president of consumer education. John, first and foremost, what do you make of this idea? What if I was a musician and my former career, now I'm an investment banker, but if my creative friends are still broke, I'm penalized?</p><p/><p>JOHN ULZHEIMER, CREDITSESAME.COM PRESIDENT: Well, the challenge that you face is that there's this hypothesis in the world of social media/risk management that birds of a feather tend to flock together.</p><p/><p>And if you have a large or disproportionate number of friends or connections on social media that indicate that they're high risk, then the likelihood of you being high risk, again, in their hypothesis is going to be much more likely, and therefore they may actually consider that when determining whether or not to do business with you and under what terms.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. But maybe times have changed, right? And I want to play for you, John, we had Mark Luschini as a guest. He's a co-founder of PayPal. Here's what he told me about the new credit environment.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Credit works fairly well for established consumers' financial products. But if you're a young person fresh off the college bench, you're about to move tax brackets most likely. And the FICO score looks back and says, well, you know, just hold it up there.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, in that sense, we know that Mark Luschini with a firm is actually loaning money to people with computer science degrees and other indicators, that even if they don't have money at that time, they will have it.</p><p/><p>ULZHEIMER: Yes, that's right. And it's a very good point. The CSPV defines those people as the invisible. Meaning that they don't have any sort of established credit history, other than probably some student loans and maybe some collections from their former apartment complexes.</p><p/><p>And it's true that credit scoring systems are much more effective when you have a long history, a robust credit history to look back onto determine whether you're going to be a subsequent risk going forward than the smaller the credit report.</p><p/><p>And if you have no credit report, lenders still want to do business with you. And so, that's when they were going to start looking for the secondary and tertiary types of data sources to determine whether or not to do business.</p><p/><p>Look, your Facebook score is never going to replace your Equifax credit report and your advantage score and your FICO score and your Transunion credit report, simply isn't going to do it.</p><p/><p>But, where it can be very effective is, for example, my niece who is about to graduate from school, probably has very little credit history and is going want to lease an apartment, is going to want to buy a car, is going to buy a house someday.</p><p/><p>And to penalize her because she has no robust credit history, without perhaps, looking how quality her connections are on Facebook. It seems to be a little bit unfair and actually can work in someone's favor. This isn't always going to work against somebody, it can actually work in your favor in many instances.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. John, great to have you with us. I should mention as well, Facebook, other big tech companies they filed for patents that they don't use, maybe this is just filing to file it.</p><p/><p>When we come back, Disney's stock dropping more than 9 percent. Netflix going to an all-time high, a new media battle is brewing.</p><p/><p>My panel guest will tell you which companies as they think will come out on top. Netflix also announcing a one year paid paternity leave and maternity leave for all employees, will other companies follow suit? We'll talk about it.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: The first republican presidential debate of 2016 tomorrow night on Fox News. Donald Trump is the most successful candidate, if you measure by social media reads. Speaking of the Donald, some people say the number who watch the debate may, in fact, top the final episode of Trump's last celebrity apprentice.</p><p/><p>With me now from Cleveland where the debate will take place is Blake Burman. So, Blake, what's Trump saying ahead of the big night?</p><p/><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Believe it or not, Deirdre, Donald Trump is actually lowering expectations a bit. You just mentioned that \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" the final episode of the last show had six million viewers, a little more than that.</p><p/><p>Some feel the debate here tomorrow night could actually top that. For a little bit of perspective context there, the first primary debates of 2011, four years ago, were about half that, but they didn't have the Trump factor. Why so many people will be tuning in tomorrow night.</p><p/><p>Still, though, Donald Trump lowering expectations talking about how he is not a debater at all while these politicians as he calls them are. I want you to take a little listen real quick to what he told Trish Regan this afternoon about lowering those expectations, here it is.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to set the bar so low, I want to set that bar so low, you have you no idea. But we'll see what happens.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BURMAN: So, he said, we'll see what happens. He talked about lowering the bar, laughing it off a little bit. We'll see what happens tomorrow night. Donald Trump did say earlier today as well as he has last night that he wants to approach this debate in a civil manner. But he also said, Deirdre, if he's attacked, he would fight back. We'll see when that happens.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes. I was going to say...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BURMAN: Who that happens thought in, how Donald Trump has thought.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: ... yes. That seems like likely as in scale of 10 out of 10.</p><p/><p>BURMAN: Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Blake Burman joining me there from Cleveland, Ohio. Thank you very much, Blake.</p><p/><p>Well, for more on tomorrow's GOP debate, social media power, Matt Witheiler from FlyBridge Capital Partners is here, as is Russ Frushtick, the editorial director at Product Hunt. Glad to have you both here.</p><p/><p>So, what do you think about this debate? Let's just talk about it from a media perspective, perhaps a number of viewers outpacing \"The Apprentice\"?</p><p/><p>MATT WITHEILER, FLYBRIDGE CAPITAL GENERAL PARTNER: Isn't really that surprising? I mean, everybody I know who's going to watch and is playing some form of drinking game involving Trump at some point. So, I think that it actually will be a ratings boon for Fox.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. And, Russ, from a social media perspective, you heard him say, I want to lower expectations so much.</p><p/><p>RUSS FRUSHTICK, PRODUCT HUNTS EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, do you think he knows he's going to bomb but he's still just counting on Twitter, Facebook and the rest for his messages?</p><p/><p>FRUSHTICK: Well, first of all, he's being very humble. I mean, that's what a good politician should lower expectations before a debate and then they come out and make a big splash, I think he'll definitely do that here. Whether it's a successful splash, helping his campaign, I don't know, but he certainly has a lot of social media power.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: He does indeed. I mean, and he has this sort of upwards of 23 percent reach, you know, the next candidate is Jeb Bush, around 12 percent. So, love him or hate him. His message and his quote and quote, \"Authentic brand,\" seems to be resonating even with some of it is ironic.</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: Yes. I think that's right. I think he's going to drive a big audience, whether you are for him or against him. It's really bringing everybody to the table for this debate.</p><p/><p>And so, they will be a tell-tale performance for him, and that will he be able to convince people who, historically, have been anti-Trump to come on his side of the camp it. And it will really depend on how he performs.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Speaking of branding, going a little bit bigger, Disney versus Netflix. If you had to put money on either one, who's your dog in the race?</p><p/><p>FRUSHTICK: Disney. Absolutely Disney.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p/><p>FRUSHTICK: I mean, Netflix is a good company and has a good product. Disney is in it for the long haul. If you're look for a long-term investment, they've been building these franchises like \"Star Wars\" and Marvel for the last 10 years.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes. But they pay for that, I mean, it's like $4 billion a pop, $4 million a pop, sorry.</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: Yes. No, that's exactly right. It's very expensive but at the same time, they are getting a huge return for that. Because that content that they produced is undistributed on Netflix. And so, when you think about shows like \"Daredevil,\" which is a Marvel property which is owned by Disney that's on Netflix, Disney is kind of taking revenue from one pocket which is the network content pocket and paying it over to Netflix.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Netflix also announcing an unlimited year of maternity and paternity leave, essentially they also have unlimited vacation. But essentially saying, listen, we trust you to be professional. You know what time you can take and when. To me this spoke of the talent war?</p><p/><p>FRUSHTICK: It is part of it. I think another part of it is the -- this sort of a very obvious strategy in the Silicon Valley space where it's like, oh, you have unlimited time to take off, so people generally are very conservative with how they use their time.</p><p/><p>If you have three weeks, you're going to take three weeks. So, I think this might be a good PR win for them, but also maybe a little bit of gamesmanship in terms of how people use their maternity leave.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Right. In other words, nobody really wants to take more than his or her peer, right?</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: Yes, I think that's right. And I think that from a PR perspective, what it's really doing is it's winning Netflix a lot of points with the millennial generation who wants culture and work life balance. And Netflix doesn't want to lose employees because recruiting a new employee is much harder and more expensive than retaining somebody.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Hold those thoughts. We're going to continue the conservation. I'm going to be back with Matt and Russ in just a little bit of time.</p><p/><p>Allegations of overpricing, social media activists calling whole foods out again. This time, though, for something as overpriced and zany as what you're looking at right now on your screens.</p><p/><p>And with two million views already on YouTube, Lexus's new hover board getting a lot of publicity. Is it real? Tell us what you think. Tweet to us @deirdrebolton, @riskrewardfbn.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Chances are you have engaged with Taboola's content before. The platform recommends editorial and sponsored articles across many highly trafficked web sites. The goal? Help publishers monetize their content while creating a personalized experience for the user.</p><p/><p>Co-founder and CEO, Adam Singolda is with me now. Adam, glad to have you with us.</p><p/><p>ADAM SINGOLDA, TABOOLA FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Thanks for having me.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: I have often heard your company described as a search engine in reverse? Is that accurate?</p><p/><p>SINGOLDA: Yes, I think it is.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. And for what reason, how does it work, how does it make what I consume better targeted for me?</p><p/><p>SINGOLDA: So, you know, I started the company eight years ago living with my parents and trying to watch TV and I couldn't find anything to watch. And I thought, you know people should not be looking for TV shows, TV shows should be looking for me.</p><p/><p>And I started the company, you know, with the vision to connect people with content they may like they never knew existed, which is in reverse to what you do with a search engine when you know exactly what you want to read.</p><p/><p>So, with us, information hopefully it's finding you before you knew you were supposed searching for it.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. And as far as my data, what happens? How do you find me?</p><p/><p>SINGOLDA: So, we work with some of the biggest media companies in the world. From USA Today that we're announcing today, Gannett, Business Insider, and many, many others. And at the bottom of the article do you know how you usually see other articles you may like. We do that which allows us to see what decisions are making when they finish consuming the content.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, in theory, it also gives sellers of products or services better information on how and who to target?</p><p/><p>SINGOLDA: Right. So, we're looking at all the information that's out there definitely. You know, all the media companies we're working with and we're trying to -- there are millions of different options trying to unless they second decide what are the two or three things you may like and never knew existed.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Now, mobile is so important right now. I know you have, as you referenced here, the deal with Gannett, how does it all fit together?</p><p/><p>SINGOLDA: So, in general, what we're announcing today is it's exciting in two ways. On the one side from the business perspective, we're announcing that we expect to generate between 45 to $55 million in the next three years to come with Gannett and USA Today.</p><p/><p>And the second one which is perhaps even more exciting is where with the industry is going where you buy. You know, I started the company eight years ago thinking personalization is the difference between me and you, and I think that was wrong.</p><p/><p>If you think about the way you consume the web, think about when you wake up in the morning and you drink your coffee on the big screen, how do you behave consuming the news versus if you're on your way with your mobile from a Facebook app, how is that different?</p><p/><p>So, we envision the web, the future of the web to be sort of a dragon with many, many heads. Whereby each head is an experience -- a different experience of the web that is telling not only to me but to me right now.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: To the activity that you're currently doing.</p><p/><p>SINGOLDA: Right.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: It makes all the sense in the world. Congratulations on the deal with Gannett. We're glad to have you with. Adam Singolda joining me there. He is the co-founder and CEO of Taboola.</p><p/><p>If you build it, they will come, that seems to be the device and mantra. We're going to show you the new plans for the tallest residential tower in the world.</p><p/><p>And then, asparagus grows after allegation of overpricing, social media activists now accusing whole foods of selling $6 asparagus water. Find out how the company reacted, next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Elon Musk is saying that storage, the battery business could generate, quote, \"A few billion dollars in 2017.\"</p><p/><p>I am back right now with Matt Witheiler and Russ Frushtick. Thanks, guys, for staying with me. So, what do make, we know that as far as the Tesla and deliveries of cars, Elon Musk missed the target. But he's saying, wait, wait, wait, there's my battery business, it's going to rocket. Yea or nay, what do you say?</p><p/><p>FRUSHTICK: Yes, I agree that there is more life there. You definitely don't want to get into a fight where you're fighting against manufacturing and the other big companies getting into this electronic -- electric car space. But, you know, that's the issue, like they haven't been hitting their numbers. So, it's not the best production.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Matt, we know that engineers do not hold these metrics against Elon Musk. Almost anyone in the tech community that I speak with would lie down in traffic for him because they say he puts his money where his mouth is. OK, finally, sometimes he makes mistakes on numbers but the spirit is in the right place?</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: It that good enough for investors?</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: I think it's good enough for its employees, it's good enough for investors that the price of which Tesla had priced that. Big question in my mind. It's easy to point to a shiny new object in battery business don't be distracted by the actual numbers in cars, but it's very speculative in my mind.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes, because the stock is already up, something like 30 percent year-to-date. So, if you're an investor you do want something back for that. All right. Speaking of a different kind of fuel, whole foods apparently, selling asparagus water, which was essentially three stocks of asparagus in a jar colored asparagus water.</p><p/><p>This is supposed to be just in one store brand with California. But hopefully it's really has this PR issues, price gouging nationwide, they're not the only shop I should say to be facing this. Is this more disappointing because hopefully this somehow supposed to be pure?</p><p/><p>FRUSHTICK: I guess that's only their brand. They want to portray this pure brand. But like, it also doesn't tell to surprise us. Every time I go to the supermarket there is another crazy fruit and like a jar, oh, it's carry water now.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes. You will live to be 700 years old if you drink this. Matt, what is your take?</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: Yes, exactly. Didn't you drink it this morning...</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes, there you go.</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: ... before you even go to work? Now, I think that given the problems that whole foods has had in New York with the Attorney General here in allegations of price kind of manipulation on how much they were charging for products, this did not comment a good time for whole foods.</p><p/><p>That being said, I'm pretty sure this was a prank and whoever is responsible probably won't take it too long.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And I look the company's response. If you think something is not been weighed properly, just bring it back. We were joking, right?</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: Exactly.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Like here's my half donut that should have been weighed or...</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: My half drinks asparagus water.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: There you go, there you go. Power and health to us all. Thank you both for joining me there. Matt Witheiler, a general partner joining us from FlyBridge Capital Partners, Russ Frushtick, editorial director at Product Hunts.</p><p/><p>Well, move over Marty McFly because Lexus introducing a real hover board. So, they say, tweet us now. Tell us, real or fake, @deirdrebolton @riskrewardfbn. What do you think?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Some of the top stories trending right now at foxbusiness.com. Target, Walmart, 7-Eleven soon may have less junk at checkout counters. Center for Science and the public interest calling for the removal of those items because they cause obesity and can lead to diabetes. Fruits, vegetables, and granola bars are suggested replacement.</p><p/><p>On the health theme, Fitbit reporting its first quarterly numbers as a public company. Wearables tech company earnings soaring. The company is selling 4.5 million devices this quarter, up nearly three million from the prior year.</p><p/><p>And, Connecticut, the nation's most expensive place to die. New probate fees resulting in relative receiving bills of up to a million dollars last week to settle the estate of their loved one.</p><p/><p>Well, speaking of transitions, we do want to let you know that \"Back to the Future 2,\" made some people dream of a real hover board. Lexus is saying it did. Take a look at this video, releasing a full video of pro-skate boarder. They say it's real. Interested tie but it will not be on sale soon.</p><p/><p>Thank you so much for joining us on Risk &amp; Reward. Glad to have you with us. Charles Payne is next.

Deirdre Bolton gets us out of this. Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST: All right. Melissa and David. Thank you so much. We have breaking news to bring you here right away. A senate IRS targeting report has been released. My colleague, Gerri Willis, has been on the story. So, Gerri, what is the latest?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GERRI WILLIS, THE WILLIS REPORT SHOW HOST: So, Deirdre, that's right. We just got report moments ago. And here is what we're finding the big take away, the IRS was delinquent in providing effective control, guidance and direction in the processing of those tax-exempt application for 501-c3 status. That's what we're learning tonight.</p><p/><p>And let me tell you, the report describes the culture within the IRS Exempt Organizations Unit. We had no idea how dysfunctional it was. Listen to this. Top management was never aware of five year delays in some of the processing at some of these organizations applications.</p><p/><p>In addition to that, people within the unit were improperly trained. They didn't know the kind of material they were looking at, what they were supposed to do, what the law regarding tax-exempt organizations was supposed to be. There was in siding. People were managing folks were halfway across the country, 2,000 miles away, that made it more difficult.</p><p/><p>In addition to that, there were people who worked from home four days a week, and it was difficult to get all the information flowing. This made it possible for Lois Lerner because she was very liberal in her outlook on life, it made it possible for her to have her political point of view represented and that's exactly what happened here, according to this report.</p><p/><p>They surveyed 1.5 million documents and 32 interviews with IRS employees, staff and others.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, Gerri, quick question here, I mean, as far as the staff views, what are, for example, republicans saying to this because many feel like, OK, some of the groups that are even right of center were clearly targeted.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: That's right. And as you know, the president recently said they were not. But this report says, yes, they were. That the IRS systemically selected tea party groups for targeting, and as I said, Lois Lerner had a big role in this. Orrin Hatch today saying that he found evidence, and he is the chairman of this committee that the administration's political agenda guided the IRS actions; they're calling this gross mismanagement.</p><p/><p>When you read the details of how the section was run, Deirdre, I don't think there's a company you cover in technology that is run that way.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. And as you said, the president, this could go all the way up to a PR problem for President Obama.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, the big question of course has been, has this targeting been directed from the White House? Even though Orrin Hatch concludes that that's what was happening, I saw none of it in the report.</p><p/><p>So, we're still waiting to see if that's in fact the case, and that's the big takeaway question so many people have at this time. But let me tell you. Tonight, the Senate Finance Committee painting a picture of complete disarray in this exempt organizations unit.</p><p/><p>And I have to tell you, it sounds like they weren't just delinquent and ineffective at controlling and guiding their employees, they didn't know what they were supposed to be doing, it sounds like.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Gerri, we are going to depend on you for updates. In the meantime, thank you very much for bringing us breaking news on that Senate Finance Committee report.</p><p/><p>I want to get you to the markets because stocks close higher but essentially went nowhere. If you look at the levels, oil prices slid. We want to get you down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Lori Rothman is there. Lori, what stood out to you about today's session?</p><p/><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, the hundred-point rally we had early fizzling certainly stood out. So, both said and done the Dow is down 10 points to close at 17,540. You hit the nail with that decline in oil prices. So, it looks like four days the down days for the Dow.</p><p/><p>The NASDAQ did post gains, about 34 points by the close. Lot of that had to do with finally a turnaround in shares of Apple. Apple shares up 6/10 of a percent, up for the first time in five days, down 14 percent still since April.</p><p/><p>We've been talking about the massive amounts of market value. Apple's given up about $100 billion in that time period. Disney was another weight on the Dow, 24 hours later after disappointing earnings report, disappointing revenue to be exact. Apparently, people are cutting the cord, so the cable business is of serious concern.</p><p/><p>Disney also warning of mysterious dollar hit, $500 million hit next year to the company because of our strong U.S. dollar. Twitter shares also hit a new low today. A lot of speculation who will be the new CEO and when that person will be appointed. Off almost 3 percent in the regular session. Also Rico reported that Google, an acquisition by Google of Twitter is highly unlikely.</p><p/><p>After the bell, we just heard the latest earnings from Tesla, the electric carmaker shares down around. They've been as low as 8 percent in the after- hours which is better than expected report. But here is the problem, Elon Musk, CEO, lowered vehicle sales expectations.</p><p/><p>He did promise 55,000 electric vehicles sold this year and he lowered that mark, 50 to 55,000. So, that pretty much sums up the day, Deirdre. I'll send it back over to you.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Lori, thank you so much. I'm going to pick up right where you left off on Tesla. Lori just told you beat on the top and the bottom lines. But this big question, can Elon Musk's company develop and deliver 55,000 cars, you heard her say. It seems like not.</p><p/><p>I want to bring in the president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo, Jon Rettinger. So, Jon, first and foremost, what do you make of the earnings, we'll talk about production in a minute.</p><p/><p>JON RETTINGER, TECHNOBUFFALO PRESIDENT AND EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Sure. So, I think people were disappointed by not hitting the sales number at 55,000 numbers. Numbers has been touted. We're supposed to have the model x this year, the model x kept getting delayed. Now we're hearing we're going to have it start shipping toward the end of the year.</p><p/><p>But we heard blames of making sure that they were -- the partners were going to be able to ship on time. And I think we're losing about 10 percent of your total estimated sales is a big hit for the company.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. It certainly is indeed. And I mean, what do you make of Tesla, right? Tesla is supposed to be next generation in Siri. We have Elon Musk touting it as bigger, better, faster, stronger, but, I mean, other car companies can meet their production standards?</p><p/><p>RETTINGER: Yes. So, Tesla is one of those companies that is being led by a modern-day Steve Jobs. You have this reality extortion field. People love the company but it follows no sense of logic with how the stock goes. I want them to hear a few things that we didn't get from the earnings call.</p><p/><p>Tesla has taken over 29,000 orders for the model x but has given no estimation when its designs is going to go live. Cars are going to ship in a few months. We don't even know what they've ordered at this point. I would like to hear more about their power low, their home battery solution. We don't know much about that.</p><p/><p>Tesla has been promising autonomous drive called autopilot in the model x. We're hearing very little about that other than it's been delayed. So, there are a lot of question marks for the company, not to mention the specter of their model 3, the affordable BMW 3 killer supposed to hitting sometime in 2017.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. And, Jon, I mean, I know you are a fan, you have you driven one, you have come on the show and talked about it. What does it mean for the future? How much does it hurt Tesla to have this missed delivery for the 55,000 cars?</p><p/><p>RETTINGER: If they deliver the Model X as expected and the car comes out to the rave reviews that the Model S had, than almost 100 consumer reports rating, it's not going to hurt the company long-term at all. But that is a big but.</p><p/><p>Every delay for the model X makes the expectations for that much higher. If there is one problem with that car, if there's a battery explosion or battery leak, it's going to spell big potential trouble.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Jon, thanks so much for your input. Jon Rettinger joining us there, president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo.</p><p/><p>Switching gears puts on regulated energy theme, President Obama going all- out over the next several weeks to build support in Congress for a nuclear deal. Take a listen to a speech that he gave at American University.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: Congressional rejection of this deal leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option. Another war in the Middle East.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Joining me now is Phil Flynn, senior market analyst for the Price Futures Group, also author of The Energy Report. So, Phil, we have alternative energy to talk about, traditional as well, I'd like to start with that, what do you think of the president's remarks?</p><p/><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP SENIOR MARKET ANALYST &amp; THE ENERGY REPORT AUTHOR: Well, I think, you know, once again, the president is saying my way or the highway. You know, if you look at how he always flames the debate. It's either my way or we're going to have a war, there's no other alternative. And that's not true.</p><p/><p>You know, the truth is that there are many other alternatives. Number one, for example, continuing the sanctions on Iran. They seem to be working pretty darn well. That's what brought Iran to the table. But the president always seems to do this. He always sees his vision is the only right one, anybody who disagrees with him is the bad guy.</p><p/><p>They don't understand. They want a war. And the truth of the matter is there are other options, there's not just two.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. So, as far as that goes, Iran, top six in the world's largest crude oil producers, what is the effect if this deal goes through this nuclear deal on the oil market?</p><p/><p>FLYNN: Well, I think we should look at both sides of it. First of all, if it goes through, obviously we're going to be giving Iran what, $58 billion? You know, maybe some of that is going to go into their energy industry to try to bring that back online.</p><p/><p>Maybe some of it will go to terrorism. You know, who knows? Because they are the biggest state sponsored country of terrorism. But let's look at the other side. What if Congress doesn't do this deal? What if they reject this deal? And the president is saying, hey, guess what, guys, if you don't get this deal, we're going to war.</p><p/><p>What is it going to do to the cost of oil? It may cause a price spike because the markets are going to believe the president and they are going to be afraid that a war is going to be just around the corner. So, it could do a lot of damage, you know. So, I think it's dangerous the way this debate is being framed.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Phil, we'll be checking in with you, I'm sure over the next few weeks. Phil Flynn joining us there, senior market analyst for the Price Futures Group, author of The Energy Report, with us there from Chicago.</p><p/><p>Stocks as you know, you heard from Lori, closing off their highs. Apple has had a volatile few days, Bank of America today cutting its price target from 142 to 130, changing the recommendation from a buy to a neutral.</p><p/><p>Jason Rotman with me now. He is president of Lido Isle Advisors. He is a bull. Mark Luschini joining me, a chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. He is an apple bear. Welcome to you both. Jason, would you buy at these levels? It seems like, yes.</p><p/><p>JASON ROTMAN, LIDO ISLE ADVISORS PRESIDENT: Absolutely. Absolutely, Deirdre. I mean, the thing is, I would buy and I would continue to buy. In other words, dollar cost average if the price continues to go down. Here's one major reason, OK?</p><p/><p>This is what is not really being talked about a lot, for whatever reason, I don't know. 73 percent of the installed user base of Apple still has not upgraded to the latest models. So, Apple is basically still crushing it in my humble opinion, and 73 percent of the people still have not upgraded.</p><p/><p>So, I think at the end of the day, it's going to be a Merry Christmas, it's going to be a happy Hanukkah, it's going to be a happy holiday season for Apple. I think now is the time to -- now is the time to buy on the dip.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Mark, I know you disagree. Again, what are you most worried about with Apple? We know as far as hand set sales in China, Apple is number three, behind Xiaomi and Huawei. Is this your concern or is it something else?</p><p/><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Well, it's really two things in terms of my concern. Now, one fundamental and one technical. On the fundamental front, it's one of the things you just mentioned, and that is of course China, in the slowdown there. And obviously with the meltdown in equity prices, the impact on the wealth affect there among Chinese consumers.</p><p/><p>On the U.S. front or at least phone sales front is more to do with the fact that perhaps the new disciplined consumer is less likely to upgrade to that new iPhone 6 if they've had a recent iPhone 5 purchase. And as a consequence, may continue to defer that purchase. From a technical standpoint, we've seen no less than three previous time to the price points reaching that 130 to $134 level that the price has been turned away.</p><p/><p>And this was the most recent one which in our view, was going to lead to potential irritation in the share price. Ultimately, it turned out to be worse. We turn back our position in the portfolio to $125 about two weeks ago and we stayed sidelined for the time being.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Mark, point well made. Jason, I know as you said, you're still a buyer. Where does Apple go from here? What other tricks fundamentally does it have up its sleeve? Is it Apple TV? Are there certain products that you think will be catalysts?</p><p/><p>ROTMAN: Yes. That's a really great question. And really I'm going to respond with two major points. Number one, technically, Apple has fallen below its 200-day moving average, 17 times only since the past 30 to 60 days to rebound above it, I think this is going to be no different.</p><p/><p>Now, to answer your question from a fundamental standpoint. We're coming in to a holiday season. Again, 73 percent of the people have not upgraded yet. I adamantly disagree with the fact or the theory that people are less likely to upgrade from 5 to 6, I don't think that makes any sense.</p><p/><p>People are going to need to upgrade and Apple is a brilliant marketing company, they're going to have a huge holiday season. I think now is the time to buy for that reason alone.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. We will leave it there. We thank you for your time for your insights.</p><p/><p>ROTMAN: Thank you.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Jason Rotman joining us there. Mark Luschini as well. We thank you both.</p><p/><p>When we come back, democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee calling on Tim Cook of Apple to release employee diversity data. Our next guest says Silicon Valley companies are being unfairly targeted on this issue.</p><p/><p>Then you may be out of luck because of Suck. Forget your credit score? According to a new Facebook patent filed. Your Facebook friend's credit scores could keep you from borrowing money.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Some of the stories we're following for you right now. Debris, including part of an aircraft wing, is confirmed to be from the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane. It has been more than a year since the plane disappeared with 239 people on board.</p><p/><p>The FBI is investigating the security of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. This is the one that she used when she was Secretary of State. The probe comes days after watchdogs from the state department and the intelligence community asked the Justice Department to explore whether or not classified material was improperly shared or stored on the e-mail account.</p><p/><p>Security regulators are approving a final rule that requires public companies to disclose the ratios between annual comp of CEO's and median pay of employees. As you see, consider this change for years, it is finally here.</p><p/><p>And Representative Barbara Lee, a democrat from California calling on tech companies including Apple to release federal data on diversity of their workforces. Lee was in Silicon Valley this week turning up the heat on the tech community to hire more African-Americans.</p><p/><p>Well, last spring, the tech community did sneak into release details on the demographics of its employees. Yahoo, Google, LinkedIn among the first to publish stats. One of the reasons they did, a push from our next guest.</p><p/><p>Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr. is with me now. He is an instrumental voice in this push for diversity. He is with me on the phone. Reverend, so glad you're with us. You have encouraged tech companies to share more information, calling on Congress to backup that call. Why is it so important for all of these companies to share their data in your view?</p><p/><p>JESSE JACKSON SR., RAINBOWPUSH COALITION FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT: Hey, Deirdre. A lot of these employers are in our country. They're the fastest growth industry and they've been from the government and upon consumers.</p><p/><p>We're not sending out Apple sending them out of the top 25 from 189 board members, 36 women were African-American, we have Latinos. And just to last year, about Twitter 49 blacks men, 16 Latinos, Facebook, 1600 employees, 140 blacks, just 7 blacks from the west different employees.</p><p/><p>Twitter, I mean, Yahoo have 6,000 employees, 138 are black. So, it's not a pretty picture.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: It's not a pretty picture. And even Nancy Lee, and I'm going to look at my notes here, reverend, to read the quote, \"Google's director of people operation told the San Jose Mercury news last spring. When we look around at the industry, we think we're doing OK, but it is not something we want to tout.\"</p><p/><p>In your view, what is the number one most practical way that you think that tech companies can improve? How can they reach out to different communities, and therefore, recruit with a wider net?</p><p/><p>JACKSON SR: With the set goals, targets and timetables, almost the least accepted federal standard, these comes as CEO 1 and contract compliance laws are very important. The government then land for them to file the yield 1 report. It's just that we should publish again as what they have come in the last year.</p><p/><p>But they all have a great difference of people's color from their boards and the women. In the six weeks I went three steps with it, unlike three blacks and three Latinos, employment is around 2 percent. And I think that enforcing laws of fair practices for these companies is important.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Reverend, is it more important to have diversity in the rank and file, or is it more important in management to set an example?</p><p/><p>JACKSON SR: Well, both examples, both of the employers, there are qualified people at every level. They spend more time looking for each one of the workers from India, from Asia, than training young people right here at home. And that's a big piece of consideration.</p><p/><p>There is no talent deficit. There is an6 opportunity deficit. And besides each of those etiquette which we advocate very much at RainbowPush and engineers, the biggest employee base is now in take.</p><p/><p>It's ad agencies, it's marketing. It's non-tech workers, that they are hovering around 2 percent in those categories. Some of them from the exempt from any other obligation, they stand up to what's just and fair.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Well, we're glad to have your thoughts on that. Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr., joining us there from the RainbowPush Coalition.</p><p/><p>Our next guest takes an opposite view. Kevin Jackson is with me now. He's a former management consultant to some of the world's largest companies. He is with me now from St. Louis.</p><p/><p>So, Kevin, what about this argument that the best people have to be found and perhaps there's just ways to get more people in that original pool?</p><p/><p>KEVIN JACKSON, FORMER MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, first of all, everything Jesse Jackson just said is nonsense. The fact of the matter is, it's people like him that aren't getting qualified blacks jobs because if you're going to hire a black person, you got to understand you're bringing Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, the Department of Justice, the EEOC, the Department of Labor, and everybody else with you to that job. So, that's issue number one. And issue number two...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Just to stop you there, Kevin, what do you mean by that? That in other words, one employee has too much baggage to even focus on his or her job hunt?</p><p/><p>JACKSON: That's exactly right. If you hire a white kid, that white kid can't do anything, he can get racist e-mails, calling him cracker or anything else he wants. And he can't do anything. He can go HR, and all he can do is just -- they'll laugh together, but they won't have a lawsuit.</p><p/><p>But let a black kid get anything or black person at a company, have anything that isn't even related to him, and you've got everybody Jesse Jackson, and everybody coming to the fore to try to profiteer because that's what's happened in American's business. American business...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, Kevin, essentially you're saying if employers are unwilling or less willing to hire minorities because they're afraid of potential lawsuits, in case something goes wrong?</p><p/><p>JACKSON: Absolutely. And they won't tell you that but that's a fact. And then the other part of it about what Jesse Jackson is looking at. He gave you all kinds of statistics about how many blacks, how many women, how many browns, or whatever.</p><p/><p>How about we focus on how many people are truly qualified for jobs. The fact is, Google, Yahoo, and everybody he said will hire the best person if they're pink, if they're purple, if they're striped. They don't care. And that's the problem that Jesse Jackson has in waging a lawsuit against these people.</p><p/><p>It's he knows they want the best people. It's the companies that allow this gangster type of mentality to occur that says you've got to have a certain number of blacks, whites, or whatever. I want qualified people. Business wants qualified people and they don't want the racial strife that comes with Jesse Jackson and his ilk. So, that's all that America is looking for.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, Kevin, to your point, the H1-B Visas that he referenced and that is to say, that allows U.S. companies to reach out and keep students who are here from India, China, or Russia, wherever, there are 3 to 4 million jobs that go unfilled every month in the U.S. because there is a dearth of either math or engineering or science skills. So, maybe that's where we start is more with education?</p><p/><p>JACKSON: Well, the fact of the matter is, if Google, the best people are in the United States, I guarantee you, Google, Yahoo, Apple and all those companies want them. They will do a job fair, they don't care what those people look like, what they sound like, they will translate for them. They'll do whatever it takes to get the best employees.</p><p/><p>And if there's 3 million H1-B 1's contrary to what Obama or Jesse Jackson or the race pimps tell you, they will hire them and those people are waiting because they're the best employees. And that's the problem is the - - the education system in America is not producing the best employees anymore.</p><p/><p>Instead, what we're doing is we're coddling people. We're saying, hey, use this EEOC guidelines and all this other nonsense that business -- that doesn't further business. Use those guidelines to get people hired but don't hire the best. That's why those jobs are unfilled.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Kevin Jackson, good clear view. We're so glad to have you with us. Joining us there from St. Louis.</p><p/><p>So, when we come back, Facebook, your friend's credit, well, they could affect your own. A patent just filed has our next guest second-guessing his friend requests.</p><p/><p>And Lexus, finally unveiling video of a prototype of a hover board. Social media is questioning its authenticity. Weigh in, tell us. Is it real? Is it Fake? You can tweet to us @deirdrebolton, to me directly or to the show @riskrewardfbn.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Next time you want to loan your Facebook friends may be important, more important than the papers you give to the bank. Social network filed for a new patent that would allow creditors to assess your creditworthiness based on the credit ratings of the people in your social network.</p><p/><p>John Ulzheimer is with me now. He is CreditSesame.com president of consumer education. John, first and foremost, what do you make of this idea? What if I was a musician and my former career, now I'm an investment banker, but if my creative friends are still broke, I'm penalized?</p><p/><p>JOHN ULZHEIMER, CREDITSESAME.COM PRESIDENT: Well, the challenge that you face is that there's this hypothesis in the world of social media/risk management that birds of a feather tend to flock together.</p><p/><p>And if you have a large or disproportionate number of friends or connections on social media that indicate that they're high risk, then the likelihood of you being high risk, again, in their hypothesis is going to be much more likely, and therefore they may actually consider that when determining whether or not to do business with you and under what terms.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. But maybe times have changed, right? And I want to play for you, John, we had Mark Luschini as a guest. He's a co-founder of PayPal. Here's what he told me about the new credit environment.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Credit works fairly well for established consumers' financial products. But if you're a young person fresh off the college bench, you're about to move tax brackets most likely. And the FICO score looks back and says, well, you know, just hold it up there.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, in that sense, we know that Mark Luschini with a firm is actually loaning money to people with computer science degrees and other indicators, that even if they don't have money at that time, they will have it.</p><p/><p>ULZHEIMER: Yes, that's right. And it's a very good point. The CSPV defines those people as the invisible. Meaning that they don't have any sort of established credit history, other than probably some student loans and maybe some collections from their former apartment complexes.</p><p/><p>And it's true that credit scoring systems are much more effective when you have a long history, a robust credit history to look back onto determine whether you're going to be a subsequent risk going forward than the smaller the credit report.</p><p/><p>And if you have no credit report, lenders still want to do business with you. And so, that's when they were going to start looking for the secondary and tertiary types of data sources to determine whether or not to do business.</p><p/><p>Look, your Facebook score is never going to replace your Equifax credit report and your advantage score and your FICO score and your Transunion credit report, simply isn't going to do it.</p><p/><p>But, where it can be very effective is, for example, my niece who is about to graduate from school, probably has very little credit history and is going want to lease an apartment, is going to want to buy a car, is going to buy a house someday.</p><p/><p>And to penalize her because she has no robust credit history, without perhaps, looking how quality her connections are on Facebook. It seems to be a little bit unfair and actually can work in someone's favor. This isn't always going to work against somebody, it can actually work in your favor in many instances.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. John, great to have you with us. I should mention as well, Facebook, other big tech companies they filed for patents that they don't use, maybe this is just filing to file it.</p><p/><p>When we come back, Disney's stock dropping more than 9 percent. Netflix going to an all-time high, a new media battle is brewing.</p><p/><p>My panel guest will tell you which companies as they think will come out on top. Netflix also announcing a one year paid paternity leave and maternity leave for all employees, will other companies follow suit? We'll talk about it.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: The first republican presidential debate of 2016 tomorrow night on Fox News. Donald Trump is the most successful candidate, if you measure by social media reads. Speaking of the Donald, some people say the number who watch the debate may, in fact, top the final episode of Trump's last celebrity apprentice.</p><p/><p>With me now from Cleveland where the debate will take place is Blake Burman. So, Blake, what's Trump saying ahead of the big night?</p><p/><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Believe it or not, Deirdre, Donald Trump is actually lowering expectations a bit. You just mentioned that \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" the final episode of the last show had six million viewers, a little more than that.</p><p/><p>Some feel the debate here tomorrow night could actually top that. For a little bit of perspective context there, the first primary debates of 2011, four years ago, were about half that, but they didn't have the Trump factor. Why so many people will be tuning in tomorrow night.</p><p/><p>Still, though, Donald Trump lowering expectations talking about how he is not a debater at all while these politicians as he calls them are. I want you to take a little listen real quick to what he told Trish Regan this afternoon about lowering those expectations, here it is.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to set the bar so low, I want to set that bar so low, you have you no idea. But we'll see what happens.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BURMAN: So, he said, we'll see what happens. He talked about lowering the bar, laughing it off a little bit. We'll see what happens tomorrow night. Donald Trump did say earlier today as well as he has last night that he wants to approach this debate in a civil manner. But he also said, Deirdre, if he's attacked, he would fight back. We'll see when that happens.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes. I was going to say...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BURMAN: Who that happens thought in, how Donald Trump has thought.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: ... yes. That seems like likely as in scale of 10 out of 10.</p><p/><p>BURMAN: Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Blake Burman joining me there from Cleveland, Ohio. Thank you very much, Blake.</p><p/><p>Well, for more on tomorrow's GOP debate, social media power, Matt Witheiler from FlyBridge Capital Partners is here, as is Russ Frushtick, the editorial director at Product Hunt. Glad to have you both here.</p><p/><p>So, what do you think about this debate? Let's just talk about it from a media perspective, perhaps a number of viewers outpacing \"The Apprentice\"?</p><p/><p>MATT WITHEILER, FLYBRIDGE CAPITAL GENERAL PARTNER: Isn't really that surprising? I mean, everybody I know who's going to watch and is playing some form of drinking game involving Trump at some point. So, I think that it actually will be a ratings boon for Fox.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. And, Russ, from a social media perspective, you heard him say, I want to lower expectations so much.</p><p/><p>RUSS FRUSHTICK, PRODUCT HUNTS EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, do you think he knows he's going to bomb but he's still just counting on Twitter, Facebook and the rest for his messages?</p><p/><p>FRUSHTICK: Well, first of all, he's being very humble. I mean, that's what a good politician should lower expectations before a debate and then they come out and make a big splash, I think he'll definitely do that here. Whether it's a successful splash, helping his campaign, I don't know, but he certainly has a lot of social media power.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: He does indeed. I mean, and he has this sort of upwards of 23 percent reach, you know, the next candidate is Jeb Bush, around 12 percent. So, love him or hate him. His message and his quote and quote, \"Authentic brand,\" seems to be resonating even with some of it is ironic.</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: Yes. I think that's right. I think he's going to drive a big audience, whether you are for him or against him. It's really bringing everybody to the table for this debate.</p><p/><p>And so, they will be a tell-tale performance for him, and that will he be able to convince people who, historically, have been anti-Trump to come on his side of the camp it. And it will really depend on how he performs.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Speaking of branding, going a little bit bigger, Disney versus Netflix. If you had to put money on either one, who's your dog in the race?</p><p/><p>FRUSHTICK: Disney. Absolutely Disney.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p/><p>FRUSHTICK: I mean, Netflix is a good company and has a good product. Disney is in it for the long haul. If you're look for a long-term investment, they've been building these franchises like \"Star Wars\" and Marvel for the last 10 years.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes. But they pay for that, I mean, it's like $4 billion a pop, $4 million a pop, sorry.</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: Yes. No, that's exactly right. It's very expensive but at the same time, they are getting a huge return for that. Because that content that they produced is undistributed on Netflix. And so, when you think about shows like \"Daredevil,\" which is a Marvel property which is owned by Disney that's on Netflix, Disney is kind of taking revenue from one pocket which is the network content pocket and paying it over to Netflix.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. Netflix also announcing an unlimited year of maternity and paternity leave, essentially they also have unlimited vacation. But essentially saying, listen, we trust you to be professional. You know what time you can take and when. To me this spoke of the talent war?</p><p/><p>FRUSHTICK: It is part of it. I think another part of it is the -- this sort of a very obvious strategy in the Silicon Valley space where it's like, oh, you have unlimited time to take off, so people generally are very conservative with how they use their time.</p><p/><p>If you have three weeks, you're going to take three weeks. So, I think this might be a good PR win for them, but also maybe a little bit of gamesmanship in terms of how people use their maternity leave.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Right. In other words, nobody really wants to take more than his or her peer, right?</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: Yes, I think that's right. And I think that from a PR perspective, what it's really doing is it's winning Netflix a lot of points with the millennial generation who wants culture and work life balance. And Netflix doesn't want to lose employees because recruiting a new employee is much harder and more expensive than retaining somebody.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Hold those thoughts. We're going to continue the conservation. I'm going to be back with Matt and Russ in just a little bit of time.</p><p/><p>Allegations of overpricing, social media activists calling whole foods out again. This time, though, for something as overpriced and zany as what you're looking at right now on your screens.</p><p/><p>And with two million views already on YouTube, Lexus's new hover board getting a lot of publicity. Is it real? Tell us what you think. Tweet to us @deirdrebolton, @riskrewardfbn.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Chances are you have engaged with Taboola's content before. The platform recommends editorial and sponsored articles across many highly trafficked web sites. The goal? Help publishers monetize their content while creating a personalized experience for the user.</p><p/><p>Co-founder and CEO, Adam Singolda is with me now. Adam, glad to have you with us.</p><p/><p>ADAM SINGOLDA, TABOOLA FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Thanks for having me.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: I have often heard your company described as a search engine in reverse? Is that accurate?</p><p/><p>SINGOLDA: Yes, I think it is.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. And for what reason, how does it work, how does it make what I consume better targeted for me?</p><p/><p>SINGOLDA: So, you know, I started the company eight years ago living with my parents and trying to watch TV and I couldn't find anything to watch. And I thought, you know people should not be looking for TV shows, TV shows should be looking for me.</p><p/><p>And I started the company, you know, with the vision to connect people with content they may like they never knew existed, which is in reverse to what you do with a search engine when you know exactly what you want to read.</p><p/><p>So, with us, information hopefully it's finding you before you knew you were supposed searching for it.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: OK. And as far as my data, what happens? How do you find me?</p><p/><p>SINGOLDA: So, we work with some of the biggest media companies in the world. From USA Today that we're announcing today, Gannett, Business Insider, and many, many others. And at the bottom of the article do you know how you usually see other articles you may like. We do that which allows us to see what decisions are making when they finish consuming the content.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: So, in theory, it also gives sellers of products or services better information on how and who to target?</p><p/><p>SINGOLDA: Right. So, we're looking at all the information that's out there definitely. You know, all the media companies we're working with and we're trying to -- there are millions of different options trying to unless they second decide what are the two or three things you may like and never knew existed.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: All right. Now, mobile is so important right now. I know you have, as you referenced here, the deal with Gannett, how does it all fit together?</p><p/><p>SINGOLDA: So, in general, what we're announcing today is it's exciting in two ways. On the one side from the business perspective, we're announcing that we expect to generate between 45 to $55 million in the next three years to come with Gannett and USA Today.</p><p/><p>And the second one which is perhaps even more exciting is where with the industry is going where you buy. You know, I started the company eight years ago thinking personalization is the difference between me and you, and I think that was wrong.</p><p/><p>If you think about the way you consume the web, think about when you wake up in the morning and you drink your coffee on the big screen, how do you behave consuming the news versus if you're on your way with your mobile from a Facebook app, how is that different?</p><p/><p>So, we envision the web, the future of the web to be sort of a dragon with many, many heads. Whereby each head is an experience -- a different experience of the web that is telling not only to me but to me right now.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: To the activity that you're currently doing.</p><p/><p>SINGOLDA: Right.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: It makes all the sense in the world. Congratulations on the deal with Gannett. We're glad to have you with. Adam Singolda joining me there. He is the co-founder and CEO of Taboola.</p><p/><p>If you build it, they will come, that seems to be the device and mantra. We're going to show you the new plans for the tallest residential tower in the world.</p><p/><p>And then, asparagus grows after allegation of overpricing, social media activists now accusing whole foods of selling $6 asparagus water. Find out how the company reacted, next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Elon Musk is saying that storage, the battery business could generate, quote, \"A few billion dollars in 2017.\"</p><p/><p>I am back right now with Matt Witheiler and Russ Frushtick. Thanks, guys, for staying with me. So, what do make, we know that as far as the Tesla and deliveries of cars, Elon Musk missed the target. But he's saying, wait, wait, wait, there's my battery business, it's going to rocket. Yea or nay, what do you say?</p><p/><p>FRUSHTICK: Yes, I agree that there is more life there. You definitely don't want to get into a fight where you're fighting against manufacturing and the other big companies getting into this electronic -- electric car space. But, you know, that's the issue, like they haven't been hitting their numbers. So, it's not the best production.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Matt, we know that engineers do not hold these metrics against Elon Musk. Almost anyone in the tech community that I speak with would lie down in traffic for him because they say he puts his money where his mouth is. OK, finally, sometimes he makes mistakes on numbers but the spirit is in the right place?</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: Yes.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: It that good enough for investors?</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: I think it's good enough for its employees, it's good enough for investors that the price of which Tesla had priced that. Big question in my mind. It's easy to point to a shiny new object in battery business don't be distracted by the actual numbers in cars, but it's very speculative in my mind.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes, because the stock is already up, something like 30 percent year-to-date. So, if you're an investor you do want something back for that. All right. Speaking of a different kind of fuel, whole foods apparently, selling asparagus water, which was essentially three stocks of asparagus in a jar colored asparagus water.</p><p/><p>This is supposed to be just in one store brand with California. But hopefully it's really has this PR issues, price gouging nationwide, they're not the only shop I should say to be facing this. Is this more disappointing because hopefully this somehow supposed to be pure?</p><p/><p>FRUSHTICK: I guess that's only their brand. They want to portray this pure brand. But like, it also doesn't tell to surprise us. Every time I go to the supermarket there is another crazy fruit and like a jar, oh, it's carry water now.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes. You will live to be 700 years old if you drink this. Matt, what is your take?</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: Yes, exactly. Didn't you drink it this morning...</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Yes, there you go.</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: ... before you even go to work? Now, I think that given the problems that whole foods has had in New York with the Attorney General here in allegations of price kind of manipulation on how much they were charging for products, this did not comment a good time for whole foods.</p><p/><p>That being said, I'm pretty sure this was a prank and whoever is responsible probably won't take it too long.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: And I look the company's response. If you think something is not been weighed properly, just bring it back. We were joking, right?</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: Exactly.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Like here's my half donut that should have been weighed or...</p><p/><p>WITHEILER: My half drinks asparagus water.</p><p/><p>BOLTON: There you go, there you go. Power and health to us all. Thank you both for joining me there. Matt Witheiler, a general partner joining us from FlyBridge Capital Partners, Russ Frushtick, editorial director at Product Hunts.</p><p/><p>Well, move over Marty McFly because Lexus introducing a real hover board. So, they say, tweet us now. Tell us, real or fake, @deirdrebolton @riskrewardfbn. What do you think?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BOLTON: Some of the top stories trending right now at foxbusiness.com. Target, Walmart, 7-Eleven soon may have less junk at checkout counters. Center for Science and the public interest calling for the removal of those items because they cause obesity and can lead to diabetes. Fruits, vegetables, and granola bars are suggested replacement.</p><p/><p>On the health theme, Fitbit reporting its first quarterly numbers as a public company. Wearables tech company earnings soaring. The company is selling 4.5 million devices this quarter, up nearly three million from the prior year.</p><p/><p>And, Connecticut, the nation's most expensive place to die. New probate fees resulting in relative receiving bills of up to a million dollars last week to settle the estate of their loved one.</p><p/><p>Well, speaking of transitions, we do want to let you know that \"Back to the Future 2,\" made some people dream of a real hover board. Lexus is saying it did. Take a look at this video, releasing a full video of pro-skate boarder. They say it's real. Interested tie but it will not be on sale soon.</p><p/><p>Thank you so much for joining us on Risk &amp; Reward. Glad to have you with us. Charles Payne is next.

That's what we're learning tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And let me tell you, the report describes the culture within the IRS Exempt Organizations Unit. We had no idea how dysfunctional it was. Listen to this. Top management was never aware of five year delays in some of the processing at some of these organizations applications.</p><p>In addition to that, people within the unit were improperly trained. They didn't know the kind of material they were looking at, what they were supposed to do, what the law regarding tax-exempt organizations was supposed to be. There was in siding. People were managing folks were halfway across the country, 2,000 miles away, that made it more difficult.</p><p>In addition to that, there were people who worked from home four days a week, and it was difficult to get all the information flowing. This made it possible for Lois Lerner because she was very liberal in her outlook on life, it made it possible for her to have her political point of view represented and that's exactly what happened here, according to this report.</p><p>They surveyed 1.5 million documents and 32 interviews with IRS employees, staff and others.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Gerri, quick question here, I mean, as far as the staff views, what are, for example, republicans saying to this because many feel like, OK, some of the groups that are even right of center were clearly targeted.</p><p>WILLIS: That's right. And as you know, the president recently said they were not. But this report says, yes, they were. That the IRS systemically selected tea party groups for targeting, and as I said, Lois Lerner had a big role in this. Orrin Hatch today saying that he found evidence, and he is the chairman of this committee that the administration's political agenda guided the IRS actions; they're calling this gross mismanagement.</p><p>When you read the details of how the section was run, Deirdre, I don't think there's a company you cover in technology that is run that way.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. And as you said, the president, this could go all the way up to a PR problem for President Obama.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, the big question of course has been, has this targeting been directed from the White House? Even though Orrin Hatch concludes that that's what was happening, I saw none of it in the report.</p><p>So, we're still waiting to see if that's in fact the case, and that's the big takeaway question so many people have at this time. But let me tell you. Tonight, the Senate Finance Committee painting a picture of complete disarray in this exempt organizations unit.</p><p>And I have to tell you, it sounds like they weren't just delinquent and ineffective at controlling and guiding their employees, they didn't know what they were supposed to be doing, it sounds like.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Gerri, we are going to depend on you for updates. In the meantime, thank you very much for bringing us breaking news on that Senate Finance Committee report.</p><p>I want to get you to the markets because stocks close higher but essentially went nowhere. If you look at the levels, oil prices slid. We want to get you down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Lori Rothman is there. Lori, what stood out to you about today's session?</p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, the hundred-point rally we had early fizzling certainly stood out. So, both said and done the Dow is down 10 points to close at 17,540. You hit the nail with that decline in oil prices. So, it looks like four days the down days for the Dow.</p><p>The NASDAQ did post gains, about 34 points by the close. Lot of that had to do with finally a turnaround in shares of Apple. Apple shares up 6/10 of a percent, up for the first time in five days, down 14 percent still since April.</p><p>We've been talking about the massive amounts of market value. Apple's given up about $100 billion in that time period. Disney was another weight on the Dow, 24 hours later after disappointing earnings report, disappointing revenue to be exact. Apparently, people are cutting the cord, so the cable business is of serious concern.</p><p>Disney also warning of mysterious dollar hit, $500 million hit next year to the company because of our strong U.S. dollar. Twitter shares also hit a new low today. A lot of speculation who will be the new CEO and when that person will be appointed. Off almost 3 percent in the regular session. Also Rico reported that Google, an acquisition by Google of Twitter is highly unlikely.</p><p>After the bell, we just heard the latest earnings from Tesla, the electric carmaker shares down around. They've been as low as 8 percent in the after- hours which is better than expected report. But here is the problem, Elon Musk, CEO, lowered vehicle sales expectations.</p><p>He did promise 55,000 electric vehicles sold this year and he lowered that mark, 50 to 55,000. So, that pretty much sums up the day, Deirdre. I'll send it back over to you.</p><p>BOLTON: Lori, thank you so much. I'm going to pick up right where you left off on Tesla. Lori just told you beat on the top and the bottom lines. But this big question, can Elon Musk's company develop and deliver 55,000 cars, you heard her say. It seems like not.</p><p>I want to bring in the president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo, Jon Rettinger. So, Jon, first and foremost, what do you make of the earnings, we'll talk about production in a minute.</p><p>JON RETTINGER, TECHNOBUFFALO PRESIDENT AND EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Sure. So, I think people were disappointed by not hitting the sales number at 55,000 numbers. Numbers has been touted. We're supposed to have the model x this year, the model x kept getting delayed. Now we're hearing we're going to have it start shipping toward the end of the year.</p><p>But we heard blames of making sure that they were -- the partners were going to be able to ship on time. And I think we're losing about 10 percent of your total estimated sales is a big hit for the company.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. It certainly is indeed. And I mean, what do you make of Tesla, right? Tesla is supposed to be next generation in Siri. We have Elon Musk touting it as bigger, better, faster, stronger, but, I mean, other car companies can meet their production standards?</p><p>RETTINGER: Yes. So, Tesla is one of those companies that is being led by a modern-day Steve Jobs. You have this reality extortion field. People love the company but it follows no sense of logic with how the stock goes. I want them to hear a few things that we didn't get from the earnings call.</p><p>Tesla has taken over 29,000 orders for the model x but has given no estimation when its designs is going to go live. Cars are going to ship in a few months. We don't even know what they've ordered at this point. I would like to hear more about their power low, their home battery solution. We don't know much about that.</p><p>Tesla has been promising autonomous drive called autopilot in the model x. We're hearing very little about that other than it's been delayed. So, there are a lot of question marks for the company, not to mention the specter of their model 3, the affordable BMW 3 killer supposed to hitting sometime in 2017.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. And, Jon, I mean, I know you are a fan, you have you driven one, you have come on the show and talked about it. What does it mean for the future? How much does it hurt Tesla to have this missed delivery for the 55,000 cars?</p><p>RETTINGER: If they deliver the Model X as expected and the car comes out to the rave reviews that the Model S had, than almost 100 consumer reports rating, it's not going to hurt the company long-term at all. But that is a big but.</p><p>Every delay for the model X makes the expectations for that much higher. If there is one problem with that car, if there's a battery explosion or battery leak, it's going to spell big potential trouble.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Jon, thanks so much for your input. Jon Rettinger joining us there, president and editorial director of TechnoBuffalo.</p><p>Switching gears puts on regulated energy theme, President Obama going all- out over the next several weeks to build support in Congress for a nuclear deal. Take a listen to a speech that he gave at American University.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: Congressional rejection of this deal leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option. Another war in the Middle East.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Joining me now is Phil Flynn, senior market analyst for the Price Futures Group, also author of The Energy Report. So, Phil, we have alternative energy to talk about, traditional as well, I'd like to start with that, what do you think of the president's remarks?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP SENIOR MARKET ANALYST &amp; THE ENERGY REPORT AUTHOR: Well, I think, you know, once again, the president is saying my way or the highway. You know, if you look at how he always flames the debate. It's either my way or we're going to have a war, there's no other alternative. And that's not true.</p><p>You know, the truth is that there are many other alternatives. Number one, for example, continuing the sanctions on Iran. They seem to be working pretty darn well. That's what brought Iran to the table. But the president always seems to do this. He always sees his vision is the only right one, anybody who disagrees with him is the bad guy.</p><p>They don't understand. They want a war. And the truth of the matter is there are other options, there's not just two.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, as far as that goes, Iran, top six in the world's largest crude oil producers, what is the effect if this deal goes through this nuclear deal on the oil market?</p><p>FLYNN: Well, I think we should look at both sides of it. First of all, if it goes through, obviously we're going to be giving Iran what, $58 billion? You know, maybe some of that is going to go into their energy industry to try to bring that back online.</p><p>Maybe some of it will go to terrorism. You know, who knows? Because they are the biggest state sponsored country of terrorism. But let's look at the other side. What if Congress doesn't do this deal? What if they reject this deal? And the president is saying, hey, guess what, guys, if you don't get this deal, we're going to war.</p><p>What is it going to do to the cost of oil? It may cause a price spike because the markets are going to believe the president and they are going to be afraid that a war is going to be just around the corner. So, it could do a lot of damage, you know. So, I think it's dangerous the way this debate is being framed.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Phil, we'll be checking in with you, I'm sure over the next few weeks. Phil Flynn joining us there, senior market analyst for the Price Futures Group, author of The Energy Report, with us there from Chicago.</p><p>Stocks as you know, you heard from Lori, closing off their highs. Apple has had a volatile few days, Bank of America today cutting its price target from 142 to 130, changing the recommendation from a buy to a neutral.</p><p>Jason Rotman with me now. He is president of Lido Isle Advisors. He is a bull. Mark Luschini joining me, a chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. He is an apple bear. Welcome to you both. Jason, would you buy at these levels? It seems like, yes.</p><p>JASON ROTMAN, LIDO ISLE ADVISORS PRESIDENT: Absolutely. Absolutely, Deirdre. I mean, the thing is, I would buy and I would continue to buy. In other words, dollar cost average if the price continues to go down. Here's one major reason, OK?</p><p>This is what is not really being talked about a lot, for whatever reason, I don't know. 73 percent of the installed user base of Apple still has not upgraded to the latest models. So, Apple is basically still crushing it in my humble opinion, and 73 percent of the people still have not upgraded.</p><p>So, I think at the end of the day, it's going to be a Merry Christmas, it's going to be a happy Hanukkah, it's going to be a happy holiday season for Apple. I think now is the time to -- now is the time to buy on the dip.</p><p>BOLTON: Mark, I know you disagree. Again, what are you most worried about with Apple? We know as far as hand set sales in China, Apple is number three, behind Xiaomi and Huawei. Is this your concern or is it something else?</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Well, it's really two things in terms of my concern. Now, one fundamental and one technical. On the fundamental front, it's one of the things you just mentioned, and that is of course China, in the slowdown there. And obviously with the meltdown in equity prices, the impact on the wealth affect there among Chinese consumers.</p><p>On the U.S. front or at least phone sales front is more to do with the fact that perhaps the new disciplined consumer is less likely to upgrade to that new iPhone 6 if they've had a recent iPhone 5 purchase. And as a consequence, may continue to defer that purchase. From a technical standpoint, we've seen no less than three previous time to the price points reaching that 130 to $134 level that the price has been turned away.</p><p>And this was the most recent one which in our view, was going to lead to potential irritation in the share price. Ultimately, it turned out to be worse. We turn back our position in the portfolio to $125 about two weeks ago and we stayed sidelined for the time being.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Mark, point well made. Jason, I know as you said, you're still a buyer. Where does Apple go from here? What other tricks fundamentally does it have up its sleeve? Is it Apple TV? Are there certain products that you think will be catalysts?</p><p>ROTMAN: Yes. That's a really great question. And really I'm going to respond with two major points. Number one, technically, Apple has fallen below its 200-day moving average, 17 times only since the past 30 to 60 days to rebound above it, I think this is going to be no different.</p><p>Now, to answer your question from a fundamental standpoint. We're coming in to a holiday season. Again, 73 percent of the people have not upgraded yet. I adamantly disagree with the fact or the theory that people are less likely to upgrade from 5 to 6, I don't think that makes any sense.</p><p>People are going to need to upgrade and Apple is a brilliant marketing company, they're going to have a huge holiday season. I think now is the time to buy for that reason alone.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. We will leave it there. We thank you for your time for your insights.</p><p>ROTMAN: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Jason Rotman joining us there. Mark Luschini as well. We thank you both.</p><p>When we come back, democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee calling on Tim Cook of Apple to release employee diversity data. Our next guest says Silicon Valley companies are being unfairly targeted on this issue.</p><p>Then you may be out of luck because of Suck. Forget your credit score? According to a new Facebook patent filed. Your Facebook friend's credit scores could keep you from borrowing money.</p><p>BOLTON: Some of the stories we're following for you right now. Debris, including part of an aircraft wing, is confirmed to be from the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane. It has been more than a year since the plane disappeared with 239 people on board.</p><p>The FBI is investigating the security of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. This is the one that she used when she was Secretary of State. The probe comes days after watchdogs from the state department and the intelligence community asked the Justice Department to explore whether or not classified material was improperly shared or stored on the e-mail account.</p><p>Security regulators are approving a final rule that requires public companies to disclose the ratios between annual comp of CEO's and median pay of employees. As you see, consider this change for years, it is finally here.</p><p>And Representative Barbara Lee, a democrat from California calling on tech companies including Apple to release federal data on diversity of their workforces. Lee was in Silicon Valley this week turning up the heat on the tech community to hire more African-Americans.</p><p>Well, last spring, the tech community did sneak into release details on the demographics of its employees. Yahoo, Google, LinkedIn among the first to publish stats. One of the reasons they did, a push from our next guest.</p><p>Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr. is with me now. He is an instrumental voice in this push for diversity. He is with me on the phone. Reverend, so glad you're with us. You have encouraged tech companies to share more information, calling on Congress to backup that call. Why is it so important for all of these companies to share their data in your view?</p><p>JESSE JACKSON SR., RAINBOWPUSH COALITION FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT: Hey, Deirdre. A lot of these employers are in our country. They're the fastest growth industry and they've been from the government and upon consumers.</p><p>We're not sending out Apple sending them out of the top 25 from 189 board members, 36 women were African-American, we have Latinos. And just to last year, about Twitter 49 blacks men, 16 Latinos, Facebook, 1600 employees, 140 blacks, just 7 blacks from the west different employees.</p><p>Twitter, I mean, Yahoo have 6,000 employees, 138 are black. So, it's not a pretty picture.</p><p>BOLTON: It's not a pretty picture. And even Nancy Lee, and I'm going to look at my notes here, reverend, to read the quote, \"Google's director of people operation told the San Jose Mercury news last spring. When we look around at the industry, we think we're doing OK, but it is not something we want to tout.\"</p><p>In your view, what is the number one most practical way that you think that tech companies can improve? How can they reach out to different communities, and therefore, recruit with a wider net?</p><p>JACKSON SR: With the set goals, targets and timetables, almost the least accepted federal standard, these comes as CEO 1 and contract compliance laws are very important. The government then land for them to file the yield 1 report. It's just that we should publish again as what they have come in the last year.</p><p>But they all have a great difference of people's color from their boards and the women. In the six weeks I went three steps with it, unlike three blacks and three Latinos, employment is around 2 percent. And I think that enforcing laws of fair practices for these companies is important.</p><p>BOLTON: Reverend, is it more important to have diversity in the rank and file, or is it more important in management to set an example?</p><p>JACKSON SR: Well, both examples, both of the employers, there are qualified people at every level. They spend more time looking for each one of the workers from India, from Asia, than training young people right here at home. And that's a big piece of consideration.</p><p>There is no talent deficit. There is an6 opportunity deficit. And besides each of those etiquette which we advocate very much at RainbowPush and engineers, the biggest employee base is now in take.</p><p>It's ad agencies, it's marketing. It's non-tech workers, that they are hovering around 2 percent in those categories. Some of them from the exempt from any other obligation, they stand up to what's just and fair.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Well, we're glad to have your thoughts on that. Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr., joining us there from the RainbowPush Coalition.</p><p>Our next guest takes an opposite view. Kevin Jackson is with me now. He's a former management consultant to some of the world's largest companies. He is with me now from St. Louis.</p><p>So, Kevin, what about this argument that the best people have to be found and perhaps there's just ways to get more people in that original pool?</p><p>KEVIN JACKSON, FORMER MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT: Hey, Deirdre. Well, first of all, everything Jesse Jackson just said is nonsense. The fact of the matter is, it's people like him that aren't getting qualified blacks jobs because if you're going to hire a black person, you got to understand you're bringing Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, the Department of Justice, the EEOC, the Department of Labor, and everybody else with you to that job. So, that's issue number one. And issue number two...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Just to stop you there, Kevin, what do you mean by that? That in other words, one employee has too much baggage to even focus on his or her job hunt?</p><p>JACKSON: That's exactly right. If you hire a white kid, that white kid can't do anything, he can get racist e-mails, calling him cracker or anything else he wants. And he can't do anything. He can go HR, and all he can do is just -- they'll laugh together, but they won't have a lawsuit.</p><p>But let a black kid get anything or black person at a company, have anything that isn't even related to him, and you've got everybody Jesse Jackson, and everybody coming to the fore to try to profiteer because that's what's happened in American's business. American business...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: So, Kevin, essentially you're saying if employers are unwilling or less willing to hire minorities because they're afraid of potential lawsuits, in case something goes wrong?</p><p>JACKSON: Absolutely. And they won't tell you that but that's a fact. And then the other part of it about what Jesse Jackson is looking at. He gave you all kinds of statistics about how many blacks, how many women, how many browns, or whatever.</p><p>How about we focus on how many people are truly qualified for jobs. The fact is, Google, Yahoo, and everybody he said will hire the best person if they're pink, if they're purple, if they're striped. They don't care. And that's the problem that Jesse Jackson has in waging a lawsuit against these people.</p><p>It's he knows they want the best people. It's the companies that allow this gangster type of mentality to occur that says you've got to have a certain number of blacks, whites, or whatever. I want qualified people. Business wants qualified people and they don't want the racial strife that comes with Jesse Jackson and his ilk. So, that's all that America is looking for.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Kevin, to your point, the H1-B Visas that he referenced and that is to say, that allows U.S. companies to reach out and keep students who are here from India, China, or Russia, wherever, there are 3 to 4 million jobs that go unfilled every month in the U.S. because there is a dearth of either math or engineering or science skills. So, maybe that's where we start is more with education?</p><p>JACKSON: Well, the fact of the matter is, if Google, the best people are in the United States, I guarantee you, Google, Yahoo, Apple and all those companies want them. They will do a job fair, they don't care what those people look like, what they sound like, they will translate for them. They'll do whatever it takes to get the best employees.</p><p>And if there's 3 million H1-B 1's contrary to what Obama or Jesse Jackson or the race pimps tell you, they will hire them and those people are waiting because they're the best employees. And that's the problem is the - - the education system in America is not producing the best employees anymore.</p><p>Instead, what we're doing is we're coddling people. We're saying, hey, use this EEOC guidelines and all this other nonsense that business -- that doesn't further business. Use those guidelines to get people hired but don't hire the best. That's why those jobs are unfilled.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Kevin Jackson, good clear view. We're so glad to have you with us. Joining us there from St. Louis.</p><p>So, when we come back, Facebook, your friend's credit, well, they could affect your own. A patent just filed has our next guest second-guessing his friend requests.</p><p>And Lexus, finally unveiling video of a prototype of a hover board. Social media is questioning its authenticity. Weigh in, tell us. Is it real? Is it Fake? You can tweet to us @deirdrebolton, to me directly or to the show @riskrewardfbn.</p><p>BOLTON: Next time you want to loan your Facebook friends may be important, more important than the papers you give to the bank. Social network filed for a new patent that would allow creditors to assess your creditworthiness based on the credit ratings of the people in your social network.</p><p>John Ulzheimer is with me now. He is CreditSesame.com president of consumer education. John, first and foremost, what do you make of this idea? What if I was a musician and my former career, now I'm an investment banker, but if my creative friends are still broke, I'm penalized?</p><p>JOHN ULZHEIMER, CREDITSESAME.COM PRESIDENT: Well, the challenge that you face is that there's this hypothesis in the world of social media/risk management that birds of a feather tend to flock together.</p><p>And if you have a large or disproportionate number of friends or connections on social media that indicate that they're high risk, then the likelihood of you being high risk, again, in their hypothesis is going to be much more likely, and therefore they may actually consider that when determining whether or not to do business with you and under what terms.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. But maybe times have changed, right? And I want to play for you, John, we had Mark Luschini as a guest. He's a co-founder of PayPal. Here's what he told me about the new credit environment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Credit works fairly well for established consumers' financial products. But if you're a young person fresh off the college bench, you're about to move tax brackets most likely. And the FICO score looks back and says, well, you know, just hold it up there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, in that sense, we know that Mark Luschini with a firm is actually loaning money to people with computer science degrees and other indicators, that even if they don't have money at that time, they will have it.</p><p>ULZHEIMER: Yes, that's right. And it's a very good point. The CSPV defines those people as the invisible. Meaning that they don't have any sort of established credit history, other than probably some student loans and maybe some collections from their former apartment complexes.</p><p>And it's true that credit scoring systems are much more effective when you have a long history, a robust credit history to look back onto determine whether you're going to be a subsequent risk going forward than the smaller the credit report.</p><p>And if you have no credit report, lenders still want to do business with you. And so, that's when they were going to start looking for the secondary and tertiary types of data sources to determine whether or not to do business.</p><p>Look, your Facebook score is never going to replace your Equifax credit report and your advantage score and your FICO score and your Transunion credit report, simply isn't going to do it.</p><p>But, where it can be very effective is, for example, my niece who is about to graduate from school, probably has very little credit history and is going want to lease an apartment, is going to want to buy a car, is going to buy a house someday.</p><p>And to penalize her because she has no robust credit history, without perhaps, looking how quality her connections are on Facebook. It seems to be a little bit unfair and actually can work in someone's favor. This isn't always going to work against somebody, it can actually work in your favor in many instances.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. John, great to have you with us. I should mention as well, Facebook, other big tech companies they filed for patents that they don't use, maybe this is just filing to file it.</p><p>When we come back, Disney's stock dropping more than 9 percent. Netflix going to an all-time high, a new media battle is brewing.</p><p>My panel guest will tell you which companies as they think will come out on top. Netflix also announcing a one year paid paternity leave and maternity leave for all employees, will other companies follow suit? We'll talk about it.</p><p>BOLTON: The first republican presidential debate of 2016 tomorrow night on Fox News. Donald Trump is the most successful candidate, if you measure by social media reads. Speaking of the Donald, some people say the number who watch the debate may, in fact, top the final episode of Trump's last celebrity apprentice.</p><p>With me now from Cleveland where the debate will take place is Blake Burman. So, Blake, what's Trump saying ahead of the big night?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Believe it or not, Deirdre, Donald Trump is actually lowering expectations a bit. You just mentioned that \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" the final episode of the last show had six million viewers, a little more than that.</p><p>Some feel the debate here tomorrow night could actually top that. For a little bit of perspective context there, the first primary debates of 2011, four years ago, were about half that, but they didn't have the Trump factor. Why so many people will be tuning in tomorrow night.</p><p>Still, though, Donald Trump lowering expectations talking about how he is not a debater at all while these politicians as he calls them are. I want you to take a little listen real quick to what he told Trish Regan this afternoon about lowering those expectations, here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to set the bar so low, I want to set that bar so low, you have you no idea. But we'll see what happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: So, he said, we'll see what happens. He talked about lowering the bar, laughing it off a little bit. We'll see what happens tomorrow night. Donald Trump did say earlier today as well as he has last night that he wants to approach this debate in a civil manner. But he also said, Deirdre, if he's attacked, he would fight back. We'll see when that happens.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. I was going to say...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURMAN: Who that happens thought in, how Donald Trump has thought.</p><p>BOLTON: ... yes. That seems like likely as in scale of 10 out of 10.</p><p>BURMAN: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Blake Burman joining me there from Cleveland, Ohio. Thank you very much, Blake.</p><p>Well, for more on tomorrow's GOP debate, social media power, Matt Witheiler from FlyBridge Capital Partners is here, as is Russ Frushtick, the editorial director at Product Hunt. Glad to have you both here.</p><p>So, what do you think about this debate? Let's just talk about it from a media perspective, perhaps a number of viewers outpacing \"The Apprentice\"?</p><p>MATT WITHEILER, FLYBRIDGE CAPITAL GENERAL PARTNER: Isn't really that surprising? I mean, everybody I know who's going to watch and is playing some form of drinking game involving Trump at some point. So, I think that it actually will be a ratings boon for Fox.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. And, Russ, from a social media perspective, you heard him say, I want to lower expectations so much.</p><p>RUSS FRUSHTICK, PRODUCT HUNTS EDITORIAL DIRECTOR: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: So, do you think he knows he's going to bomb but he's still just counting on Twitter, Facebook and the rest for his messages?</p><p>FRUSHTICK: Well, first of all, he's being very humble. I mean, that's what a good politician should lower expectations before a debate and then they come out and make a big splash, I think he'll definitely do that here. Whether it's a successful splash, helping his campaign, I don't know, but he certainly has a lot of social media power.</p><p>BOLTON: He does indeed. I mean, and he has this sort of upwards of 23 percent reach, you know, the next candidate is Jeb Bush, around 12 percent. So, love him or hate him. His message and his quote and quote, \"Authentic brand,\" seems to be resonating even with some of it is ironic.</p><p>WITHEILER: Yes. I think that's right. I think he's going to drive a big audience, whether you are for him or against him. It's really bringing everybody to the table for this debate.</p><p>And so, they will be a tell-tale performance for him, and that will he be able to convince people who, historically, have been anti-Trump to come on his side of the camp it. And it will really depend on how he performs.</p><p>BOLTON: Speaking of branding, going a little bit bigger, Disney versus Netflix. If you had to put money on either one, who's your dog in the race?</p><p>FRUSHTICK: Disney. Absolutely Disney.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>FRUSHTICK: I mean, Netflix is a good company and has a good product. Disney is in it for the long haul. If you're look for a long-term investment, they've been building these franchises like \"Star Wars\" and Marvel for the last 10 years.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. But they pay for that, I mean, it's like $4 billion a pop, $4 million a pop, sorry.</p><p>WITHEILER: Yes. No, that's exactly right. It's very expensive but at the same time, they are getting a huge return for that. Because that content that they produced is undistributed on Netflix. And so, when you think about shows like \"Daredevil,\" which is a Marvel property which is owned by Disney that's on Netflix, Disney is kind of taking revenue from one pocket which is the network content pocket and paying it over to Netflix.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Netflix also announcing an unlimited year of maternity and paternity leave, essentially they also have unlimited vacation. But essentially saying, listen, we trust you to be professional. You know what time you can take and when. To me this spoke of the talent war?</p><p>FRUSHTICK: It is part of it. I think another part of it is the -- this sort of a very obvious strategy in the Silicon Valley space where it's like, oh, you have unlimited time to take off, so people generally are very conservative with how they use their time.</p><p>If you have three weeks, you're going to take three weeks. So, I think this might be a good PR win for them, but also maybe a little bit of gamesmanship in terms of how people use their maternity leave.</p><p>BOLTON: Right. In other words, nobody really wants to take more than his or her peer, right?</p><p>WITHEILER: Yes, I think that's right. And I think that from a PR perspective, what it's really doing is it's winning Netflix a lot of points with the millennial generation who wants culture and work life balance. And Netflix doesn't want to lose employees because recruiting a new employee is much harder and more expensive than retaining somebody.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Hold those thoughts. We're going to continue the conservation. I'm going to be back with Matt and Russ in just a little bit of time.</p><p>Allegations of overpricing, social media activists calling whole foods out again. This time, though, for something as overpriced and zany as what you're looking at right now on your screens.</p><p>And with two million views already on YouTube, Lexus's new hover board getting a lot of publicity. Is it real? Tell us what you think. Tweet to us @deirdrebolton, @riskrewardfbn.</p><p>BOLTON: Chances are you have engaged with Taboola's content before. The platform recommends editorial and sponsored articles across many highly trafficked web sites. The goal? Help publishers monetize their content while creating a personalized experience for the user.</p><p>Co-founder and CEO, Adam Singolda is with me now. Adam, glad to have you with us.</p><p>ADAM SINGOLDA, TABOOLA FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BOLTON: I have often heard your company described as a search engine in reverse? Is that accurate?</p><p>SINGOLDA: Yes, I think it is.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. And for what reason, how does it work, how does it make what I consume better targeted for me?</p><p>SINGOLDA: So, you know, I started the company eight years ago living with my parents and trying to watch TV and I couldn't find anything to watch. And I thought, you know people should not be looking for TV shows, TV shows should be looking for me.</p><p>And I started the company, you know, with the vision to connect people with content they may like they never knew existed, which is in reverse to what you do with a search engine when you know exactly what you want to read.</p><p>So, with us, information hopefully it's finding you before you knew you were supposed searching for it.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. And as far as my data, what happens? How do you find me?</p><p>SINGOLDA: So, we work with some of the biggest media companies in the world. From USA Today that we're announcing today, Gannett, Business Insider, and many, many others. And at the bottom of the article do you know how you usually see other articles you may like. We do that which allows us to see what decisions are making when they finish consuming the content.</p><p>BOLTON: So, in theory, it also gives sellers of products or services better information on how and who to target?</p><p>SINGOLDA: Right. So, we're looking at all the information that's out there definitely. You know, all the media companies we're working with and we're trying to -- there are millions of different options trying to unless they second decide what are the two or three things you may like and never knew existed.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Now, mobile is so important right now. I know you have, as you referenced here, the deal with Gannett, how does it all fit together?</p><p>SINGOLDA: So, in general, what we're announcing today is it's exciting in two ways. On the one side from the business perspective, we're announcing that we expect to generate between 45 to $55 million in the next three years to come with Gannett and USA Today.</p><p>And the second one which is perhaps even more exciting is where with the industry is going where you buy. You know, I started the company eight years ago thinking personalization is the difference between me and you, and I think that was wrong.</p><p>If you think about the way you consume the web, think about when you wake up in the morning and you drink your coffee on the big screen, how do you behave consuming the news versus if you're on your way with your mobile from a Facebook app, how is that different?</p><p>So, we envision the web, the future of the web to be sort of a dragon with many, many heads. Whereby each head is an experience -- a different experience of the web that is telling not only to me but to me right now.</p><p>BOLTON: To the activity that you're currently doing.</p><p>SINGOLDA: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: It makes all the sense in the world. Congratulations on the deal with Gannett. We're glad to have you with. Adam Singolda joining me there. He is the co-founder and CEO of Taboola.</p><p>If you build it, they will come, that seems to be the device and mantra. We're going to show you the new plans for the tallest residential tower in the world.</p><p>And then, asparagus grows after allegation of overpricing, social media activists now accusing whole foods of selling $6 asparagus water. Find out how the company reacted, next.</p><p>BOLTON: Elon Musk is saying that storage, the battery business could generate, quote, \"A few billion dollars in 2017.\"</p><p>I am back right now with Matt Witheiler and Russ Frushtick. Thanks, guys, for staying with me. So, what do make, we know that as far as the Tesla and deliveries of cars, Elon Musk missed the target. But he's saying, wait, wait, wait, there's my battery business, it's going to rocket. Yea or nay, what do you say?</p><p>FRUSHTICK: Yes, I agree that there is more life there. You definitely don't want to get into a fight where you're fighting against manufacturing and the other big companies getting into this electronic -- electric car space. But, you know, that's the issue, like they haven't been hitting their numbers. So, it's not the best production.</p><p>BOLTON: Matt, we know that engineers do not hold these metrics against Elon Musk. Almost anyone in the tech community that I speak with would lie down in traffic for him because they say he puts his money where his mouth is. OK, finally, sometimes he makes mistakes on numbers but the spirit is in the right place?</p><p>WITHEILER: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: It that good enough for investors?</p><p>WITHEILER: I think it's good enough for its employees, it's good enough for investors that the price of which Tesla had priced that. Big question in my mind. It's easy to point to a shiny new object in battery business don't be distracted by the actual numbers in cars, but it's very speculative in my mind.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, because the stock is already up, something like 30 percent year-to-date. So, if you're an investor you do want something back for that. All right. Speaking of a different kind of fuel, whole foods apparently, selling asparagus water, which was essentially three stocks of asparagus in a jar colored asparagus water.</p><p>This is supposed to be just in one store brand with California. But hopefully it's really has this PR issues, price gouging nationwide, they're not the only shop I should say to be facing this. Is this more disappointing because hopefully this somehow supposed to be pure?</p><p>FRUSHTICK: I guess that's only their brand. They want to portray this pure brand. But like, it also doesn't tell to surprise us. Every time I go to the supermarket there is another crazy fruit and like a jar, oh, it's carry water now.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. You will live to be 700 years old if you drink this. Matt, what is your take?</p><p>WITHEILER: Yes, exactly. Didn't you drink it this morning...</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, there you go.</p><p>WITHEILER: ... before you even go to work? Now, I think that given the problems that whole foods has had in New York with the Attorney General here in allegations of price kind of manipulation on how much they were charging for products, this did not comment a good time for whole foods.</p><p>That being said, I'm pretty sure this was a prank and whoever is responsible probably won't take it too long.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: And I look the company's response. If you think something is not been weighed properly, just bring it back. We were joking, right?</p><p>WITHEILER: Exactly.</p><p>BOLTON: Like here's my half donut that should have been weighed or...</p><p>WITHEILER: My half drinks asparagus water.</p><p>BOLTON: There you go, there you go. Power and health to us all. Thank you both for joining me there. Matt Witheiler, a general partner joining us from FlyBridge Capital Partners, Russ Frushtick, editorial director at Product Hunts.</p><p>Well, move over Marty McFly because Lexus introducing a real hover board. So, they say, tweet us now. Tell us, real or fake, @deirdrebolton @riskrewardfbn. What do you think?</p><p>BOLTON: Some of the top stories trending right now at foxbusiness.com. Target, Walmart, 7-Eleven soon may have less junk at checkout counters. Center for Science and the public interest calling for the removal of those items because they cause obesity and can lead to diabetes. Fruits, vegetables, and granola bars are suggested replacement.</p><p>On the health theme, Fitbit reporting its first quarterly numbers as a public company. Wearables tech company earnings soaring.

New probate fees resulting in relative receiving bills of up to a million dollars last week to settle the estate of their loved one.</p><p>Well, speaking of transitions, we do want to let you know that \"Back to the Future 2,\" made some people dream of a real hover board. Lexus is saying it did. Take a look at this video, releasing a full video of pro-skate boarder. They say it's real.

This hour breaking news. The IRS is reporting the computer hack of its databases more extensive than previously thought. An additional 390,000 taxpayer accounts are potentially affected. Fox Business's Gerri Willis with me now. So, Gerri, this number is more than half the original amount referenced in May. Why the slow leak?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GERRI WILLIS, THE WILLIS REPORT SHOW HOST: All right. So, it wasn't a slow leak. These are just other names they've discovered from the same breach. As you say, 225,000 households breached. We learned about that in May. Another 390,000 today. That is a total of 615,000 households breached. Just to remind you, look, social security numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The social security numbers your children, your address, how much money you make, your income, all of that kind of data at risk here. And this information coming out, at the IRS conducted a deeper analysis of 23 million uses of the Get Transcript function, that's what sources are telling me.</p><p>They went deeper after the end, the close of tax filing season, they went back in, looked more deeply in this and they found many, many other people at risk here. Now, just to round this out here, they're offering free credit protection. Pin numbers that they will give to folks who are filing so that IRS knows they are legit, credit monitoring, and how they are going to tell you that this all happened? Well, Deirdre, they're going to snail mail you a letter to tell you, you've been breached.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Nothing like paste Gerri Willis. Thank you so much for more. One of the country's top so-called friendly hackers is with me now.</p><p>He is the CEO of Information Security Company, TrustedSec, David Kennedy. So, David, why are we hearing about this little by little?</p><p>DAVID KENNEDY, TRUSTEDSEC INFORMATION SECURITY COMPANY CEO: Well, the problem is when you have a breach like this, you know, the federal government isn't exactly known as having the best security when it comes to protecting personal information. Step they to go through, you know, thousands and thousands and millions of logs to figure out exactly what the hackers had access to.</p><p>And, you know, this earlier statistics of around 600,000, they actually had -- they were successful around 50 percent of the time on guesting, you know, the account information to get access to your data. So, that's pretty alarming to see that they had high success in getting personal information.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, personal information, and as my colleague, Gerri Willis, just pointed out, its social security numbers.</p><p>KENNEDY: That's right.</p><p>BOLTON: Its salary levels, its people's children social security numbers.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: So, what are the chances that the number goes higher or that the kind of information is even deeper although, I can't imagine what is deeper than social security number?</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, that's the problem with these types of breaches. The government doesn't have a lot of monitoring detection capabilities of actually detecting these hackers. So, they're really trying to go back to looking at a lot of this information. So, the numbers could definitely go up. Who knows?</p><p>And the problem you have with this, you know, it's not just, you know, like getting your credit card stolen. They have to go back in, look that it's your identity that's actually taken, which means that it could be 5 years, 10 years from now before you actually see the impact of this.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Five to 10 years, which is a long time to wait before you try to apply for a mortgage or some sort of a practical process.</p><p>KENNEDY: That's right.</p><p>BOLTON: And find out that somehow your credit or something is very much off. But, how did this kind of information -- I heard you say, that the government really isn't up to date? Is it software, is it humans? Where is the weakest link in our system right now?</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, first here, the government they're literally 5 to 10 years behind the private sector. So, it's everywhere. It's their web sites. It's the, you know, the humans themselves. There's a lot of vulnerabilities that we have right now in the federal government. And unfortunately, they're the largest conglomeration of data that we have, you know, around personal information on our social security numbers and everything else.</p><p>So, in this specific one, it was through their web sites. They didn't have good security protections in place to stop large these amounts of collection and data exfiltration. So, you know, it's unfortunate all aspects right now in the federal government.</p><p>BOLTON: So, David, based on what you know, do you think that the federal government is doing something, that is to say, maybe not publicly, but is looking to hire, is looking to upgrade its web, anything?</p><p>KENNEDY: I think they're trying. The problem is that security is one of those things you need to move fast, you need to make changes real quickly, which is the exact opposite of how the government operates. So, it's very difficult for them to go in and implement these changes in a quick manner to protect it.</p><p>So, we're unfortunate we're going to see these for the next few years, where we have large amounts of social security numbers and personal information taken. The government can't just move quick enough.</p><p>BOLTON: David, thank you so much.</p><p>KENNEDY: Thanks, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: David Kennedy joining us there, CEO of TrustedSec. Well, on related theme of security, the New York Times is reporting that telecom company AT&amp;T has worked in a close partnership with the NSA for decades, giving the government access to billions of customer e-mails.</p><p>Peter Barnes is with me now from D.C. So, Peter, how is AT&amp;T different than its peers? I'm thinking about Verizon or any other one?</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, according to The Times story, Deirdre, Times story, Deirdre, it says that basically AT&amp;T was acting more like a business partner with the super eavesdropping spy agency, the National Security Agency than its competitors, collecting data on billions -- on Americans billions of pieces of information from 2003 to 2013.</p><p>According to documents released by former government contractor Edward Snowden. The Times says AT&amp;T installed surveillance equipment in at least 17 of its Internet hubs on American soil, far more than its competitor Verizon which is similar in size.</p><p>And AT&amp;T engineers were the first to try out new surveillance technologies invented by the NSA. Now the documents do not specifically identify AT&amp;T or any companies by name. Instead, they refer to corporate partnerships run by the agency's special source operations division.</p><p>That division is responsible for more than 80 percent of the information the NSA collects according to one document. An analysis by the Times and ProPublica, says the evidence points to AT&amp;T as the program's partner and several former intelligence officials confirmed that finding to The Times.</p><p>Now in a statement, an AT&amp;T spokesman said, quote, \"We do not provide information to any investigating authorities without a court order or other mandatory process, other than if a person's life is in danger and time is of the essence. For example, in a kidnapping situation we could provide help tracking down called numbers to assist law enforcement. A spokesperson had nothing further to add. And the NSA did not respond to our request for comment.</p><p>BOLTON: Peter, we thank you as always. Peter Barnes joining us there from D.C. Well, for an insider's perspective, we bring in former NSA technical chief, Bill Binney. The bottom line, AT&amp;T helping U.S. spy on the Internet, vast scale. Bill, we're glad to have you with us.</p><p>So, AT&amp;T, as you just heard my colleague Peter Barnes talking about providing the NSA with billions of phone records, billions of e-mails. What are the chances this is still happening?</p><p>WILLIAM BINNEY, NSA WHISTLEBLOWER: Oh, I think it is absolute -- I mean, that's the main reason I left NSA back in October of 2001. That's when they started doing the bulk transfer of data on every U.S. citizen using a telephone that they had record of.</p><p>But since then, I mean, it has expanded and this is the AT&amp;T program now. It's called Fairview and it got taps to all across the United States between 80 to 100 taps across the network, getting the fiber data both for telephone and for Internet.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Bill, what do you say, for example, I'm assuming you told your bosses if you're talking with us about it, that the reason you left the NSA, I'm assuming at some level because you felt it was personally unethical to spy on citizens, is that the reason?</p><p>BINNEY: Well, it was a violation of the First and Fourth Amendments, primarily the Constitution, simply because when you pull in all the phone records, it's not just the to and from. You can do a reverse look up on the phone book and find out who it is and where they live, and then you could see everybody they're associated with.</p><p>Well, the First Amendment has right to free association. It doesn't say you have that with understanding that NSA needs to know about it. And of course...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: So, Bill, I just want to take the opposite point of view, just for argument sake. What did you say to your bosses because I'm sure you had numerous debates when they just said, look, surveillance is a necessary evil in the post-9/11 world?</p><p>BINNEY: Surveillance is always been a necessary evil but it doesn't, it has to be directed. This is bulk acquisition of everybody in the United States. It's not directed. And you could certainly do that by a warrant. That is not a problem at all. So, that was always possible.</p><p>BOLTON: So, essentially, you're saying that these larger nets that are being cast, those are the ones that go against the Constitution?</p><p>BINNEY: Yes. They also bury the NSA analysts. That's why they're failing. And I use the Garland shooting in Texas a few weeks ago. Anonymous, two people I think, one or two people from anonymous had tipped the Garland police off that were going to -- that attack was going to occur two days before it hit. And our intelligence committee...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: And why wasn't that caught in your view?</p><p>BINNEY: Well, because our intelligence, well, I mean, they were ready for it anyway, so. But our intelligence community didn't tell them anything. And the difference is the intelligence community is looking at bulk data on everybody on the planet. And anonymous was looking at very focused set of people who were involved in terrorist activity or threatening that and focusing on them to watch them.</p><p>That's what our intelligence community should be doing. That's what the FBI should be doing so that they can succeed instead of fail every time. They failed in Boston. Failed in Times Square. They failed in Texas. They failed in, you know, Fort Hood. Keep failing. Why? Because they're buried in data.</p><p>This is already been published also by from material from Snowden where internally, an NSA, the analysts at NSA were saying they have too much data. They can't get through it all. They can't figure out what's happening.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, big data as you rightly point out, Bill, is useless without analysis.</p><p>BINNEY: Exactly.</p><p>BOLTON: We're glad to have you with us. Bill Binney, joining us there, NSA whistleblower. Well, when we come back, some Amazon employee are accusing the company of running a soulless, dystopian workplace. Author Larry Winget says, workers should stop whining, just work harder. He's with us, next.</p><p>And then, Apple CEO speaking of its big tech. Tim Cook finally releasing diversity figures saying they are up 50 percent in all demographics. Not everyone is happy with those results. Reverend Jesse Jackson is going to be with us. His first official response is coming your way.</p><p>BOLTON: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos forced to publicly defend his company's corporate culture after scathing article was published in The New York Times called Amazon's bruising, thrilling workplace.</p><p>The Article say its former employees such as, Bo Olson, who worked there for almost two years quoted as saying in the article, \"Nearly every person I worked with I saw cry at their desk.\" Gerri Willis is here without tears as am I. What is your take Gerri on this?</p><p>WILLIS: This blew me away. This is the way the world works in competitive industries, right? So, these people were mad because their ideas had been criticized. In meetings that never happens right, every single day?</p><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p>WILLIS: Or maybe they got in a late night phone call and they had to answer it. Let me tell you what one person said. Let me read you this, \"When you have so much turnover, the risk is that people see it as -- see people -- is that people are seen as fungible.\" Pardon me. \"You know that tomorrow you're going to look around, and some people are going to have left the company or been managed out.\"</p><p>And that's exactly what happens in the private sector, particularly competitive arenas like technology.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, we take it for granted. I mean, Amazon we see as the top dog but, Jack Ma, the chairman of Alibaba said, I'm coming to Silicon Valley, head's up, Amazon. So, it underlines the competitive pressure that these companies are under.</p><p>One of the recruiters I read in that piece saying, \"When you're shooting for the moon -- and I'm quoting her actually, the nature of the work is really challenging and for some people it just doesn't work.\"</p><p>WILLIS: Well, let's just talk about a couple of good things. I thought this article was really trying to kill a successful company. They were trying to shoot a successful company in the foot. Largest retailer in the world, right? Bezos the fifth largest person in the world. Here's is what Jay Carney had to say about the growth in employment in this country. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY CARNEY, AMAZON SENIOR VP: For the past five years, we've grown from 28,000 employees to 183,000 employees. And somehow, we managed to do that and managed to keep some of the best talent in the industry because they like it so much. Because of the spirit of innovation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: Yes, that was the former spokesman for the White House, now representing Amazon. But he makes a good point this. This is a company that has grown faster, larger, more than Microsoft. It is much bigger than Twitter. All the other tech companies.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Microsoft is referred to I read it as a country club in that article or has some serious overtones of that. Gerri Willis, thank you very much.</p><p>WILLIS: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Great reporting. Gerri Willis joining us there. Well, that New York Times piece on Amazon's work is a tough profile. Jeff Bezos as we said publicly responded. So, for many, this is not really the image of Silicon Valley employers, with a long list of perks ranging from free food and snacks to unpaid maternity leave.</p><p>My next guest says amazon employees need to stop being crybabies. Larry Winget is here. Here is the author of \"Grow a Pair.\" He is with me from Phoenix. Larry, what can I say, we are very glad you are with us. But what are the chances that Amazon is a decent place to work but has pockets of toxicity like any big company?</p><p>LARRY WINGET, \"GROW A PAIR\" AUTHOR: Well, I said, there is probably pretty good chance of that. That's a great big company. And you could have pockets of that anywhere. Overall, though, when I read most of these interviews with these ex-employees.</p><p>First of all, it's not hard to find disgruntled ex-employees. I don't care how big your company is you can always those people. But when I read them it was kind of like reading a Yelp review of my favorite restaurant. I don't believe most of it. And that's...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Amazon, Google, Facebook, I mean, these are companies that others want to emulate, eventually even bring down, so to speak, in a competitive aspect. So, how tough is it for these big companies to keep the part of their startup culture? I actually was on Cyber Dust, that's Mark Cuban's network. Earlier it's anonymous.</p><p>Just asking, how many of you work for big companies? How many of you feel like they lost their startup culture? And most people say, you know what, once a company gets above, I don't know, a few thousands, it's hard to keep that team spirit.</p><p>WINGET: It is hard to keep the team spirit. And I think that is certainly coming into play in the case of Amazon, but is going to be part of any huge company. The point is, Amazon has been very clear about what their culture is from the beginning. Jeff has not been unclear about what he says he wants from his employees and what he wants from the work that goes on there.</p><p>So, I'm a little surprised sometimes when people want to attack and tear apart. But, then again, we always want to tear apart the biggest dog on the block and he is the biggest dog right now.</p><p>BOLTON: And to be fair to his leadership abilities, I mean, he came out very publicly this morning and said, if this is your experience at Amazon as an employee, this not the experience that I want you to have for somebody working for this company. Escalate your concerns right away to the highest levels of HR. So, we essentially made this public open statement take it up with your supervisor, take it up with HR.</p><p>WINGET: Well, as what they could have been doing all along if they had a problem. In most companies that's how it works. If you have issue go to the HR department. In fairness, though, he had to come out and respond. I mean, The New York Times wrote this scathing article about him and he had to respond publicly.</p><p>And he did a good job when he came out and said that's not the company that I run and if you have a problem, write me. Now I doubt anybody actually writes him personally but he did come out the right way and attack it head- on.</p><p>BOLTON: Larry, last question. Do you think that Silicon Valley is tougher place to work? I mean, this sounds like the atmosphere on any Wall Street trading desk on which I have been on a few or partner track at a law firm?</p><p>WINGET: Well, you know, Silicon Valley is probably made up mostly of millennials and the workforce has changed considerably. And they expect a lot different, sort of interaction with their employer than they did with the boomers and my generation.</p><p>So, it is going to have to be a different sort of leadership that's out there and that's what I think the problem is. Leadership swings both ways. This pendulum swings both ways. And it's tougher right now for leaders to figure out what millennials really want in the work place.</p><p>BOLTON: Larry, thank you very much. We're glad to have you.</p><p>WINGET: Thanks.</p><p>BOLTON: Larry Winget, joining us there. He is author of the book, \"Grow a Pair.\"</p><p>Apple one of the biggest and latest Silicon Valley companies to release its diversity stats. And one reason that any of these companies have been releasing data is due to the work of our next guest.</p><p>The Reverend Jesse Jackson, Sr. he is the founder and president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition. He is with us now from Chicago. Reverend, I know you were attending the services for Julian Bond. So, we thank you in particular for making the time to speak with us today.</p><p>But on this subject of diversity of equal opportunity, what do you make of Apple's new numbers, 50 percent improvement across all categories?</p><p>JESSE JACKSON SR., RAINBOW PUSH COALITION PRESIDENT: Well, they're growing with much stimulation and Apple has been lax in its diversity and its inclusion. And Tim Cook himself said, that is the fault of the company that they could not have been as diverse as they could be.</p><p>There has not been talent shortage. There has been an opportunity shortage. So, women and people of color. Silicon Valley the top 500 companies have 189 board members. For example, 36 are white women, three African-American, one Latino. That does not represent the talent pool. We still want the talent pool to look horizontally to look like a consumer base.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Reverend, when you speak about the talent pool, do you really think that Americans have it? I mean, there are on average four million jobs per month that remain unfilled in this country and as group, it is not just Silicon Valley, Corporate America says, there are not the people here with these so-called stem skills, science, math, engineering?</p><p>JACKSON SR.: First of all, there are a number of steam-trained people that can't get a job, number of one. Number two, half the jobs are non-stem in the first place. They're lawyers, ad agencies and marketing, and investment, and engineering and construction.</p><p>And so, they have not done a good job of hiring or recruiting and training. They have spent more time with H1B workers from Indonesia from China than they have from training workers at home. We think workers at home deserve a fair shake.</p><p>BOLTON: When you speak about H1B Visas, we had GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump talk about immigration, not in specific reference to the H1B issues, but to immigration and his plan include building a wall. What do you make of that plan?</p><p>JACKSON SR.: Here's what we do whether we do better with bridges than we do with walls. We export to south, central Latin America. And they import here. Building better trade relations may be better than building walls.</p><p>We do share 2,000 miles of border with Mexico, for example. But south of Mexico, south-central, Latin America, these are our neighbors. And I think that rather than building walls I'm little concerned that we expand the relationship with Cuba.</p><p>We pull Venezuela into the fold and have good relations with our neighbors. That would make Central America secure and prosperous.</p><p>BOLTON: So, you mention just to cycle back to the H1B V issue, should that be separated from other kinds of immigration?</p><p>JACKSON SR.: That's according to, you know, again, American workers should have the first option on American jobs. And you should have one -- for Cubans and Asia, for example. You cannot leave youth in Oakland and San Francisco in urban America and untrained and we bring the workers from other countries.</p><p>I think that the American youth should have the option to be Silicon Valley workers. As a matter of fact, Rainbow PUSH is getting a thousand churches to build in their churches app and tech training, app and co-training for our youth in financial literacy and stock market gain begin to train our youth in that direction.</p><p>So, that doesn't just suggest we can't do that work. We should have an opportunity. And when we have the work, whether Apple or Amazon, it should be workplace safety and workplace security conducive for human being.</p><p>BOLTON: And starting with education, never a bad place to start. As you say, coding is the new literacy. Reverend Jesse Jackson, Sr., joining us there. Thank you for your time. Rainbow PUSH Coalition president.</p><p>When we come back, oil briefly dropped below $42 today. It may drop a whole lot more. The Obama administration just announcing Shell's approval to drill for oil and gas under the Arctic.</p><p>BOLTON: Here are some of the stories we are following for you right now. A deadly bomb blast rocks a busy tourist hot spot in Bangkok during the evening rush hour. At least 27 people are dead and dozens are injured.</p><p>To Brazil, hundreds of thousands of protesters are calling for the President Rousseff's impeachment. Marchers are denouncing widespread corruption and blaming her for the worst slammed in 25 years. The president's approval rating has fallen to only 8 percent in recent polls.</p><p>The Pentagon to sharply increasing the number of U.S. drone flights by 50 percent in the next four years. The plan brought in surveillance and intelligence collection in places such us, Ukraine, Iraq, Syria, the South China Sea, and North Africa.</p><p>And the first republican debate has shaken up the 2016 GOP presidential race. The latest Fox News national poll of registered voter is in. On the democratic side, Clinton dropping below 50 percent for the first time. Vermont Senator, Bernie Sanders, keeps climbing.</p><p>Businessman Trump is leading the field for the republican nomination with 25 percent of GOP primary voters. Trump reporting for jury duty, by the way, in lower Manhattan earlier today served his one required day was not chosen for jury duties, press surprised, cannot be called back for another six years.</p><p>Well, speaking of news that we are following for you. The Obama administration approving undersea Arctic drilling for Shell oil. Now, oil prices are lower. So, the larger context here is six and a half, your low point for prices today. My next guest says it's a good time, though, to invest in pipelines and energy companies that make oil transport and storage happen.</p><p>Michelle Kelly is with me now. She is managing director of Tortoise Capital, manages over $18 billion in energy investments. Michelle, it's great to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>MICHELLE KELLY, TORTOISE CAPITAL MANAGING DIRECTOR: Thank you. It's great to be here.</p><p>BOLTON: So, we just talked about these oil prices being at six and a half year low. It seems as if that the Obama administration has given the green light to more drilling, which at least in my mind means prices could yet move lower. But you say it's a good time to invest in energy, why is that?</p><p>KELLY: Well, we've certainly seen a lot of activity in the energy space. And in a way it's really been like a global test game. You have geopolitics, economic activity, currency, already impacting the price of oil and we are really at six year lows here, around $42. And we've really seen everything in energy really ahead.</p><p>But we think that in a way, the baby has been thrown out with the bathwater and there is opportunity in various parts of energy, and particularly in the pipeline space. And that's because of the defensive nature of their asset.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, in a sense, is it safer to invest in price line in actual structure? Because, I mean, no matter the price of oil is it still needs to float through something, right?</p><p>KELLY: That right. If you think of the spectrum of energy you have the oil and gas producers, such a really getting the oil and gas out of the ground to those pipelines, which are energy toll roads, there are just responsible for transporting energy to areas of demand. And if you think about the energy, it's so essential to everyday lives whether taking our showers, driving our kids to school, even in this plastic eyeglasses I'm wearing it is absolutely essential. And with pipeline companies it's serving that very important role in our society.</p><p>BOLTON: So, do you see less demand or do you -- are you fielding more questions from investors who say, well, why should I invest? Because it seems like, you know, even cars, for example, electric cars are becoming more and more mainstream?</p><p>Michelle Kelly: Well, it's interesting. The lower price for crude oil is actually impacting consumers at the pump. And so, with the gasoline prices where they are, we're seeing a 5 percent increase in refine product demand. And if you think about pipelines it moves not only crude but refine products and also natural gas. And there is a big opportunity on the natural gas side as well.</p><p>BOLTON: Especially with a -- Jaron is telling us El Nino if going to be even a bit tougher, bring about some tougher weather patterns, which doesn't apply colder winter in some parts of the country. Michelle Kelly, it's great to see you. Thank you so much. Joining us there, managing director with Tortoise Capital.</p><p>When we come back, Apple is looking for a secure location to test its driverless cars. This is according to a new report; Silicon Valley may be the new Detroit. We'll give you the detail.</p><p>BOLTON: Apple reportedly scouting out a secure site in the San Francisco area to test driverless vehicles. \"Appetalize on Your Idea\" author, Justin Esgar is here. Digital Trends editor-in-chief, Jeremy Kaplan as well. Great to see you both.</p><p>JUSTIN ESGAR, \"APPITALIZE ON YOUR IDEA\" AUTHOR: Hi.</p><p>BOLTON: So, apparently, Apple, it's so secret. They even kept it from their own employees. There is rumored or news of four miles north from the Cupertino headquarters? A lot of engineers working on a big fancy prospect. What do you think?</p><p>ESGAR: I'm an Apple fan boy. Everybody knows that I run an Apple consulting company. I'm all that Apple that -- I normally have my Apple or whatever. I really want this to happen, I would totally get one but at the same time I kind of want Apple to stick to their bread and butter. Make good computers, make good phones. If they expand beyond that, you know, who knows. But I'm all for it at the same time. Salutatorian.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, The Guardian newspaper reports that this is called project- tighten. And to your point, Apple may be partnering with other car companies. There has been a lot of discussions. Almost every other big car company apparently Tim Cook has held meetings with.</p><p>JEREMY KAPLAN, DIGITAL TRENDS EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Yes. They've been rumored to be working with BMW. Look, I think there is a germ truth in this. They have people that are working on cars. They have a product too, it's car play. I think maybe what's happening is that they're doing an evolution of car play rather than creating a platform for cars because that's just a really different place.</p><p>BOLTON: So, they may just be testing out this kind of Apple dash board for perhaps BMW if not other car company?</p><p>KAPLAN: Personally, and it's just a speculation on my part, I think that this is just Apple being secretive about their in-car stuff rather than someone creating it.</p><p>BOLTON: But there is nothing that makes people want to dig more than saying it's a secret, right?</p><p>KAPLAN: Of course.</p><p>BOLTON: Like a red flag especially to us -- especially to us journalist. Now, speaking of the opposite of secrets. Disney D23 Expo Saturday morning, 8,000 fans gathering standing ovation, this is crazy. Is Disney trumping Apple as far as life events go?</p><p>ESGAR: Possibly but the things is they have so many great titles under their name that it's really for them to be able to do. Like they own Marvel and they now own \"Star Wars\" or some trouble talk about. And they are going to build that new \"Star Wars\" park and they own Kingdom Hearts, all these things. It's really easy for them to get people excited about their upcoming products.</p><p>BOLTON: Also \"Star Wars\" the force awakens. There you go. I got it in there, director J.J. Abrams, I mean, this is like the coolest of the cool, right?</p><p>KAPLAN: I couldn't be more excited for more \"Star Wars\" to come out. Oh, my, God, it's going to be the greatest thing ever. That's all I can say. It's not surprising that D23 is so big.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. And I mean, saying essentially there is going to be new theme parks added based around this. I mean, this isn't just like, hey, we're going to print some extra...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KAPLAN: And we're talking about it before. Why wasn't there already a theme park?</p><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p>KAPLAN: How much do we love this stuff?</p><p>ESGAR: I mean, they already sold those out. But, yes, \"Stars Wars\" we were talking earlier that they have the \"Indiana Jones\" park at Universal like they need that \"Star Wars\" park now and I would immediately buy a ticket...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Well, I keep going back to when Disney bought Lucas Films for $4 billion and everybody like, oh, they over paid. And now, it seems not so much, right? They're fully developing this idea. So, you know, developing idea target expanding its Curbside pickup to New York and New Jersey.</p><p>I actually spoke with the CEO of Curbside. Here's what he told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JARON WALDMAN, CURBSIDE CEO: Curbside is free. It provides instant on- demand commerce, has it ready for you as you go and you spring by the storm pick it up, we meet you upfront. So, our technology alerts folks that a storm is coming and you just drop by, it's in your trunk and you often on your way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, here we are, you could it now economy coming to target.</p><p>ESGAR: I'm trying to figure out, who needs this? I asked a couple of people about like who would really use this. And I think it's great for people who have like a young kid in the car and can't get out because taking up the car, she is in the stroller the whole night. But like how more immediate do we need to get our stuff?</p><p>Like Amazon has next day, you go to the store -- you can really go to the store and like be that, but, you know, I don't want to go in the store. I want to go through the store but I don't want to go in the store. So, I'm trying to figure out exactly like who is this is for.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. It's a bit like seamless bit for shopping, right? Instead of like -- but I hear what you're saying.</p><p>ESGAR: But seamless comes to me, right. Like if Target was like, I'll deliver to in an hour, I get that, but for me to first drive to the store...</p><p>BOLTON: So, I actually asked because I have to admit, I'm with you on this. And I actually asked the Curbside CEO more or less your question. And he said, well, actually there is a lot of people who want to do their own errands, they want to drive around and, you know, they want to sort of put that order, then go to other stuff and then come and pick it up within a 15-minite window. What is your take?</p><p>KAPLAN: Here's the thing. There is a lot of the incredibly challenging algorithms in technology that goes into this even though it might seem a little bit silly to us. A quick anecdote if I could, when they are first working on harvesting bananas, there was a challenge getting bananas from the field and onto the boat. And they invented a form of short wave radio in order to facilitate, that's the bananas we get the right way. Transportation and delivery of things is really hard. It's a logistical challenge. And this company has gone there and they're addressed that.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. I like that. I like stories about fruit. This is fantastic.</p><p>KAPLAN: We love bananas.</p><p>BOLTON: Justin and Jeremy will be back with us in just a minute. Speaking of bananas, the U.S. flag may not be the only thing left on the moon. If billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX has its way, you could have a new sports drink, not kidding, advertisement of there as well. There you have it. Believe it's possible.</p><p>BOLTON: A Japanese drink maker said it to become the first company to advertise on the moon when SpaceX or another lands Rover on the moon next year. It is going to bring a can of Pocari Sweat, that is the name of sports drink, which apparently taste like Gatorade. It is going to be left on the lunar plane for a future astronauts to find later.</p><p>We are appropriately with Justin or Jeremy or maybe inappropriately, but here e are. So, what do you think? And I should also say this is not in liquid form just in case you were concerned about that, it is in powder form.</p><p>ESGAR: Yes. The company actually like hired physicist to like figure out how they can have the can be like build it as a titanium...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, I saw that.</p><p>ESGAR: ... but they took all the water out of it so they can actually just live it on the moon. Their thing is that they want to have future generations become astronauts and go up there and then someone rehydrate it and drink it, which is great in concept, but like leave it to a company in Japan to come up to something like that.</p><p>BOLTON: But it's also -- I guess advertising is very lightly regulated on moon.</p><p>KAPLAN: Well, the thing is we don't have any real regulation because it's only been the U.S. that's been going up there and we haven't done it in decades and there is no real issue, and then all of a sudden, now there is really an issue.</p><p>We have actually already polluted the moon to a great extent with the Apollo Rovers and left over trash and what not. This is the first intentional thing we're bringing up there and dropping off. It seems we're the men.</p><p>BOLTON: It seems extraordinarily weird, but at the very least to this company, this Japanese sports drink company is already getting tons of publicity, so whether they do it or whether they don't it, we now all know Pocari Sweat.</p><p>KAPLAN: Pocari Sweat, yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Which looks like sweat. Case like Gatorade looks like sweat.</p><p>KAPLAN: I can't wait to take a bottle of that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Taste like chicken.</p><p>ESGAR: I think it's sweat.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Well, speaking of...</p><p>KAPLAN: I told you there's no problem with that.</p><p>BOLTON: ... the earth, scientists are developing a kind of inflatable space elevator, believe it or not. So astronauts are sending 12 miles, if this works, into the stratosphere before taking off. It feels like essentially you become part of the pinball machine and you're the ball. I guess is the idea.</p><p>ESGAR: I hate heights, so...</p><p>BOLTON: This isn't for you.</p><p>ESGAR: ... definitely not for me.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>ESGAR: But like I've been thinking about this for a while. First of all, this idea came up like the 1800's like, how do we go up like that high. I feel bad for the guy who climbs the ladder they're going to fix something up there like an amusement park.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Jeremy.</p><p>KAPLAN: I disagree. I love the concept. It has been for a while. They just haven't done it right. If you think about it you swing a tennis ball around in the string and if it stays out there, that's what is going on here. It seems really, really easy, we just need to find a way to do it. If it's in this inflatable thing, fine.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: And you think it is worthwhile doing it.</p><p>KAPLAN: And we could save billions of dollars on fuel to get up there.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Because I'm rethinking it because it's unfeasible so far because no matter exist that could support itself at such high and we just thought as compare to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KAPLAN: So, they talked about nano materials that could maybe do it. I think technology is getting us there. Science is getting us there.</p><p>ESGAR: And there is a real reason for it eventually. I mean, they say it takes like 1.3 million foot pounds of thrust to get off the ground and that's a lot of fuel. And if this is up there like they can make rocket ships take off much, much easier.</p><p>KAPLAN: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: And I guess things that seem actually crazy to us right now. In 20 years, it would be a very common place.</p><p>ESGAR: And it's an easier way for them to pick up their Pocari Sweat.</p><p>BOLTON: There you go. There you go. Tying it like to not tie better together myself. Justin and Jeremy, thank you both. Great conversation.</p><p>ESGAR: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Thirty four start-ups going under this year. According to a new report, we have the CEO of one who says his company is different. He is going to tell you why.</p><p>BOLTON: He is what's catching my eye on Twitter today. Constantly checking your phone could be bad for your brain. According to a new study, the more a person uses the Internet or a mobile phone more prone they are to, quote, \"Cognitive failures.\" Frequent users apparently more likely to daydream during conversations and have difficulty paying attention.</p><p>Uber's app has a new update that puts a huge emphasis on food delivery. When you open the app you can choose between hailing a car or ordering food. The company launched Uber Eat in Los Angeles last year. It is since expanded to New York City, Toronto, Austin, Chicago, and Barcelona. In each of these cities Uber partners with few restaurants per day to deliver meals, chosen ones to its customers.</p><p>Well, Snap Chat head of news tweeted a photo of Donald Trump being considered for jury duty today. The caption just your average day at jury duty. Now, you can see him sitting there. Other around him seems to be casually doing their own thing.</p><p>Well, speaking of Snap Chat it is still considered in startup category, even though it has raised quite a lot of money but the private markets. A new report from CB Insights says it is tricky to found a successful company, tricky to invest in one.</p><p>And if you look at the stats that CB Insights provided, 34 start-ups have failed since the beginning of 2015.</p><p>We're bringing in right now RealtyShares founder and CEO, Nav Athwal. He is with me. So, Nab, you have built a successful real estate crowdfunding. First and foremost, did you ever get intimidated by statistics like that?</p><p>NAV ATHWAL, REALTYSHARES FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Well, just to be clear, start-ups are risky. Start-ups have always been risky. I think the press plays up how risky they are by showing highlighting the failures, but nothing has changed. The only thing that's changed is the market is very choppy.</p><p>We see more venture capital flowing in the start-us now so the success are greater -- oh, sorry, the failures are greater, but always have always been prevalent in the start-up space. And the keys to success haven't changed. You have to have strong product market that you need something users want. You have to have scale or business model.</p><p>Do you have something that could generate revenue. You have to have a hyper focus on customers' success. Do customers want you? Do they want to keep using you? And finally, you have to manage burn. Too many start-ups ran out of cash because they're trying to grow too quickly before they have these other things.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Nav, I beg to differ. I'm glad for all of that, but I beg to differ on your point that the press emphasizes failures. I think the press emphasizes success. It seems like 30 years ago, it was cool to be in the van. And I feel like now it's cool to be either part of a start-ups or investing in start-ups.</p><p>But you gave us a few key metrics that you consider. Obviously when you're working on your own, what have been maybe some of the learning tales that you've tried to learn, let's say, from other's mistakes?</p><p>ATHWAL: I think the key takeaway is really how do you manage your money? You have to have a good process in place to know make sure you're not burning more than you actually have in the bank. And that's the number one failure of start-ups. Before they have product market failure or customer success, they ran out of money.</p><p>So, for us it's really been about do we have market product that -- yes, we have a platform that users want. We provide investors and ability to invest as little as $5,000 in the real-estate market. We provide borrowers with the more efficient way to raise capital.</p><p>We have borrowers and investors that are using us three or four times a year to a high repeat rate. So, the big take away really is, do you have enough money, are you growing too quickly for what you can actually manage for your start-up and that's the biggest learn I've taken away from both failures and successes in the start-up ecosystem.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Nav, I know this doesn't particularly apply to you or to RealtyShares, but what about companies that say, we just need a lot of users, if we get a lot of users the revenue will come?</p><p>ATHWAL: I think, you know, Facebook pioneer that thought process of let's get a lot of users and that that will revenue will come. I think that's great. If you have a great product that a lot of users want to use, over time if you get enough of them, you will able to monetize whether it's through advertisers or to sort of up selling down. I'm going from premium to premium. There are ways to monetize.</p><p>But if your only business model is get a lot of users and then monetize without anything more without something users actually want, without product market, without customers they want to use you time and time again, that's a faulty business model.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Nav, it's great to have your insight on that. Come back, we'll talk a little bit more about real estate and investing. Nav Athwal joining us there. He is RealtyShares founder and CEO.</p><p>When we come back, attacking koalas. They're not always furry and cuddly. Eucalyptus-eating teddy bears. There is one who is pretty motivated. We'll tell you why.</p><p>BOLTON: Here are some of the stories trending on fox Business.com. Citigroup announcing it will pay nearly $180 million to settle charges dating back to the financial crisis. The SEC says, the bank made of false and misleading statements to investors surrounding the safety of two hedge fund. Citi Group is settling without admitting or denying the charges.</p><p>Former Lehman Brothers CEO, Dick Fuld, putting his 71-acre of estate in Sun Valley, Idaho, for auction. It hits the ruffing block on Wednesday, or the auction block rather. It could be one of the most expensive estate ever sold at auction.</p><p>And NASDAQ president, Adina Friedman, spoke to Foxbusiness.com about her career at NASDAQ and her role. She oversees the company's lifting and information services and manages its tech solutions.</p><p>For that full interview, others as well, go to fox business.com.</p><p>Well, koalas may look cute but look at. A woman caught at the moment that she was being chase by a seemingly fearless koala while riding a quad bike in Australia. So, you're watching the video right now.</p><p>After she stopped, the manic marsupial caught up to her proceeded to climb up on the rear wheel of the motorbike. You can see him there, fun fact. We're not chasing humans on tape. Koalas split on average 16 to 18 hours a day, but seems to be revved up when they're awake.</p><p>The woman posted that video to Facebook. It has already been viewed more than 600,000 times.</p><p>Well, we thank you very much for watching us here on Risk &amp; Reward. Making Money with Charles Payne starts now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2015081701cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HGY-FW31-JB20-G3HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7521\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>RISK &amp;

Thanks for having me.</p><p>BOLTON: You're a donor to Trump's campaign -- we love having you here.</p><p>BOCH: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Do these recent comments make you rethink your support?</p><p>BOCH: No. No. Because, I don't -- from what I understand, if he really wants to do this, it has to be legislated and, you know, that probably won't happen but he is starting a debate. He is starting a debate and he's getting, he's getting people listening to him.</p><p>It's, I don't agree with everything he says but I don't agree with everything anybody says so.</p><p>BOLTON: But it sounds like from your point, Ernie, he is doing a service to citizens and -- OK, fine, he's going way out on a limb, but you're saying at least he is getting people talking about issues that are important to our society?</p><p>BOCH: Yes, he is. He is getting people talking and I think he should be Time magazine's man of the year, by the way, because of what he has done to the political system and how he has people talking. He's -- he's extreme but, he's -- I like him.</p><p>BOLTON: I take your point, and you are not alone. He is comparing himself to other leaders. This comment comes from earlier this morning where he compares himself to FDR.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: What I'm doing is no different than what FDR. FDR's solution for Germans, Italians, Japanese, you know, many years ago.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, you're for internment camps.</p><p>TRUMP: This is a president who is highly respected by all. He did the same thing. If you look at what he was doing, it was far worse.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, Ernie, Trump as you know is facing backlash from both parties. Jeb Bush is calling him unhinged. Do you think that, as we said, he is just extreme, do you think he is going to have to run as an independent.</p><p>BOCH: No, I don't think he is going to have to run as an independent. I think this is one of the many crazy things that he says that gets people talking, that gets people listening, that gets the conversation going and people concentrating, making awareness.</p><p>Do we are -- we are in times that I have never seen before. And I'm somewhat of a history buff and I've never seen these times before in the United States. So, something has to be done whether it's this, I don't know, probably not. But something has to be done.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Ernie, because he tweeted out himself, and I'm going to read that \"A new poll indicates that 68 percent of my supporters would vote for me if I departed the GOP and ran as an independent.\"</p><p>Now do you think he is doing this because he just wants to throw it back at what he feels like is not support, the opposite of support from his party? Or do you think he is testing the waters?</p><p>BOCH: I think he is just, if anything, testing the waters but I don't think he'll run as an independent. I'm not an expert on Mr. Trump, but I don't think he will run as an independent. I think he is going to win the GOP nomination.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Let's listen to some of the GOP candidates who, at least today, do not share your particular view on that subject.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLY FIORINA, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That overreaction is as dangerous as Barack Obama's under reaction. So let's see, we're now going to violate the constitutional rights of citizens because of <person><nameText>Donald Trump?</nameText></person></p><p>He is mobilizing anti-Muslim sentiment. He is preying on the fears of the American people. It is called rabble rousing.</p><p>CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is the kind of thing that people say when they have no experience and don't know what they're talking about. We do not need to resort to that type of activity, nor should we.</p><p>LINDSEY GRAHAM, SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR: He is a raise-bating, xenophobic religious bigot. He doesn't represent my party.

Tell <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to go to hell.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Well, he said, Ernie, he started conversation for sure. In fact Philadelphia Daily News this is the headline, you may have seen this, <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>they compare him to Hitler with the new furor on the front page. Did the paper go overboard? That's a big stretch from there to Time magazine?</p><p>BOCH: I think everybody is going overboard. I think this is, way, way, crazy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: This is the point.</p><p>BOCH: He is getting people talking. He is doing what he should be doing, he's making people aware of him, what he wants to do. Maybe not like this, but he definitely wants to help the United States handle this major problem that we have.</p><p>I think they're doing a lot to derail him and derail him and, you know, they're not doing a great job doing it.</p><p>BOLTON: His son obviously remains loyal saying that Muslims support his father.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>JR., <person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP'S </nameText></person>SON: The driver that you said, this is not someone as I ever met before, very personable guy, because I just wanted to introduce myself, Mr. Trump. I'm a Muslim. And I'm saying, oh, boy, this is going to be interesting.</p><p>He goes, honestly, I'm so for everything that your father is saying. Because I went back two years ago to my country, my brother-in-law, came with us on vacation was kidnapped held for ransom. I don't want to see that here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, Ernie, you're a businessman. I want to ask you about this. I actually looked into his golf properties in Dubai and his partner there like you, is defending Trump. At least not going for boycotting saying we are going to leave American politics out of business agreements. So, at least as far as his business goes, even in Dubai, he is not facing any consequence. What do you make of that?</p><p>BOCH: I think that's good. I think that's -- that's very good.</p><p>BOLTON: Ernie, we thank you.</p><p>BOCH: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Glad to have you with us. Ernie Boch joining me there. We are going to continue because some lawmakers are calling for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to quit the presidential race such as republican Congressman David Jolly.</p><p>The outspoken congressman will be joining Charles Payne this evening at 50, five- zero minutes, at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. You will not want to miss that.</p><p>Critics are blasting <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>saying that his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. violates U.S. and international law and would never be allowed by the courts.</p><p>You just heard one of his supporters and donors, Ernie Boch saying the same thing.</p><p>My legal panel is here. Emily Compagno, she says the proposal is constitutional. Alex Ozols says it is not. Emily, on what ground is the plan or anything that looks like it constitutional?</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY: I'd actually like to clarify, that on a technicality the Constitution here does not directly apply and here's why. Concept aside of what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>just proposed, the Constitution applies to every citizen here in the United States and by the bill of rights it also protects even illegal immigrants.</p><p>But here <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>plan is actually about those not yet on our soil, which the United States Constitution does not affect. And secondly, immigration is a matter of foreign policy and national security. And what that means, is that the Supreme Court an all the courts have long upheld that it is immune from judicial review. Meaning that's a matter of administrative law and does not go through the courts.</p><p>So, when we talk about the constitutionality of something, I'd like it to be specific. Then here it actually does not apply.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Fair points made. Alex, do you see what Emily is saying? That is to say the Constitution protects religious freedom for citizens. It does not say anything about refugees, immigrants, people who are in the process of being naturalized?</p><p>ALEX OZOLS, ATTORNEY: I disagree because it does affect individuals in the U.S. Now, the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution talks about freedom of religion. And that basically says that if there is a law that discriminates against religion, then therefore that law is unconstitutional.</p><p>Now I understand the argument that it's not directly affecting individuals but you have to consider this. What if someone has a lawful visa, and someone else coming in from another country, a spouse. And now they can't come in because they're a Muslim. Now that affects an American citizen.</p><p>What if it's a family? What if someone has a job? What if employer is waiting for an individual to come in on a job? This does affect America whether its indirectly...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: But that's different visa with all due respect.</p><p>OZOLS: ... or directly.</p><p>BOLTON: To me, that's an H1b visa. That's an L visa, that's a different category of quote and quote, \"skilled labor,\" which is an entirely separate process.</p><p>OZOLS: Well, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>said that, he said that this is a blanket. He's not going to let any Muslims in no matter what. He's not going to let Muslims in. He didn't say he was going to make exceptions for employment or family visas.</p><p>He said it's an all-out ban. He's not talking about asylum or anything like that. He's not talking about asylum or anything like that. He is saying these individuals can't come in.</p><p>BOLTON: Emily, legally, are we allowed to question someone's religious stance when they come here?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, legally things are set up where actually their religious beliefs are the reason that they're here. And that's why we offer asylum to those who are persecuted for their religion in other countries including certain Muslims.</p><p>And, Alex, I understand all of your points that you said, and they're absolutely fair points. But here again, the technicality is that it doesn't apply. So, what we're talking about is something before they get here and the effect on a present Muslim citizen or a present naturalized citizen here who is Muslim, that's not enough to warrant what we're talking about legally in the courts.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Thank you both, glad to have you here. Emily Compagno, Alex Ozols, glad for your input.</p><p>We want to get you right now to another legal matter. It is breaking news. It affects health care. Gerri Willis is with me now. Gerri, what is going on with Cigna?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER: All right. So, questions being asked tonight about Cigna's commitment to the Obamacare exchanges. Cigna CEO, David Cordani telling Kaiser Health News that the company was committed to participating in the exchanges next year, 2016, but beyond that, the matter is in question.</p><p>Now this comes just days after United Healthcare said it may pull out and being in Obamacare was a mistake that cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>Cordani telling Kaiser Health News and I should mention, Kaiser is not a political organization. It's a health news reporter. He told them we didn't make money on ACA exchanges in 2014, and we aren't making money in 2015.</p><p>I should also note that Cigna is not a big player in the marketplace, 236,000 customers in the Obamacare marketplace. And it is soon be acquired by Anthem. Cordani will stay on as president in that company, but now it's beginning to look a little like a pile-on with more companies starting to say we may not stay in the exchanges. Big questions tonight about how Obamacare continues.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Gerri Willis, thank you as always. Joining me there with that very latest development with Cigna.</p><p>Fox News also learning that investigators are focusing on the possibility that Malik -- that Tashfeen Malik, the female shooter in San Bernardino, was quote, unquote, \"An operative.\" We will bring you more details on that.</p><p>Also when we come back, a Silicon Valley lender may be behind a California terrorist's $28,000 bank account deposit. We'll bring you everything we know right after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have to find out who gave this guy $28,000, put it into his account. How many other $28,000 checks were made? Are there thousands all over the country. When you say you are afraid, I think you should, you should be afraid of the other side, not my side.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Breaking news. Fox is learning that investigators are say it is possible that the female shooter, you're looking at her photo right now, Tashfeen Malik, was an operative.</p><p>Adam Housley is with me from Redlands, California. Adam, what's the latest?</p><p>ADAM HOUSLEY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Deirdre, a lot of information is coming in right now. There's been some reports also that the FBI is looking at some people that are radicalized here locally.</p><p>I just got off the phone with the FBI about that. They say it's not a huge leap to the make that assumption, especially when the regional director came out in a press conference and said that they -- the two terror suspects were talking to people locally who are under investigation by the FBI.</p><p>So, you have that element along with international component what you just mentioned. They're telling us that they believe Tashfeen was radicalized overseas, again, not a huge leap. Considering they told us that they feel, in a press conference, they feel \"she has been radicalized for some time.\" That was the quote.</p><p>But that she was radicalized overseas that they're looking into her family also being radicalize and that there is the possibility she could ve -- she could been an operative.</p><p>Now when I pressed them on that, of course they would not go any further. There is a lot of ways that can go. But that's the investigation right now into her family overseas about, whether they're radicalized, whether there is some sort of operative-type status for Tashfeen.</p><p>They also insist that Syed, her husband, was at least partly radicalized here. So, you can then make the connection how to try to put the dots together, and the dots do include information here locally, Deirdre, about the case here and about individuals being looked at very closely by the FBI. Deirdre?</p><p>BOLTON: Adam, thank you very much. Adam Housley joining us there from California.</p><p>Well, there are new details emerging as you just heard my colleague say on the California killers in various ways. And in this sense, how may they may have funded the attack.</p><p>Bank records show that shooter Syed Farook got $28,500 loan from an online lender called Prosper. Now we reached out to Prosper. We e-mailed them, asking them for a statement. They said they prohibited by law from disclosing any non-public personally identifiable information regarding any loan originated to our platform.</p><p>All loans originated through the Prosper platform are subject to all identity verification and screening.</p><p>With me now Katie Gorka, she is the head of the Council of Global Security. So, Katie, how can this happen?</p><p>KATIE GORKA, COUNCIL OF GLOBAL SECURITY PRESIDENT &amp; CEO: Well, this just goes to show that this enemy is very adaptive. We saw that already in Paris, the fact that they were able to carry on their communications without being detected. You know, the thought might be that they were using PlayStation.</p><p>This enemy is very adept and very adaptive. And it means we have to be adaptive in our response.</p><p>BOLTON: Because we do have in the U.S. anti-money laundering, anti- terrorism, I mean, the banking system in theory is heavily regulated.</p><p>GORKA: It is indeed. So, it's a little bit, you know, it really raises questions how this could have happen, when you think about how much scrutiny there is now, post-9/11 of all financial transactions.</p><p>Anybody who's applied for a mortgage knows that. But again, it just reinforces that even if we have so many mechanisms in place to monitor, we also have to be aware of the fact that this enemy will constantly find new ways to get around our rules.</p><p>BOLTON: And as far as the banks, what role do you see them in? I mean, what role should they be playing? I know for a fact that some of them are going through, they are trying to flag certain transactions but the volume is intense.</p><p>GORKA: Yes, that's right. I mean, again, I think they should be held at the same standard as the rest of us, which is see something, say something. I mean, let's use our common sense here. And I hope that this now does alert the banks.</p><p>But, again I think that they're operating under tough circumstances as well because the restrictions have become so great, it also has become difficult for them just to carry out their day-to-day business.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Katie, we've been speaking about financial issues. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>earlier questioning terror checks in general.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have to find out who gave this guy $28,000, put it into his account. How many other $28,000 checks were made? Are there thousands all over the country? When you say you're afraid, I think you should be afraid. You should be afraid of the other side, not my side.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, Katie, going forward, what can be done whether it's from the banking sector or the tech sector? If there is one thing that could be done to improve our system, improve our security, what is it?</p><p>GORKA: Well, I think there's a bigger issue which is that we need to erase the distinction now between domestic and international terrorism. I think that's the single big thing that's really holding us up.</p><p>You know, that distinction doesn't hold true anymore. And that's what preventing a lot more effective intelligence being carried out in this country.</p><p>BOLTON: Katie, thank you so much. Katie Gorka with us there.</p><p>We are going to continue the conversation. She's going to be back with us.</p><p>The White House says, going to be speaking to big tech companies about taking a more active role in fighting terrorism. A congressman will be joining us saying he is ready to crack down on Silicon Valley right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL MCCAUL, TEXAS REPRESENTATIVE: Malik, the female, pledged her allegiance to al-Baghdadi and ISIS in a Facebook posting. We have the computers. We have the devices. We are currently going through the forensics.</p><p>They tried to destroy those computer -- computers unsuccessfully. And now the investigation is ongoing to find out what is precisely the connection between ISIS, say in Raqqah, and in the United States and what was going on.</p><p>I believe at a minimum inspired, that very well could be directed by this internet communications.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: We want to bring you some breaking news right now. The House approving a bill to bolster the visa waiver program. The vote for 07 to 19, all this came from the democrats. More on this House vote, coming up, republican strategist Ashley Pratte, democratic strategist Jessica Tarlov with me now.</p><p>So, first and foremost, Ashley, will this make the U.S. safer?</p><p>ASHLEY PRATTE, FP1 STRATEGIES VICE PRESIDENT: I mean, at this point I think what we're looking for are more restrictions when it comes to visas. When we saw what happened with Tashfeen Malik in San Bernardino, that was exactly one of the problems with the K-1 visas at least, which was probably one of the most expensive visas programs. And she was still able to use a fake address; she still had traveled to these countries.</p><p>So, I think in placing these restrictions, I think that we will see an outcome that is safer for Americans, but I do think that we need to look out more of a comprehensive strategy overall.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Jessica, to Ashley's point, Malik passed three of four interviews.</p><p>JESSICA TARLOV, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: What do you make of this visa program, the idea that the filter will become finer?</p><p>TARLOV: I think it's a great thing. I think this is the discussion that we should be having, a more nuanced conversation about looking at specific countries versus, you know, blanketing on, you know, a ban on all Muslims, for instance.</p><p>Or Rand Paul proposed a bill last week that would prohibited Muslims for -- sorry, people from 34 countries entering the country, as well as visa waiver country as having to wait 30 days to come here. Which I believe, you know, to be very un-American, and attitude in how we treat other nations and many of them are our allies.</p><p>PRATTE: Well, I think you and I can both agree on that too, Jessica.</p><p>TARLOV: Oh, great.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Speaking of agreement...</p><p>PRATTE: Good news.</p><p>BOLTON: ... it seems as if the White House wants Silicon Valley to take a more aggressive stance. In other words, if pro ISIS, pro terrorist material is out there, here's the latest comment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: I will urge high-tech and law enforcement leaders to make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: As far as tech companies, what can they really do, Ashley?</p><p>PRATTE: I mean, I'm not sure what they can really do, but there's got to be something. I mean, within minutes of that San Bernardino shooting, we did see Tashfeen Malik pledge her allegiance to ISIS on Facebook.</p><p>So, I do think that if there are any patterns or anything, if there is any information sharing that's going on, I believe at this point the Islamic state, both the fact that they are tweeting or posting on any social media accounts about 90,000 times or posts a day.</p><p>That is a huge amount and that's where they're primarily doing all of their recruiting to mainly a younger audience. And that's why we're seeing a lot of these instances in which they are younger, middle-aged men, sometimes women, and women are tending to be more susceptible to a lot of the radicalization.</p><p>So, I do think when we are looking at this, we have to see how significant the role of social media is and what Silicon Valley can do to put some sort of restriction in place or program in place to really filter out what is going on between communication for these...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: And some have said Twitter is not that strong, for example, if you have terrorist 01 and that could shut down and somebody creates terrorist 02, it seems like that keeps running almost to the extent that some pro terrorists are actually taunting Twitter.</p><p>I should also mention making death threats against the current CEO, jack Dorsey. The former CEO, Dick Costelo. So, Twitter responding though, I should read this out, to the president at call to action saying \"Violent threats, the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter, our rules make that clear. We have teams around the world actively investigating reports of rule violation; they work with law enforcement entities around the world when appropriate.\"</p><p>But, Jessica, even if Twitter, Facebook, all the ones that we know begin to be more aggressive, don't we see more encrypted properties? What I want to know is why some Silicon Valley brain kids are not going on sabbatical and working with the government for six months to a year and saying we're here to help. What do you need?</p><p>TARLOV: Well, that might be coming. That's a great idea. And I think that also, you know, the government perhaps all too often, has things going on that we don't know about. And I want to have confidence in the fact that they're taking this threat seriously.</p><p>And I know that this is going to open up the conversation again about the NSA and Metadata surveillance, I know it's been an issue already in the campaign, it will continue to be. But with 68 percent of Americans feeling uneasy about the president's strategy towards ISIS, and I think it was over 80 percent feeling that there could be an incident on U.S. soil.</p><p>This is before the San Bernardino attacks. I'm sure that that's already increased. I think that a lot more people are going to feel all right about their social media accounts being checked and more vigilance over what's going on the internet.</p><p>BOLTON: Thank you, both, Ashley and Jessica, glad to have you here.</p><p>TARLOV: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: We are going to stay on the terror trail because new security documents revealed that terrorist have tried to enter the U.S. with Syrian refugees. My next guest is wondering why the White House is silence on the subject.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TED CRUZ, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This makes no sense. We should not be bringing in refugees when on our FBI tells us, we cannot ascertain whether or not they're ISIS terrorists.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: The House just approved legislation to make the filter stronger for the federal visa waiver program. The overall bans people from Iraq, Syria, and the Sudan or those who have traveled to those countries in the last five years from traveling to the U.S. without a visa.</p><p>Terrorism expert Kyle Shideler is with me now. So, Kyle, is this a bill like a step in the right direction to protect Americans?</p><p>KYLE SHIDELER, CENTER FOR SECURITY POLICY: It's absolutely a good step, but it's really a Band-Aid on a wound we need a tourniquet for, I'm afraid. The visa waiver program has -- has issues, everyone admitted that, that's why we saw such bipartisan support to pass this.</p><p>But it's not going to raise any -- it's not going to lift anyone's concerns about refugee screening, for instance, screening on things like K-1 visas, which we saw with the San Bernardino shooting.</p><p>These are all still issues in place. So, if -- you know, if this is a view people thank we can do this, and we're done, it's not the case. This is a good start, we need to keep working.</p><p>BOLTON: Kyle, Homeland Security chairman Mike McCaul revealed that new security documents proved that terrorists, you just mentioned this, have tried to enter our country as refugees.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL MCCAUL, HOUSE COMMITTE ON HOMELAND SECURITY CHAIRMAN: Tied to terrorist groups in Syria have already attempted to gain access to our country through the U.S. Refugee program.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, does it surprise you that we haven't heard more about this?</p><p>SHIDELER: It's surprise -- it's no surprise that they're trying -- it's a little bit surprising we haven't heard more about this. There was a desire I think by the administration to paint the refugee resettlement process as beyond approach, vetting was going to be 100 percent. Couldn't possibly go wrong, anyone that was trying to seriously look at vetting for Syrian or other refugees was playing into Islamic state hands.</p><p>And now what we're really learning is that Islamic state very much wishes to use the refugee flow in order to move operatives into the United States and other Western countries.</p><p>BOLTON: Kyle, some total, when you talk about playing into the hands of the terrorists, it seems like they have one goal, right, which is to destroy. So, anything that goes against that is not in their hands. Am I missing something?</p><p>SHIDELER: Their goal is to wage Jihad in order to establish and maintain their caliphate. So, anything that helps them on that effort, they will do, including utilize the refugee flow if they can in order to strike at the West.</p><p>BOLTON: We know that Utah, on this point is a assigning a state police detective to monitor refugees. Do you see that as an appropriate precaution?</p><p>SHIDELER: If I had limited resources, it may not be the way I would use my detectives. I would be very concerned about new refugees linking up with mosques in my area or Islamic organizations in my area that I already knew had ties to terrorism or Islamic movements.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, actually speaking of these ties, GOP presidential candidate, Ted Cruz called earlier for new legislation that would actually ban refugees from settling in the States if they come from a country controlled by a foreign terrorist organization such as ISIS.</p><p>SHIDELER: That would be...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TED CRUZ, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This makes no sense. We should not be bringing in refugees when our own FBI tells us we cannot ascertain whether or not they are ISIS terrorists.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Although, Kyle, what I'm assuming and what we are hearing and reading about the majority of Syrian refugees is that that's the whole reason that they're leaving Syria is because they don't want to live under an ISIS rule. How do we separate them out?</p><p>SHIDELER: Well, we have to have law enforcement intelligence officers who understand this ideology, and they understand this enemy, they know how to ask people questions about their backgrounds, about their history, about their religious and ideological affinities in order to weed these people out.</p><p>That training does not exist right now because it was removed from law enforcement and CBP and other officers, Customs and Border Patrol, and other officers have been forbidden from asking these very questions.</p><p>So, they cannot ask the kinds of questions they need in order to screen the bad from the good in this refugees flow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: that sounds like some questions worth bringing back. Kyle, we thank you as always for your input. Kyle Shideler joining me there. He is a terrorism expert.</p><p>When we come back, President Obama's says the U.S. air campaign in Syria is working. My next guest says these leaked ISIS documents shows the terrorists have logged some big wins and is also building an empire. He has proof.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: Back then in Syria, air strikes are taking out ISIL leaders, heavy weapons, oil tankers, infrastructure, and since the attacks in Paris, our closest allies, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have ramped up their contributions to our military campaign, which will help us accelerate our effort to destroy ISIL.</p><p>MARCO RUBIO, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Nothing that happened in the speech tonight is going to sweep away people's fear. First of all, we heard tonight that the same strategy that has brought us to this point is the strategy he's going to continue. He honestly believes that there's a coalition fighting against ISIS, this is absurd. There is no such coalition</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: The San Bernardino massacre is showing that U.S. counterterrorism strategy needs to improve.</p><p>My next guest says the U.S. has treated terrorism as a law enforcement problem as opposed to a war. The president of the Counsel of Global Security is back with me now.</p><p>Katie, thank you for staying with me. So, 20 minutes after the attacks in Paris, the French president said \"We are at war.\" Do we need to make a similar statement?</p><p>KATIE GORKA, COUNCIL OF GLOBAL SECURITY PRESIDENT &amp; CEO: Yes, I can't believe we didn't make it long before now. I mean, this is so obvious. And, you know, we continue to treat these acts on American soil like they're isolated cases, we love to throw out the term 'loan wolf' but, no, the enemy has adapted, we're not looking at those grand centrally operations anymore.</p><p>This enemy has figured out that it's better off working through individuals who don't need that central direction. This is how they're carrying out their war on our soil.</p><p>BOLTON: So, I want to ask you something. President Obama did speak about the terrorist threat saying we will overcome it. And some semantics experts that I have spoken with have said he's doing this on purpose to try to minimize where the French President somehow elevated the terrorist cause. What do you make of this war on words?</p><p>GORKA: Yes. I think that's absolutely true. I think President Obama believes that terrorism is a function of U.S. actions in the Middle East. And that now we have a much less bigger role in the Middle East militarily that the terrorism will somehow eventually dissipate.</p><p>But that just couldn't be farther from the truth. And I think it's also interesting that he made this distinction in his speech where he said so far, we don't think that these were centrally directed operations. But it doesn't matter because this enemy isn't working that way anymore.</p><p>BOLTON: Your point is well taken. Unfortunately, for all of us they have evolved in their tactics as you said. You also noted that the Justice Department is shifting its training, focusing more on Civil Rights than evaluating threats. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Here in the U.S. an incredibly disturbing rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric, the fear that you have just mentioned is, in fact, my greatest fear as a prosecutor. As someone who has sworn to the protection of all of the American people. Which is that the rhetoric will be accompanied by acts of violence.</p><p>JEH JOHNSON, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: In the current environment, the answer cannot be to vilify all American-Muslims or to drive them into hiding in this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Katie, as a security expert, what is this right mix between security and freedom at this juncture?</p><p>GORKA: Well, you know, it's interesting. George Bush apparently was afraid of the same thing. After 9/11, he was afraid that there would be some great backlash against Muslims, it never happened, it hasn't happened, there isn't any backlash.</p><p>And so, this hyper concern with how Americans are going to react or we're going to turn anti-Muslim, I just think is just ill-founded.</p><p>BOLTON: Meaning if people want to attack us, they want to attack us no matter what we say. Katie, I'm glad you're here. Thank very much. Katie Gorka with us.</p><p>We want to give you this breaking news. The U.S. is conducting a serious review of Iran's second ballistic missile test; this is the one in many months, violation, apparently, of two U.N. Security Council resolutions.</p><p>According to the State Department and the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Fox News first reported the Iranian missile launch yesterday. We wanted to keep you updated there.</p><p>We are back in just two minutes with more on Risk and Reward.</p><p>BOLTON: Social media tools are used by terrorists and the people citing them. Social Flow is a company that collects and analyzes data that's being shared through Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat.</p><p>Jim Anderson is the CEO, he is with me now. Jim, great to see you. What percentage of social media flow, social media data is either terrorist- related or sympathetic to terrorists?</p><p>JIM ANDERSON, SOCIAL FLOW CEO: Well, I don't know the exact number but I have to say it's in fastasmally (ph) small, the challenge with any group is getting an audience. And whether you're be a group for good or a group for terrorism, you've to get the audience.</p><p>And so, we do a lot of monitoring of activity, we don't see any significant quantity of that activity.</p><p>BOLTON: So, where is the most traffic coming from?</p><p>ANDERSON: The traffic is coming from people talk about terrorism. So, the media companies put stories out, there's plenty of commentary, obviously after a terrorist incident. There's a lot of traffic and commentary about ISIS.</p><p>And then what we see is over time that tends to taper off after an incident.</p><p>BOLTON: Now, ISIS mentions when, you know, across to your point, all kinds of platforms, do you see journalists, do you see -- I mean, who's sharing the most?</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, it's everybody. Who's consuming the content and it's both for good and bad. But by and large, you know, with the terrorist incident, it's lots of coverage about the tragedy of it and lots of commentary about how horrible it is.</p><p>BOLTON: So, last night, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>said he would keep Muslims temporarily from entering the U.S.</p><p>ANDERSON: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: And you sent us a chart, so, we'll show that to our viewers so they can follow along, and it just shows as one of Trump's supporters have said, at the very least he is certainly engaging the public, he wants to start a conversation. So judging by your data, he's successful.</p><p>ANDERSON: He has really taken over the conversation. I mean, his traffic as you can see there spiked five times larger than it's been any time in the previous 30 days, so he's certainly got everybody's attention.</p><p>BOLTON: So, let me ask you, we have the breaking news as far as polling goes, as you know, he had about 30 percent in Iowa but essentially, has a 32 percent rating as far as New Hampshire goes, and you can see how he is, in fact, widening the lead for New Hampshire, and you can see which maybe - - some people may be surprised, Dr. Carson not even on this first screen, he's down noticeably at 5 percent.</p><p>ANDERSON: Yes. We did see some interesting data from Dr. Carson. After Thanksgiving, the Thanksgiving break, for whatever reason his commentary, the comments about him on social...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Just ran out of steam.</p><p>ANDERSON: ... just sort of ran out of steam. There was not much activity; it was very notable after the Thanksgiving break.</p><p>BOLTON: So, if we can pull up that screen again, which are ranks, so you're not surprised I take it by Trump being in that top spot. But it seems as if Marco Rubio is gaining and Chris Christie, although he was endorsed by New Hampshire's main paper.</p><p>ANDERSON: Right. I think the big question is clearly, Trump got a lot of attention with this statement yesterday, the question that everybody seems to be asking and I'm asking as well, has he gone too far? When does he go too far?</p><p>Just because people are talking about him doesn't mean it's necessarily positive, although clearly, your polling data, you know, seems to indicate there's at least a core group of people who like what he has to say.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, his supporters say, he is starting a conversation. Jim Anderson, thank you for the time. CEO of Social Flow.</p><p>Well, this is not fog that you're looking at right now. A 30-car pileup in Beijing. Red alert for smog. Schools and businesses are completely shut. The capital city is issuing its first ever extreme weather warning. We're going to be talking about the health of citizens there.</p><p>BOLTON: China's capital city more or less shut down because of pollution. So, in Beijing, schools and business are closed after the first ever red alert. The smog is so thick, it caused at least 33-car pileup, killing at least six people.</p><p>Fox News our medical A-team, Dr. Marc Siegel is here, as is Ashley Pratte, back with me. Dr. Siegel, how is the smog this bad, what is it doing to people's health.</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, FOX BUSINESS MEDICAL A-TEAM: You know, Deirdre, I'm not a big fan of regulations but there is a lot non-going on in China. I mean, the coal is burning, the oil is burning, the gas is not controlled in terms of emissions, the factories are spewing.</p><p>And you know, they -- it's not a surprise. I mean, why I can see the air in New York City and we can't see in Beijing. And this leads to asthma being provoked, long-term risks of emphysema, long cancer. This is a very, very, very serious health issue.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. A very serious health issue. Ashley, you just heard the doctor say. He doesn't believe in regulation, but maybe China is too unregulated. What do you make of that?</p><p>ASHLEY PRATTE, FP1 STRATEGIES VICE PRESIDENT: Well, the good doctor took the words right out of my mouth because I was going to say I'm not for big government. But it seems like at this point the Chinese government has to step in.</p><p>The sad thing here is that Greenpeace was the one who had to come out and say, hey, you, guys, should really be issuing a red alert instead of orange because you're still leaving people susceptible to this poisonous smog that's outside.</p><p>And the fact that we're allowing someone, you know, like Greenpeace to come in and make those determinations should be concerning to the Chinese government. They should be doing all they can to protect the people right now.</p><p>And we just heard the doctor say, you know, the health risk involved with this. But this is poisonous. I mean, people are walking outside. Schools were still open until they closed them.</p><p>And this is something -- I have a friend who is actually in Hong Kong right now working and she said, you know, China is actually pretty disgusting in the sense that the air is never really clean to breathe.</p><p>So, this is something that's been going on for a while, and we've seen their president come out and say, you know, we are going to cut carbon emissions by 2030. But are they really doing enough?</p><p>BOLTON: Well, as we can see from people there, you can't see them right to second, Ashley, but we're showing pictures of bikers with a mask covering their noses and their faces at least trying to protect themselves as much as possible.</p><p>Speaking of health issues a little closer to home, at Chipotle, 80 Boston college students suffered from G.I. symptoms, probably tied, possibly tied to e. Coli after eating at a local Chipotle.</p><p>So, Doc, how can restaurants protect the clients held better?</p><p>SIEGEL: well, you know, Deirdre, Chipotle is getting a heavy hit. And unfortunately, they pride themselves in fresh and green ingredients but this isn't the first time. The Norovirus has 21 million cases a year in the United States and it spreads like wildfire. And it gets very sick and dehydrated and nauseous.</p><p>And the culprit is usually a food handler. So, I think with all of this recurrent problems at Chipotle and they've say it's only the Chipotle near Boston College. But the people that go home from there with this are going to spread it all over the community. They're going to add to all of the cases.</p><p>So, I think that we have to take a closer look there at the food handlers and how they're preparing the food there.</p><p>BOLTON: So, I'm sure they are going to have a very official internal review, if not external review, but it's basically people not washing their hand. Is that what you're saying?</p><p>SIEGEL: Not washing their hands and not being careful when they prepare the food. Absolutely. And wearing gloves, they should be wearing gloves when they prepare the food.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Doc, Ashley, any quotes would you go to Chipotle?</p><p>PRATTE: I had Chipotle for lunch today, so I'm kind of questioning that decision right about now, but my hand were washed, so let's hope they did, too.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Living on the edge, courageous, Ashley Pratte,...</p><p>PRATTE: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: ... with me there and Dr. Marc Siegel, thank you very much.</p><p>SIEGEL: Thank you a lot.</p><p>BOLTON: We thank you for joining us here on Risk and Reward. Republican David Jolly calling for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to quit the race. He is Charles Payne's guest, starting now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I'm Deirdre Bolton. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Strong earnings results pushing tech stocks to new levels. Our market bull,  our market bear with me now with their next moves. Market bull, Michael  Lee, market bear Michael Chadwick. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Michael Lee on the bullish side. Alphabet, formerly known as Google.  Amazon, Microsoft all exceeding expectations, is there a worry to you, even  as a bull that only three to four stocks are really pushing this rally and  everyone else is just jumping on a few winners? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MICHAEL LEE, TIGER WEALTH MANAGEMENT FOUNDER &amp; MANAGING PARTNER:  Well,  what I would say here is these stocks are going push it higher because  they're exceptional, and that's why they're going higher. </p><p>Google, if you look at them, they have over a billion users on six  different platforms, and they're really just -- they're executing on a  really high level now. Valuation with Google as with Microsoft one of the  other big tech stocks that traded well today, you can look a little closer  at, but Amazon and Facebook are almost impossible to value</p><p>And what I mean by that is Amazon is doing $100 billion a year in revenue,  and growing at 20 to 25 percent, I mean, how do you put a number on that?  And their goal is really not to make money. They're investing in all  through it new technology. </p><p>And then Facebook, you know, not quickly the same top line of revenue, 15,  around 15 to 16 billion, but they're growing the revenue at 35 to 40  percent. So, it's really difficult to value those stocks, but I would say  that when you have an exceptional business model and you're best in class  that you're going to deserve a premium.</p><p>And, you know, they say tech leads the market, I'm very bullish on the U.S.  economy. And so, I think this is a good sign for things to come. </p><p>BOLTON:  OK. Michael Chadwick, what the chances this is a bear market trap? </p><p>MICHAEL CHADWICK, CHADWICK FINANCIAL ADVISORS CEO:  I think the chances are  at a very, very high. In fact, as you said earlier, you've got four or five  big names leading the market. Where is the overall participation? And in  fact, yesterday, there was 1.7 stocks up for every stock down. </p><p>Now, on a big day, where the market is up 2, 3 percent, that's horrible  participation. The reality is, those are great businesses. Valuations are  out of hand on some of them, others are reasonable. But the reality is the  economy runs on more than four businesses, and if we don't get the broad  base and start catching up to these hot, hot names, then we're going to  have a big bear trap. </p><p>And I think people need to be cautious, as Mike said, about valuations.  People aren't thinking about valuations. And let's step back two days, what  drove this rally? Draghi yesterday, and then China overnight. </p><p>So, once again, we're back to people acting like Pavlov's dogs and running  on stimulus hopes. We're not running on fundamentals here. We're running on  pipe dreams on accomplishing value.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Well, I agree that obviously there are some macro moves  and central banks are being supportive. But that said, at least for the  three stocks we're talking about, they did actually exceed earnings  expectation. </p><p>But I want to stay on the tech stock theme, because it's allowing one  founder to give back to his employees. Twitter co-founder CEO, Jack Dorsey  giving a third of his company stock to an employee equity pool. That by the  way, is worth around $200 million, fittingly he announced it on Twitter. </p><p>He wrote, \"I'm giving one-third of my Twitter stock, exactly 1 percent of  the company to our employee equity pool to reinvest directly in our people.  As for me, I would rather have a smaller part of something big than a  bigger part of something small. I am confident we will make Twitter big.\"</p><p>So, Michael Lee, do you see this as incentive? I mean, this follows  decision to cut jobs at Twitter following Dorsey retaking the CEO position,  is this his insurance against other people leaving? </p><p>LEE:  Well, what I would say is this is a nice sentiment by a very famous  CEO, a tech all-star. But let's face it, if it was worth two or three times  as much as it is now, why would he be giving it away. </p><p>And now I would love to get more stock. But Twitter is a portfolio company,  it's going to have to be bought by someone for them to stay in business and  I just don't know what that price is. </p><p>So, I can't imagine, you know, look, it's a good sentiment but I don't  think it's a bullish sign for the stock or whatsoever. </p><p>BOLTON:  Michael Chadwick does it change your view in any way about the  future of Twitter? </p><p>CHADWICK:  No, I don't think it changes my view of the company but I do  love the move by the CEO, and I think more CEO's should be doing that.  Because the reality is the CEO's are making so much and their average guy  is really having a hard time. </p><p>Now, whether the CEO, whether this particular company's stock is worth all  that more down the line or its toilet paper is anybody's guess, but I love  the concept in the upper echelon of corporate America sharing the wealth  with the average employee. </p><p>It's wonderful incentive. It lines up everybody's interests and people  working a whole lot harder for you when you have that kind of behavior. </p><p>BOLTON:  Market bull, Michael Lee. Market bear, Michael Chadwick, thank you  for joining me.</p><p>LEE:  Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON:  We want to bring you now to world and national news, Secretary of  State John Kerry meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister in Vienna,  Austria. Topic number one, the four-year Civil War raging in Syria. </p><p>Russia, by the way, launching airstrikes that are hitting U.S. backed  Syrian rebels. </p><p>With me now retired General Jack Keane. General, so glad to see you here in  person. You told me that the White House National Security team is talking  about safe zones and no-fly zones over Syria's airspace. This is a big move  and if this is put in place, it's a huge shift in policy, right? </p><p>JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, absolutely. A number of us to  include Secretary Gates, Secretary Condi Rice, Secretary Clinton have all  made these recommendations over the last year or two, Senator McCain goes  back about three years. </p><p>And what this is as I already understand is a safe zone, we would put  largely refugees in there. But once you put them in there, and you have to  protect them with some kind of ground force, that would be a moderate  opposition ground force that we have been backing, and then you have to  protect them with air power because somebody could bomb that. </p><p>So, it gets more complicated to put it together and make sure it truly is,  quote, \"a safe zone.\" </p><p>BOLTON:  But it would also, at least avoid what could be called a mistake.  I mean, you remember when Russia, by mistake, hit a few targets that it  said it was not intending to hit and what if Russian planes and U.S. planes  collided, that could start an incident. </p><p>KEANE:  Well, the good news is that the United states and Russia have had a  meeting, a series of meetings actually where out of that came air  procedures. So, we de-conflict our operations. So, I'm not too concerned  about that. </p><p>The Russians will have to make up their mind if they are going to continue  to bomb our moderate rebels that the CIA has trained and armed which they  have been doing since they've been in there. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, General, we just saw a picture of the Russian President  Vladimir Putin shaking hands with Syrian President Assad. That meeting, a  surprise meeting, Assad flew to Moscow and the world is very divided. </p><p>Russia and Iran think Assad belongs in power in Syria. Everyone else,  Europe and the U.S., said no way. For there to be a peaceful situation in  Syria, that guy has to go. What is your stance from a military point of  view on how likely it is to remove him and then have peace. </p><p>KEANE:  well, from a policy perspective, Deirdre, I mean, the reason why  Russia is there and the Iranians are there so strongly is because actually  Assad, this last year the rebels made a lot of gains and he was in a  precarious position, that is over. </p><p>They're going to create a buffer zone there, that's why they're pushing  back to rebels, they'll create an enclave. Syria only owns 20 percent of  the country but they'll make certain that that's a solid 20 percent, and  Assad is going to stay in power until such time as the Iranians and the  Russians no longer want him in power. We are no longer influenced in that  decision. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Well, that is a sober comment, we will hear it, we'll  digest it. Retired General, Jack Keane joining me. Thank you, sir, as  always. We appreciate your perspective. </p><p>To domestic matters, Department of Justice announcing that former IRS  official, Lois Lerner will not face charges for targeting political groups.  \"The probe found substantial evidence of mismanagement, but poor  management. But poor management is not a crime.\" </p><p>That is actually a quote, that was the assistant attorney general, Peter  Kadzik, who's making that statement. So, this closes a two-year  investigation into whether or not the IRS improperly targeted the Tea Party  and other conservative groups. </p><p>Columnist, Deneen Borreli with me now, democratic strategic Chuck Rocha.  Deneen, what does this message send to any party, Tea Party included? </p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, CONSERVATIVE COLUMIST:  Well, listen, this is the Friday  afternoon dump on Americans, Deirdre. And basically, the Department of  Justice has essentially said that the IRS can do and say whatever they want  to intimidate Americans who want to use their political standards and  statures across the country. </p><p>They can do and say whatever, and we can't challenge them or we can't hold  them accountable. And I think this is really horrible that Lois Lerner was  able to use her power in this position to make this happen. </p><p>BOLTON:  Chuck, for your view, when the Department of Justice says that it  found substantial mismanagement, does that require consequences? Is that a  slap on the wrist? How do you see this? </p><p>CHUCK ROCHA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I mean, I think it's what it states  that it is. I mean, there's consequences in that she's no longer there. I  think that there will probably be reviews, but I think if they use their  own words if that you're a pretty bad manager, that will mean you got to go  to jail. </p><p>I think that there's things that need to be accountable, I think that  there's to be accountable to the American people. I think those are our tax  dollars. But just because somebody is not good at running their department  don't mean that they're a criminal. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Deneen, what -- I know you want to say something, what  is your follow-up to this idea of no consequences? </p><p>BORELLI:  I've met the hundreds of patriots across the country, who are  waiting for months, for years to file their paperwork in the proper manner  and Lois Lerner used her power to intimidate these individuals, and I find  it outrageous. </p><p>And that's why we have the wave of Americans tired of the politicians and  individuals in government who are not being held accountable. </p><p>BOLTON:  Well, Deneen, that is why we are seeing an outliers race as far as  the presidential race goes. Deneen Borelli, thank you. Chuck Rocha, I know  both of you will be joining me in a bit.</p><p>But in the meantime, we want to give you this update about this monster  category 5 hurricane Patricia, barreling towards Southwest Mexico. The  country on track to get hit with the strongest hurricane ever recorded in  the Western hemisphere. </p><p>In fact, if you look at the winds right now, 160 miles per hour. Fox News  meteorologist Rick Reichmuth is with me. Rick, when is this expected to  hit? </p><p>RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, it's getting very close. The  winds are actually now at 190 miles an hour. And as far as records go  across the globe, it looks like it's difficult to go through al of the  records everywhere, but I think we're probably at about the fifth strongest  storm we've ever seen anywhere, and the strongest anywhere in around the  Americas in the Western hemisphere, and making landfall at a category 5. </p><p>Here's the center of the storm there just off the coast of Puerto Vallarta  and Manzanillo, Mexico. And when you look at this one here, you can see  it's been wobbling just as like if you had a top that you spun, the way it  will wobble, and that's what normal. </p><p>But, likely making landfall somewhere here between Puerto Vallarta and  Manzanillo within the next couple of hours. Very mountainous terrain, not a  huge population right here, about 110 miles between these two cities and we  might just thread the needle right between them, and that's important  because hurricane-force winds only extend up 35 miles from the center. </p><p>So, if you get this in between, we could be looking at just tropical storm  conditions in Puerto Vallarta and maybe Manzanillo as well. But any spots  here right along the coast certainly we're going to be seeing storage surge  and if you're right where this makes landfall, it's going to be one of the  most extreme experiences that we've seen anywhere and landfall from any  kind of a tropical storm. </p><p>Very incredible, it's also a quick mover, and that's good because it won't  drop rainfall totals maybe in the widespread 20 inches. But we'll likely  see a few spots in that range. And it's such a quick mover. Take a look at  this, Texas still potentially looking at the remnants of that. </p><p>And I'll show you how that plays out. This is a future radar. So, that's  what we think the radar is going to look like. Guadalajara getting a lot of  rain, and by tomorrow from Monterrey, Mexico. </p><p>But you'll notice that moisture moving in here across parts of Texas, a  different system that's been plaguing Texas since last week is going to  pull that moisture in there, and we might be seeing some spots maybe up to  a foot of rain, and this Texas' that will cause some flooding here. </p><p>So, even in the U.S., Deirdre, we're going to have some impacts from the  storm. </p><p>BOLTON:  OK. Rick, we will depend on you for updates. Rick Reichmuth, thank  you so much, our meteorologist. </p><p>Well, when we come back, this video is going viral. A woman in China is  destroying her husband's luxury BMW. There is more to the story and her  motive. </p><p>We'll also talk about legal charges, would she face them if she did this in  the U.S.? The answer might surprise you. </p><p>Aaron Sorkin's \"Steve Jobs,\" movie enters wide release today. The actor who  played Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, Seth Rogen is my guest. </p><p>Khloe Kardashian may have to pay up to $79,000 for Lamar Odom's brothel  bill. We'll tell you why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Blood is coming out of his nose, white stuff coming  out of his mouth and can't get him to wake up. He's like, almost not  breathing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Is he conscious?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Excuse me?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Is he conscious?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Jeb Bush is apparently struggling to galvanize his family's donor  base, as a result, he is ordering across the board pay cuts and slashing  positions at campaign headquarters. </p><p>Conservative columnist, Deneen Borelli, democratic strategist, Chuck Rocha  back with me. Deneen, he has been trailing, Jeb Bush is been trailing in  the national polls at fourth or fifth place, it almost seems like he just  settled into that second tier of candidates. </p><p>So, is this just a consequence of failing to inspire, the idea of a  successful run? </p><p>BORELLI:  Well, listen, as they say in the business world, Deirdre, the  trend is your friend. And Jeb Bush is not trending on the right side of the  voters, especially grassroots voters. He is an establishment candidate,  he's got the establishment name, political name, Bush. And this is the  anti-establishment movement that is sweeping the country. </p><p>People are tired of what they're seeing represented in Washington today.  And so, he's on the wrong side of the trend. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, in this case, the last name and the connection to the family  dynasty may be hurting him. But, Chuck, I mean, it seems as if he would  have already spent something like more than $130 million to have to make  these moves, right? </p><p>ROCHA:  Right, and what he's doing is he's being accountable to his donors.  So, he wants the donors to keep giving and he wants others to give because  money is more than just the mother's milk in politics. </p><p>It's everything in a presidential race because you have to have the money  to get up there to spread your message. So, he's trying to show his donors  that, hey, I'm cutting back, I'm being more responsible, I'm going to wait  this out, it's going to go up, it's going to go down. </p><p>So, he's trying to resurrect and show a change of all-around strategies  doing his campaign. </p><p>BOLTON:  But, Deneen, is this the beginning of the end? </p><p>BORELLI:  Well, listen, anything is possible with politics, but the other  thing with Bush is that he's on the wrong side of two issues that are  really important to grassroots. And that's common core and immigration. </p><p>So, again, he's on the wrong side of the trend, wrong side on several  issues as well, and it's hurting him. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. But yet, there are other candidates who say all kinds  of outlandish things on those two topics and more and it only helps them. </p><p>In a new Des Moines Register poll, candidate Dr. Ben Carson actually  surging past Donald Trump who is obviously been the most outspoken on  numerous issues but it's worth noting has been in the lead for 100 days. </p><p>So, Carson now has 28 percent. Donald Trump coming in at 19 percent and Ted  Cruz in third place with 10 percent. </p><p>Deneen, does this make sense to you, I know you say anything can happen,  we're more than a year away. Does that photo, that image of who is where  make sense to you? </p><p>BORELLI:  Well, I don't think Trump is out at all, and you look at Carson  trending in Iowa, for example, he's really tapping into the Evangelicals in  that state. And so, he's a very religious gentleman. Individuals are really  relating to him, and he's the anti-establishment individual. </p><p>He's not a career politician, so he's getting a lot of momentum, a lot of  attention and a lot of money. </p><p>BOLTON:  Chuck, what do you think about the republican field and what it  means for the democratic competition, if you like? </p><p>ROCHA:  Well, you know what, Pat Roberts and Huckabee and Santorum all have  in common? And everyone like to be president but they all want Iowa. And  there so much stuff going on in Iowa. And on the democratic side, you've  got people dropping out left and right and pretty much left with Bernie  Sanders and Hillary, so it will be interesting on seeing who's doing the  better job in marketing. </p><p>But the key point here is it is an outsider's game right now, that's why  you see that Donald Trump and Carson and even Bernie Sanders has touched a  cord in trying to say we want something different. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. I thank you, both. Deneen Borelli, Chuck Rocha, great  to have you both here.</p><p>BORELLI:  Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON:  And remember to tune into Fox Business republican debate, Tuesday  November 10th.</p><p>Too close for comfort. Look at this midair close call. The story coming up. </p><p>Also, the Steve Jobs biopic out today, the actor who played the Apple co- founder, Steve Wozniak is my guest. </p><p>Seth Rogen is here to talk about everything from the movie to Sony's hack  settlement. You don't want to miss that conversation. </p><p>First though, the Fox Business interview that is making headlines, Maria  Bartiromo sat down with the infamous drug CEO, Martin Shkreli, he hired or  rather, hiked his aids drug price by 5,000 percent. </p><p>We have a CEO who says if Martin won't lower the price on the treatment, he  will. He is now selling his own version of the drug for just $1. He's my  guest next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARTIN SHKRELI, TURING PHARMACEUTICALS CEO:  When people say 750, that  sounds like a lot of money. But the reality is, 60 percent of our patients  get it for it $1, one penny a pill. </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, MORNINGS WITH MARIA SHOW HOST:  Listen, $750 doesn't sound  like a lot of money, $750 is a lot of money. And when you're talking about  a drug that people in this nobody else having the drug on the market,  that's where the outrage came from. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  There he is. But I know you need some money.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHKRELI:  Put yourself in the shoes of someone who has this illness, this  drug is 70 years old and it has terrible side effects and it's not that  effective. </p><p>By taking the price up, we can actually afford to do real research to make  a better drug. If you were a patient that have this illness, you wouldn't  want a 70-year-old drug, most people don't want a 6-month-old cell phone.</p><p>So, for me, I think it's imperative for us to actually make the drug that a  price that makes sense for us and is affordable to patients. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  That is the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals defending his company's  controversial decision to raise the price of aids drug, Daraprim, by 5,000  percent. He said once that he sold the drug for $13.50, then drastically  increased it to $750 per tablet. </p><p>There is now a company that is offering a cheaper alternative $1 per pill.  He is with me now, the CEO of the company that is doing that, Mark Baum, he  is the CEO of Imprimis. </p><p>Mark, so glad you are joining us. Did you hear the CEO of Turing basically  saying he is trying to raise the price on purpose to wash out a bad drug,  it seems like faulty logic, and then increase R&amp;D in a better one. Does  that make sense to you? </p><p>MARK BAUM, IMPRIMIS PHARMACEUTICALS CEO:  Well, you know, what is really  interesting is, you know, in his press release when they acquired the drug,  what was fascinating is he actually included information about additional  drugs that should be taken or that could be prescribed and taken by  patients in concert with his drug. </p><p>And one of them is the additional component of our compounded formulation.  So, you know, it's interesting. Maybe when he's talking about, you know,  new and better drugs, he might be talking about our compounded formulation,  which includes this additional ingredient. </p><p>BOLTON:  But would you ever charge more for a drug that you think is  outdated anyway, and then after the fact say, well, the higher prices for  the people who are almost kind of implied too stupid to keep paying it,  that's going to help us with R&amp;D? </p><p>BAUM:  His logic, you know, listen, I'm no logician but it really doesn't  make a lot of sense. I mean, what makes, and by the way, he's free to  charge whatever he wants, God bless him. But, you know, we can act as an  amazing counterbalance to what he's doing and what others are frankly doing  beyond him. I mean, this is a much bigger issue from our perspective. </p><p>BOLTON:  OK. So, you are offering, essentially, the same treatment for a  dollar. Have people said to you is this really the same quality? Do people  have that concern? </p><p>BAUM:  Well, let me be clear. We cannot legally make this exact copy of his  drug. That is illegal, federal law prevents us from doing that. So, we will  absolutely not do that at all. </p><p>You know, and what we're committed to doing obviously is just is getting  this drug out to patients at an affordable price. You won't see us raise  the price up. I mean, frankly, we make a tremendous profit when we sell it  at even 99 cents a pill. </p><p>So, we're quite happy to do that. But as I said, the bigger picture is this  is happening across the board with a lot of these types of drugs and, you  know, we're going to be there hopefully, to act as a counterbalance with  the help, hopefully, of policymakers because we're not going to succeed  unless we work with the FDA and others that regulate what we do. </p><p>BOLTON:  So you think that the FDA and others are on your side or are they  more going even though they may hate the CEO of Turing that they're saying,  OK, what he's doing is not illegal, so we can't do anything about it? </p><p>BAUM:  I think what's important is that we put, you know, FDA, and I know  that's the FDA's mission and it's our mission as well. We have to put  patients first. Our philosophy is when we put patients first, we're going  to win as a company, and we're a public company. We have shareholders to  account to. </p><p>So, we're committed to putting patients first. And if that's what the FDA  wants to do, so we're aligned in that regard. We do need to work  cooperatively with them though, to make sure that we can act as a  counterbalance, you know, to this situation as well, as many others that  we're going soon talk about. </p><p>BOLTON:  Mark Baum, so grateful for you time. Thank you so much. We wish  you all the luck. It seems like to root for people taking the high road.  Thank you. </p><p>BAUM:  Thank you, Deirdre. </p><p>BOLTON:  Too close for comfort, an amazing midair close call. We're going  to bring you more details. What is behind this brush with a huge jetliner?</p><p>Then, actor Seth Rogen joining me to talk about his new movie, it is called  Steve Jobs, of course he plays the role of Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of  Apple.  We also talk about Sony's hack attack and Hollywood's challenge  with equal pay. </p><p>Then a jilted lover smashing her husband's BMW, that is the video that is  going viral, our attorneys have something to say, though, about property  damage. </p><p>Khloe Kardashian may have to pick up the bill for her pro basketball  husband, albeit estranged until now.  Lamar Odom's $80,000 brothel bill,  our legal guest says she might be on the hook for that.  We'll bring you  more details. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  This video is going viral.  The woman pictured with the hammer  spent about 20 minutes trying to destroy the $150,000 BMW that belongs to  her husband.  So she was not arrested.  Local security did not try to slow  her down.  Our legal panel is here, Deb Blum, also Evangeline Gomez,  Evangeline, before we talk about liability damages there seems to be more  to the story, apparently her husband was cheating on her that was a big  part of her motivation.  But does that change from a legal standpoint,  charges -- potential charges for property damage? </p><p>EVANGELINE GOMEZ, ATTORNEY:  No.  And if there is going to be any charge,  guess what?  The money's going to come out of the same pot.  They're not  divorced that we know of, so they -- he and she are both going to pay for  the damage. </p><p>BOLTON:  And apparently, he said let her just smash it, I can get it  repaired.  So Deb, as far as legal -- there are no legal issues, right? </p><p>DEB BLUM, ATTORNEY:  Well, I think if this happened here, she would  absolutely be arrested.  It's technically his property.  He probably has  title.  She bashed his car with a hammer.  There were children in the  video, so you could say she's endangering their welfare because there are  children nearby and there is glass flying everywhere.  So I do think if  this happened here, she would end up with a criminal case. </p><p>BOLTON:  Ok, well, although her motivation probably -- I'm assuming  somebody would take into consideration on.  But on another topic that seems  to be proving legally tricky, Khloe Kardashian may actually have to pay for  her estranged husband's brothel bill which is about $80,000.  The owner of  the brothel says that is what he is owed and if Lamar Odom doesn't pay,  he's going after Khloe Kardashian because she has the money.  If they are  not legally divorced, Deb, is that possible? </p><p>BLUM:  Well, we don't know if they had a prenuptial agreement or what the  settlement agreement said in their divorce.  Although, it's now rumored  that Khloe is not seeking the divorce. </p><p>BOLTON:  I think that's off. </p><p>BLUM:  That would probably invalidate their settlement agreement, although  it would not invalidate a prenuptial agreement.  So I'm not sure if she  will be responsible for his brothel bill. </p><p>BOLTON:  Evangeline, if they're not divorced, does she have to pay? </p><p>GOMEZ:  This is the situation in California.  When you get a legal  separation, any debts or any property that you should amass after that  date, it basically goes each person individually.  So at this point, they  were legally separated, they were not yet divorced because the judge had  not signed off on it, based on reports, and he accrued this debt when they  were legally separated, so he should be held responsible for this, not  Khloe.  And there seems to be this back between a brothel owner and between  the Kardashians, and I think there's more here.  Obviously, the brothel  owner can sue her, but that doesn't mean he's going to get a recovery. </p><p>BOLTON:  Yeah, I think he's just trying to get paid, I guess. </p><p>BLUM:  He's definitely getting a lot of publicity from this. </p><p>BOLTON:  Indeed.  All right, well, we thank you both, Deb and Evangeline  for your legal skills.  Thank you. </p><p>GOMEZ:  Thank you, Deirdre. </p><p>BOLTON:  Another video that is trending on social media, a midair close  call.  We're going to give you more details on this story behind a brush  with a jetliner. </p><p>Then forget student debt, apprenticeships are gaining popularity, in fact,  some even lead to six figure salaries, one person who is capitalizing on  that joining me. </p><p>But first, the actor who plays Steve Wozniak in the new Steve Jobs film is  joining me.  Seth Rogen weighing in on everything from North Korea to his  bashing of Ben Carson and Hollywood pay inequality.  He's my guest next. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you do? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I play the orchestra.  And you're a good musician, you  sit right there.  You're the best in your role. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I got to get back on stage.  You got two minutes of  rehearsal time left.  I don't want to see you get dragged off. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I get free from you.  You give them to me. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're going to have a stroke. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What did you do?  What did you do? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  We are here now with one of the stars of the Steve Jobs movie  released today, Seth Rogen plays Steve Jobs' longtime friend and Apple co- founder Steve Wozniak, Seth, so glad you could join us.  . </p><p>SETH ROGEN, STEVE JOBS:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>BOLTON:  So Steve Wozniak, playing that role that's a bit of a departure  from some of your previous roles, what made you want to do this project? </p><p>ROGEN:  Honestly, I was skeptical that I would want to do it when I first  heard about it, and then I read the script, and it really blew my mind,  it's one of the best scripts if not the best written script I've read in my  entire life.  And as a writer, it pains me greatly to say that and fills me  with both rage and jealousy. </p><p>BOLTON:  Rage and jealousy, it's a good combo. </p><p>ROGEN:  Yes, it really just blew my mind, and Danny Boyle is someone I'm a  huge fan of.  I really wasn't interested in Steve Jobs at all going into  the movie, it was just the work itself was incredible to me, and so I  wanted to try to be a part of it. </p><p>BOLTON:  So let me pick up on something that you said, because some of the  critics of the movie have said that it actually is too geek-focused, in a  way that, for example, the Social Network was a little bit more accessible  for people who didn't know the Facebook story.  But I've seen people write  and say with the Steve Jobs movie you really have to know the history of  Apple.  But it sounds like after you got to know the script, you were  convinced? </p><p>ROGEN:  Yeah, I disagree with that honestly.  Again, I knew nothing about  Apple.  I didn't read the Walter Isaacson book.  I really just read the  movie and talked to the people involved, and did a lot of research about  Steve Wozniak, and I find the movie incredibly interesting.  I am in the  movie which probably adds some bias to that opinion, but I feel as though  personally, I don't feel you have to be at all interested in Apple or any  computer to enjoy the movie, because I wasn't, and I did. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right, and we know Steve Wozniak is particularly a fan of  yours.  But I want to ask you a little bit more of an emotional question.   Steve Jobs' wife did not want this released.  Did that color, does that  color the way that you see it or that any of your co-stars see it? </p><p>ROGEN:  No, honestly.  I imagine that when most movies are made about  public figures, their family has very conflicted feelings about that, and  the people who knew them closely have very conflicted feelings about that,  and I sympathize with that.  But at the same time, once you cross a certain  threshold of impact culturally, I think you kind of become everyone's to  interpret in some way, and that doesn't mean it has to be a realistic  interpretation, it just has to be a resonant interpretation, something that  strikes a chord with people and has some honesty to it at least from the  perspective of the person who is interpreting it.  </p><p>So I sympathize with that, but I don't think that means that we shouldn't  make movies about famous people and people who have impacted our culture  basically. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right, now speaking of culture and emotional connection, you  recently hosted a big charity bar mitzvah for your buddy James Franco, whom  we interviewed, and I actually asked him about the Sony hack.  So this is  going back a few months.  And he said essentially, you were more connected  to the Sony machine than he was.  You told him not to worry, so therefore  he didn't worry about it.  I know that Sony settled this week for $8  million with its employees.  Does that affect you?  How do you see that  settlement? </p><p>ROGEN:  Honestly, I know nothing about it, I've been filming a movie all  week, and just read that headline.  But yeah, I'll read more about it and  get back to you. </p><p>BOLTON:  Yeah, I think James Franco's quote was don't worry, whatever, so  we'll go with that, but we know the issue of course was identity theft.  So  Seth, I'm on twitter, I follow you, a lot of your recent comments have  stood out to me, especially politically-based ones.  I know you said f-you,  I'm not going to say it, but to the real Ben Carson.  What made you be so  strong in your views to this presidential candidate? </p><p>ROGEN:  Is that that strong?  I don't know if it's that strong.  I think  it's all the language you choose to use in your daily life.  To me that's  not that strong a statement.  It's marginal.  </p><p>BOLTON:  It's marginal.  But I know you do take issues with -- I know this  from following your account.  For example, there was a man killed earlier  today, three women wounded in a shooting at Tennessee State University, and  I know that this is an issue that you feel passionately about. </p><p>ROGEN:  I do feel murder is bad, yes, passionately.  I didn't know about  that specific story, but I am always on the anti-murder side of things. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right, one more of your tweets here on the 7th, you tweeted  out just when it seems like think the real Donald Trump cornered the market  on saying insane B.S., I'm paraphrasing, real Ben Carson steps up to the  challenge.  Which candidate is more outrageous in your view, Carson or  Trump? </p><p>ROGEN:  That's a tough question.  Honestly, I don't know, what do you  think? </p><p>BOLTON:  Well, it's a toss-up.  But which of the candidates, any party, do  you feel makes the most sense to you right now?  I'm not saying who you're  going to vote for, but which candidate out there right now makes the most  sense to you? </p><p>ROGEN:  I don't know, honestly, but I'm happy that Stephen Harper is out of  the Canadian government.  That I can speak very knowledgeably about. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right, but if you could create one policy that would be  adapted by the next President, no matter who he or she is, let's just say  you get Carte Blanche, whatever you say right now would get passed into  law, as a citizen, what would it be? </p><p>ROGEN:  That's a tough question.  I think America has a problem with  imprisoning its own citizens, and I would probably push to reform that  element of things.  </p><p>BOLTON:  All right, one more semi-political question here, more  interpersonal politics. </p><p>ROGEN:  Great. </p><p>BOLTON:  Jennifer Lawrence wrote an open essay about equal pay, Bradley  Cooper backed her up in GQ, then just this morning Jeremy Renner made a  comment saying it's not my job to help female co-stars negotiate their  salaries.  Where do you stand on Hollywood's pay gap? </p><p>ROGEN:  I think that it is real, and I think that I don't want to tell  people what their responsibility is, but I personally view it as my  responsibility to try to make, you know, that gap disappear as much as  humanly possible.  I think Hollywood has a lot of problems that, you know,  obviously, involving race and gender, that you know, we, I know in my  personal life we are trying to actively come up with ways to, again, to  close those gaps and get rid of them altogether, because to me they're  real.  I see it, and yeah, I would advocate for trying to, you know, not  have there be a massive gap between how much men and women get paid to do  the same thing, and how many people of color are represented in films and  television. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right, we look forward to seeing it, Seth Rogen, thank you so  much for the time, Steve Jobs actor Seth Rogen. </p><p>ROGEN:  Thank you, hard hitting questions over here on Fox Business.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Student loan debt is at a record high in the U.S., more than $1  trillion.  More students are considering apprenticeships to avoid that  financial burden.  The appeal is that people get paid to learn, their  college tuition is paid, and they have a greater chance of finding a job  post graduation.  Christopher Stone is with me now.  He is a field engineer  at a school in North Carolina.  Christopher, welcome to the program, we are  so glad to have you.  What is a typical day like for you? </p><p>CHRIS STONE, FIELD ENGINEER APPRENTICE:  A typical day for me, I normally I  wake up about 5:00 a.m. start getting ready for work.  I really try to make  sure when I head into work, I'm set and ready to go.  I normally work  anywhere between 7:00 a.m. To 4:00 p.m., 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  I get to  take a lot of the knowledge I'm learning in my actual college classes and  apply them working some equipment for the printing industry.  Normally, I  get to work hands on with some mentors, get to learn a little bit of  different fields that normally people don't get to see outside of the  industry. </p><p>BOLTON:  So will it take you longer to finish school?  </p><p>STONE:  It does.  It's a two-year degree that I'll end up getting, it's  stretched over the course of three years.  I'm actually graduating a little  bit earlier.  I have been put on an accelerated path, trying to finish it  up a little bit quicker than some people do, but three years for a two-year  degree which is actually very productive for what we do. </p><p>BOLTON:  I was going to say -- and with the work experience is great.  What  have your parents said about it? </p><p>STONE:  My parents have been nothing but supportive.  My senior year is  when I really got into the program.  You know it was either do military --  do a program or do a four-year college because that's the tendency in  America.  My parents were really supportive.  They realized that I'm really  good with my hands and I wanted to do something hands-on.  So it worked out  perfect for me because this program is nothing but hands-on experience and  being able to use your education to do the work that you have to do. </p><p>BOLTON:  So you are getting an education.  You're getting paid, $13.50 an  hour, and you're not going to graduate with any debt. </p><p>STONE:  Yeah, exactly.  I really cannot think of any other place you can  get that.  I'm actually making a little bit more than that, but just the  fact that when I get out of there not only am I going to have no debt and a  paycheck but I'm going to have experience that very few people will ever  have in their life.  And a lot of people are going to learn the book side  of it and not actually get to apply it in real life, so it's going to be  more difficult for them. </p><p>BOLTON:  It makes all the sense in the world.  Christopher Stone, thank you  very much for the time.  Congratulations, we are glad to have you with us. </p><p>STONE:  Thank you very much. </p><p>BOLTON:  When we come back, viewers are already speaking out about my  interview with Steve Jobs actor Seth Rogen, some of your responses which  are (Inaudible) after this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGEN:  I think America has a problem with imprisoning its own citizens,  and I would probably push through reform that element of things. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGEN:  I think that it is real.  And I think that -- I mean, I don't want  to tell people what their responsibility is, but I personally view it as my  responsibility to try to make you know that gap disappear as much as  humanly possible.  I think that Hollywood has a lot of problems. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  My interview with Seth Rogen provoking heated response on social  media, seems like a lot of you will not be lining up to get tickets this  weekend.  Joseph said, Rogen looked best in Horton hears a Who.  Seth Rogen  is a Hollywood actor who has zero relevance when it comes to telling the  rest of us how to behave.  Of course, that was on equal pay.  Thank you for  joining us on Risk and Reward.  Charles Payne is up next.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Deirdre Bolton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Strong earnings results pushing tech stocks to new levels. Our market bull, our market bear with me now with their next moves. Market bull, Michael Lee, market bear Michael Chadwick.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Michael Lee on the bullish side. Alphabet, formerly known as Google. Amazon, Microsoft all exceeding expectations, is there a worry to you, even as a bull that only three to four stocks are really pushing this rally and everyone else is just jumping on a few winners?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MICHAEL LEE, TIGER WEALTH MANAGEMENT FOUNDER &amp; MANAGING PARTNER: Well, what I would say here is these stocks are going push it higher because they're exceptional, and that's why they're going higher.</p><p>Google, if you look at them, they have over a billion users on six different platforms, and they're really just -- they're executing on a really high level now. Valuation with Googleas with Microsoft one of the other big tech stocks that traded well today, you can look a little closer at, but Amazon and Facebookare almost impossible to value</p><p>And what I mean by that is Amazon is doing $100 billion a year in revenue, and growing at 20 to 25 percent, I mean, how do you put a number on that? And their goal is really not to make money. They're investing in all through it new technology.</p><p>And then Facebook, you know, not quickly the same top line of revenue, 15, around 15 to 16 billion, but they're growing the revenue at 35 to 40 percent. So, it's really difficult to value those stocks, but I would say that when you have an exceptional business model and you're best in class that you're going to deserve a premium.</p><p>And, you know, they say tech leads the market, I'm very bullish on the U.S. economy. And so, I think this is a good sign for things to come.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Michael Chadwick, what the chances this is a bear market trap?</p><p>MICHAEL CHADWICK, CHADWICK FINANCIAL ADVISORS CEO: I think the chances are at a very, very high. In fact, as you said earlier, you've got four or five big names leading the market. Where is the overall participation? And in fact, yesterday, there was 1.7 stocks up for every stock down.</p><p>Now, on a big day, where the market is up 2, 3 percent, that's horrible participation. The reality is, those are great businesses. Valuations are out of hand on some of them, others are reasonable. But the reality is the economy runs on more than four businesses, and if we don't get the broad base and start catching up to these hot, hot names, then we're going to have a big bear trap.</p><p>And I think people need to be cautious, as Mike said, about valuations. People aren't thinking about valuations. And let's step back two days, what drove this rally? Draghi yesterday, and then China overnight.</p><p>So, once again, we're back to people acting like Pavlov's dogs and running on stimulus hopes. We're not running on fundamentals here. We're running on pipe dreams on accomplishing value.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Well, I agree that obviously there are some macro moves and central banks are being supportive. But that said, at least for the three stocks we're talking about, they did actually exceed earnings expectation.</p><p>But I want to stay on the tech stock theme, because it's allowing one founder to give back to his employees. Twitter co-founder CEO, Jack Dorsey giving a third of his company stock to an employee equity pool. That by the way, is worth around $200 million, fittingly he announced it on Twitter.</p><p>He wrote, \"I'm giving one-third of my Twitter stock, exactly 1 percent of the company to our employee equity pool to reinvest directly in our people. As for me, I would rather have a smaller part of something big than a bigger part of something small. I am confident we will make Twitter big.\"</p><p>So, Michael Lee, do you see this as incentive? I mean, this follows decision to cut jobs at Twitter following Dorsey retaking the CEO position, is this his insurance against other people leaving?</p><p>LEE: Well, what I would say is this is a nice sentiment by a very famous CEO, a tech all-star. But let's face it, if it was worth two or three times as much as it is now, why would he be giving it away.</p><p>And now I would love to get more stock. But Twitter is a portfolio company, it's going to have to be bought by someone for them to stay in business and I just don't know what that price is.</p><p>So, I can't imagine, you know, look, it's a good sentiment but I don't think it's a bullish sign for the stock or whatsoever.</p><p>BOLTON: Michael Chadwick does it change your view in any way about the future of Twitter?</p><p>CHADWICK: No, I don't think it changes my view of the company but I do love the move by the CEO, and I think more CEO's should be doing that. Because the reality is the CEO's are making so much and their average guy is really having a hard time.</p><p>Now, whether the CEO, whether this particular company's stock is worth all that more down the line or its toilet paper is anybody's guess, but I love the concept in the upper echelon of corporate America sharing the wealth with the average employee.</p><p>It's wonderful incentive. It lines up everybody's interests and people working a whole lot harder for you when you have that kind of behavior.</p><p>BOLTON: Market bull, Michael Lee. Market bear, Michael Chadwick, thank you for joining me.</p><p>LEE: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: We want to bring you now to world and national news, Secretary of State John Kerry meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister in Vienna, Austria. Topic number one, the four-year Civil War raging in Syria.</p><p>Russia, by the way, launching airstrikes that are hitting U.S. backed Syrian rebels.</p><p>With me now retired General Jack Keane. General, so glad to see you here in person. You told me that the White House National Security team is talking about safe zones and no-fly zones over Syria's airspace. This is a big move and if this is put in place, it's a huge shift in policy, right?</p><p>JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, absolutely. A number of us to include Secretary Gates, Secretary Condi Rice, Secretary Clinton have all made these recommendations over the last year or two, Senator McCain goes back about three years.</p><p>And what this is as I already understand is a safe zone, we would put largely refugees in there. But once you put them in there, and you have to protect them with some kind of ground force, that would be a moderate opposition ground force that we have been backing, and then you have to protect them with air power because somebody could bomb that.</p><p>So, it gets more complicated to put it together and make sure it truly is, quote, \"a safe zone.\"</p><p>BOLTON: But it would also, at least avoid what could be called a mistake. I mean, you remember when Russia, by mistake, hit a few targets that it said it was not intending to hit and what if Russian planes and U.S. planes collided, that could start an incident.</p><p>KEANE: Well, the good news is that the United states and Russia have had a meeting, a series of meetings actually where out of that came air procedures. So, we de-conflict our operations. So, I'm not too concerned about that.</p><p>The Russians will have to make up their mind if they are going to continue to bomb our moderate rebels that the CIA has trained and armed which they have been doing since they've been in there.</p><p>BOLTON: So, General, we just saw a picture of the Russian President Vladimir Putin shaking hands with Syrian President Assad. That meeting, a surprise meeting, Assad flew to Moscow and the world is very divided.</p><p>Russia and Iran think Assad belongs in power in Syria. Everyone else, Europe and the U.S., said no way. For there to be a peaceful situation in Syria, that guy has to go. What is your stance from a military point of view on how likely it is to remove him and then have peace.</p><p>KEANE: well, from a policy perspective, Deirdre, I mean, the reason why Russia is there and the Iranians are there so strongly is because actually Assad, this last year the rebels made a lot of gains and he was in a precarious position, that is over.</p><p>They're going to create a buffer zone there, that's why they're pushing back to rebels, they'll create an enclave. Syria only owns 20 percent of the country but they'll make certain that that's a solid 20 percent, and Assad is going to stay in power until such time as the Iranians and the Russians no longer want him in power. We are no longer influenced in that decision.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Well, that is a sober comment, we will hear it, we'll digest it. Retired General, Jack Keane joining me. Thank you, sir, as always. We appreciate your perspective.</p><p>To domestic matters, Department of Justice announcing that former IRS official, Lois Lerner will not face charges for targeting political groups. \"The probe found substantial evidence of mismanagement, but poor management. But poor management is not a crime.\"</p><p>That is actually a quote, that was the assistant attorney general, Peter Kadzik, who's making that statement. So, this closes a two-year investigation into whether or not the IRS improperly targeted the Tea Party and other conservative groups.</p><p>Columnist, Deneen Borreli with me now, democratic strategic Chuck Rocha. Deneen, what does this message send to any party, Tea Party included?</p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, CONSERVATIVE COLUMIST: Well, listen, this is the Friday afternoon dump on Americans, Deirdre. And basically, the Department of Justice has essentially said that the IRS can do and say whatever they want to intimidate Americans who want to use their political standards and statures across the country.</p><p>They can do and say whatever, and we can't challenge them or we can't hold them accountable. And I think this is really horrible that Lois Lerner was able to use her power in this position to make this happen.</p><p>BOLTON: Chuck, for your view, when the Department of Justice says that it found substantial mismanagement, does that require consequences? Is that a slap on the wrist? How do you see this?</p><p>CHUCK ROCHA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I mean, I think it's what it states that it is. I mean, there's consequences in that she's no longer there. I think that there will probably be reviews, but I think if they use their own words if that you're a pretty bad manager, that will mean you got to go to jail.</p><p>I think that there's things that need to be accountable, I think that there's to be accountable to the American people. I think those are our tax dollars. But just because somebody is not good at running their department don't mean that they're a criminal.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Deneen, what -- I know you want to say something, what is your follow-up to this idea of no consequences?</p><p>BORELLI: I've met the hundreds of patriots across the country, who are waiting for months, for years to file their paperwork in the proper manner and Lois Lerner used her power to intimidate these individuals, and I find it outrageous.</p><p>And that's why we have the wave of Americans tired of the politicians and individuals in government who are not being held accountable.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, Deneen, that is why we are seeing an outliers race as far as the presidential race goes. Deneen Borelli, thank you. Chuck Rocha, I know both of you will be joining me in a bit.</p><p>But in the meantime, we want to give you this update about this monster category 5 hurricane Patricia, barreling towards Southwest Mexico. The country on track to get hit with the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Western hemisphere.</p><p>In fact, if you look at the winds right now, 160 miles per hour. Fox News meteorologist Rick Reichmuth is with me. Rick, when is this expected to hit?</p><p>RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, it's getting very close. The winds are actually now at 190 miles an hour. And as far as records go across the globe, it looks like it's difficult to go through al of the records everywhere, but I think we're probably at about the fifth strongest storm we've ever seen anywhere, and the strongest anywhere in around the Americas in the Western hemisphere, and making landfall at a category 5.</p><p>Here's the center of the storm there just off the coast of Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo, Mexico. And when you look at this one here, you can see it's been wobbling just as like if you had a top that you spun, the way it will wobble, and that's what normal.</p><p>But, likely making landfall somewhere here between Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo within the next couple of hours. Very mountainous terrain, not a huge population right here, about 110 miles between these two cities and we might just thread the needle right between them, and that's important because hurricane-force winds only extend up 35 miles from the center.</p><p>So, if you get this in between, we could be looking at just tropical storm conditions in Puerto Vallarta and maybe Manzanillo as well. But any spots here right along the coast certainly we're going to be seeing storage surge and if you're right where this makes landfall, it's going to be one of the most extreme experiences that we've seen anywhere and landfall from any kind of a tropical storm.</p><p>Very incredible, it's also a quick mover, and that's good because it won't drop rainfall totals maybe in the widespread 20 inches. But we'll likely see a few spots in that range. And it's such a quick mover. Take a look at this, Texas still potentially looking at the remnants of that.</p><p>And I'll show you how that plays out. This is a future radar. So, that's what we think the radar is going to look like. Guadalajara getting a lot of rain, and by tomorrow from Monterrey, Mexico.</p><p>But you'll notice that moisture moving in here across parts of Texas, a different system that's been plaguing Texas since last week is going to pull that moisture in there, and we might be seeing some spots maybe up to a foot of rain, and this Texas' that will cause some flooding here.</p><p>So, even in the U.S., Deirdre, we're going to have some impacts from the storm.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Rick, we will depend on you for updates. Rick Reichmuth, thank you so much, our meteorologist.</p><p>Well, when we come back, this video is going viral. A woman in China is destroying her husband's luxury BMW. There is more to the story and her motive.</p><p>We'll also talk about legal charges, would she face them if she did this in the U.S.? The answer might surprise you.</p><p>Aaron Sorkin's \"Steve Jobs,\" movie enters wide release today. The actor who played Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, Seth Rogen is my guest.</p><p>Khloe Kardashian may have to pay up to $79,000 for Lamar Odom's brothel bill. We'll tell you why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Blood is coming out of his nose, white stuff coming out of his mouth and can't get him to wake up. He's like, almost not breathing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is he conscious?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Excuse me?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is he conscious?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Jeb Bush is apparently struggling to galvanize his family's donor base, as a result, he is ordering across the board pay cuts and slashing positions at campaign headquarters.</p><p>Conservative columnist, Deneen Borelli, democratic strategist, Chuck Rocha back with me. Deneen, he has been trailing, Jeb Bush is been trailing in the national polls at fourth or fifth place, it almost seems like he just settled into that second tier of candidates.</p><p>So, is this just a consequence of failing to inspire, the idea of a successful run?</p><p>BORELLI: Well, listen, as they say in the business world, Deirdre, the trend is your friend. And Jeb Bush is not trending on the right side of the voters, especially grassroots voters. He is an establishment candidate, he's got the establishment name, political name, Bush. And this is the anti-establishment movement that is sweeping the country.</p><p>People are tired of what they're seeing represented in Washington today. And so, he's on the wrong side of the trend.</p><p>BOLTON: So, in this case, the last name and the connection to the family dynasty may be hurting him. But, Chuck, I mean, it seems as if he would have already spent something like more than $130 million to have to make these moves, right?</p><p>ROCHA: Right, and what he's doing is he's being accountable to his donors. So, he wants the donors to keep giving and he wants others to give because money is more than just the mother's milk in politics.</p><p>It's everything in a presidential race because you have to have the money to get up there to spread your message. So, he's trying to show his donors that, hey, I'm cutting back, I'm being more responsible, I'm going to wait this out, it's going to go up, it's going to go down.</p><p>So, he's trying to resurrect and show a change of all-around strategies doing his campaign.</p><p>BOLTON: But, Deneen, is this the beginning of the end?</p><p>BORELLI: Well, listen, anything is possible with politics, but the other thing with Bush is that he's on the wrong side of two issues that are really important to grassroots. And that's common core and immigration.</p><p>So, again, he's on the wrong side of the trend, wrong side on several issues as well, and it's hurting him.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. But yet, there are other candidates who say all kinds of outlandish things on those two topics and more and it only helps them.</p><p>In a new Des Moines Register poll, candidate Dr. Ben Carson actually surging past Donald Trump who is obviously been the most outspoken on numerous issues but it's worth noting has been in the lead for 100 days.</p><p>So, Carson now has 28 percent. Donald Trump coming in at 19 percent and Ted Cruz in third place with 10 percent.</p><p>Deneen, does this make sense to you, I know you say anything can happen, we're more than a year away. Does that photo, that image of who is where make sense to you?</p><p>BORELLI: Well, I don't think Trump is out at all, and you look at Carson trending in Iowa, for example, he's really tapping into the Evangelicals in that state. And so, he's a very religious gentleman. Individuals are really relating to him, and he's the anti-establishment individual.</p><p>He's not a career politician, so he's getting a lot of momentum, a lot of attention and a lot of money.</p><p>BOLTON: Chuck, what do you think about the republican field and what it means for the democratic competition, if you like?</p><p>ROCHA: Well, you know what, Pat Roberts and Huckabee and Santorum all have in common? And everyone like to be president but they all want Iowa. And there so much stuff going on in Iowa. And on the democratic side, you've got people dropping out left and right and pretty much left with Bernie Sanders and Hillary, so it will be interesting on seeing who's doing the better job in marketing.</p><p>But the key point here is it is an outsider's game right now, that's why you see that Donald Trump and Carson and even Bernie Sanders has touched a cord in trying to say we want something different.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. I thank you, both. Deneen Borelli, Chuck Rocha, great to have you both here.</p><p>BORELLI: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: And remember to tune into Fox Business republican debate, Tuesday November 10th.</p><p>Too close for comfort. Look at this midair close call. The story coming up.</p><p>Also, the Steve Jobs biopic out today, the actor who played the Apple co- founder, Steve Wozniak is my guest.</p><p>Seth Rogen is here to talk about everything from the movie to Sony's hack settlement. You don't want to miss that conversation.</p><p>First though, the Fox Business interview that is making headlines, Maria Bartiromo sat down with the infamous drug CEO, Martin Shkreli, he hired or rather, hiked his aids drug price by 5,000 percent.</p><p>We have a CEO who says if Martin won't lower the price on the treatment, he will. He is now selling his own version of the drug for just $1. He's my guest next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARTIN SHKRELI, TURING PHARMACEUTICALS CEO: When people say 750, that sounds like a lot of money. But the reality is, 60 percent of our patients get it for it $1, one penny a pill.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, MORNINGS WITH MARIA SHOW HOST: Listen, $750 doesn't sound like a lot of money, $750 is a lot of money. And when you're talking about a drug that people in this nobody else having the drug on the market, that's where the outrage came from.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: There he is. But I know you need some money.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHKRELI: Put yourself in the shoes of someone who has this illness, this drug is 70 years old and it has terrible side effects and it's not that effective.</p><p>By taking the price up, we can actually afford to do real research to make a better drug. If you were a patient that have this illness, you wouldn't want a 70-year-old drug, most people don't want a 6-month-old cell phone.</p><p>So, for me, I think it's imperative for us to actually make the drug that a price that makes sense for us and is affordable to patients.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: That is the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals defending his company's controversial decision to raise the price of aids drug, Daraprim, by 5,000 percent. He said once that he sold the drug for $13.50, then drastically increased it to $750 per tablet.</p><p>There is now a company that is offering a cheaper alternative $1 per pill. He is with me now, the CEO of the company that is doing that, Mark Baum, he is the CEO of Imprimis.</p><p>Mark, so glad you are joining us. Did you hear the CEO of Turing basically saying he is trying to raise the price on purpose to wash out a bad drug, it seems like faulty logic, and then increase R&amp;D in a better one. Does that make sense to you?</p><p>MARK BAUM, IMPRIMIS PHARMACEUTICALS CEO: Well, you know, what is really interesting is, you know, in his press release when they acquired the drug, what was fascinating is he actually included information about additional drugs that should be taken or that could be prescribed and taken by patients in concert with his drug.</p><p>And one of them is the additional component of our compounded formulation. So, you know, it's interesting. Maybe when he's talking about, you know, new and better drugs, he might be talking about our compounded formulation, which includes this additional ingredient.</p><p>BOLTON: But would you ever charge more for a drug that you think is outdated anyway, and then after the fact say, well, the higher prices for the people who are almost kind of implied too stupid to keep paying it, that's going to help us with R&amp;D?</p><p>BAUM: His logic, you know, listen, I'm no logician but it really doesn't make a lot of sense. I mean, what makes, and by the way, he's free to charge whatever he wants, God bless him. But, you know, we can act as an amazing counterbalance to what he's doing and what others are frankly doing beyond him. I mean, this is a much bigger issue from our perspective.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, you are offering, essentially, the same treatment for a dollar. Have people said to you is this really the same quality? Do people have that concern?</p><p>BAUM: Well, let me be clear. We cannot legally make this exact copy of his drug. That is illegal, federal law prevents us from doing that. So, we will absolutely not do that at all.</p><p>You know, and what we're committed to doing obviously is just is getting this drug out to patients at an affordable price. You won't see us raise the price up. I mean, frankly, we make a tremendous profit when we sell it at even 99 cents a pill.</p><p>So, we're quite happy to do that. But as I said, the bigger picture is this is happening across the board with a lot of these types of drugs and, you know, we're going to be there hopefully, to act as a counterbalance with the help, hopefully, of policymakers because we're not going to succeed unless we work with the FDA and others that regulate what we do.</p><p>BOLTON: So you think that the FDA and others are on your side or are they more going even though they may hate the CEO of Turing that they're saying, OK, what he's doing is not illegal, so we can't do anything about it?</p><p>BAUM: I think what's important is that we put, you know, FDA, and I know that's the FDA's mission and it's our mission as well. We have to put patients first. Our philosophy is when we put patients first, we're going to win as a company, and we're a public company. We have shareholders to account to.</p><p>So, we're committed to putting patients first. And if that's what the FDA wants to do, so we're aligned in that regard. We do need to work cooperatively with them though, to make sure that we can act as a counterbalance, you know, to this situation as well, as many others that we're going soon talk about.</p><p>BOLTON: Mark Baum, so grateful for you time. Thank you so much. We wish you all the luck. It seems like to root for people taking the high road. Thank you.</p><p>BAUM: Thank you, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: Too close for comfort, an amazing midair close call. We're going to bring you more details. What is behind this brush with a huge jetliner?</p><p>Then, actor Seth Rogen joining me to talk about his new movie, it is called Steve Jobs, of course he plays the role of Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple. We also talk about Sony's hack attack and Hollywood's challenge with equal pay.</p><p>Then a jilted lover smashing her husband's BMW, that is the video that is going viral, our attorneys have something to say, though, about property damage.</p><p>Khloe Kardashian may have to pick up the bill for her pro basketball husband, albeit estranged until now. Lamar Odom's $80,000 brothel bill, our legal guest says she might be on the hook for that. We'll bring you more details.</p><p>BOLTON: This video is going viral. The woman pictured with the hammer spent about 20 minutes trying to destroy the $150,000 BMW that belongs to her husband. So she was not arrested. Local security did not try to slow her down. Our legal panel is here, Deb Blum, also Evangeline Gomez, Evangeline, before we talk about liability damages there seems to be more to the story, apparently her husband was cheating on her that was a big part of her motivation. But does that change from a legal standpoint, charges -- potential charges for property damage?</p><p>EVANGELINE GOMEZ, ATTORNEY: No. And if there is going to be any charge, guess what? The money's going to come out of the same pot. They're not divorced that we know of, so they -- he and she are both going to pay for the damage.</p><p>BOLTON: And apparently, he said let her just smash it, I can get it repaired. So Deb, as far as legal -- there are no legal issues, right?</p><p>DEB BLUM, ATTORNEY: Well, I think if this happened here, she would absolutely be arrested. It's technically his property. He probably has title. She bashed his car with a hammer. There were children in the video, so you could say she's endangering their welfare because there are children nearby and there is glass flying everywhere. So I do think if this happened here, she would end up with a criminal case.</p><p>BOLTON: Ok, well, although her motivation probably -- I'm assuming somebody would take into consideration on. But on another topic that seems to be proving legally tricky, Khloe Kardashian may actually have to pay for her estranged husband's brothel bill which is about $80,000. The owner of the brothel says that is what he is owed and if Lamar Odom doesn't pay, he's going after Khloe Kardashian because she has the money. If they are not legally divorced, Deb, is that possible?</p><p>BLUM: Well, we don't know if they had a prenuptial agreement or what the settlement agreement said in their divorce. Although, it's now rumored that Khloe is not seeking the divorce.</p><p>BOLTON: I think that's off.</p><p>BLUM: That would probably invalidate their settlement agreement, although it would not invalidate a prenuptial agreement. So I'm not sure if she will be responsible for his brothel bill.</p><p>BOLTON: Evangeline, if they're not divorced, does she have to pay?</p><p>GOMEZ: This is the situation in California. When you get a legal separation, any debts or any property that you should amass after that date, it basically goes each person individually. So at this point, they were legally separated, they were not yet divorced because the judge had not signed off on it, based on reports, and he accrued this debt when they were legally separated, so he should be held responsible for this, not Khloe. And there seems to be this back between a brothel owner and between the Kardashians, and I think there's more here. Obviously, the brothel owner can sue her, but that doesn't mean he's going to get a recovery.</p><p>BOLTON: Yeah, I think he's just trying to get paid, I guess.</p><p>BLUM: He's definitely getting a lot of publicity from this.</p><p>BOLTON: Indeed. All right, well, we thank you both, Deb and Evangeline for your legal skills. Thank you.</p><p>GOMEZ: Thank you, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: Another video that is trending on social media, a midair close call. We're going to give you more details on this story behind a brush with a jetliner.</p><p>Then forget student debt, apprenticeships are gaining popularity, in fact, some even lead to six figure salaries, one person who is capitalizing on that joining me.</p><p>But first, the actor who plays Steve Wozniak in the new Steve Jobs film is joining me. Seth Rogen weighing in on everything from North Korea to his bashing of Ben Carson and Hollywood pay inequality. He's my guest next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you do?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I play the orchestra. And you're a good musician, you sit right there. You're the best in your role.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got to get back on stage. You got two minutes of rehearsal time left. I don't want to see you get dragged off.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I get free from you. You give them to me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're going to have a stroke.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did you do? What did you do?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: We are here now with one of the stars of the Steve Jobs movie released today, Seth Rogen plays Steve Jobs' longtime friend and Apple co- founder Steve Wozniak, Seth, so glad you could join us. .</p><p>SETH ROGEN, STEVE JOBS: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BOLTON: So Steve Wozniak, playing that role that's a bit of a departure from some of your previous roles, what made you want to do this project?</p><p>ROGEN: Honestly, I was skeptical that I would want to do it when I first heard about it, and then I read the script, and it really blew my mind, it's one of the best scripts if not the best written script I've read in my entire life. And as a writer, it pains me greatly to say that and fills me with both rage and jealousy.</p><p>BOLTON: Rage and jealousy, it's a good combo.</p><p>ROGEN: Yes, it really just blew my mind, and Danny Boyle is someone I'm a huge fan of. I really wasn't interested in Steve Jobs at all going into the movie, it was just the work itself was incredible to me, and so I wanted to try to be a part of it.</p><p>BOLTON: So let me pick up on something that you said, because some of the critics of the movie have said that it actually is too geek-focused, in a way that, for example, the Social Network was a little bit more accessible for people who didn't know the Facebookstory. But I've seen people write and say with the Steve Jobs movie you really have to know the history of Apple. But it sounds like after you got to know the script, you were convinced?</p><p>ROGEN: Yeah, I disagree with that honestly. Again, I knew nothing about Apple. I didn't read the Walter Isaacson book. I really just read the movie and talked to the people involved, and did a lot of research about Steve Wozniak, and I find the movie incredibly interesting. I am in the movie which probably adds some bias to that opinion, but I feel as though personally, I don't feel you have to be at all interested in Apple or any computer to enjoy the movie, because I wasn't, and I did.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, and we know Steve Wozniak is particularly a fan of yours. But I want to ask you a little bit more of an emotional question. Steve Jobs' wife did not want this released. Did that color, does that color the way that you see it or that any of your co-stars see it?</p><p>ROGEN: No, honestly. I imagine that when most movies are made about public figures, their family has very conflicted feelings about that, and the people who knew them closely have very conflicted feelings about that, and I sympathize with that. But at the same time, once you cross a certain threshold of impact culturally, I think you kind of become everyone's to interpret in some way, and that doesn't mean it has to be a realistic interpretation, it just has to be a resonant interpretation, something that strikes a chord with people and has some honesty to it at least from the perspective of the person who is interpreting it.</p><p>So I sympathize with that, but I don't think that means that we shouldn't make movies about famous people and people who have impacted our culture basically.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, now speaking of culture and emotional connection, you recently hosted a big charity bar mitzvah for your buddy James Franco, whom we interviewed, and I actually asked him about the Sony hack. So this is going back a few months. And he said essentially, you were more connected to the Sony machine than he was. You told him not to worry, so therefore he didn't worry about it. I know that Sony settled this week for $8 million with its employees. Does that affect you? How do you see that settlement?</p><p>ROGEN: Honestly, I know nothing about it, I've been filming a movie all week, and just read that headline. But yeah, I'll read more about it and get back to you.</p><p>BOLTON: Yeah, I think James Franco's quote was don't worry, whatever, so we'll go with that, but we know the issue of course was identity theft. So Seth, I'm on twitter, I follow you, a lot of your recent comments have stood out to me, especially politically-based ones. I know you said f-you, I'm not going to say it, but to the real Ben Carson. What made you be so strong in your views to this presidential candidate?</p><p>ROGEN: Is that that strong? I don't know if it's that strong. I think it's all the language you choose to use in your daily life. To me that's not that strong a statement. It's marginal.</p><p>BOLTON: It's marginal. But I know you do take issues with -- I know this from following your account. For example, there was a man killed earlier today, three women wounded in a shooting at Tennessee State University, and I know that this is an issue that you feel passionately about.</p><p>ROGEN: I do feel murder is bad, yes, passionately. I didn't know about that specific story, but I am always on the anti-murder side of things.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, one more of your tweets here on the 7th, you tweeted out just when it seems like think the real Donald Trump cornered the market on saying insane B.S., I'm paraphrasing, real Ben Carson steps up to the challenge. Which candidate is more outrageous in your view, Carson or Trump?</p><p>ROGEN: That's a tough question. Honestly, I don't know, what do you think?</p><p>BOLTON: Well, it's a toss-up. But which of the candidates, any party, do you feel makes the most sense to you right now? I'm not saying who you're going to vote for, but which candidate out there right now makes the most sense to you?</p><p>ROGEN: I don't know, honestly, but I'm happy that Stephen Harper is out of the Canadian government. That I can speak very knowledgeably about.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, but if you could create one policy that would be adapted by the next President, no matter who he or she is, let's just say you get Carte Blanche, whatever you say right now would get passed into law, as a citizen, what would it be?</p><p>ROGEN: That's a tough question. I think America has a problem with imprisoning its own citizens, and I would probably push to reform that element of things.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, one more semi-political question here, more interpersonal politics.</p><p>ROGEN: Great.</p><p>BOLTON: Jennifer Lawrence wrote an open essay about equal pay, Bradley Cooper backed her up in GQ, then just this morning Jeremy Renner made a comment saying it's not my job to help female co-stars negotiate their salaries. Where do you stand on Hollywood's pay gap?</p><p>ROGEN: I think that it is real, and I think that I don't want to tell people what their responsibility is, but I personally view it as my responsibility to try to make, you know, that gap disappear as much as humanly possible. I think Hollywood has a lot of problems that, you know, obviously, involving race and gender, that you know, we, I know in my personal life we are trying to actively come up with ways to, again, to close those gaps and get rid of them altogether, because to me they're real. I see it, and yeah, I would advocate for trying to, you know, not have there be a massive gap between how much men and women get paid to do the same thing, and how many people of color are represented in films and television.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, we look forward to seeing it, Seth Rogen, thank you so much for the time, Steve Jobs actor Seth Rogen.</p><p>ROGEN: Thank you, hard hitting questions over here on Fox Business.</p><p>BOLTON: Student loan debt is at a record high in the U.S., more than $1 trillion. More students are considering apprenticeships to avoid that financial burden. The appeal is that people get paid to learn, their college tuition is paid, and they have a greater chance of finding a job post graduation. Christopher Stone is with me now. He is a field engineer at a school in North Carolina. Christopher, welcome to the program, we are so glad to have you. What is a typical day like for you?</p><p>CHRIS STONE, FIELD ENGINEER APPRENTICE: A typical day for me, I normally I wake up about 5:00 a.m. start getting ready for work. I really try to make sure when I head into work, I'm set and ready to go. I normally work anywhere between 7:00 a.m. To 4:00 p.m., 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. I get to take a lot of the knowledge I'm learning in my actual college classes and apply them working some equipment for the printing industry. Normally, I get to work hands on with some mentors, get to learn a little bit of different fields that normally people don't get to see outside of the industry.</p><p>BOLTON: So will it take you longer to finish school?</p><p>STONE: It does. It's a two-year degree that I'll end up getting, it's stretched over the course of three years. I'm actually graduating a little bit earlier. I have been put on an accelerated path, trying to finish it up a little bit quicker than some people do, but three years for a two-year degree which is actually very productive for what we do.</p><p>BOLTON: I was going to say -- and with the work experience is great. What have your parents said about it?</p><p>STONE: My parents have been nothing but supportive. My senior year is when I really got into the program. You know it was either do military -- do a program or do a four-year college because that's the tendency in America. My parents were really supportive. They realized that I'm really good with my hands and I wanted to do something hands-on. So it worked out perfect for me because this program is nothing but hands-on experience and being able to use your education to do the work that you have to do.</p><p>BOLTON: So you are getting an education. You're getting paid, $13.50 an hour, and you're not going to graduate with any debt.</p><p>STONE: Yeah, exactly. I really cannot think of any other place you can get that. I'm actually making a little bit more than that, but just the fact that when I get out of there not only am I going to have no debt and a paycheck but I'm going to have experience that very few people will ever have in their life. And a lot of people are going to learn the book side of it and not actually get to apply it in real life, so it's going to be more difficult for them.</p><p>BOLTON: It makes all the sense in the world. Christopher Stone, thank you very much for the time. Congratulations, we are glad to have you with us.</p><p>STONE: Thank you very much.</p><p>BOLTON: When we come back, viewers are already speaking out about my interview with Steve Jobs actor Seth Rogen, some of your responses which are (Inaudible) after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGEN: I think America has a problem with imprisoning its own citizens, and I would probably push through reform that element of things.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGEN: I think that it is real. And I think that -- I mean, I don't want to tell people what their responsibility is, but I personally view it as my responsibility to try to make you know that gap disappear as much as humanly possible. I think that Hollywood has a lot of problems.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: My interview with Seth Rogen provoking heated response on social media, seems like a lot of you will not be lining up to get tickets this weekend. Joseph said, Rogen looked best in Horton hears a Who. Seth Rogen is a Hollywood actor who has zero relevance when it comes to telling the rest of us how to behave. Of course, that was on equal pay.
