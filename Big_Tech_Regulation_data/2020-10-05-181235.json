Has he sold out \\x96 or can he really be the missing link between government and Big Tech?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p>  Two months ago, on a bright spring morning in Paris, Nick Clegg set off for a meeting among various heads of government and assorted leaders of the global technology companies \\x96 Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Google et al. The default setting on Clegg\\x92s personal hard drive has long been optimism-despite and he was cautiously confident that he could help facilitate agreement again. The meeting was to be hosted by the French president Emmanuel Macron and the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. Among those also present were Theresa May, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, and the Irish premier Leo Varadkar.</p><p>  But this time, of course, the 52-year-old former deputy prime minister sat on the other side of the table, not with the politicians but with the representatives of the technology firms \\x96 among them, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Google chief legal officer Kent Walker. Clegg was just a little over six months into his new job as head of global affairs and communications at Facebook. The meeting had been called to co-ordinate international efforts to stop social media being used to organise and promote terrorism following the horrific mass casualty gun attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March this year, which was partly live-streamed by the attacker on Facebook Live.</p><p>  The Paris session got off to a tense and wary start with some of the technology company representatives reading from their lawyer-lacquered statements. The politicians wanted some easily explainable \\x93job done\\x94 solutions to take home; but the new masters of the universe speak in a different language from others, and the world leaders, like most of the people they represent, struggled to understand what the American tech giants were saying they could do, had done, might do, or might be prepared to undo. In a sense, the room became a microcosm of the wider human deadlock. On the one side, the ungainly paper-and-pencil ballot-box power of the national democratic governments; on the other, the deep-code, click-savvy digital power of the borderless private technology platforms. Between them, that oldest of questions: how to deal with human tragedy, trauma, violence and savagery.</p><p>  Into this no man\\x92s land stepped Nick Clegg. There has long been something unassailably buoyant in his manner. Certainly, that day in Paris, he was the only one who knew people on all sides of the table. He was an old acquaintance of Juncker from his days as a Liberal Democrat MEP and more recently from leading unofficial missions to Brussels with Tony Blair and John Major. He had kept up cordial contact with Macron\\x92s circle. He had shared cabinet meetings with Theresa May. And he had also been talking to Ardern, both on his own and with Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook.</p><p>  \\x93Look,\\x94 he said, venturing across the divide, \\x93I\\x92ve spent a large part of my adult life on the other side of the table. And I know the huge pressure you are under to extract change and concessions from this side\\x85\\x94 Here was the ideal interlocutor to explain one group to the other; and thus the ice was broken.</p><p>  Some time later, Theresa May began censoriously to rasp from her briefing notes. The history between Clegg and May was \\x93unpleasant\\x94, he would tell me: Clegg had spent half a decade fighting and blocking her initiatives at the Home Office during the coalition government \\x96 among them, the prim excesses of the \\x93Snoopers\\x92 Charter\\x94 and May\\x92s acidic approaches to immigration. He had found her \\x93unbelievably techno-ignorant\\x94, with a \\x93leaden securocrat\\x92s\\x94 attitude to technology. But in Paris, her intervention was measured and incisive. Clegg again leaned into the yawning gap between the two sides, set aside his differences with May and \\x96 to the surprise of his new tech fellows \\x96 offered his support to the Prime Minister. \\x93Actually,\\x94 he ventured, \\x93I agree with what Theresa has just said. In fact, Theresa, I\\x92m agreeing with you more across this table than I ever did around the cabinet table.\\x94</p><p>  The effect was to draw laughter from the other politicians, to bolster May (at that time in a near-horizontal limbo of low spirits) and to corral the other tech companies into a more open, engaged demeanour. Ignore ideology and partisanship; seek progress and compromise; look for evidence- and reality-based solutions: this is Clegg\\x92s approach, as he would have it. A nine-point plan emerged from the meeting that all the tech giants signed up to; it was voluntary, so for individual countries and companies to honour as they saw fit. But at least the two sides had stopped talking past one another.</p><p>  This view of Clegg \\x96 as a translator \\x96 is the positive one. In this account of his career, he is the moderator not the quisling. The man who speaks five languages fluently \\x96 forever translating, in effect, between European ideas of social democracy and Atlantic ideas of a more rapacious capitalism. And, of course, this is a mirror position to the one he took in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government of 2010 to 2015. Better to be in there \\x96 blocking the more rabidly self-lathering elements of the Conservative Party and advancing Liberal Democrat policy where possible \\x96 than not to have power at all.</p><p>  But there is also the opposite view: that of Clegg as Tory enabler, apostate and sell-out. A man who will say and do almost anything for gain. And now that he has moved to California and Facebook, this question has taken on a new acuity: who is he really, what does he believe and for whom does he speak? Have the files been irretrievably corrupted? Can he address the questions Facebook should answer in the United Kingdom and, if not, why should we take him seriously?</p><p>  ****</p><p>  When we meet in London, Clegg is fresh from a tour of the other European capitals where he has been making what he describes as a \\x93big offer\\x94: asking for government regulation of Facebook. We agree to come back to the Facebook questions later but for now it is clear that his zest has returned. There have been times in the past few years when he\\x92s been remarkably \\x96 staggeringly \\x96 resilient but all the same you felt as though you were talking to a political taxidermist. Now, though, the dash and vim are back and he has again the trademark demeanour of an award winner \\x96 British Airways\\x92 multi-destination pilot of the year, perhaps. He smiles and jokes and seems to be able to mine an inexhaustible resource of optimism.</p><p>  Clegg went to Westminster School and studied anthropology at Cambridge \\x96 the latter furnishing him with a wide-screen view of history and our species. He interned briefly for Christopher Hitchens at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nation</emphasis> magazine in New York then went to Brussels to work for the EU. From 1994 to 1998, he was employed by the European Commission, where he assisted negotiating the entries of Russia and China into the World Trade Organization (WTO). He became an MEP in 1999, an MP in 2005, leader of the Liberal Democrats in 2007 and entered the Conservative-led coalition government as deputy prime minister in 2010.</p><p>  On the day we meet, Clegg is looking after his three sons and part of the time we drive around London in a tiny electric street-hire car with his children in the back. His wife, Miriam, an international trade lawyer born in Spain (who has advised both the UK and EU on trade law), is out. At one point, his father calls while we\\x92re talking at the house he uses as his London base. Though Clegg has known family trauma \\x96 his son, Antonio, was diagnosed with a form of blood cancer three years ago and is now in remission \\x96 his family life has been stable and happy.</p><p>  We take his sons to play tennis in one of the public parks by the Thames \\x96 \\x93the years I have spent here,\\x94 Clegg says, shaking his head, as we contemplate that most British of sights: a wet wooden park bench.</p><p>  For two decades, Miriam earned far more than her husband and Clegg did a good deal of the daily care. And it\\x92s obvious he has a close bond with his sons \\x96 like a veteran of child-wrangling, he starts haranguing them to find their shoes a good 15 minutes before we are due to leave. There\\x92s an interesting psychological question as to why he always seems to place himself in positions of national (now global) vilification, but in the local caf\\xE9s he is warmly recognised. Perhaps it\\x92s because he makes his immediate world feel so genial that the attacks seem almost abstract, as if happening to someone everybody else has misunderstood. He is good company. Above all, he remains copiously engaged with every conversational subject from philosophy to literature to politics and he has a multi-dimensional intelligence rather than, say, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">trompe l\\x92\\x9Cil</emphasis> mind of Boris Johnson.</p><p>  Between 2015 and 2018 Clegg (though ever-ebullient on the surface) retreated a little, psychologically, into some kind of private hinterland where he dealt with what can only have been a form of post-traumatic stress disorder following a series of atrocious public defeats. In the 2015 general election, the party he had lead into the coalition was all but annihilated \\x96 dropping from 57 MPs to eight. In 2016, his vision of an outward-looking patriotic pro-European Britain was sacrificed at the rank and fetid altar of Johnson\\x92s Conservative leadership ambitions. In 2017, he lost his parliamentary seat in Sheffield to Labour\\x92s Jared O\\x92Mara (who now sits as an independent).</p><p>  \\x93You have to embrace failure not shun it,\\x94 Clegg tells me. \\x93You have to accept it, stare it in the face not try and explain it away. Without naming any names, I do think it\\x92s the real abiding failure of a lot of previous politicians. They\\x92ve spent all their time trying to explain the past, justify themselves, vindicate themselves. I think you have to be open about it. [The 2015 election result] was a massive defeat and that fell on my shoulders and I took responsibility for it and you have to admit it and absorb it \\x96 embrace is not quite the right word.\\x94</p><p>  I ask about David Cameron and George Osborne. \\x93No, I\\x92m not friends with George or David,\\x94 he replies. \\x93I see them from time to time. George comes out to California. I stood next to David at the memorial for Sir Jeremy Heywood [the ex-cabinet secretary and former head of the Home Civil Service, who died last November]. I am not an idiot. [Back in 2009-2010] George was doing what he loves doing \\x96 which is playing politics. When I came into government and sat across the table, I thought you\\x92re the guy\\x85 who was trying to drag me and my family through the mud just a few days go.\\x94 He is referring to hostile briefings that appeared in the Conservative press at that time. \\x93Maybe I was naive, but there was a method to my madness. I thought: what is the point of being in power and then looking as if you don\\x92t want to be there? Sitting there with my arms crossed for five years looking grumpy? I was co-running [the government] with Cameron and I was bloody well going to do it and grab the reins.\\x94</p><p>  We talk, inevitably, about Brexit. He remains angry and deeply exasperated. I was writing about politics in 2014 and I remember a long train ride back from Bath (following a visit to the battleground constituency at that time held by Liberal Democrat Don Foster) with Clegg when he laid out \\x96 detail by detail \\x96 all the problems and contradictions of Brexit as an idea, as a process and as a political event. His dissection remains the most forensic forecast of what would happen that I have heard. He predicted the risible handling of the referendum itself by Cameron, and the subsequent issues if the vote was lost \\x96 our asymmetrical trading relationships, the customs union dilemma, free movement, Ireland, the European response, the steep Tory learning curve and inevitable chaos.</p><p>  At that time, it was not an exaggeration to say that he was one of fewer than half a dozen MPs who actually knew what our relationship with the EU meant \\x96 politically, economically, in terms of power, sovereignty, national security and the hard-won details of sector-by-sector trade. He understood what was at stake and why. Clegg contacted Cameron during the 2016 referendum campaign urging him to change strategy, but he carried little sway by then and had barely any voice \\x96 a consequence, as he admits, of his failure in the 2015 general election.</p><p>  Clegg won\\x92t agree with the characterisation of Boris Johnson as a fat-berg who has blocked the national sewer, but says instead that he\\x92s \\x93one of those classic examples, the more you see of him, the less impressive he is. With familiarity, he diminishes.\\x94</p><p>  How does Clegg see the next few years going politically? \\x93It seems to me that the clock is now ticking for the end of the union of the United Kingdom. I am afraid I\\x92ve sort of come to the view I think that is now more likely than not. I think the Brexit demon has unleashed such an aggressive and regressive right-wing English nationalism. And that the Conservative Party is converting itself into an English nationalist party. It has so little representation in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and they have to compete with [Nigel] Farage. So I think the Conservative Party is condemned \\x96 whoever is leader \\x96 to be pulled in an ever more English and divisive direction.\\x94</p><p>  Boris Johnson will end up calling a general election, Clegg believes, because his only persuasive political claim is that he\\x92s a winner. \\x93And he\\x92s going to really scratch away at that itch because that\\x92s all he has got. I mean he\\x92s literally reduced to saying I\\x92ve got no plan for Brexit. I have no answers to the questions about my character. You know as I do that [Johnson\\x92s] journalism is about striking poses; that\\x92s the whole point about it. That\\x92s what columnists do \\x96 they\\x92re trying to provoke thought. But that is not what government is about. Instead, you are trying to play Solomon on a whole bunch of really invidious choices where you will never keep everyone happy, where there\\x92s no perfect solution.\\x94</p><p>  Clegg often talks about rolling up his sleeves and dealing \\x93with reality\\x94 and the \\x93limitations of government\\x94. I attended an ideas forum in London in 2014 which Clegg addressed by saying: \\x93It would be great if we could stay within the bounds of reality as it is commonly understood.\\x94 The problem, of course, as TS Eliot would remind us, is that: \\x93human kind cannot bear very much reality\\x94. Electorates, in particular, are allergic to it.</p><p>  While we\\x92re talking, Clegg gets a call from Chuka Umunna, who joined the Lib Dems last month. Clegg walks away so that I can\\x92t hear what they\\x92re discussing. He comes back full of excitement about the prospect for the Lib Dems \\x96 \\x93a real opportunity to hold the balance of power again\\x94. Clegg won\\x92t criticise Vince Cable but instead says that \\x93Jo [Swinson] or Ed [Davey] will give some real energy to it\\x85 because there\\x92s an excellent opportunity. In the grand scheme of things for such an old political party, it\\x92s only four years and we\\x92re back in business and I think that\\x92s very exciting.\\x94</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nick Clegg and Mark Zuckerberg meet French president Emmanuel Macron in May 2019</emphasis></p><p>  ****</p><p>  The central charge against Nick Clegg is that he is a bad actor and that his motives are suspect \\x96 or, worse, venal. At its crudest and simplest the question is this: was he merely a power-seeking Tory enabler in the coalition government, and does this mean he has \\x93form\\x94 for his taking a job at Facebook?</p><p>  His role in the coalition government is becoming easier to weigh with time. Of course he was power-seeking; he wanted to take the Liberal Democrats into power. But from the perspective of the party he led, he did so for good reasons: to get as many Liberal Democrat initiatives on to the statute book as he could. At that time, there was a new generation of energised liberal politicians and thinkers who were seeking to ally social justice with economic liberalism. They all contributed to the influential pamphlet \\x93Orange Book: Reclaiming Liberalism\\x94, published in 2004. Clegg was their dynamic leader and he wanted to give the Liberals their first shot at government since the time of Lloyd George.</p><p>  This is not to say that he was wildly successful or that he and senior colleagues did not make serious mistakes \\x96 the tuition fees debacle; the easing through of Andrew Lansley\\x92s botched NHS reforms; the decision not to take a big definable role at the Home Office or education so as to build and own a distinct Clegg-Liberal legacy. Undoubtedly, the Liberal Democrats were naive in the early years of the coalition. They paid heavy prices for zombie policies such as the (all-but-forgotten) Alternative Vote referendum of 2011. But if Clegg\\x92s underlying motive is in question, then only the most cynical would ascribe venality; he did what he did because he thought it was the best for the country and for his party. Far from enabling the Tories, he was trying to carbon-offset them. He wanted to translate liberal policies into real-world improvements.</p><p>  As he concedes, it soon became clear that this would not be easy. Indeed, the combined experience of all the senior Liberal Democrats that I have spoken to since the end of the coalition speaks most forcibly to one point: each and every one of them had to spend more and more time battling (the often bewildering) ideological Tory excesses on behalf of a country that had little idea at that time just how toxic the right wing of that party was becoming.</p><p>  Danny Alexander, as chief secretary to the Treasury from 2010 to 2015, wound up asking for distributional analyses so that he could see where the pain of cuts would be felt \\x96 whether by the richer or the less well off. What this meant in practice was that every time the Tories attempted something ideologically driven that placed an unfair burden on the poor, the Liberal Democrats first illuminated the policy for what it was and then either blocked it (time and time again) or insisted upon a reciprocal burden being placed on the better off.</p><p>  David Laws, meanwhile, minister of state for schools from 2012 to 2015, was staggered by Conservative opposition to the pupil premium, a Liberal Democrat scheme that allocated more money for poorer children in schools. In 2013 Cameron and Osborne tried to persuade Clegg to accelerate austerity with a further \\xA330bn of cuts \\x96 almost all of them on welfare spending \\x96 and Clegg flatly said no. A telling graph from the Institute for Fiscal Studies illustrates the impact of tax and benefit reform on net household income during the coalition as against the Conservative-only policies announced since the 2015 election \\x96 needless to say, it got much worse for those on lower incomes the moment the Liberal Democrats left office. And, indeed, the best evidence of what Clegg prevented is what happened next. We now know that the Farage effect was already dangerously overheating the right-wing Tory reactors and, once the cooling rods were removed, there was bound to follow a huge explosion and subsequent national meltdown.</p><p>  ****</p><p>  The new national beef with Clegg, though, concerns Facebook. Questions germinate: are politicians entitled to a career after politics? If they make a lot money, is this to be resented? What, if anything, are we entitled to expect from them?</p><p>  For some, Clegg\\x92s remuneration package \\x96 several million pounds \\x96 is evidence of venality. (See also the case of Tony Blair after he left office.) And there is no answer to the charge that Clegg has taken the money and left the country. He now lives with his family in the Silicon Valley town of Atherton, near San Francisco, which was last year named \\x93the most expensive zip code in the country\\x94 by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Forbes</emphasis> magazine. But, for others, it\\x92s not the dollars: it\\x92s the fact that it\\x92s Facebook. It\\x92s the feeling that if Clegg were so mortified by the EU referendum result, then surely he wouldn\\x92t be comfortable working for Facebook, a platform where so much \\x93dark money\\x94 of uncertain provenance was spent on advertising for the Leave campaign.</p><p>  When deciding whether to work for the tech giant (Facebook\\x92s market capitalisation was $582bn at time of writing), Clegg remembered that Pascal Lamy, former director of the WTO, \\x93had this wonderful saying, when I worked with him in Brussels: \\x91If you are part of the problem, you are part of the solution.\\x94\\x92</p><p>  He was approached by the office of Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer, who had previously worked for Google. And there was a lot of back and forth. Clegg told her, \\x93I know that Facebook seems to be in such reputational trouble and I\\x92ve spent the past 20 years working and being shouted at and I don\\x92t feel like doing that again.\\x94</p><p>  He was on holiday in Catalonia in Spain as talks intensified. He had been getting on well with Sandberg, and then \\x93wrote a three- or four-page paper to Mark and Sheryl and was very blunt. I said, \\x91Look, I don\\x92t want to come\\x85 to meet Mark and Priscilla [Zuckerberg\\x92s wife]\\x85 I don\\x92t want to get on a plane until you understand where I\\x92m coming from. I think it\\x92s remarkable that you offer this ad-funded business model for free and that you\\x92ve offered your services to Africa and South America and so on. But you know you\\x92ve sullied political and public trust about how Facebook is a guardian of people\\x92s data.</p><p>  \\x93Social attitudes have changed completely, as far as the holding, aggregation and storage of data is concerned. There\\x92s a profound feeling in Europe that companies like Facebook don\\x92t pay enough tax and that you should contrast your values much more sharply with what\\x92s going on in China. And there needs to be an attempt at least to try to develop a more mature and open approach to regulation, to governments.\\x92\\x94</p><p>  Meanwhile, Clegg discussed the offer with his wife, Miriam. \\x93I think, as a family, we felt it was time for a change. And I think we were both pretty down in the mouth about what\\x92s happening to the country here\\x85 And I was not in a position to do anything about it any more. And just gnashing your teeth from the sidelines is not something I like doing.\\x94</p><p>  He pauses, and then adds: \\x93I\\x92m 52. I did not want to be an ex-senior politician, pontificating endlessly on the after-dinner circuit. Giving a few lectures. Sitting on a few boards and quietly expiring on a sofa in a gentleman\\x92s club. I\\x92ve got 20, 25 years of life left in me, and I\\x92ve got a lot of energy\\x85 And I like to think I\\x92ve learnt some things. So, I had decided I wanted to work in tech, and then I became chair of the advisory board of a small, small social care tech company. And [at some point] I thought, well, if I am serious about this, it might as well be the most\\x85 controversial.\\x94</p><p>  When he finally flew out to California and met Zuckerberg, Clegg told him straight: \\x93Your fundamental problem is that people think you\\x92re too powerful and you don\\x92t care.\\x94</p><p>  To Clegg\\x92s surprise, Zuckerberg replied: \\x93Yes [that\\x92s] totally understandable, I get that.\\x94</p><p>  Clegg further argued that it was \\x93a good thing that society doesn\\x92t like concentrations of power\\x94. And Zuckerberg said, \\x93I understand that, I get that.\\x94 It was only at that point \\x96 when Clegg saw how open Zuckerberg was to change and advice \\x96 that he thought he could take the job. They talked everything through. \\x93The guy is much maligned but I find him unbelievably thoughtful. He hasn\\x92t got to where he is at 35 by being a dunce. He\\x92s seriously smart, he\\x92s got an ability to look several moves ahead.\\x94</p><p>  Clegg moved out to Silicon Valley just after Christmas with his family and now bicycles to the office every day.</p><p>  \\x93There\\x92s lots of sleeveless Patagonia puffa things and shoes like I\\x92ve got on now with no socks. I never wear a suit and there\\x92s micro-kitchens everywhere with a mix of healthy foods. The work rhythm is very different: I get up at six, then take the kids to school and then it\\x92s pretty full-on. You know you don\\x92t have any of the Westminster lunching culture here. Lunch is basically broccoli with some suspect sauce while you\\x92re in a meeting. I stick out like a sore thumb, I honestly think I would blend in more in Sicily or Bavaria than I do in California. I\\x92m constantly using phrases that I shouldn\\x92t which then leave everybody utterly stunned. There was one meeting I had the other day with all these engineers and I wanted to make a suggestion so I said: \\x91I don\\x92t want to teach Grandmas to suck eggs but\\x85\\x92 And they were like \\x91what?\\x92\\x94</p><p>  We come back to the Brexit referendum and Facebook\\x92s role in it. The charges are various. That there was Russian interference; that a huge amount of money was deployed on Facebook advertising but that we, the electorate, do not know who spent that money or how much; that we do not know what ads were shown to whom; that we do not know what effect this had on the result.</p><p>  \\x93The problem is,\\x94 Cleggs says, \\x93we keep going round in circles. We have no evidence [for Russian interference]. We have looked for it. People say, \\x91show us the evidence\\x92. But we can\\x92t have evidence for something which hasn\\x92t happened. We ran these tests twice, using exactly the same methodology as Facebook used when the FBI tipped them off about the Russian bots in the US presidential election. And the only thing we can confirm is that they \\x96 the Russians, if I can put it loosely \\x96 spent $1 on the Brexit referendum.\\x94</p><p>  Politicians like to answer tight and specific questions as a way of not answering others. Clegg goes as far as I think he can: \\x93That doesn\\x92t mean, by the way\\x85 for all I know\\x85 that Arron Banks tried to spend money on adverts, OK? It doesn\\x92t mean that people didn\\x92t say ghastly things about Turkish immigrants on Facebook \\x96 because that is not what I was asked. But can we absolve ourselves of the anguish by saying it was cooked up in the Kremlin? I\\x92m afraid there is just no evidence of that.\\x94</p><p>  While Clegg is firm on Russian involvement, he is, of course, not denying that advertisements on Facebook are effective. So I push the Cambridge Analytica question.</p><p>  Was the data that has been improperly harvested from Facebook redeployed by the now defunct UK political consulting and communications company, and does he think this swung the vote for Leave?</p><p>  \\x93Crucially,\\x94 Clegg says, \\x93the watchdog has said that no UK Facebook data was involved. So, the Cambridge Analytica data, as much as we can tell, is almost entirely to do with US voters, not UK voters. I think conflating the two is not very\\x85 helpful. I\\x92m not saying that social media doesn\\x92t have nasty sides to it \\x96 Facebook groups saying excitable and hyperbolic things to each other. [But there is] no systematic proof of some external puppeteer.\\x94</p><p>  Then, cryptically, he adds: \\x93To say two plus two equals seven is the problem. But it doesn\\x92t mean that two plus two is incorrect.\\x94</p><p>  On 12 July, the US Federal Trade Commission was reported to have voted to approve fining Facebook $5bn to settle an investigation into the company\\x92s privacy violations after the Cambridge Analytica allegations.</p><p>  \\x93If the criticism,\\x94 Clegg continues, \\x93is that there was a period of time in which data was too loosely governed, and data was almost too liberally shared\\x85 Yes, absolutely, undoubtedly. And that led to Cambridge Analytica, you bet. And boy has the company learnt the mistake, the lesson.\\x94</p><p>  I put it to him if a company is politically operative in a country, it must be obliged to answer to that country\\x92s parliament. That Zuckerberg should come to Westminster and answer some questions.</p><p>  \\x93Mark has quite rightly given evidence to lots of parliaments and he\\x92s given evidence to the US Congress, to the European Parliament\\x85 He will no doubt give evidence to other parliaments in future. But [the UK] hasn\\x92t actually attracted the attendance of other chief executives\\x85 And, we\\x92re going have to agree to disagree on this\\x85 He has to choose and he chose not to [come to the UK].\\x94</p><p>  Clegg \\x96 speaking now as a Facebook employee \\x96 is obfuscating. His answers are inadequate and partial \\x96 and he knows it. We don\\x92t know the details of who spent what money on Facebook advertising during the referendum, but Facebook does. We don\\x92t know how much money was spent \\x96 but Facebook does. We don\\x92t know if the effect of the advertising was to change the result \\x96 but Facebook could help us understand that.</p><p>  On this subject, the case against Clegg is forcible; he is either unhelpful or uninformed. If he knows the truth, he\\x92s not going to tell us. More likely, he doesn\\x92t know the details and he\\x92s not going to find out. He sees his role as trying to translate a bad past into a better future.</p><p>  When I speak to computer scientists at Cambridge University about the 2016 referendum by way of background, the kindest interpretation is that, \\x93Clegg may not actually know what he is talking about.\\x94</p><p>  But all of them are clear that variously paid-for manipulative advertising occurred and that it had an effect. Ross Anderson is a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. \\x93It\\x92s clearly politics trumping the rule of law,\\x94 he told me. \\x93There has been a real failure of electoral law enforcement. If this had happened in a by-election, a high court judge would have simply ordered it to be run again.\\x94</p><p>  Steve Murdoch, an associate professor and Royal Society university research fellow in information security research at University College London, says that: \\x93Facebook advertising is problematic from the perspective of privacy in that they rely on surveillance. The thing that advertisers pay for is attention and how to manipulate attention. And that might not be a great thing for society \\x96 especially when it comes to political advertising.\\x94</p><p>  Of the half-dozen computer scientists I talk to, all are united in their call for government regulation as a direct result of what they think happened during the Brexit referendum. Nobody should be allowed to advertise on social media during election campaigns unless strongly authenticated \\x96 with passports, certificates of company registration, declarations of ultimate beneficial ownership. The source and application of funds needs to be clear and easily visible. All ads should be recorded \\x96 as should the search terms used to target people. And there\\x92s no reason why you couldn\\x92t pass these laws, and give the fines real teeth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Into the valley: the main gate of Facebook\\x92s headquarters in the city of Menlo Park in Silicon Valley, California</emphasis></p><p>  ****</p><p>  If Nick Clegg is part of the problem with regard to the referendum, then might he also be part of the solution in terms of privacy? In terms of preserving what the writer Shoshana Zuboff has called \\x93decision rights\\x94 \\x96 the right to self-determination and individual autonomy? In recent weeks, Clegg has been in Europe overtly calling for regulation. This is the Clegg of Paris where we began. He is in a unique and powerful position to change things for the better.</p><p>  \\x93I have certainly spoken a lot to Mark and Sheryl,\\x94 Clegg says. \\x93They\\x92re very open to it. That they\\x92ve gone through one chapter and then they\\x92re entering another one. But they don\\x92t have all the answers. Of course, they\\x92ll fight to protect the business, but they equally accept that no business thrives unless it operates within the social consent of the society in which it\\x92s located. [My part of Facebook] is the policies: what does the company think about new privacy legislation and data portability and anti-terrorism measures and how you communicate that externally? The core of my job is overseeing this really interesting stuff.</p><p>  \\x93I was on a long call yesterday with Mark about what we do on this evolving problem of high-risk \\x91deep fakes\\x92 [sophisticated hoax films and images] in election time. Particularly if machine learning is used to produce them. All of that stuff is fascinating policy. And it actually draws on muscle memory that is very, very reminiscent of politics. Mark and Sheryl have given me as much latitude and authority as I could possibly ask for to shift the ground. And if anyone wants to be cynical about Facebook\\x92s motives for calling for a turning of the page in the relationship between Silicon Valley and governments, [they should see] the splenetic private reactions of the other players.\\x94</p><p>  Clegg is clear that he wants intelligent government regulation.</p><p>  \\x93We need law. I don\\x92t buy for one minute that it can\\x92t be done. I mean, financial services and pensions are easily more complicated in my view than social media. You have to come up with some rules of the game, where data is kept safe and locked down, but can go walkabout where people want it to go walkabout. And for that we genuinely need the help of decision-makers and lawmakers. And the European Union is interesting here because it has no dog in the fight \\x96 commercially.\\x94</p><p>  ****</p><p>  Later, Clegg tells me about the first time Zuckerberg called him and immediately asked what he thought he should do about Macron. \\x93Mark had met Macron and got on very well with him,\\x94 Clegg explains, \\x93and there was this issue about whether Facebook should try to enter into a very unusual partnership with the French government, where we would lift the bonnet and invite French officials to [Facebook headquarters] Menlo Park. [Mark] said there was a great deal of misgiving in the company. But I said, \\x93No, you\\x92ve absolutely got to do this.\\x94\\x92</p><p>  Clegg observes that Macron was busy filling the gap left by the British, who used to play a role as a so-called transatlantic bridge between Europe and the US, and so he thought it was essential they co-operated with him. Zuckerberg decided to go ahead with it. \\x93And we then conducted this totally unprecedented set of consultations and deliberations with a team of French officials, and here\\x92s the thing\\x85\\x94 Clegg grins. \\x93Guess what the upshot has been? Draft French legislation. I got an email this morning and we\\x92ll see the legal analysis about it. Of course, it is totally unwelcome to us in some important respects. And very welcome in others. And my next step is to turn around to Mark and say, \\x91That\\x92s how it works. You don\\x92t then get the regulation you want. You don\\x92t control this.\\x92\\x94</p><p>  Clegg is trying to emulate this process with the New Zealand government and he wants to propose a similar exercise with the Dutch government on political speech and content. Pride and candour re-enter his voice. \\x93I\\x92ve got half of an American company speaking to what is traditionally the most <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">dirigiste</emphasis> political class, the French. Mark has a sort of kitchen cabinet of people he gathers around him. I\\x92m one of a clutch of people. And the vast majority, the rest of them, are engineers, and I do find myself constantly having to translate from a rational world where things are laid out on spreadsheets and code to the irrational world of public figures, media sentiment and political reaction.</p><p>  \\x93But the great thing about being 52, rather than 22, in this job, is that I don\\x92t have to pander. I\\x92m not there to climb a greasy pole. I tell Mark exactly what I think, and most of the time he seems, at the moment at least, to be prepared to listen.\\x94</p><p>  As we close the interview, we talk about all the attacks on him and how at least for figures such as Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson there\\x92s a vocal faction of die-hard support, which he does not have. \\x93There\\x92s something in me,\\x94 he says, \\x93I like to grapple with difficult stuff. I think you make progress through compromise. Maybe that\\x92s a motif for me, I just think you need to get your hands dirty.\\x94</p><p>  And this is true as long as I have known him: he goes towards difficulty. Grasps it. There is something admirable here, to do with the difference between seeking approval and wanting to be liked. Most politicians are thirsty for both, of course. Some will shoot for approval even if disliked \\x96 imagined, covert or unspoken approval if it gets really bad (as with Theresa May). But others \\x96 the rarer type \\x96 are secure in their own views; or secure in their ability to avoid complacency and come to an intelligent assessment when their view is as yet unformed.</p><p>  Clegg wants to be liked, but he does not need approval. At a very fundamental psychological level, he trusts himself and is at ease. This doesn\\x92t mean we should trust him \\x96 but it\\x92s what makes him different from lesser politicians who either panic-buy their entire suite of views off the shelf, or posture in ways they believe will find favour. It is also what makes him different from, say, Johnson or Michael Gove, for whom the covert inner life is at odds with the outer life, and for whom politics therefore becomes a protracted agony of performance and bad acting.</p><p>  There is something peculiar about the British psyche with regard to other languages \\x96 a mediocre grasp of the dead ones \\x96 fine, funny even; but actual fluency in the living ones \\x96 less fine, vaguely suspicious. But more than ever, we need translators. We need fluent ambassadors in the courts of modernity. Clegg won\\x92t, I think, return to politics. But he will keep representing the UK abroad.</p><p>  He is a compromiser \\x96 no doubt; but we are living in a time horribly blighted by pedlars of what philosophers like to call the nirvana fallacy \\x96 politicians who love nothing better than to create a false dichotomy between difficult human reality and fantastical unrealistic alternatives. Under this fallacy, everything that is imperfect can be attacked. But the abiding human question has always been the same: can the imperfect man or woman manage to do more good than ill in the time and circumstances in which they find themselves?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Edward Docx\\x92s most recent novel is \\x93Let Go My Hand\\x94 (Picador)</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STATEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STATEM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKW-HV41-DYX2-C00M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6427\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New Statesman Ltd.

It is now understood that the letter will only be sent once Clegg has completed his move to California and started his job, meaning there is unlikely to be any showdown between him and the current party leadership in the coming months.</p><p>Instead, Lib Dems have largely closed ranks around their former leader after he came under sustained criticism in the public eye in recent years. One who was involved in the top levels of the party said there was a general sense of goodwill toward Clegg's bid to restart his career abroad: \"Even if you weren't a Clegg fan you think this is a good move for him and the party.\"</p><p>They expressed sadness, however, that they were losing one of their only well-known spokespeople \"who would automatically get onto the Today programme\" and be able to draw attention to the party.</p><p>Tech companies are increasingly hiring lobbying staff as many inquiries launched into social networks following the 2016 Brexit referendum and US presidential election begin to publish their conclusions, and debate switches to whether legislation is required to force tech companies to change how they operate.

Until now there has not been a unified voice fighting on behalf of the major tech companies in Britain, but the lobby group has decided to act given the imminent publication of the government's white paper on tech regulation.</p><p>\"The internet creates significant benefits for UK consumers, the economy, and society,\" a spokesperson said, confirming the association's launch plans. \"We look forward to engaging constructively in the UK to help the internet economy grow and thrive.\"</p><p>Daniel Dyball, a former lobbyist with the National Lottery operator Camelot and Channel 4, is thought to have been lined up to run the Internet Association in Britain.

He also touches on why hes generally bored with the online advertising sector (except for Seattle-based Marchex), and the one key area in which he would seek omniscient advice.<br/><br/>Here is part two of our interview:<br/><br/>Xconomy: What are the prospects for another big tech company like Amazon to come out of the Seattle area?<br/><br/>Nick Hanauer: I think the prospects are very good. Its a very dynamic, creative, and risk-tolerant business culture here. Theres a fabulous ecosystem of people who understand technology in all sorts of ways. Theres software, Internet, biotech, aerospace. Insitu, as an example, is a big company now. And in 10 years, that could be a huge company. I think they employ 600-700 people now. We [Second Avenue Partners] dont own it anymore, Boeing(NYSE:BA)  owns it, sadly. We have as good a shot at creating more big technology companies as almost any place on planet Earth. Probably not as good as Silicon Valley, but better than most places.<br/><br/>X: Tell me more about Second Avenues involvement with Bingen, WA-based Insitu, and when you first invested in it. (This company makes unmanned aircraft systems for surveillance and intelligence applications.)<br/><br/>NH: It wasnt the first round of financing, but they were a teeny tiny company, employed half a dozen people. We looked at it in June or July 2001, and they were like, \u0153Fishing, were going to find tuna with cool planes. We thought it was really interesting technology. [CEO] Steve Sliwa was so good. We got that if they could pull off this technology in this domain, there are an infinite number of applications. And then [September 11, 2001] hit. And we said, oh. The militarys going to buy a lot of these. OK, were in. We led that round, and kept on backing them. Im sad that we sold it, because it was such a civic achievement; it made such a difference in the lives of so many people. Its maybe the single biggest thing to happen to that region of Washington and Oregon economically in decades. We were very lucky [with the Boeingsale], there was this incredible global bidding war going.<br/><br/>X: How should one learn to think about solving big problems in business and society?<br/><br/>NH: I think the capacity to think creatively isnt gated by your intellectual abilities so much as your psychological ability to not conform to what other people want you to believe about how the world works. Humans are social creatures, and getting along, conforming, is an unbelievably important part of the essence of what it is to be human. We conform in ways in which we dont perceive. When you see the world the way someone else does, you conform. If youre missing the conformity gene, you get to see it different ways. You get to rearrange it in ways that other people arent willing to, or wouldnt consider rearranging.<br/><br/>I dont think its IQ. Being smart helps, but you dont have to be a genius to see the world differently. You have to have the capacity to disagree, to take the road less traveled. I guarantee you I am not smarter than lots of the people you know. But I dont need to do it the way that other people do it.<br/><br/>So I think that capacity is an incredibly important element of being successful in any endeavor, but particularly if you want to be an entrepreneur. Right now, this capacity would make me unemployable by a large company like AT&amp;T. (NYSE:SBT)  (NYSE:T)  They would kick me out so fast, Id be in and boom, out in the parking lot before Id had a cup of coffee in the morning the first day. Because there isnt anything Ive ever seen that didnt want to take apart and [mess] with. I would be unemployable by a large bureaucratic organization. My friend Jeff Bezos calls me a high-functioning contrarian; the problem is that being a low-functioning contrarian means youre in prison. I think that capacity to rearrange things and see if they make sense is very, very helpful.<br/><br/>X: Since you bring up Jeff Bezos, what is the key thing that has made Amazon what it is today?<br/><br/>NH: Jeff is just an incredible independent thinker. He would tell you he makes lots of crappy decisions, but theyre not bounded by what other people think, thats for damn sure. Hes an extraordinarily gifted problem solver.<br/><br/>A huge part of [Amazons success] is force of personality. And there are good sides to that and bad sides to that. Jeff has certainly been mostly right, but he has made some mistakes. The thing about Jeff is he understands technology, but hes not a technologist; hes not wed to technologies. Jeff Bezos wouldnt give a rip if the whole Web blew up tomorrow. Hed just find another way. Like, \u0153sold books in paper form for a while, now were going to sell them by the bits. And by the way, its kind of obvious its going to go that way, so we better get ahead of it. Hes not romantic about anything.<br/><br/>X: Bezos was in New York, so why did he set up Amazon in Seattle in the first place? Some people may not know.<br/><br/>NH: The three reasons were this. Its a small state [Washington]. California was out because 25 percent of his customers were going to be from California, and they were all going to have to pay sales tax. He wanted that tax advantage. Washington\u201dno people, no problem. The second reason was it had to be a place where you could hire development talent; Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  was here, and he figured he could get some good people. The third reason was it had to be physically near to a major book distributor; there was Ingram, a huge warehouse in Roseburg, Oregon, which was close enough. And that was it.<br/><br/>X: We havent even talked about aQuantive yet. What are your thoughts on the future of online advertising?<br/><br/>NH: Im bored with that, other than my big bet with Marchex. Im actively avoiding investments in that space. I feel like I did it. Been there, done that, its just not intrinsically interesting enough anymore for me. And P.S., its done. Maybe Ill be proved wrong, but plus or minus, the online advertising ecosystem is baked. Yes, you can incrementally improve something here, or maybe somebody will do something slightly more interesting over there, but its done, its just over. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) , Bing, whatever, who gives a [bleep]? So I get all these plans about \u0153weve got this new ad optimization blah blah blah. You know, open a chicken farm, right? Thats being unfair. What theyre doing isnt bad, its just not intrinsically interesting to me. I just feel like there are so many domains where theres more innovation space, more convention to turn upside down.<br/><br/>X: Given all your experience, what one question would you ask the God of Business?<br/><br/>NH: Whats the best way to get people to change their minds? Thats what Id want to know, if I could know anything.<br/><br/>X: What kind of answer would you be looking for?<br/><br/>NH: Well, I reckon Im a very persuasive person, so I have a better fix on this answer than most people you will meet. So Im being glib. Clearly its not that easy. The answer comes down to changing peoples metaphors. If I can get you to start thinking about the market as a garden, then its super easy for me to get you to change your mind about regulation. Even the word \u0153regulation is already living in a world where the market is perfectly efficient. The word \u0153regulation relates to understanding the market as a machine. You regulate machines. Its intrinsically a pejorative term. Regulation is intrinsically a failure. Whereas \u0153tending or \u0153weeding\"these are not failures, these are obligations. Wittgenstein said, \u0153The limits of my language are the limits of my world. So I think the answer is something like that. Some omniscient advice on this, I would love.<br/> Comments |  | Share:   <url

It allows us to run the economy in our national interest, fund services, and show solidarity with one another, by creating good, well paid jobs for everyone, taxing people fairly and providing welfare for those who need it.</p><p>The EU cannot do these things. Just ask the young unemployed workers of Spain. Or almost anybody in Greece. Or the people of places like Boston, Lincolnshire, who experienced their communities change almost overnight thanks to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">unlimited free movement of people</url>.</p><p>And just ask any minister or diplomat whether the EU is capable of heeding public concern and changing direction. Or save yourself the time and listen to last week's grandstanding by the French President, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">Emmanuel Macron</url>.</p><p>Out of the EU, free to govern ourselves, we can take back control. We can free ourselves from protectionist EU regulations, develop our own regional development funds and introduce free ports and enterprise zones to boost the regional economy.</p><p>We can cut energy costs, support local businesses in public procurement, and reduce <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">NHS</url> commissioning costs. We can regulate big tech and cut VAT bills on anything from gas bills to tampons.</p><p>We can negotiate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">our own trade deals</url>, control immigration and protect ourselves from terrorism unhindered by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">idiotic rulings</url> by the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">European Court of Justice</url>.</p><p>Right now, this optimistic vision for life after Brexit seems a long way away. And there is a real danger we will never see it at all.</p><p>                     'GROTESQUELY FLAWED DEAL'                   </p><p>The Government's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">Withdrawal Agreement</url> is deeply flawed. It would mean, if we cannot agree our long-term future relationship with Europe, we end up in the dreaded \"backstop\", locking us into       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">the EU's customs union</url> and tying us to countless EU laws.</p><p>Late on Monday night, the Government said it had won new assurances from Brussels that would mean the EU is legally bound to find alternative arrangements to the backstop. But Leave supporters in Parliament are understandably wary.</p><p>Once we are in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">the backstop</url>, they worry there will be only one way for Britain to get out again. And that is if we sign up to a permanent customs union and even more European laws. Sabine Weyand, one of the EU's negotiators, boasts that the Withdrawl Agreement \"requires the customs union as the basis of the future relationship.\" Thanks to the agreement, she says, \"the EU will retain all the controls\" over Britain.</p><p>Surely this means Eurosceptic MPs who, like me, voted for Brexit, believe passionately in Britain's independence, and hate the Withdrawal Agreement should vote against it on Tuesday?</p><p>If only life was so simple. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">If MPs reject Theresa May's deal</url>, the House of Commons will certainly vote, on Thursday, to prevent a no-deal departure and delay Brexit instead. The EU says it will agree a delay, but       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">we do not know how long we might have to wait to leave</url>.</p><p>Some Leave supporters say this is fine, and we can leave without a deal at the end of the delay. The EU, they reason, will not keep granting extensions, and without an agreement in place, Britain can simply get out.</p><p>But the EU might well grant further extensions. After all, they have the likes of Tony Blair telling them Brexit can still be stopped. And during the delay, Remainers in Parliament will mount <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">new challenges to Brexit</url>.</p><p>Some are working to bring about a Norway-style relationship, in which Britain would follow almost all EU rules and laws, including on free movement, as well as a customs union.</p><p>Others are trying to stop Brexit altogether, through a second referendum. And if they get their way, do not expect either the rules or the choice put to the people to be fair. They want <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">to rig a second referendum</url> in favour of staying in after all.</p><p>                     LEAVERS 'HAVE NOWHERE TO GO'                   </p><p>The Leavers, a minority in Parliament, remember, have nowhere to go. Those who want to leave without a deal will be thwarted by the majority of MPs who are against it. Those who want a different deal to the Withdrawal Agreement have been timed out by the Prime Minister.</p><p>They therefore need to consider the new assurances carefully. And even if they are unconvinced, they need to think through the reality of the choice they face.</p><p>Vote against Theresa May's deal, and risk certain death with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">Norway-style relationship</url> or, worse, a rigged second referendum. Or back the deal, risking only probable death as the backstop might lead Britain to an eventual customs union.</p><p>Leave supporters in Parliament are understandably angry about the situation they find themselves in. Not only is the choice they are being forced to make unpalatable, it is about Brexit: the cause to which many of them have dedicated their careers. They feel conned by a Prime Minister, a Cabinet and a Parliament they suspect simply never believed in their cause.</p><p>With a House of Commons divided along party lines and between a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">minority of Leavers and a majority of Remainers</url>, leaving the EU was never going to be easy. David Cameron knew this when he resigned in 2016, saying he did not want to stay on and do \"the hard s**t.\"</p><p>But after so many missteps, so much lost trust, and swathes of her party feeling betrayed, Theresa May will soon face a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/7767142/theresa-may-brexit-deal-protect-british-jobs/\">day of reckoning with her MPs</url>.</p><p>Before then, however, there is tonight's vote. Brexit supporters hate this deal, and so do I. They are wary, too, of the assurances won, last minute, by ministers. But as grotesquely flawed as it is, MPs who want to see Brexit through should vote for the deal. In a choice between certain death and probable death, it is better to stay alive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNONL-52500353</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM7-FJH1-F021-646M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"997\"/><timeReceived>10:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thesun.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26461\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

En toch zullen met name De Vreselijke Vijf (Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook en Microsoft), de waardevolste groepen op de Amerikaanse markt, niet zo snel verdwijnen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">De voorbije twee jaar groeit de vrees voor de almacht van die Vreselijke Vijf. De redenen om actie te ondernemen zijn legio. Er moet nieuw onderzoek naar concurrentievervalsing komen. Sommigen beschuldigen de bedrijven van politieke inmenging, anderen wijzen op het gebrek aan diversiteit en de concentratie van rijkdom. De bedrijven zijn vatbaar voor manipulatie uit het buitenland. Ze maken ons verslaafd aan hun producten.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">De techreuzen uiten op verschillende manieren hun begrip voor die angsten en beloven eraan tegemoet te komen. De balans opmaken, opruimen, 'morele verantwoordelijkheid' opnemen voor hun rol in de samenleving - het gonst van dit soort termen in een ecosysteem dat zogezegd verteerd wordt door berouw en uit is op eerherstel.</p><p>Toch klopt er iets niet in alle heisa over de zogenaamde techlash: de techreuzen voelen er amper iets van in hun financi\u00eble resultaten. In de voorbije twee weken rapporteerden ze alle vijf resultaten die alleen maar goed nieuws bevatten voor de investeerders. Amazon, dat aandeelhouders al een eeuwigheid voorhoudt dat ze groei maar geen winst mogen verwachten, meldde een recordwinst. Microsoft en Alphabet, de moederholding van Google, overtroffen vlot de analistenverwachtingen op Wall Street. Dat deed gisteren ook Apple: de aandelen zijn in die mate in waarde gestegen, dat het het eerste bedrijf geworden is met een marktwaarde van meer dan een biljoen dollar (860 miljard euro).</p><p>Maar wat dan met Facebook, dat investeerders waarschuwde voor lagere groeicijfers en hogere kosten en daardoor in \u00e9\u00e9n dag ruim 100 miljard euro verloor op de markten? Op bizarre wijze onderstreepten de problemen van het sociale netwerk alleen maar zijn dominantie. Zelfs na de crash van de aandelen bleef Facebook het vijfde meest waardevolle bedrijf op de Amerikaanse markten, nog voor het investeringsfonds Berkshire Hathaway. Amper iemand eist het ontslag van zijn CEO, wat bij andere bedrijven in gelijksoortige omstandigheden zeker zou gebeuren. De reden is dat het bedrijf niets meldde dat de langetermijnverwachtingen van experts tegensprak. Zowat iedereen die Facebook van nabij volgt, gaat ervan uit dat het zijn greep op de cultuur en de advertentiesector in de nabije toekomst zal behouden.</p><p>\"Dit is een van de meest winstgevende businessmodellen die ik ooit gezien heb, en dat is niet veranderd\", zegt Mark Mahaney, analist bij RBC Capital. Volgens hem is het aandeel Facebook \"misschien wel het aantrekkelijkst geprijsde effect in de technologie\".</p><p>Software</p><p>De resultatenrekeningen van de vijf vertellen een duidelijk verhaal. Ondanks de publieke verontwaardiging vergroten ze hun greep op ons leven, en voelen ze amper het effect van de krachten die hen zogezegd belagen, zoals regelgeving en apathie. Als de vijf al concurrentie voelen, dan komt die meestal van andere leden van de groep: de ene mag wat marktaandeel van de andere afsnoepen, maar dat wijzigt niets aan de algehele dynamiek binnen de technologiesector.</p><p>Hoe komt dat? Als je hun rapporten uitpluist, bots je op krachtige motoren die de bedrijven aan de top houden.</p><p>Software slorpt de wereld wel degelijk op</p><p>Toen het nog een e-commercebedrijf was, had Amazon \u00e9\u00e9n aanhoudende kopzorg: zou het ooit veel winst maken? Al meer dan twintig jaar breidt het bedrijf systematisch zijn capaciteit uit om alsmaar sneller een alsmaar grotere hoeveelheid producten te bezorgen. Dat vergt enorm grote investeringen: ook al groeide zijn omzet jaar op jaar als gek, toch moest Amazon zijn inkomsten steeds aanwenden voor verdere expansie.</p><p>Drie jaar geleden begon Amazon kleine maar consequente winst te melden. In het voorbije jaar groeide die winst aan, tot ze nu een omvang bereikt die zelfs voor de techindustrie uitzonderlijk is. In het kwartaal dat eindigde in juni boekte Amazon 2,1 miljard euro winst. Dat is slechts de helft van de winst van Facebook, maar het is wel echt geld.</p><p>Waar verdiende Amazon al dat extra geld? Op dezelfde plek waar de techindustrie altijd winst boekt: software. De meeste mensen mogen Amazon dan beschouwen als een plek om toiletpapier te kopen, toch haalt het het grootste deel van zijn winst uit zijn clouddienstentak, Amazon Web Services, waarmee bedrijven hun data op de servers van Amazon kunnen bewaren. Een andere nieuwe bron van inkomsten is de reclametak, die bedrijven doet betalen voor het plaatsen van advertenties op de website van Amazon.</p><p>Voor rivaliserende retailers is dat nieuwe verdienmodel van Amazon een nachtmerrie. Door winst uit zijn softwareactiviteiten door te sluizen naar zijn retailtak kan Amazon in een duizelingwekkend tempo zijn winkel blijven uitbreiden.</p><p>\"Door die activiteiten met enorme winstmarges kan Amazon zijn hele winkel met bijna geen winstmarge draaiende houden. Op die manier wordt het nagenoeg onmogelijk voor spelers die alleen met commerce bezig zijn om de concurrentie aan te gaan\", zegt Youssef Squali, analist bij de firma Sun Trust Robinson Humphrey.</p><p>Boetes</p><p>Maar niet alleen Amazon profiteer van de these van durfkapitalist Marc Andreessen dat software de wereld aan het opslorpen is. Ook de stijgende inkomsten van Microsoft hangen nauw samen met zijn cloud-activiteiten, net zoals de softwarediensten van Apple - de verkoop van apps en muziek, cloudopslag en Apple Pay - de snelst groeiende onderdelen van het bedrijf zijn.</p><p>De Europese Unie gaf Facebook onlangs een boete van 4,4 miljard euro omdat het misbruik had gemaakt van zijn softwaremonopolie. Vorig jaar had het al eens een boete van 2,3 miljard euro gekregen wegens misbruik van zijn zoekmonopolie. (Google gaat tegen beide uitspraken in beroep.) Apple ging vorig jaar akkoord om 13,8 miljard euro aan belastingachterstallen terug te betalen aan de Europese Unie vanwege zijn handige belastingdeal met de Republiek Ierland. (Het geld blijft op een geblokkeerde rekening staan zolang het beroep van Ierland loopt. Apple spreekt tegen dat het iets fout heeft gedaan.)</p><p>Facebook, dat zich voor het Amerikaans en het Europees Parlement moest verantwoorden wegens inmenging in de politiek, hangt strengere regels en boetes boven het hoofd wegens schending van de privacy.</p><p>Toch voelde Big Tech amper iets van dat verstrengde toezicht. Google betaalde zijn boete en meldde daarna doodleuk 2,8 miljard euro kwartaalwinst. Google noch Facebook had last van de strengere Europese privacyregels, de General Data Protection Regulation. In Europa verloor Facebook amper een miljoen gebruikers (van de 367 miljoen die minstens elke maand Facebook gebruiken). Beide bedrijven waarschuwden dat de wet in de toekomst een groter effect kan hebben, maar volgens analisten zullen Google en Facebook juist profiteren van de wet omdat de kosten om eraan te voldoen kleinere rivalen noodlottig kunnen worden.</p><p>De mogelijkheid bestaat ook dat de reguleringsijver zal afnemen. Google-watchers zeggen dat het opvallend was dat de Amerikaanse president Trump via Twitter kritiek op de Europese boete uitte, waaruit misschien wel blijkt dat de Amerikaanse regelgevers nooit zo ver zullen gaan. (Al is natuurlijk nooit helemaal duidelijk hoe we die presidenti\u00eble tweets moeten interpreteren.)</p><p>Groene velden</p><p>Of kijk naar de dynamiek van de digitale reclamewereld, die gedomineerd wordt door Google en Facebook en die volop op de korrel wordt genomen door pleitbezorgers van eerlijke concurrentie. Amazons groeiende reclametak vormt een bedreiging voor zowel Google als Facebook - wat aangeeft dat de advertentie-economie competitiever wordt, ook zonder hulp van de overheid. \"De vrees bestond dat advertising een duopolie zou worden van Google en Facebook\", zegt Mahaney. \"Nu wordt het dus een triopolie. Maar als je je zorgen maakte over dat duopolie, heb je vast iets van: 'Kon die derde speler dan niet iemand anders dan Amazon zijn?'\"</p><p>Tot slot zijn er wat Mahaney de 'groene velden' noemt: de bijna eindeloze mogelijkheden die de Vijf hebben om alsmaar meer geld te verdienen met diverse onderdelen van hun bedrijf. Facebook zag zijn kernactiviteit, zijn sociaal netwerk, slabakken, maar andere onderdelen - waaronder Instagram, Facebook Messenger en WhatsApp - groeien nog steeds erg snel, en het bedrijf is er nog maar net geld mee aan het verdienen.</p><p>Google heeft iets gelijksoortigs met YouTube, dat net zoals Facebook zal profiteren van de miljarden voor tv-reclame die de komende jaar naar het internet zullen verschuiven.</p><p>En dat is nog maar op de korte termijn. De resultatenrekeningen tonen aan dat alle vijf zwaar investeren in de technologie die de toekomst zal beheersen, zoals artificial intelligence en stemtechnologie voor zelfrijdende auto's.</p><p>\"Wat deze bedrijven onderscheidt van andere megabedrijven en ze aan de absolute top zal houden, is hun bereidheid om zichzelf te heruitvinden\", zegt Squali. \"Ze beschouwen zichzelf als laboratoria voor nieuwe idee\u00ebn, en ze zijn niet bang om iets wat vandaag werkt te vernielen om de langetermijndingen nog beter voor hen te maken.\"</p><p>Met andere woorden: wen maar aan De Vreselijke Vijf. Die gaan nog niet snel weg.</p><p>\u00a9 The New York Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MORGEN-9911687</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MORGEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SY7-GR81-F151-W3PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343694</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1579\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 De Persgroep Publishing All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>De Morgen</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"60995\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>3 Augustus 2018 Vrijdag</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Krant</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>DUTCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>NEDERLANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>Internet Social Networking</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Also, the data analytics related income could help to 'subsidise' airtime and data tariff costs for subscribers.

Given the Federal Government (FG)'s perennial need to source funds for the country's annual budget, it might be prescient to continue to consider innovative funding options, to avoid budget deficits, whilst also diversifying revenue sources away from petroleum related income.

The major obstacle to such approach would be moral hazard arising from ethical conflict of interest issues. Governments can only leverage the data for regulatory, administrative, service provision and national security reasons, etc. having already charged fees in appropriate cases for the primary purpose (e.g. issuance of driver's license/international passport) for which it obtained citizens' data. It is also possible that the enabling legislation may restrict the use to which such public data could be deployed. For instance in the US, public health records collected by the National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) may only be used for the purpose for which they were obtained.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote6\"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p>Section 308(d) United States Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242m)</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>This article seeks to look at ways the FG can create value by regulating data commoditization through Data Exchange (DataEx) Market similar to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) albeit virtual where resident's data are transacted and attendant tax liabilities are imposed on such transactions.</p><p>Data Residency: Essential for Data Commoditisation?</p><p>Data residency, or data localisation, is the legal requirement that data about a country's citizens or residents collected, processed or emanating from a particular territory are warehoused within its jurisdiction with strict conditions as to privacy, breach notification, consent, etc. for export.

Although the ICT Local Content Guidelines did not define what constitutes government data, it could be presumed to mean all data emanating from government's activities including data collected by government MDAs for National Identity Card, driver's license, international passport, etc. purposes.</p><p>It is noteworthy that Paragraph 12, Data Protection Guidelines (DPG), 2017 made pursuant to section 6, National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Act,<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote9\"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p>Cap.

Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS)<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote12\"/><label>12</label><bodyText><p>(2018) 35 TLRN 1</p></bodyText></footnote> where the Federal High Court (FHC) held that contract for the supply of satellite network bandwidth capacities services (an intangible service) by a non-resident in Nigeria was subject to VAT pursuant to the Reverse Charge Mechanism. Thus, services are liable to tax in the place of supply which is the place where the supplied services are consumed. This was also the position in FIRS v. Gazprom Oil &amp; Gas Nigeria Limited (Gazprom),<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote13\"/><label>13</label><bodyText><p>Unreported Suit No: FHC/ABJ/TA/1/2015.</p></bodyText></footnote> wherein the FHC reiterated that resident entities are required by law to remit VAT on transactions with non-resident entities even where the non-resident entity failed to issue VAT invoice.</p><p>Although, it is arguable whether Nigerian tax law recognises the application on the Reverse Charge Mechanism, these judicial decisions in line with the principle of stare decisis remains the position of the law until they are set aside. Can it be said that data residency is essential for data commoditisation? To answer this question, it is important to consider the basis for data residency. As earlier stated, data residency laws are enacted to protect the privacy of DSs. More so, it creates data interchange standard which must be met before data is transferred to other jurisdictions. Essentially, this speaks to how government exerts control over how the data of its residents are processed within its jurisdiction.</p><p>It is however arguable whether data residency is essential for data commoditisation. This is premised on the fact that long before the move to have data localised in-country, data extracted by online platforms such as facebook, google, etc. had been commoditised. However, with the clamour for increased privacy compliance requirements evidenced with the new European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR),<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote14\"/><label>14</label><bodyText><p>EU GDPR which was made on 14 April, 2016 became effective on May 25, 2018 and replaces European Commission Directive 95/46/EC</p></bodyText></footnote> data residency laws/regulation would protect DSs/residents.</p><p>Thus, for government to derive value from commoditisation of data by big TechCos, it is essential to strictly regulate data exchange through data residency laws. On the flip side, it could be argued that having strong data residency laws could stiffen innovation in the tech space such as cloud services. Nonetheless, it could increase investment in in-country data centres as opposed to other jurisdictions.</p><p>Big Data Exchange: Extracting Value from Data Commoditisation</p><p>Undoubtedly, data is big business and governments all over the world are making plans to tap into the value created by big data. One of such ways is the recognition of revenues generated by data processors/controllers under the European Commission (EC) Proposal for Council Directive (COM (2018) 148) which proposes to impose minimum tax on the revenue of such companies even though they do not engage in the sale of conventional 'goods and services.'</p><p>In Nigeria, there could be ways the FG can leverage the country's increasing digital penetration by creating the regulatory framework cum enabling business environment upon which a private sector driven DataEx Market could thrive. This could be similar to BDEX, a US based Data Exchange Platform (DXP) where Application Programming Interface (APIs) are used to enable data flow into the exchange and buyers can purchase the data using identifiers. The market would simply comprise data controllers and big data companies.</p><p>Under the operations/transactions layer, data is extracted by data owners which is then processed and sold at the common market (DataEx) to digital companies and advertisers. Para 4.1 (2)(w) DPG had defined data owner as \"...the organisations or a hired third party in possession of any data collected by (sic) from a Data Subject either directly or indirectly.\" Although, it is arguable whether this definition does not seek to expropriate data by denying DSs' proprietary rights. It could provide a practical framework within which DataEx could be built.</p><p>Upon the creation of DataEx, the FG can thereafter monitor data transactions with a view to safeguarding national security interests. More so, it could impose tax obligations on those transactions to generate revenue to fund its budget.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Although this is an emerging area, given the value TechCos derive from big data transactions, it is prescient to have a system in place that ensures that the privacy of DSs are not breached. Furthermore, government needs to be focused on national security goals to avoid residents' data getting into the wrong hands; accordingly the necessity for data residency laws cannot be overemphasised. Apart from the national security angle, there is the commercial angle which involves deriving value from data transactions.</p><p>The creation of DataEx would ensure that the interest of both the DSs and governments are protected. Currently, there is no framework for creation of DataEx in Nigeria. Notwithstanding, NITDA could begin to consider a common framework to ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are protected.</p><p>October 2018</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

With an estimated 2.96 billion social media users worldwide, social media is the greatest accomplice to the speedy dispensation of personal information around the world.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote2\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/accessed\">https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/accessed</url> on January 20, 2020.</p></bodyText></footnote> Virtually everybody on the planet has their personal data i.e., name, address, pictures, email address, bank details, or medical information online. These data reveal sensitive personal information that can be exploited to harm users unscrupulously for economic gain. Thus, it is has become important to protect these data and regulate the way data is used. One should be able to decide whether or not they want to share some information, who has access to it, for how long, for what reason and to be able to modify some of this information, if necessary.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote3\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>Estelle Masse \"Data Protection: Why it matters and how to protect it\" (January 25, 2018) available online at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accessnow.org/data-protection-matters-protect/accessed\">https://www.accessnow.org/data-protection-matters-protect/accessed</url> on January 20, 2020.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>The information age has seen data exchange become a common feature and an integral part of commercial transactions.

For instance, the Google-owned YouTube's algorithm feeds off personal data (e.g. user information, likes, searches, etc.) to suggest what videos users may like or find interesting.</p><p> \"Knowledge is power, information is power.\"</p><p>1.1 This statement by Robin Morgan became more glaring and profound in the light of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica Data Privacy Scandal<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote5\"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p>\"Facebook data privacy scandal: A cheat sheet\" by James Sanders and Dan Patterson (July 24, 2019) available online at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/facebook-data-privacy-scandal-a-cheat-sheet/\">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/facebook-data-privacy-scandal-a-cheat-sheet/</url> accessed on January 20, 2020.</p></bodyText></footnote> that shook the world in 2018. Here, Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting and strategic communication firm was found to have illicitly collected the personal data and information of about 87 million Facebook users without their consent for political advertising purposes (especially in the run-up to the 2016 US Presidential elections). This scandal amongst other previous data privacy breaches<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote6\"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p>For instance, in 2014 the personal information of over 3billion Yahoo users was unlawfully accessed by hackers - CNN Business: \"Every Single Yahoo Account was Hacked - 3 Billion in all\" (October 4, 2017) available online at <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/03/technology/business/yahoo-breach-3-billion-accounts/index.html/\">https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/03/technology/business/yahoo-breach-3-billion-accounts/index.html/</url> accessed on 4TH February, 2020</p></bodyText></footnote> signaled the urgent need to protect personal data. It prompted the immediate implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote7\"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p>The European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 is the EU's major law on Data Protection and Privacy is aimed at protecting natural persons within the EU with respect to the processing of personal data and on the transfer of such data outside the EU.</p></bodyText></footnote> in 2018.</p><p>1.2 In similar vein, Nigeria has had its own fair share of data privacy breaches. Notably, the recent case between NITDA<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote8\"/><label>8</label><bodyText><p>National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) is Nigeria's foremost agency responsible for regulating data privacy and protection in Nigeria.</p></bodyText></footnote> and TrueCaller (2019) as well as the case involving MTN Nigeria Communications Ltd v Barr. Godfrey Eneye (2013) are a few instances.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote9\"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p>CA/A/689/2013 (Unreported).</p></bodyText></footnote> Data protection is becoming a risk issue discussed at negotiation stages between companies in different jurisdictions and data protection has become a tool to encourage confidence in businesses. In essence, it is important that companies and persons in Nigeria know the laws governing Data Privacy and Protection in Nigeria and the scope of rights, duties and responsibilities available to them.</p><p> The Legal Framework of Data Privacy and Protection Laws in Nigeria</p><p>Although Nigeria does not have a specific statute regulating Data Privacy and protection, the NITDA commendably came up with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulations (NDPR) in 2019 which specifically addresses Data Privacy and Protection in Nigeria. Asides from the NDPR, there are other laws which touch on Data Privacy and Protection in Nigeria, which are briefly highlighted below.</p><p> The Constitution<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote10\"/><label>10</label><bodyText><p>The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended). Act No. 24, 5 May 1999.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Section 37 of Nigeria's 1999 constitution forms the foundation of data privacy rights and protection in Nigeria. Section 37 guarantees and protects the right of Nigerians to privacy with respect to their homes, correspondence, telephone conversations and telegraphic communications. It deems Privacy in this respect a fundamental right which is enforceable in a court of law when breached. Prior to the NDPR, most cases of data privacy breaches were enforced under this section.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote11\"/><label>11</label><bodyText><p>See the case of Barr. Ezugwu Emmanuel Anene v.

Some of these include the cases of Godfrey Nya Eneye v MTN Nigeria Communication Ltd<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote31\"/><label>31</label><bodyText><p>Appeal No: CA/A/689/2013 (Unreported).</p></bodyText></footnote> and Barr. Ezugwu Anene v Airtel Nigeria Ltd.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote32\"/><label>32</label><bodyText><p>Suit No: FCT/HC/CV/545/2015 (Unreported).</p></bodyText></footnote> In the former case, the court held that the unauthorized disclosure of the claimant's mobile phone number by his telecommunications service provider (the defendant) and subsequent unsolicited text messages he received from unknown third parties were violations of his constitutional right to privacy. A similar verdict was given in the latter case. Both claimants were awarded damages of N5,000,000 (five million naira), respectively.</p><p> Conclusion</p><p>15.1 It is laudable that Nigerian authorities through their laws and various regulations are taking bold steps to protect the personal data of her citizens. However, despite the array of laws and regulations on data privacy and protection, the only law that specifically and comprehensively deals with this phenomenon is the recently announced NDPR by NITDA.</p><p>15.2 Prior to the NDPR, most laws on data privacy and protection in Nigeria were industry specific. For instance, the various NCC regulations protect consumers in the telecommunications sector; the provisions in the Child Rights Act protects persons under the age of 18 and the Freedom of Information Act protects personal data in records of public institutions. Therefore, the establishment of a data privacy and protection law in the form of the NDPR that transcends industries and category of persons is highly commendable.</p><p>15.3 The quick implementation and enforcement of the NDPR by NITDA has shown its seriousness in ensuring compliance with data privacy and protection laws by data controllers and processors in Nigeria. <footnote><anchor id=\"fnote33\"/><label>33</label><bodyText><p>In December 2019, NITDA threatened to issue a Notice of Non-compliance and to publish the names of companies that default in filing their Initial Data Protection Audit Report within the prescribed timeline.

The regulation solely \"applies to all transactions intended for the processing of personal data and to actual processing of personal data... and to natural persons residing in Nigeria or residing outside Nigeria but of Nigerian descent.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote36\"/><label>36</label><bodyText><p>Article 1.2 of the NDPR 2019.</p></bodyText></footnote> The NDPR applying solely to personal data and natural persons means the regulation excludes other forms of data and corporate organisations respectively.</p><p>15.5 Furthermore, some quarters believe the NDPR being a regulation and not a statute enacted by the National Assembly lacks the requisite force of law sufficient for addressing such an important subject. Some also believe the NITDA is not empowered by law within the ambit of Section 6 of the NITDA Act to make such a regulation.</p><p>15.6 Nonetheless, Nigeria is one of the few countries that can boast of having data privacy and protection laws in the world.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote37\"/><label>37</label><bodyText><p>Other countries/regions include the EU, Canada, Brazil, China, Angola, Argentina, Australia and Cape Verde.</p></bodyText></footnote> It is thus apparent the country is heading in the right direction although there is still room for improvement.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

These are the four key pillars and I still see good moments around the world.</p><p>I know everyone talks about the trade conflict, increased polarisation in many countries and societies and climate change as key challenges, but I think overall the world is in reasonable shape, growth rates are quite reasonable and so I'm still optimistic we will continue on a good path.

What stands out for you in countries that you visit and what lessons can Nigeria learn from your observations?</p><p>Of course what you notice are two things; one is the infrastructure, from duly built airports to ports, railroads and highways, and of course the other thing is the discussions with people, when they talk about their lives and the lives of their children, about education, business and about how they feel.</p><p>I think these are the two most important issues and the key thing you see in emerging markets is that there is improvement in infrastructure. What you physically see is that moving from the three months to the next three months, a road that had not been finished in the last quarter gets completed. In the developed markets in Europe and North America, people are actually satisfied with what they have but are really worried about the future and everybody expresses this.</p><p>In emerging markets, people are not satisfied with what they have but they are optimistic about the future and they are willing to engage on the future. So that is something which you'll hear all the time and that is why I like to be in emerging markets, which is where I spend most of my time because people are very optimistic and willing to take their destiny into their hands.</p><p>There are many places like Nigeria where the struggle with building infrastructure is prevalent and I want to ask what the global concepts that are working for developing infrastructure at a rapid pace and how can Nigeria tap into that knowledge.</p><p>First of all, I would say except for China, all countries are struggling with this and all new high ways and ports or airports take a long time.</p><p>In China you decide to embark on such projects and in two years you are done with it and everybody has to move aside. There is nowhere else in the world where that is possible and of course I'm aware in Nigeria you have particular issues with infrastructure but I don't think it is something completely unusual. You find connectivity within Africa overall still with lots of room for improvement.</p><p>Same in Asia and Latin America but I think they are making progress because you find leaders like President Joko Widodo in Indonesia being much focused on infrastructure and really putting himself on the line and trying to remove obstacles.</p><p>Where there are issues, say with a village because a highway is supposed to move close by, he engages with the villagers and this has been on several occasions. He has tried to convince them and get things done. It still takes time but progress is being made. In India, the kilometres of roads being built per day has moved to up to 30 kilometres because within the government, there are specific people who really have the will and determination to get things done.</p><p>In India, we are working with the minister of transportation who is also in charge of building roads and he really is getting things done, public sector ports, increasing capacity, engaging the people. I think that's what it takes, you have to have people-champions- who drive this and remove the many obstacles that are clearly there.</p><p>You alluded to the challenge of will and courage that is required to breakdown some of these barriers. In Nigeria we see an amplification of funding challenge for building infrastructure especially at a time where government revenues are flat, perhaps declining with rising debt service costs. What should Nigeria be doing to crack the funding challenge?</p><p>I think the key thing about infrastructure is not so much the funding. Again, I don't know the details for Nigeria or Africa but I think it's interesting to see that the money usually is there. In Asia certainly, maybe that's also true for Africa, Chinese, Japanese and Koreans are really trying to build and also provide cheap finance. The development banks, the multilateral development banks are really engaged and there is also a lot of institutional investment from pension funds and insurance companies, who actually look for infrastructural investments and to have a steady flow of income. The key is getting these projects off the ground and get going. This is why many people hesitate because when you say you will build a new toll road, and then it takes about 50 years before you get started because there are a lot of struggles with all kinds of regulation, land disputes, court cases and so forth. The real issue in many places is not so much the money but the ability to get moving.</p><p>The reason we see funding as a challenge here, is not necessary due to the unavailability of capital, but unlocking it through creating a good asset class that people can invest in; like a good pipeline of projects that private equity, pension funds can invest in. In Nigeria we see government only, there isn't a PPP project that I have seen come to the market in the last three years.</p><p>Different countries have different experience with PPP. For some, it has worked well but for many it has not, including developed markets. I think one of the key ways of financing is to sell existing projects; airport, ports, highways, railroads and then use the money to finance new projects because when you have brown field projects you know what you have, the investors are clear they can really size what they are getting. Whereas for Green field projects, you never know what would come and when it would come. So that may be a way of not only getting the money but also unlocking the funding by selling existing assets at a good price and with the proceeds building the next round of high ways, railroads and airports. I think we have been also working a lot on how to finance infrastructure, the uncertainty has been the major issues for most of the investors-the primary investors. If you can remove this by having specific projects, then it is a much easier task.</p><p>BCG is big on infrastructure globally, what would you say is the impact that the work your colleagues in Lagos has had on moving the needle in the area of infrastructure in Nigeria and what more can be done?</p><p>I think it's always important to find the champions within the government or certain institutions that really want to move things forward. We have been working with a number of airports and help to create big expansions to increase the flow of passengers, to increase revenue and so forth. We have been working at ports, at terminals, increasing capacity significantly with very limited investment and I think the starting point has to be somebody who has the determination whether it is the head of the port in Jakarta, Indonesia, the head of the airport in Singapore or the minister in India who says he wants to really improve the public sector port in India and really expand with limited resources.</p><p>These people- the champions within government- are usually concerned with how they can make those places more effective and efficient. I am sure there are also champions in Nigeria, but I think this is the key part for me as it is not something one can do from the outside. You need to have someone, whether it is the public sector or private sector who really wants to get it done and is personally committed to engaging and removing the obstacles. There are many obstacles, not only here but also abroad.</p><p>You spoke earlier about global growth and that there have been concerns about the trade war between Unites States and China, do you think these days that it might not be as bad as most analysts had envisaged?</p><p>Well, we should say that there is not only a trade conflict between US and China. There is also one between US and Europe, one between US and Japan and another between Europe and China. In other places, you'd see trade barriers and tariffs being reintroduced by many countries. So I think there is a general concern about trade flows and that's why we see trade as a percentage of global GDP stagnating and even decline some years ago, but it's up again. At the same time we see more exchange of service and data. Globalisation is not dead or declining; it continues to move forward but takes a different form. So product has been the core, increasingly services, and of course data. The exchange of data is massive and so what we will see is an on-going globalisation but not quite as physically visible as we have seen it before and we need to address those conflicts and frictions between the various trading blocs and I am pretty sure we would find solutions because everybody would be hurt if we have a real imposition of massive tariffs, 35 percent or whatever the number on a large chunk of the world's trade, everybody would suffer.</p><p>Retaliatory actions hurt different parts of the economy in different parts of the world but I think we should clearly see that especially, the conflict between US and China would continue beyond any trade agreement, because it is a conflict about being the strongest or super power of the world. This is not new thinking. The fight between US and the Soviet Union has now moved on to the friction between US and China.</p><p>Back to the issue of the economy, what should business leaders and CEOs be doing at a time like this when there is so much concern about growth and trade and as established relationships and partnerships are being tested as vigorously as we see today?</p><p>It is important to remain ambitious but at the same time be realistic. Whenever we see the economic growth forecast for the world in 2019 and then three months after they are being reduced by the IMF or World Bank, I think we have to be realistic once it's global.</p><p>Europe would grow 1 to 2 percent, it can be 2 or maybe higher but it can also be 1 or slightly lower. US can grow 2 to 3 percent; Asia is around 5 to 6, Latin America maybe around 2 to 3 depending on commodity price, Africa too is also dependent on commodity price and while we have some countries growing quite high at 6,7,8 percent, the big ones like South Africa, like Nigeria and Egypt are growing more at the lower end of 2 to 3 percent.</p><p>I think it is very important not to always have inflated expectations because of the demographics certainly in Europe but also in countries like North America. The growth of productivity and also the debt level do not allow you to artificially create lower growth just by pumping more money. You have tried this before the recession, now you have seen that it has its limitations. With the technical population in Europe, you will have 1 to 2 percent growth.</p><p>The second element is business leaders should really think about their overall portfolio businesses. You need to question what businesses we are doing. By the way, there are no bad industries. In every industry, there are outperformers and underperformers. Although some people say certain industries are very bad, there are examples of outperformers in these industries. The difference between the outperformers and under-performers is significant. When you are looking at your portfolio, always look at yourself and ask where you can do better. You ask if you are really creating value in that sector.</p><p>If you are not getting the right answers, sell it off. The focus should be where you can create value and differentiate yourself.</p><p>For everyone it is important to look at the opportunity created by digitalization. Every industry, sector and company is digitalized one way or the other. The big-tech companies are putting themselves between you and your customers. The big-tech companies have a much higher valuation and have more currency to make acquisitions. Everyone has to think of what digitalization has done for them and how they can benefit. They need to also ask what the threats and challenges are.</p><p>Secondly, I think every company needs to start thinking global. It doesn't really mean you have to be everywhere. But you should ask yourself; where are my customers? How can I really reach customers? Where can I supply or find suppliers in the world? Where can I find relevant data? Where can I work with others to create eco-systems?</p><p>The third one is given that there is so much criticism of capitalism or market societies, I think just focusing on shareholder value is not long and sufficient, you would have to create value for all your stakeholders; and I think it's really important to talk about your customers, your employees, your suppliers, government entities and your investors. You have to engage with all of them and create value for them; otherwise you may even lose your license to operate.</p><p>Typically CEOs around the world that you meet will ask you your view about certain businesses. What message do you take back to them about Nigeria this time?</p><p>Well, certainly, I will say it is important to invest in Africa, but it must be a long-term plan. There are lots of portholes on the road. I think the key is building step by step. It takes a long-term view to have a strong base, and a base which goes beyond commodity. There is opportunity to produce in Africa and to really export from Africa to the rest of the world.</p><p>Did you notice any change on the airport road when you came out of the airport?</p><p>It took me 40 minutes to get to my office from the airport and that was really a surprise.</p><p>Any other surprises?</p><p>Yes, of course. But you know that growth is slow in Nigeria. Unemployment is high.</p><p>I had the feeling that four or five years ago, there were a lot of Nigerians coming back into country to seize one opportunity or the other, but now there is a net outflow. Everybody seems to be speaking of Canada as the place to go to. That has also caught me by surprise.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSDAY-BUSSDAY13052019000531</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSDAY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3V-JG61-F00C-64FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436445</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Day All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Day</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 13, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002NOA</classCode><className>BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541513 COMPUTER FACILITIES MANAGEMENT SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000373</classCode><className>CONSULTING SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001914</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009939</classCode><className>FACILITIES MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX238</classCode><className>LAGOS, NIGERIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC334</classCode><className>NIGERIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Hitherto called Union Capital Markets Ltd, a former subsidiary of Union Bank of Nigeria Plc before Akpata and his partners acquired it in 2014. UCML is a foremost investment and advisory firm active in the debt capital markets segment of the industry. In this interview with Kunle Aderinokun, Akpata speaks on Nigeria\u2019s money and capital markets, analysing money market instruments and bond issuances as well as the performance of the Nigerian Stock Exchange in recent time. Besides, Akpata expresses his views on the economy, investment climate and narrows down on the federal government\u2019s borrowing and debt service to revenue, which recently reached an all-time high. Excerpts:    How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the primary issuance market?    A lot of things have happened. I think the first lockdown started at the end of March, and the impact on the primary market has not been as much as we would have thought it would be, for a number of reasons.    First, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remained open, so did FMDQ and the NSE. So trading was still going on and primary market transactions were still being approved. A number of transactions actually happened during the total lockdown of Lagos and Abuja. So the primary markets actually continued uninterrupted.    Also, interest rates have been coming down due to the Central Bankof Nigeria\u2019s activities in the market, and globally, central banks have been forcing rates down to try and provide liquidity for the market to survive this slow-down period. I think that has also helped here. The equity market, though, has not really seen much on the primary issuance side.    We noticed that your company\u2019s name has changed from Union Capital Markets Limited. What necessitated the change?    Our new name is UCML Capital Ltd. Union Capital Market used to be a subsidiary of Union Bank. My partners and I bought the company from Union Bank in 2014. That transaction technically closed on December 31, 2013. In January 2014, we took control of the company. Part of the requirements of the acquisition was to rename the company. Also, we did that to coincide with our 20 years anniversary.    The company was founded in 1999, and the 20 years anniversary of the company was technically last year. We are in our 21st year now. So, in order to just reposition the company as independent of any bank, we went into a renaming process. The new name has been approved by all the regulatory authorities. And so the new name is UCML Capital Limited.    We do have one new subsidiary, UCML Investment Management Limited, which is the asset management, fund, and portfolio management arm. So, our new name is UCML Capital, and that name is what we would be using going forward.    Is the independence basically the reason you changed the name?    Well, it is primarily regulatory. It is also to rebrand and create our own identity. It is a repositioning and I think over the past five years, we have done quite a lot particularly in the investment banking space. A lot of quality transactions that have proven our capacity to perform in these markets on our own.    Despite record-low interest rates, we don\u2019t seem to be seeing as many corporate or state bond issues as would have been expected. Why?    This problem happens any time interest rates drop very substantially. Recall this happened in the end of 2015/2016, and I can name a few other times it has happened. Most issuers miss the exact point when rates bottom out.    Let\u2019s break the primary bond market into two parts. The state government bond market since 2015 has become quite small, for a number of regulatory and other reasons. Between 2015 and December 2019, I think Lagos State was the only state that issued a bond. So that is the challenge.    You are having a situation where, for all kind of reasons, most states can\u2019t issue. But Lagos State did do a very large transaction, I think in February or so, to the tune of N100 billion, the largest state government bond ever.    But, you don\u2019t see many states come to the market because of regulatory constraints around some existing laws, primarily Investment and Securities Act (ISA) 2007, making it a bid difficult for those transactions to get approved.    Again in Q1, you tend not to have many transactions from corporates, because most corporates have a December year-end. By the time their audited accounts are out and they start the process of a regulated transaction, you go a bit beyond Q1.    But a number of transactions have been coming through. Dangote Cement PLC did a N100-billion bond, you had a N100-billion Commercial Paper (CP) from Dangote Cement, MTN also issued a N100-billion CP.    These sizes have not been seen before. Never has there been a N100-billion Commercial Paper transaction, so those transactions have gone through, and there are quite a number that are coming into the market as you can see.    We closed a N10-billion bond for United Capital in May. We are closing a N10-billion bond for another merchant bank this month, and we have a couple of others that are on the pipeline. So we will be seeing more transactions, but the question is, why everybody has not tapped into the low-rate environment to refinance and re-price all their borrowings down? Sometimes, it\u2019s just knowledge. So we may have to do more to reach out to more clients. Also, sometimes, there are other internal constraints within the issuer community. But I think we will see more transactions this year, certainly more than we saw last year.    Interest rates for all FGN instruments of all tenors are all below inflation. Why and is this a sustainable trend?    There are two parts to look at it from. First is, has it happened before? It has happened before in this market. It happened in 2016, happened in 2009/10 financial crisis. In this case, it is a reaction to a global crisis.    We do have a global economic crisis triggered by the global pandemic. And if you look at what central banks all over the world have been doing, they have been forcing interest rates down particularly on the short end of the curve. And that has dragged all rates down across all tenors. So we have a situation where, if you look at the US for instance, 10-year bond is around 0.6% per cent. It is probably sitting well below around inflation there. And if you go to Europe or Japan, they even have negative interest rates.    So that phenomenon has found its way here. There was a time when Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) believed in positive real interest rates, interest rates above inflation. But now, they have to battle with servicing the economy, so they systematically managed the situation in the market to the point where all FGN bond tenors are now yielding below inflation. Inflation is now 12.4 per cent, and even the 30-year bond is below 12 per cent.    So you just create a challenge for investors who are trying to outperform inflation, but for a government that is having to borrow very massively to fund its operations, it\u2019s actually a positive on the government side.    They\u2019re reasonably trying to force people to spend money or invest in productive assets, rather than just storing your money. Because right now, your money is being eroded by inflation, you can\u2019t even earn an interest rate high enough. It is to stimulate the economy.    On how long can it go on for? We have had negative real interest rates in many countries for five years plus, the question is, can you sustain low rates? The CBN probably has enough tools to do so, but what is the collateral damage in terms of punishing savers or encouraging capital flight??    The CBN seems to have found a backdoor way to almost isolate the exchange rate part of the market from the interest rate part. They could do this for a while, a few years definitely.    The federal government has vastly increased borrowing in this year\u2019s budget. How is the new local borrowing impacting corporate borrowers?    I think the original budget had about N1.6 trillion total borrowing, local and foreign. The local was about N850 billion, now the local is like N2.2 trillion. First of all, the entire N1.6 trillion has been converted to local, and they have even added more.    Part of the problem started because of this pandemic. The Federal Government was supposed to go to the Eurobond market for about $3.3 billion which then was about N1 trillion roughly, and the market shutdown just before they could go out. Unfortunately, they started working on the issue in early March, by end of March, the market had shut down. So there was no opportunity to go into the Eurobond market.    In terms of the naira side the cause was technical issues around the way CBN is managing liquidity. For instance, local investors in OMO bills cannot buy OMO bills anymore. So as these OMO bills mature, they have to put the money in other federal government instruments such as bonds, or treasury bills.    So, all that money that is maturing from OMO bills, the DMO and CBN are finding a way to basically direct that money back into federal government instruments.    So as of now, federal government has met about 66 per cent of the N2.2 trillion 2020 borrowing target in local currency Given the level of bids they have received in the auctions, clearly, the liquidity is there for them get to their N2.2 trillion this year. This as far as I know will be a record amount of local borrowing by the federal government in a calendar year and because of the peculiar situation of the market, they can actually raise the money.    On its impact on corporate issuers, it is probably a positive impact from the point of view that the interest rate environment is being managed downwards so as to allow the federal government not take too much borrowing costs. The corporates who are smart enough to tag on to that wave, are able to get money out on usually low rates compared to historical averages.    When somebody is issuing a N100 billion CP at 4.9 per cent and 5.95 per cent for 6 and 9 months respectively, historically you just did not issue CPs at those kind of rates, if you go a year back. So, positive side is that it has brought rate down, and the negative side is that when the excess liquidity dries up, if the federal government continues to borrow at this rate, which is likely next year, then, it would become a very different story.    But for now, it doesn\u2019t seem to be disturbing the local issuance market.    The outstanding FGN debt has grown astronomically in the past five years. Is there now the risk that we might be returning to the debt trap of the 90s?    It depends on what time horizon you look at. Short-term horizon, such as next two years, the answer is no, because you have to bear in mind that most of that debt is in local currency.    And when you have debts in local currency, the government has a few options, at the worst case scenario, you can either print money or increase taxes. And in the Nigerian government case, the third option is to devalue, so you have more naira from any dollar earnings, to offset the naira debt.    The naira debt is really not a problem. The problem is foreign currency components, which is growing very rapidly. And at some point, I think debt in foreign currency is almost $30 billion. When you add this new IMF, World Bank, AfDB, IDB $5.5 billion that has been recently approved, it definitely goes well over $30 billion. There are still all these Chinese borrowings that are not still clear what their status is. They were as high as $22 billion. I mean when you add this on top of everything, then you are getting into problem territory.    On the short term though, because of the structure of these loans, the Chinese loans, the multilateral or bilateral loans from DFIs, they are not a problem on the short term. They have low interest rates within longer repayment period. The problem is that at some point, you would start to have to repay these loans in foreign currency. And that could become a problem in about five to 10 years\u2019 time, if it keeps growing at this rate.    For now, there is no near-term risk that Nigeria would have any difficulty to pay any foreign currency debt including Eurobond debt which is private. Total debt service for Eurobonds last year was $771 million. I think next year, it might be slightly more because of a maturity of $500 million early in the year.    But it is still not a problem, which is why Nigeria has not requested any type of restructuring of the Eurobond debt. Even when FGN Eurobonds dropped substantially in price (in March, it dropped 30 per cent plus) it pretty much recovered in price because the market knows that there is no risk of default on Nigerian Eurobonds.    Ten years from now at this rate, the foreign currency loans would become a problem.    When you look at the debt service to revenue, it\u2019s about 99 per cent, which is too high. Who do you think would pay for these debts in the medium to long term?    I think there\u2019s a lot of talk from the government side around debt service to GDP. We have less than 25 per cent which I guess local regulations allow. Debt service to GDP probably doesn\u2019t mean anything because you don\u2019t service debt with GDP. GDP is privately owned. This is not a communist state.    The GDP is actually privately-owned and not owned by the government. It does not have any ability to use the GDP to service debt. What you have ability to use to service debt is revenue that accrues to the government from taxes or other revenues with the government.    Yes, 99 per cent is very worrying, again, it might be worthwhile adjusting the 99 per cent downward for a bond repayment that happened sometimes in March.    When you have a bond repayment, you are pre-paying principal. That in theory, is servicing but it is not a cost for carrying debts. Cost of carrying debt is the interest. And in reality, there are very few governments in the world that ever paid down their debt.    When you look at the US government, their debt has more than doubled in the past 10 years. In fact, in the past three years it has increased probably by $6 or $7 trillion.    In the case of Nigeria, we have bonds that are as far as 2049 maturity, both in local and foreign currencies. And these are bullet repayments. Clearly, those would not need to be repaid any time before then. What would probably happen is that, the debt would most likely keep getting larger, but they would find a way to make the interest payment lower, and you just keep rolling it over.    I don\u2019t see any scenario in the foreseeable future where Nigerian government debt will materially reduce. The only way that would happen is if there was some substantial selling of government\u2019s assets to bring down debt.    And again, in the face of a huge infrastructural deficit, why are you bringing down debt? You should be using the money to build the country itself.    US equity markets are setting all-time highs, but the NSE ASI seems stuck at a fraction of its all-time high. Why has this market failed to surpass its 2008 highs?    The US markets, particularly the S&amp;P and NASDAQ indices, recently set new all-time highs. The Dow Jones index is yet to do that but it is getting close. So, it is a bit odd that you are having all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic with a huge spike in US unemployment and earnings collapsing in a couple of companies.    But the reason why that is happening is primarily because the Federal Reserve Bank has pumped a lot of money into the system. And their system is a bit different from here.    When the Federal Reserve Bank pumps money into their system, some of that money finds its way into the stock market. In the system we are running here in Nigeria, none of that money goes into the stock market. The people who get hold of the money that is coming out of CBN, they are almost prohibited from putting the money into stock market. It is different in the US. So, a lot of money that their federal government has released, has entered their stock market and pushed it up.    US investors are given the option of earning almost zero on their money in US Treasuries. Buying stocks that actually still pay yields way above government yields is a rational choice. I mean, many US companies are paying dividend yields of 2 per cent and above, so it makes sense to park in money in stocks, which is what they are doing.    Now when you bring it to the Nigerian case, unfortunately, here, you have not even had any significant economic growth in the past few years, and the companies have not been growing earnings at a very rapid pace, and you need continuous earnings growth to have your stocks become more valuable. That is really not happening here.    Also, you have a situation where you don\u2019t have a lot of the fast-growing sectors of the economy well represented in the stock exchange. It is only recently that MTN got listed and the stock is doing quite decently, but the growth areas of the economy are not represented in the stock exchange, so you might not get the kind of index growth that you hope to get.    If you look at the US, most of the companies that are propping up that market are big tech companies that are still growing.    There seem to be very few equity listings coming to the market. In fact, the number of listed companies on the NSE reduces every year. When will this trend be reversed?    I think that is an unfortunate trend. That is factual. You have to go to the history of the NSE and the 70s indigenisation. A lot of companies were forced to list, so those companies basically, some of them are delisting for different reasons and a number of them are just dying off. Some are now dormant and no more very attractive to investors.    So nobody really misses those ones.    The challenge is getting new companies to come to the exchange. The problem seems to be that, for most sectors, public companies in Nigeria have a lower valuation than private companies. That is the root problem.    So if you own a company, you don\u2019t see any value in going to list it, and then, if you want to do a transaction for equity raising, everybody points to your stock price. You find out that your public price is far less than when you are a private company and you have a higher valuation.    That creates a big disincentive for anybody to list you. The whole point of listing is that you hoped to get a higher valuation as a public company. And also, the structure of the market is such that you don\u2019t really have any significant pool of institutional equity investors outside the pension funds.    Mutual funds that are equity focused are very tiny, and you can\u2019t really rely on HNI or corporate investors in the market local. Foreign investors are not that excited about this economy anymore, on the equity side, so you don\u2019t really have demand for the instrument. And when you don\u2019t have that kind of demand, there is a very little motivation for companies to rush to the market.    Until we do have a situation where your public valuation is higher than your private valuation, you might not see any rush in companies coming to list on the exchange.    Governments seem to have a long-term challenge funding their recurrent expenditure, suggesting they cannot fund infrastructure needs of the country. What is the way to bring in fresh funds for infrastructure development?    We have structural problems across the board both at state and federal governments level, because it\u2019s the practical reality. It\u2019s just mathematical, given their payroll, and pension cost, which can only go up every year. It cannot go down, without a huge restructuring of the workforce and layoffs. And that is politically not on the table.    Eventually, it is already happening at the federal government level, and that is why the debt service is so high. Eventually the government basically is just living on borrowed money and hoping that some generations in the future would repay the debts.    So first thing is that the government has to restructure, it can\u2019t keep just getting bigger in terms of its operating cost. Because its revenues are not growing commensurately.    Also, philosophies around who owns what have to change. There was a time in this country where to just make a phone call it was through the government company. We had no private options. That has changed.    That kind of change has to apply to most sectors. The government shouldn\u2019t really be in most sectors of the economy, it should be left to private investors to run and the government taxes them.    But where are those private investors? They are not in Nigeria. The money to build infrastructure does not physically exist in the country. Even if you take all the money in the country and put it into infrastructure, it would not be enough. So, you have to get fresh money from abroad that would come in to build infrastructure to stimulate economic growth and eventually these investors get their money back in foreign currency    So far, that has really not happened. There is no private company in any serious infrastructure in Nigeria outside some ports. The power privatization attracted some private money that was mainly leveraged, and that sector is not in good shape right now.    That privatization hasn\u2019t solved anything as the government keeps spending on subsidizing the sector. So many sectors have to be opened to private capital especially foreign private equity. Not debt, but actually equity. Meaning, risk capital that might make a good return or might be lost. That is what equity is; it\u2019s not debt.    That money has to come in from abroad. There are various structures that can be used but right now, we don\u2019t seem to be making much progress in that front because, there is no evidence of any money having come in, in any material way into infrastructure, and that has to change.    Can you give an assessment of the investment climate amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and what are your predictions?    The investment climate locally cannot be good right now because we do know that there is an economic downturn driven by the COVID-19 situation. We haven\u2019t seen the Q2 GDP data from NBS, but we are quite sure it is down. We haven\u2019t also seen Q2 results of public companies, but we are quite sure it\u2019s down.    So clearly, the investment climate is not great right now. However, fixed income investors have been making very good returns, because yields have been falling and bond prices have been going up. So fixed income investors have done very well.    Equity investors in US markets have done well, and the NSE hasn\u2019t done great, but hasn\u2019t collapsed either. It might be down a bit, but it isn\u2019t down that much.    Again, bear in mind a couple of things. One is that, the oil price dropped because of COVID-19. If COVID-19 ends in one year, and oil prices are a lot higher, it does have a slightly different impact on the tone of the investment climate in Nigeria.    This economy is still hinged on the oil price. So a lot depends on where oil goes to, which is what will drive the exchange rate. Also, it depends on the political direction the country goes.    There is an election in 2023, this president is not due for re-election, so it depends on the direction that the winner of that election decides to go.    If the country decides to go on a more private capital trajectory, the investment climate would be very different from the current status quo, where it seems to be that government thinks it is the solution to a lot of things.    Because right now, that model has not generated the returns that we are looking for. The returns meaning, high GDP growth. Without high GDP growth, we can\u2019t have a great investment climate locally. Right now, we don\u2019t have high GDP growth, so a lot will depend on the political environment which is the foundation that would push forward the policies that would drive high GDP growth, and give us a good investment climate going forward.    What are your projections for UCML in the nearest future?    For us, we are going to keep building on what we have done in the past six years. Certainly on the investment banking side, we are going to be deepening our strength in debt capital market.    We are doing quite a number of things in the M&amp;A segment, we want to build on that track record also. For asset management, we are looking at building one or two investment in products and technologies to help aggregate assets with a more cost-effective model, so that we can assess a bigger market.    And we would be coming out with a number of funds also to target certain segments of the economy that are underserved. For the securities team, we are looking at expanding our offerings in securities both for fixed income and equities, and we believe there are a number of opportunities in the market for smaller operators.    We do know that there are lots of operators in this market, but clearly, there are new companies that are coming up. And we are among the new companies that are looking to dominate the market in the future.    thisdaylive</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42578837212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BF-Y4H1-F07F-84P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4244\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Libya Business Info</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 12, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0004530</classCode><className>UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>SECURITIES &amp;

Earnings season gets off to a good start. And that`s put investors in a buying mood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Health prognosis. Medicare is the fastest growing part of the health insurance market. That helped UnitedHealth easily top earning`s expectations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Beats and boosts. J&amp;J`s quarter was better than expected and its outlook strong despite all of its legal headaches.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, October 15th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and well.</p><p>Wall Street`s focus was definitely on fundamentals today. Yes, there was some positive news on trade and on the U.K.`s efforts to leave the European Union. But what really put investors in buying mood was earnings, especially solid results from banks and health care companies. And that sent the broader market higher today.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 237 points. We`re back above 27,000. Nasdaq was up 100. The S&amp;P added 29.</p><p>Bob Pisani is at the New York Stock Exchange with a look at today`s rally.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks roared higher today with the Dow up more than 300 points at its high.</p><p>Earnings, Brexit, a little bit of optimism on the China trade front all contributed to today`s gains.</p><p>First, we had earnings. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reported strong earnings, but most importantly, the consumer side was strong with good growth in loans, deposits and credit card. CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated that saying the consumer remains healthy with growth in wages and spending combined with strong balance sheets and low unemployment levels.</p><p>UnitedHealth also powered the Dow higher after a strong beat on both earnings and guidance that gave a boost to the broader healthcare sector. Also, we had positive comments from European Union negotiators on the prospects of a Brexit deal. That lifted the markets in the middle of the morning.</p><p>We`ve known that Brexit deal would be worth something to the market but it`s just been hard to quantify. Federal Reserve did specifically cite a hard no deal Brexit as a significant risk.</p><p>Finally, a little bit of warm and fuzzy feeling from China on the trade talks. \"The Global Times\" editor-in-chief said the Friday`s meeting did, in fact, represent a breakthrough, and that both sides have a strong will to achieve a deal. \"The Global Times\" is generally considered a mouthpiece for the Communist Party.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: A number of other banks reported earnings today. For Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), it was a mixed quarter. Profit fell more than expected, hit by a slowdown in deal-making while revenue topped forecasts.</p><p>Consumer banking powered Citi`s profits. The bank reported better than expected earnings, thanks to growth in its credit card unit and an increase in digital deposits.</p><p>And Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) missed third quarter profit estimates as mortgage income sank. The bank has been working to improve its image and has been operating under heavy regulatory scrutiny. Shares of all three banks finished the day higher.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Let`s turn to Bill Stone now for more analysis on these bank earnings from today. He`s chief investment officer at Avalon Investment and Advisory.</p><p>Bill, good to see you again. Welcome back.</p><p>BILL STONE, AVALON INVESTMENT &amp; ADVISORY CIO: Thanks.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Thanks to the consumer, huh? And we keep hearing how they`re helping the retailers. They`re helping the banks now as well, aren`t they?</p><p>STONE: Exactly. I mean, I think it`s exactly the thing we talk about with the overall U.S. economy, it`s really the consumer keeping things together because manufacturing is you know you arguably in a recession, seeing a lot of the similar thing on the banking side, not as much demand from the business side of the equation. But the consumer just seems to have, you know, no real cracks in it yet.</p><p>HERERA: You know, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is kind of a separate issue. They`ve had issues that they`ve been dealing with for some time. But if you put Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) aside, most of the major banks had some pretty solid results in investment banking, and also in some cases trading as well.</p><p>STONE: That`s true. I mean, you know, the investment banking was pretty good. Yes, I mean there`s specifics like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) didn`t do as much mergers and acquisitions business, but they`re still ranked number one. So, it`s more like that business just didn`t have a big quarter.</p><p>So, you`re right, they did actually have a pretty decent job on the in general for those involved in the capital markets as well.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Do you have favorites in this group right now?</p><p>STONE: You know most of its interesting, just happens to be -- we do like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) quite a bit. You know, you`re talking -- it looks very inexpensive. You know, certainly, it has very broad portfolio and then you also get a dividend of 3 percent while you`re kind of I`ll say waiting or whatever you want to say, and it looks obviously very secure.</p><p>So, I think actually a lot of these names we talked about. We do like Goldman despite the kind of transitory issues that they had in their earnings this quarter.</p><p>HERERA: Could the fly in the ointment though be the trade situation? I know the banks are domestically based so the international economy may not impact them quite as much as it would otherwise, but what about trade?</p><p>STONE: Yes, I mean, so city has more international exposure. We actually do like that as well, happens to be. But the interesting thing is you`re right. I think the more the issue is trade the global economy, if you continue to see a big slowdown. That does way further on the U.S. economy. Certainly that could be exactly the fly in the ointment.</p><p>We have some sort of recession that kicks in that`s certainly going to hurt the banks. And we think there are much better capital position, so it`s not the severity that you saw in the in the great recession, but that`s kind of the worry that I think is probably holding them back. We don`t think there`s a recession imminent. So I do think there`s some attractiveness there.</p><p>Quickly, it doesn`t help with the feds cutting interest rates right now either, does it?</p><p>It is hard part. I mean, the yield curve is very -- you know, the difference between what they you know get deposits and what they lend out is, has a small differential which is usually what they make extra money on. So, that is part of the -- you know, headwinds I guess you`d have to say for the banks as well.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Bill Stone with Avalon Investment Advisory -- again, thanks for joining us tonight, Bill.</p><p>STONE: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: A solid quarter for Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The company reported better than expected earnings and raised its full-year forecast, despite being embroiled in a number of legal fights. The quarterly results sent the stock up more than 1 percent in trading today.</p><p>Meg Tirrell has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Third quarter results that blew away Wall Street`s expectations offered investors in Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) a brief respite from an onslaught of recent legal headlines. Both sales and earnings topped estimates of analysts helped by J&amp;J`s pharmaceuticals and medical device businesses. Sales in its consumer products unit, J&amp;J smallest despite selling its best-known brands like Tylenol and Band-Aids were in line with expectations.</p><p>The health giant also raised its forecast for full-year results.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON CFO: We see great momentum for the balance of this year. We think that`s going to catapult us into 2020.</p><p>TIRRELL: Even as the stock rose, analysts noted the overhang of ongoing litigation. As of June 30th, J&amp;J; faced lawsuits from more than 100,000 plaintiffs over everything from opioids to talc powders to hip replacement systems and multiple J&amp;J drugs.</p><p>The company last week was hit with an $8 billion punitive damages verdict over its drug Risperdal, and award legal experts expect will be overturned or reduced. In August, J&amp;J; lost a case against the state of Oklahoma over its role in the opioid crisis and was ordered to pay $572 million. J&amp;J is appealing.</p><p>The company also just reached a $20 million settlement with two Ohio counties to avoid the first federal opioid trial scheduled to start next week. A major question now is whether a broader settlement can be reached among all plaintiffs and defendants involved in opioid litigation.</p><p>WOLK: Our drugs were less than 1 percent of the market share of all outstanding opioids. So, we want to make sure that`s in proportion. But where it makes sense for all stakeholders, we`ll look to have a settlement.</p><p>TIRRELL: But what about J&amp;J`s reputation as it takes on these legal battles. It`s something CFO Joe Wolk said they`re watching closely.</p><p>WOLK: If you look at the most recent, most admired list, we`re still well within the top 20. We always aspire to be number one. That`s what our employees are motivated by. That`s what they`re engaged to do.</p><p>So, we monitor this closely and I could say that we`re still -- the expectations around our company are still the same, and we`re going to continue to do that and focus there.</p><p>TIRRELL: With J&amp;J stock trailing the S&amp;P by more than 15 percentage points this year, Wall Street seems not so sure.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: By the way, we should point out that $572 million judgment that Meg mentioned against the company has just been reduced. The judge conceded this afternoon that there was a $107 million calculation error. He said, that`ll be the last time I use that calculator.</p><p>And there`s a report tonight also that they the three major drug distributors, McKesson (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) and Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) are all in talks to pay $18 billion to settle opioid litigation. J&amp;J`s also involved in the discussions to contribute additional money.</p><p>HERERA: Manufacturing activity in the New York area picked up in October as optimism over business conditions improved. New orders showed a small increase as did shipments which just recently hit its lowest level in nearly three years.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And the international monetary fund today is predicting global economic growth will slow to its weakest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. It now sees 3 percent growth overall for the global economy, 2.4 percent for the U.S. and 6.1 percent in China. According to the group, a sharper than expected slowdown in international trade is affecting manufacturing and investments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GITA GOPINATH, IMF CHIEF ECONOMIST: One factor are the rising trade barriers and the continuing geopolitical and trade tensions. But then there are a couple of other factors which is kind of country-specific factors in emerging market and developing economies, and also structural forces, which is low productivity growth, an aging demographics and advanced economy. So, these three factors are responsible for this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes, I`ve added that the outlook could darken even more if trade tensions remain unresolved.</p><p>HERERA: New reports out of the world`s second largest economy show it continues to face a number of challenges.</p><p>Eunice Yoon is in Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: More evidence of a weak Chinese economy. Producer prices fell in September by their fastest pace in three years, due to sluggish demand, as well as falling energy and raw material costs. Most analysts believe China will roll out further stimulus as early as this month. Consumer prices spiked by their quickest clip in six years, mostly because of pork.</p><p>China`s pig population is down 41 percent because of African swine fever. The pork shortage is pushing up prices of all proteins here. The foreign ministry said today that China would accelerate the purchase of U.S. agricultural products, but the state media has still barely mentioned the $50 billion purchase pledge that came out of the trade talks.</p><p>The Communist Party paper \"The Global Times\" referred to the purchase but as tens of billions of dollars and pointed out that the purchase could be fully achieved as long as the two sides continue to maintain and expand consensus. In other words, Beijing feels that the purchases are still its prime bargaining chip and will hold back, even though it needs the food.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look now at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades. We begin with shares of Lowe`s. They were upgraded to overweight from neutral at Piper Jaffray, with the analysts citing lower mortgage rates and an improving sales outlook. Price target now, $130. That stock was up one and a half percent today to $112.42.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) was upgraded to overweight from sector weight at KeyBanc. The analysts cited the retailer`s brand new CEO and the improvements in merchandising and operations that he is expected to bring. The price target now, $18. Despite that upgrade, though, the stock fell more than 2 percent today to $11.99.</p><p>And Bloomin` Brands was downgraded to hold from buy at Deutsche Bank. The analysts cited the overall lackluster casual dining industry right now. Price target, $21. That stock fell about 1 percent today to $17.97.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, when the Democratic presidential hopefuls take the debate stage tonight, the economy will be in the spotlight.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: There are reports tonight the General Motors (NYSE:GM) and the UAW are closing in on an agreement that would end the 30-day labor strike. While a final deal has not been announced, it`s being widely reported that the automaker and the union have agreed to terms on most issues. The strike has cost the automaker an estimated $2 billion.</p><p>GRIFFETH: UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) topped earnings estimates. They raise their 2019 forecast and offered a glimpse into next year as well. The largest U.S. health insurer said today, it is raising its long term earnings growth target to between 13 and 16 percent in part because of strength in its Medicare business. The results are relieved to investors that have been concerned about the increased scrutiny in Washington over health care costs. Shares of the company climbed 8 percent today, making it the best performing stock in the Dow today.</p><p>Medicare is a big business not just for UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) but for other private insurers as well, and many are expanding their offerings.</p><p>Bertha Coombs takes a look at what some are calling a hot market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Guy Penny has been on his wife`s health insurance for years, but now, he`s turning 65.</p><p>GUY PENNY, NEW MEDICARE ENROLLEE: People come out of woodwork to contact you.</p><p>COOMBS: The Sacramento hairstylist has been deluge with Medicare plan offers, he`s leaning toward a Medigap supplemental plan but isn`t sure.</p><p>PENNY: It`s a little scary when you`re wondering whether or not you`re going to the budget the best for you, you know. Because there`s so many different ones.</p><p>COOMBS: With 10,000 baby boomers a day aging into Medicare, it is becoming the fastest growing segment of the health insurance market. The Trump administration expects that Medicare Advantage plan growth could top 10 percent next year, and that is prompting insurers to expand.</p><p>CVS (NYSE:CVS) Health`s Aetna (NYSE:AET) unit is moving into 260 new markets, UnitedHealthcare will add a hundred new regions and Medicare giant Humana (NYSE:HUM) more than two dozen. The Trump administration has given insurers greater flexibility to design all-in-one Medicare advantage plans with additional benefits that go beyond traditional Medigap coverage, ranging from free gym memberships, vision and dental benefits, to help with home care.</p><p>SCOTT FLANDERS, EHEALTH CEO: There`s more alternatives and there are more benefits. So, it`s a net positive if you get into the right plan but there`s also more confusion and a little bit more stress for the senior trying to get them into the right plan.</p><p>COOMBS: For insurers, those all-in-one plans can be lucrative if they can keep members healthier and avoid costly hospital stays. That`s the goal of Medicare advantage upstarts like Oscar and Clover Health funded by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Ventures and Devoted Health backed by VC firm Andreessen and Horowitz.</p><p>GRETCHEN JACOBSON, KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION: There seems to be a lot of potential value for the venture capital companies because when you think about it, they`re investing in these insurance plans for seniors rather than investing in other types of products like biotech or any healthcare technology.</p><p>COOMBS: Democratic hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have called for banning all private insurers but an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found 56 percent of voters oppose the idea.</p><p>JACOBSON: Private plans have a very large role in the current Medicare system.</p><p>COOMBS: And boomers like Guy Penny like having options, even if it`s hard to make a choice.</p><p>PENNY: What helps out is the fact that I know next year, at this time, I could change it if I didn`t like it.</p><p>COOMBS: Medicare annual enrollment for 2020 runs through December 7th.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now for those of you looking at your Medicare coverage right now, now is the time to make decisions for next year.</p><p>Our Sharon Epperson joins us tonight with what you need to know for this Medicare open enrollment period, and how you can save some money.</p><p>Now you have reported in the past that the average couple retiring this year is expected to pay about $285,000 in health care-related costs over the time of their retirement, even if you do qualify for Medicare. So what determines how much you`re going to spend here?</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Really what determines how much you spend on health care is how healthy you are. I mean, it seems to make sense but if you have a chronic illness if you have multiple prescriptions that you must take, this is going to increase the amount you spend. So, now is the time to really figure out how much you may have to spend in retirement if you`re not already retired.</p><p>And if you are retired, what`s changed? How is your health status change from last year? That may indicate that you may want to make a different choice for your Medicare plan.</p><p>And then also, depending on how old you are, if you`re not 65, as was pointed out, you`re going to have to pay for this with a health insurance plan of your own, so you need to figure that out and your retirement income, the higher it is, the higher the premiums, keep that in mind for original Medicare in particular.</p><p>GRIFFETH: As we mentioned, this is open enrollment time, where you can make changes in your coverage and maybe your prescription drug plan as well. But what are the different Medicare options that are out there at this point?</p><p>EPPERSON: So this alphabet soup is what confuses people because there`s so many different parts to Medicare. So we`ll start with the hospital visits. That is part A, and that is free from the government in the original Medicare.</p><p>Part B is outpatient visits. You may have a monthly premium, and you will for that. And then Medicare Advantage, as Bertha described, is a managed care plan. And so you there various ones from private insurers that you can compare on medicare.gov to see which is best for you. Part D is for prescription drugs and that again is what you really need to be looking at now during open enrollment to see if there been any changes.</p><p>And if you can lower the premiums that you`re paying for that coverage, if you need some type of supplemental insurance a Medigap policy can help there. But many people are saying, rather than do that, and let me see if I can look at Medicare Advantage.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Quickly, I don`t know if there`s an answer to this. But I mean, with between the co-pays and the premiums and all in, and out-of-pocket expenses, how do you try and lower your own cost?</p><p>Well, do some of the things you were doing in your insurance plan. Look at that network, make sure it`s in network if you`re doing this Medicare advantage plan.</p><p>Also, think now about contributing to an HSA. Pre-tax money goes in, you can use it for health care expenses that may not be covered by Medicare. So that`s something to consider. If your spouse is not yet retired, you are, they can put the money in the HSA for you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Sharon Epperson, always good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>EPPERSON: Thanks.</p><p>HERERA: Blackrock`s total assets near $7 trillion. That`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The asset management firm received about $85 billion in new money in the latest quarter, as the company top Wall Street`s expectations. Blackrock saw investors shift money into its fixed income funds and cash management units. Shares were up more than 2 percent to $444.45.</p><p>Charles Schwab topped estimates, thanks to higher trading volume and growth in its asset management and administration fees. But the online broker said it`s still concerned about global trade and a soft economic outlook. Schwab rose more than 5 percent to $39.4.</p><p>Abbott Labs is buying back an additional $3 billion worth of its shares. Separately, the company said it`s teaming up with tandem diabetes care to explore new ways to improve diabetes management options. The shares rose more than two and a half percent to $81.98.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Canadian cannabis company Aphria reported mixed results. It did turn in a profit when Wall Street had been expecting a loss, but revenue came in below expectations. Aphria also reaffirmed its full-year outlook. And shares rose more than 24-1/2 percent today to $5.43.</p><p>Then after the bell tonight, United Airlines profit topped estimates but revenue fell just short. The airline experienced flight reductions to Hong Kong and to China in the latest quarter, but United was able to raise its full-year outlook. And that led to shares initially rising in after-hours trading tonight on top of the closing regular session. They were up about 1 percent to $87.88.</p><p>HERERA: Democratic presidential hopefuls take the stage in Ohio for a debate. And once again, economic issues are expected to be a major focus.</p><p>John Harwood is in Westerville covering this story for us tonight.</p><p>John, so how do we expect the two frontrunners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren to difference themselves on the economy?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, it is a new situation in the race now that Warren is a co front-runner with Joe Biden. It`s a classic center versus left matchup between these two frontrunners and it`s built largely around the fundamental changes that Elizabeth Warren wants in American capitalism -- breakup big tech, new rules for corporation, wealth taxes. I would expect her to continue to make the case that those are sensible changes.</p><p>Joe Biden`s point of view is that they`re not practical, that they go too far. But he also, of course, has other fish to fry in this debate tonight and that is to make a forceful response to President Trump over the attacks the Trump has been making on him and his son Hunter. Joe Biden will make the case that that shows that the president the United States is scared of me. I`m the best able to take him out in 2020.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Bernie Sanders is expected to be there tonight. What role is he going to play in the campaign now with his health issues and he`s -- you know, he`s been a differentiator with Elizabeth warren on the far left as well.</p><p>HARWOOD: It`s an important moment for Bernie Sanders to try to show that he`s back in the race, that he can perform with vigor and energy, 78 years old having had a heart attack.</p><p>But it`s interesting that the way he chose to contrast himself in the last few days with Warren is to say, she`s a capitalist, I am not. That may help him hold on to some of his base which has been dwindling, but I think it`s also beneficial to Warren because she can portray herself as in the middle, in between Bernie Sanders on the left and Joe Biden in the center.</p><p>HERERA: Very quickly, can any of the others breakthrough on the economic side of things on the arguments there?</p><p>HARWOOD: They`re already trying. Pete Buttigieg has got an ad up today going after Elizabeth Warren on Medicare-for-All, for the issue that Bertha Coombs raised in that piece a moment ago, that it would get rid of private insurance. Kamala Harris (NYSE:HRS) has also differentiated herself from the frontrunner by saying that even though she initially embraced Medicare- for-All, she wants to preserve a role for private insurers, too.</p><p>Look for that issue to be a way that they can make a contrast.</p><p>HERERA: John, thank you so much. John Harwood in Westerville, Ohio.</p><p>HARWOOD: You bet.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, the next chapter. A popular video game goes dark, but now we know why.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Finally, tonight, it was a gaming cliffhanger. The wildly popular video game \"Fortnite\" suddenly went black on Sunday, leaving its 250 million players around the world wondering what happened. But now, it has all been cleared up.</p><p>Here`s Josh Lipton.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: \"Fortnite\" fans can breathe a sigh of relief. Epic Games, a private company that owns the smash hit, has now formally launched chapter 2 of that game. \"Fortnite\" boasts 250 million registered players and raked in an estimated $2.4 billion in revenue last year, more than any other single title. \"Fortnite\" is free-to-play but makes money when gamers purchase digital items like weapons.</p><p>\"Fortnite\" had been down since Sunday. Players trying to enter the game simply saw this -- a blank screen with a black hole. But this was no error, analysts say. Instead, they emphasized that this was a bold marketing strategy designed to generate interest and excitement about this new version.</p><p>The decision to shut down the game cost Epic an estimated seven million dollars a day in lost revenue, but it also sparked a ton of buzz at a time when there are signs that interest could be ending. Piper Jaffray in a recent survey of teenagers found that 37 percent said they played \"Fortnite\", that`s down from 53 percent in the spring, though demand can fluctuate depending on seasonality and what other games are popular at that moment.</p><p>Still, analysts say if chapter 2 now proves popular, it could rejuvenate interests and pose a challenge to rival games like Electronic Arts` \"Apex Legends\".</p><p>\"Fortnite`s\" popularity could also slow momentum for the latest iteration of Activision`s \"Call of Duty\" which launches next week.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And before we go, here`s another look at the day`s final numbers on Wall Street. The Dow rose 237 points to close back above 27,000. The Nasdaq was up 100, and the S&amp;P 500 added 29.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening.

Earnings season  gets off to a good start.  And that`s put investors in a buying mood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Health prognosis.  Medicare  is the fastest growing part of the health insurance market.  That helped  UnitedHealth easily top earning`s expectations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Beats and boosts.  J&amp;J`s quarter was better than expected and its  outlook strong despite all of its legal headaches.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday,  October 15th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and well.</p><p>Wall Street`s focus was definitely on fundamentals today.  Yes, there was  some positive news on trade and on the U.K.`s efforts to leave the European  Union.  But what really put investors in buying mood was earnings,  especially solid results from banks and health care companies.  And that  sent the broader market higher today.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 237 points.  We`re back above  27,000.  Nasdaq was up 100.  The S&amp;P added 29.</p><p>Bob Pisani is at the New York Stock Exchange with a look at today`s rally.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks roared higher  today with the Dow up more than 300 points at its high.</p><p>Earnings, Brexit, a little bit of optimism on the China trade front all  contributed to today`s gains.</p><p>First, we had earnings.  JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reported strong earnings, but  most importantly, the consumer side was strong with good growth in loans,  deposits and credit card.  CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated that saying the  consumer remains healthy with growth in wages and spending combined with  strong balance sheets and low unemployment levels.</p><p>UnitedHealth also powered the Dow higher after a strong beat on both  earnings and guidance that gave a boost to the broader healthcare sector.   Also, we had positive comments from European Union negotiators on the  prospects of a Brexit deal.  That lifted the markets in the middle of the  morning.</p><p>We`ve known that Brexit deal would be worth something to the market but  it`s just been hard to quantify.  Federal Reserve did specifically cite a  hard no deal Brexit as a significant risk.</p><p>Finally, a little bit of warm and fuzzy feeling from China on the trade  talks.  \"The Global Times\" editor-in-chief said the Friday`s meeting did,  in fact, represent a breakthrough, and that both sides have a strong will  to achieve a deal.  \"The Global Times\" is generally considered a mouthpiece  for the Communist Party.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  A number of other banks reported earnings today.  For Goldman  Sachs (NYSE:GS), it was a mixed quarter.  Profit fell more than expected,  hit by a slowdown in deal-making while revenue topped forecasts.</p><p>Consumer banking powered Citi`s profits.  The bank reported better than  expected earnings, thanks to growth in its credit card unit and an increase  in digital deposits.</p><p>And Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) missed third quarter profit estimates as  mortgage income sank.  The bank has been working to improve its image and  has been operating under heavy regulatory scrutiny.  Shares of all three  banks finished the day higher.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Let`s turn to Bill Stone now for more analysis on these bank  earnings from today.  He`s chief investment officer at Avalon Investment  and Advisory.</p><p>Bill, good to see you again.  Welcome back.</p><p>BILL STONE, AVALON INVESTMENT &amp; ADVISORY CIO:  Thanks.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Thanks to the consumer, huh?  And we keep hearing how they`re  helping the retailers.  They`re helping the banks now as well, aren`t they?</p><p>STONE:  Exactly.  I mean, I think it`s exactly the thing we talk about with  the overall U.S. economy, it`s really the consumer keeping things together  because manufacturing is you know you arguably in a recession, seeing a lot  of the similar thing on the banking side, not as much demand from the  business side of the equation.  But the consumer just seems to have, you  know, no real cracks in it yet.</p><p>HERERA:  You know, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is kind of a separate issue.   They`ve had issues that they`ve been dealing with for some time.  But if  you put Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) aside, most of the major banks had some  pretty solid results in investment banking, and also in some cases trading  as well.</p><p>STONE:  That`s true.  I mean, you know, the investment banking was pretty  good.  Yes, I mean there`s specifics like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) didn`t do  as much mergers and acquisitions business, but they`re still ranked number  one.  So, it`s more like that business just didn`t have a big quarter.</p><p>So, you`re right, they did actually have a pretty decent job on the in  general for those involved in the capital markets as well.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Do you have favorites in this group right now?</p><p>STONE:  You know most of its interesting, just happens to be -- we do like  JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) quite a bit.  You know, you`re talking -- it looks very  inexpensive.  You know, certainly, it has very broad portfolio and then you  also get a dividend of 3 percent while you`re kind of I`ll say waiting or  whatever you want to say, and it looks obviously very secure.</p><p>So, I think actually a lot of these names we talked about.  We do like  Goldman despite the kind of transitory issues that they had in their  earnings this quarter.</p><p>HERERA:  Could the fly in the ointment though be the trade situation?  I  know the banks are domestically based so the international economy may not  impact them quite as much as it would otherwise, but what about trade?</p><p>STONE:  Yes, I mean, so city has more international exposure.  We actually  do like that as well, happens to be.  But the interesting thing is you`re  right.  I think the more the issue is trade the global economy, if you  continue to see a big slowdown.  That does way further on the U.S. economy.   Certainly that could be exactly the fly in the ointment.</p><p>We have some sort of recession that kicks in that`s certainly going to hurt  the banks.  And we think there are much better capital position, so it`s  not the severity that you saw in the in the great recession, but that`s  kind of the worry that I think is probably holding them back.  We don`t  think there`s a recession imminent.  So I do think there`s some  attractiveness there.</p><p>Quickly, it doesn`t help with the feds cutting interest rates right now  either, does it?</p><p>It is hard part.  I mean, the yield curve is very -- you know, the  difference between what they you know get deposits and what they lend out  is, has a small differential which is usually what they make extra money  on.  So, that is part of the -- you know, headwinds I guess you`d have to  say for the banks as well.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Bill Stone with Avalon Investment Advisory -- again, thanks for  joining us tonight, Bill.</p><p>STONE:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  A solid quarter for Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).  The company  reported better than expected earnings and raised its full-year forecast,  despite being embroiled in a number of legal fights.  The quarterly results  sent the stock up more than 1 percent in trading today.</p><p>Meg Tirrell has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Third quarter results  that blew away Wall Street`s expectations offered investors in Johnson &amp;  Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) a brief respite from an onslaught of recent legal  headlines.  Both sales and earnings topped estimates of analysts helped by  J&amp;J`s pharmaceuticals and medical device businesses.  Sales in its consumer  products unit, J&amp;J smallest despite selling its best-known brands like  Tylenol and Band-Aids were in line with expectations.</p><p>The health giant also raised its forecast for full-year results.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON CFO:  We see great momentum for the balance  of this year.  We think that`s going to catapult us into 2020.</p><p>TIRRELL:  Even as the stock rose, analysts noted the overhang of ongoing  litigation.  As of June 30th, J&amp;J; faced lawsuits from more than 100,000  plaintiffs over everything from opioids to talc powders to hip replacement  systems and multiple J&amp;J drugs.</p><p>The company last week was hit with an $8 billion punitive damages verdict  over its drug Risperdal, and award legal experts expect will be overturned  or reduced.  In August, J&amp;J; lost a case against the state of Oklahoma over  its role in the opioid crisis and was ordered to pay $572 million.  J&amp;J is  appealing.</p><p>The company also just reached a $20 million settlement with two Ohio  counties to avoid the first federal opioid trial scheduled to start next  week.  A major question now is whether a broader settlement can be reached  among all plaintiffs and defendants involved in opioid litigation.</p><p>WOLK:  Our drugs were less than 1 percent of the market share of all  outstanding opioids.  So, we want to make sure that`s in proportion.  But  where it makes sense for all stakeholders, we`ll look to have a settlement.</p><p>TIRRELL:  But what about J&amp;J`s reputation as it takes on these legal  battles.  It`s something CFO Joe Wolk said they`re watching closely.</p><p>WOLK:  If you look at the most recent, most admired list, we`re still well  within the top 20.  We always aspire to be number one.  That`s what our  employees are motivated by.  That`s what they`re engaged to do.</p><p>So, we monitor this closely and I could say that we`re still -- the  expectations around our company are still the same, and we`re going to  continue to do that and focus there.</p><p>TIRRELL:  With J&amp;J stock trailing the S&amp;P by more than 15 percentage points  this year, Wall Street seems not so sure.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  By the way, we should point out that $572 million judgment that  Meg mentioned against the company has just been reduced.  The judge  conceded this afternoon that there was a $107 million calculation error.   He said, that`ll be the last time I use that calculator.</p><p>And there`s a report tonight also that they the three major drug  distributors, McKesson (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) and  Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) are all in talks to pay $18 billion to settle  opioid litigation.  J&amp;J`s also involved in the discussions to contribute  additional money.</p><p>HERERA:  Manufacturing activity in the New York area picked up in October  as optimism over business conditions improved.  New orders showed a small  increase as did shipments which just recently hit its lowest level in  nearly three years.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And the international monetary fund today is predicting global  economic growth will slow to its weakest levels since the 2008 financial  crisis.  It now sees 3 percent growth overall for the global economy, 2.4  percent for the U.S. and 6.1 percent in China.  According to the group, a  sharper than expected slowdown in international trade is affecting  manufacturing and investments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GITA GOPINATH, IMF CHIEF ECONOMIST:  One factor are the rising trade  barriers and the continuing geopolitical and trade tensions.  But then  there are a couple of other factors which is kind of country-specific  factors in emerging market and developing economies, and also structural  forces, which is low productivity growth, an aging demographics and  advanced economy.  So, these three factors are responsible for this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes, I`ve added that the outlook could darken even more if trade  tensions remain unresolved.</p><p>HERERA:  New reports out of the world`s second largest economy show it  continues to face a number of challenges.</p><p>Eunice Yoon is in Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  More evidence of a  weak Chinese economy.  Producer prices fell in September by their fastest  pace in three years, due to sluggish demand, as well as falling energy and  raw material costs.  Most analysts believe China will roll out further  stimulus as early as this month.  Consumer prices spiked by their quickest  clip in six years, mostly because of pork.</p><p>China`s pig population is down 41 percent because of African swine fever.   The pork shortage is pushing up prices of all proteins here.  The foreign  ministry said today that China would accelerate the purchase of U.S.  agricultural products, but the state media has still barely mentioned the  $50 billion purchase pledge that came out of the trade talks.</p><p>The Communist Party paper \"The Global Times\" referred to the purchase but  as tens of billions of dollars and pointed out that the purchase could be  fully achieved as long as the two sides continue to maintain and expand  consensus.  In other words, Beijing feels that the purchases are still its  prime bargaining chip and will hold back, even though it needs the food.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today`s upgrades and  downgrades.  We begin with shares of Lowe`s.  They were upgraded to  overweight from neutral at Piper Jaffray, with the analysts citing lower  mortgage rates and an improving sales outlook.  Price target now, $130.   That stock was up one and a half percent today to $112.42.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) was upgraded to overweight from sector  weight at KeyBanc.  The analysts cited the retailer`s brand new CEO and the  improvements in merchandising and operations that he is expected to bring.   The price target now, $18.  Despite that upgrade, though, the stock fell  more than 2 percent today to $11.99.</p><p>And Bloomin` Brands was downgraded to hold from buy at Deutsche Bank.  The  analysts cited the overall lackluster casual dining industry right now.   Price target, $21.  That stock fell about 1 percent today to $17.97.</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, when the Democratic presidential hopefuls take the  debate stage tonight, the economy will be in the spotlight.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  There are reports tonight the General Motors (NYSE:GM) and the UAW  are closing in on an agreement that would end the 30-day labor strike.   While a final deal has not been announced, it`s being widely reported that  the automaker and the union have agreed to terms on most issues.  The  strike has cost the automaker an estimated $2 billion.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) topped earnings estimates.  They  raise their 2019 forecast and offered a glimpse into next year as well.   The largest U.S. health insurer said today, it is raising its long term  earnings growth target to between 13 and 16 percent in part because of  strength in its Medicare business.  The results are relieved to investors  that have been concerned about the increased scrutiny in Washington over  health care costs.  Shares of the company climbed 8 percent today, making  it the best performing stock in the Dow today.</p><p>Medicare is a big business not just for UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) but  for other private insurers as well, and many are expanding their offerings.</p><p>Bertha Coombs takes a look at what some are calling a hot market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Guy Penny has been  on his wife`s health insurance for years, but now, he`s turning 65.</p><p>GUY PENNY, NEW MEDICARE ENROLLEE:  People come out of woodwork to contact  you.</p><p>COOMBS:  The Sacramento hairstylist has been deluge with Medicare plan  offers, he`s leaning toward a Medigap supplemental plan but isn`t sure.</p><p>PENNY:  It`s a little scary when you`re wondering whether or not you`re  going to the budget the best for you, you know.  Because there`s so many  different ones.</p><p>COOMBS:  With 10,000 baby boomers a day aging into Medicare, it is becoming  the fastest growing segment of the health insurance market.  The Trump  administration expects that Medicare Advantage plan growth could top 10  percent next year, and that is prompting insurers to expand.</p><p>CVS (NYSE:CVS) Health`s Aetna (NYSE:AET) unit is moving into 260 new  markets, UnitedHealthcare will add a hundred new regions and Medicare giant  Humana (NYSE:HUM) more than two dozen.  The Trump administration has given  insurers greater flexibility to design all-in-one Medicare advantage plans  with additional benefits that go beyond traditional Medigap coverage,  ranging from free gym memberships, vision and dental benefits, to help with  home care.</p><p>SCOTT FLANDERS, EHEALTH CEO:  There`s more alternatives and there are more  benefits.  So, it`s a net positive if you get into the right plan but  there`s also more confusion and a little bit more stress for the senior  trying to get them into the right plan.</p><p>COOMBS:  For insurers, those all-in-one plans can be lucrative if they can  keep members healthier and avoid costly hospital stays.  That`s the goal of  Medicare advantage upstarts like Oscar and Clover Health funded by Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) Ventures and Devoted Health backed by VC firm Andreessen and  Horowitz.</p><p>GRETCHEN JACOBSON, KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION:  There seems to be a lot of  potential value for the venture capital companies because when you think  about it, they`re investing in these insurance plans for seniors rather  than investing in other types of products like biotech or any healthcare  technology.</p><p>COOMBS:  Democratic hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have  called for banning all private insurers but an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll  found 56 percent of voters oppose the idea.</p><p>JACOBSON:  Private plans have a very large role in the current Medicare  system.</p><p>COOMBS: And boomers like Guy Penny like having options, even if it`s hard  to make a choice.</p><p>PENNY:  What helps out is the fact that I know next year, at this time, I  could change it if I didn`t like it.</p><p>COOMBS:  Medicare annual enrollment for 2020 runs through December 7th.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now for those of you looking at your Medicare coverage right  now, now is the time to make decisions for next year.</p><p>Our Sharon Epperson joins us tonight with what you need to know for this  Medicare open enrollment period, and how you can save some money.</p><p>Now you have reported in the past that the average couple retiring this  year is expected to pay about $285,000 in health care-related costs over  the time of their retirement, even if you do qualify for Medicare.  So what  determines how much you`re going to spend here?</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Really what  determines how much you spend on health care is how healthy you are.  I  mean, it seems to make sense but if you have a chronic illness if you have  multiple prescriptions that you must take, this is going to increase the  amount you spend.  So, now is the time to really figure out how much you  may have to spend in retirement if you`re not already retired.</p><p>And if you are retired, what`s changed?  How is your health status change  from last year?  That may indicate that you may want to make a different  choice for your Medicare plan.</p><p>And then also, depending on how old you are, if you`re not 65, as was  pointed out, you`re going to have to pay for this with a health insurance  plan of your own, so you need to figure that out and your retirement  income, the higher it is, the higher the premiums, keep that in mind for  original Medicare in particular.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As we mentioned, this is open enrollment time, where you can  make changes in your coverage and maybe your prescription drug plan as  well.  But what are the different Medicare options that are out there at  this point?</p><p>EPPERSON:  So this alphabet soup is what confuses people because there`s so  many different parts to Medicare.  So we`ll start with the hospital visits.   That is part A, and that is free from the government in the original  Medicare.</p><p>Part B is outpatient visits.  You may have a monthly premium, and you will  for that.  And then Medicare Advantage, as Bertha described, is a managed  care plan.  And so you there various ones from private insurers that you  can compare on medicare.gov to see which is best for you.  Part D is for  prescription drugs and that again is what you really need to be looking at  now during open enrollment to see if there been any changes.</p><p>And if you can lower the premiums that you`re paying for that coverage, if  you need some type of supplemental insurance a Medigap policy can help  there.  But many people are saying, rather than do that, and let me see if  I can look at Medicare Advantage.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Quickly, I don`t know if there`s an answer to this.  But I mean,  with between the co-pays and the premiums and all in, and out-of-pocket  expenses, how do you try and lower your own cost?</p><p>Well, do some of the things you were doing in your insurance plan.  Look at  that network, make sure it`s in network if you`re doing this Medicare  advantage plan.</p><p>Also, think now about contributing to an HSA.  Pre-tax money goes in, you  can use it for health care expenses that may not be covered by Medicare.   So that`s something to consider.  If your spouse is not yet retired, you  are, they can put the money in the HSA for you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Sharon Epperson, always good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p>EPPERSON:  Thanks.</p><p>HERERA:  Blackrock`s total assets near $7 trillion.  That`s where we begin  tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The asset management firm received about $85 billion in new money in the  latest quarter, as the company top Wall Street`s expectations.  Blackrock  saw investors shift money into its fixed income funds and cash management  units.  Shares were up more than 2 percent to $444.45.</p><p>Charles Schwab topped estimates, thanks to higher trading volume and growth  in its asset management and administration fees.  But the online broker  said it`s still concerned about global trade and a soft economic outlook.   Schwab rose more than 5 percent to $39.4.</p><p>Abbott Labs is buying back an additional $3 billion worth of its shares.  Separately, the company said it`s teaming up with tandem diabetes care to  explore new ways to improve diabetes management options.  The shares rose  more than two and a half percent to $81.98.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Canadian cannabis company Aphria reported mixed results.  It did  turn in a profit when Wall Street had been expecting a loss, but revenue  came in below expectations.  Aphria also reaffirmed its full-year outlook.   And shares rose more than 24-1/2 percent today to $5.43.</p><p>Then after the bell tonight, United Airlines profit topped estimates but  revenue fell just short.  The airline experienced flight reductions to Hong  Kong and to China in the latest quarter, but United was able to raise its  full-year outlook.  And that led to shares initially rising in after-hours  trading tonight on top of the closing regular session.  They were up about  1 percent to $87.88.</p><p>HERERA:  Democratic presidential hopefuls take the stage in Ohio for a  debate.  And once again, economic issues are expected to be a major focus.</p><p>John Harwood is in Westerville covering this story for us tonight.</p><p>John, so how do we expect the two frontrunners Joe Biden and Elizabeth  Warren to difference themselves on the economy?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it is a new  situation in the race now that Warren is a co front-runner with Joe Biden.   It`s a classic center versus left matchup between these two frontrunners  and it`s built largely around the fundamental changes that Elizabeth Warren  wants in American capitalism -- breakup big tech, new rules for  corporation, wealth taxes.  I would expect her to continue to make the case  that those are sensible changes.</p><p>Joe Biden`s point of view is that they`re not practical, that they go too  far.  But he also, of course, has other fish to fry in this debate tonight  and that is to make a forceful response to President Trump over the attacks  the Trump has been making on him and his son Hunter.  Joe Biden will make  the case that that shows that the president the United States is scared of  me.  I`m the best able to take him out in 2020.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Bernie Sanders is expected to be there tonight.  What role is he  going to play in the campaign now with his health issues and he`s -- you  know, he`s been a differentiator with Elizabeth warren on the far left as  well.</p><p>HARWOOD:  It`s an important moment for Bernie Sanders to try to show that  he`s back in the race, that he can perform with vigor and energy, 78 years  old having had a heart attack.</p><p>But it`s interesting that the way he chose to contrast himself in the last  few days with Warren is to say, she`s a capitalist, I am not.  That may  help him hold on to some of his base which has been dwindling, but I think  it`s also beneficial to Warren because she can portray herself as in the  middle, in between Bernie Sanders on the left and Joe Biden in the center.</p><p>HERERA:  Very quickly, can any of the others breakthrough on the economic  side of things on the arguments there?</p><p>HARWOOD:  They`re already trying.  Pete Buttigieg has got an ad up today  going after Elizabeth Warren on Medicare-for-All, for the issue that Bertha  Coombs raised in that piece a moment ago, that it would get rid of private  insurance.  Kamala Harris (NYSE:HRS) has also differentiated herself from  the frontrunner by saying that even though she initially embraced Medicare- for-All, she wants to preserve a role for private insurers, too.</p><p>Look for that issue to be a way that they can make a contrast.</p><p>HERERA:  John, thank you so much.  John Harwood in Westerville, Ohio.</p><p>HARWOOD:  You bet.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, the next chapter.  A popular video game goes  dark, but now we know why.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Finally, tonight, it was a gaming cliffhanger.  The wildly  popular video game \"Fortnite\" suddenly went black on Sunday, leaving its  250 million players around the world wondering what happened.  But now, it  has all been cleared up.</p><p>Here`s Josh Lipton.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  \"Fortnite\" fans can  breathe a sigh of relief.  Epic Games, a private company that owns the  smash hit, has now formally launched chapter 2 of that game.  \"Fortnite\"  boasts 250 million registered players and raked in an estimated $2.4  billion in revenue last year, more than any other single title.  \"Fortnite\"  is free-to-play but makes money when gamers purchase digital items like  weapons.</p><p>\"Fortnite\" had been down since Sunday.  Players trying to enter the game  simply saw this -- a blank screen with a black hole.  But this was no  error, analysts say.  Instead, they emphasized that this was a bold  marketing strategy designed to generate interest and excitement about this  new version.</p><p>The decision to shut down the game cost Epic an estimated seven million  dollars a day in lost revenue, but it also sparked a ton of buzz at a time  when there are signs that interest could be ending.  Piper Jaffray in a  recent survey of teenagers found that 37 percent said they played  \"Fortnite\", that`s down from 53 percent in the spring, though demand can  fluctuate depending on seasonality and what other games are popular at that  moment.</p><p>Still, analysts say if chapter 2 now proves popular, it could rejuvenate  interests and pose a challenge to rival games like Electronic Arts` \"Apex  Legends\".</p><p>\"Fortnite`s\" popularity could also slow momentum for the latest iteration  of Activision`s \"Call of Duty\" which launches next week.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And before we go, here`s another look at the day`s final numbers  on Wall Street.  The Dow rose 237 points to close back above 27,000.  The  Nasdaq was up 100, and the S&amp;P 500 added 29.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks  for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.

So says a key report on reforming financial  regulation.  Its co-author William Donaldson says a systemic risk regulator  is needed now and it shouldn`t be the Federal reserve. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  JAMES ANGEL, FINANCE PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: They were  buying a corpse when they thought they were buying a baby. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  He`s talking about  scams touting money making opportunities in the worthless shares of old GM.   Coming up, an investor alert. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB:  Tonight`s \"Street Critique\" guest says Wal-Mart`s not the  only retailer cashing in on the recession.  He`s Patrick O`Hare, chief  market analyst at briefing.com. </p><p>  YASTINE:  Then, it looks like more people are paying their credit  cards on time.  American Express and Capital One both report delinquencies  are down.  The news helped stocks surge as the Dow added over 250 points. </p><p>  GHARIB:  I`m Susie Gharib. </p><p>  YASTINE:  And I`m Jeff Yastine.  Paul Kangas is off tonight. This is  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, July 15. </p><p>  YASTINE:  Good evening everyone.   We begin tonight with a developing  story. The struggling commercial lender CIT Group says talks with the  government for a possible financial bailout have ended. CIT says there is  quote, no appreciable likelihood of additional government support over the  near term, end quote. That means no money to help the cash-strapped firm.  CIT is now evaluating alternatives.  It is one of the nation`s largest  small business lenders serving hundreds of thousands of firms.  It has been  on the verge of bankruptcy for days. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Harsh criticism today of President Obama`s plan to make the  Federal Reserve the super regulator of the U.S. financial system.  An  institutional investors group led by two former heads of the Securities and  Exchange Commission says that won`t work.  They say the central bank should  not get the job of preventing systemic risk in the financial system.  That  task is the centerpiece of the president`s plan to restructure how banks  and other firms are regulated to prevent another financial collapse. </p><p>  Arthur Levitt and William Donaldson`s criticism of the Fed was blunt.   Their report compiled by the Investors` Working Group said quote, the Fed`s  credibility has been tarnished by the easy credit policies it pursued and  the lax regulatory oversight that let institutions ratchet higher their  balance sheet leverage and amass huge concentrations of risky complex  securitized products. Instead, they are recommending the creation of an  independent oversight board to monitor risk management.  That so-called  systemic risk oversight board would be appointed by the president and  approved by Congress with no affiliation to government agencies.  </p><p>       The task force is also recommending that hedge funds and private  equity firms be required to register with the SEC and be subject to  oversight. Over the counter derivatives, like credit default swaps, would  trade on regulated exchanges and be subject to strict government  regulation.  And Congress should create a new agency to regulate consumer  financial products, including mortgages. </p><p>  I sat down with William Donaldson earlier today and asked him why he`s  opposed to the Fed taking on the job of systemic risk regulator. </p><p>        WILLIAM DONALDSON, CHAIRMAN, DONALDSON ENTERPRISES:  We feel that  the -- basically the Federal Reserve has got its hands full in terms of  monetary policy and so forth. We have felt that an independent group that  is not coming out of any one of the existing agencies, independent group  with great strength in terms of the chairmanship, strength in terms of its  commissioners and board members and particularly strong staff with the  mandate and the authority to go anywhere they want, it is a way of really  getting at the systemic risk problem. </p><p>  GHARIB:  But you`re proposing this oversight board and Treasury  Secretary Geithner has said you can`t put out a fire with a committee. </p><p>DONALDSON:  The type of editing we`re talking about here is a small  group that by appointment and the people appointed to it have different  dimensions of experience and so forth and has a strong chairman  </p><p>  GHARIB:  You also proposed that hedge funds and private equity funds  be required to register with the SEC.  Now, Bernie Madoff`s fund was also  registered with the SEC and he still cheated thousands of investors, so why  would this work? </p><p>DONALDSON:  Bernie Madoff didn`t register. Let me make that clear. The  thing that was registered was a different business so that this business,  his other business that was such a fraud was not registered. Nobody knew  about it.  It only seems logical that if funds are put together whether you  call them hedge funds or whatever, that there should be some authority that  has the right to go in and look at the procedures within that fund, look at  things such as how they price  their securities, what conflicts of interest  they have, et cetera, et cetera. </p><p>  GHARIB:  I`m sure you`ve heard it said that we really don`t need new  regulation and new structures. We just need smart regulators who can  enforce the rules that we already have. What are your thoughts on that? </p><p>DONALDSON:  There are a number of rules and regulations we don`t have.   I mean the whole derivative area that has gotten us in so much trouble has  no rules and regulations and no jurisdictional oversight from CFTC or the  SEC. So I think that clearly we need effective regulators and clearly we  need -- we need people who are trained and again this is a problem and a  challenge and an opportunity to bring people into the regulatory agencies  that are trained and know what they`re talking about and eager to work  through that agency. </p><p>  GHARIB: What`s your analysis of the Obama reform plan?  Is it the  right solution to reform the system? </p><p>DONALDSON:  We say that it`s a very good start, a good start but we`re  taking things a little bit further and we are also counseling that the  whole systemic part of this and some of the conflicts of interest that are  going require more study and we should not move too swiftly. </p><p>  GHARIB:  So what`s the one take away message you would like the Obama  administration to take from your report? </p><p>DONALDSON:  I hope the administration will take a good hard look at  some of these areas we`ve  pointed out and take and see if they want to add  to their proposal.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  I guess what it boils down to is what investors care about  and will these reforms ultimately spot risks in the future and will they be  able to prevent a Bernie Madoff situation from happening again.  What are  your thoughts on that? </p><p>DONALDSON:  There`s always going to be in a society as big as ours and  a global and financial investment world, there are going to be people who  are going to come up with schemes and so forth and some of them are going  to be pretty devious I`m sure.  So can you say that a Madoff kind of thing  would never happen again with proper regulation, I don`t think you can say  that.  I think the best you can do is to address the causes of this  situation which the congressional committee is taking this on is going to  do and then to do the best you can. </p><p>  GHARIB: Chairman Donaldson, it`s a pleasure talking to you. Thank you. </p><p>DONALDSON:  Thanks. </p><p>  YASTINE:  While the investors` working group made recommendations  aimed at preventing another financial crisis, Congress today named a panel  to investigate the crisis.  Former California state Treasurer Phil  Angelides will lead the 10 member bipartisan group.  Congress called for  the probe into the worst meltdown since the great depression earlier this  year.  The panel will have just over a year to get to the bottom of things.   It has to report back to Congress by December 15 of next year. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is defending his  actions during the financial crisis.  Tomorrow he will testify on Capitol  Hill about Bank of America`s controversial acquisition of Merrill Lynch.   Paulson released today his prepared remarks, saying Bank of America had no  legal basis to nix the Merrill deal and doing so would have shown a quote,  colossal lack of judgment. Paulson also says it was appropriate for him to  warn BOA`s CEO Ken Lewis that the bank`s management could be ousted if it  rejected the Merrill purchase. </p><p>  YASTINE: Investors viewed today as a colossal buying opportunity,  after Intel`s better than expected results last night.  The Dow opened  nearly 100 points higher at the bell.  Intel shares leapt 8 percent, giving  the Dow a 180 point gain by noontime.  Adding to the bullishness, credit  card issuers like American Express say they`re now seeing fewer defaults  and delinquencies.  That helped the financials and added more fuel to  today`s rocket ride higher.  The Dow rising 256.72, closing at 8,616.21.   The NASDAQ adding 63 points to 1,862.90 and the S&amp;P 500 up 26.84 to 932.68.   In the bond market, the 10-year note falling 1 4/32 to 96 and the yield at  3.61 percent. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Shares of the old General Motors lost half their value today  as regulators lifted a trading ban on the penny stock.  Trading was halted  Friday after some investors confused the new GM that emerged from  bankruptcy with the old GM stock that remains tangled up in court.  To be  clear, the new GM isn`t publicly traded now and most of the company is  owned by the U.S. government.  But what about those old GM shares?  As  Darren Gersh explains, they`re still virtually worthless. </p><p>       DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It was stunning  news. Last Friday, a reborn General Motors peeled out of bankruptcy far  sooner than anyone thought and shares in GM jumped on the news.  The only  problem is, there are no shares in this new GM. </p><p>   JAMES ANGEL, FINANCE PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY:  They were  buying a corpse when they thought they were buying a baby. </p><p>  GERSH:  Finance professor James Angel said many would-be investors  thought they were buying the new, post-bankruptcy GM, when in fact, they  were buying GM.`s cast off parts -- the assets that are still languishing  in bankruptcy court and might be stuck there for years. </p><p>  ANGEL:  Many of the online news wires basically said General Motors,  GMGMQ today emerged from bankruptcy.  So many people thought, ah ha! I can  buy stock in the new company now, but it wasn`t the new company they were  buying.  It was the corpse of the old company. </p><p>  GERSH: When GM went bankrupt, its old stock got a new trading symbol - - GMGMQ. That confused some investors so regulators have given the old  company a new name -- Motors Liquidation Company.  The financial industry  regulatory authority`s John Gannon wants everyone to know buying stock in  Motors Liquidation or any bankrupt company usually means you are buying a  lemon. </p><p>   JOHN GANNON, FINRA OFFICE OF INVESTOR EDUCATION: I think we took  action when we could. Unfortunately, the Federal securities laws don`t  allow us to determine whether or not a bankrupt stock should be in the  market.</p><p>  GERSH:  Regulators did not halt trading in the old GM`s shares until  just after 2:00 p.m. last Friday -- too late Professor Angel says.  But  Gannon says securities law requires them to wait for the kind of unusual  trading that took place on Friday. </p><p>   GANNON:  People who think that if they buy the old stock, when the  company emerges from bankruptcy, they are all of a sudden going to make a  big return, are wrong. What is probably going to happen is the stock is  going to get canceled. Their investment`s going to be worthless and there  may be new stock issued, but they`re not going to have participation in  that new company. </p><p>  GERSH:  The new GM plans to issue new shares next year.  Shares in  Motors Liquidation now cost about as much as a newspaper.  And regulators  warn the stock will probably be worth nothing by the time the bankruptcy  court finishes its work.  Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT,  Washington. </p><p>  YASTINE: Municipal debt issuers could soon have to dot their I`s and  cross their T`s in public.  The SEC wants the nearly $3 trillion muni  market to have the same disclosure rules as publicly traded companies.  The  agency wants states and counties to be up front about things like  bankruptcies so investors can make better decisions.  And it wants those  disclosures quickly within 10 days.  Right now, muni debt issuers have some  gray areas to work with disclosing in what`s called a quote, timely manner. </p><p>  And now let`s take a look at our stocks in the news tonight.   </p><p>        Citigroup (C) topping our list today, gaining $0.25. The financials  all are running higher.  Credit card issuers say they`re seeing fewer  delinquencies.  Citigroup shares have rallied 20 percent or more in recent  days.</p><p>        Bank of America (BAC) again another financial, adding $0.51.</p><p>       Wells Fargo (WFC) up $0.90.  A Federal judge upheld their buyout of  Wachovia last year.  Citigroup had claimed Wachovia didn`t have the  authority to accept Wells Fargo`s rival bid.</p><p>       JPMorgan Chase (JPM) moving up $1.56.  Their quarterly results due  out tomorrow.</p><p>       And General Electric (GE) picking up $0.60.</p><p>   Ford Motor Co (F) rising $0.21.</p><p>       Then Vale (VALE) jumping $1.70, up in sympathy with today`s broad  rally.</p><p>       And ExxonMobil (XOM) surged more than $2.  Oil prices rose $2 to  nearly $62 a barrel.  Exxon shares going along for the ride and analysts  expect Exxon to report a 50 percent drop in profits compared to a year ago.   It reports results on July 30th.</p><p>       Pfizer (PFE) adding $0.12 to its gains.  </p><p>       CIT Group (CIT) rising a fraction before being halted and you heard  the news, no support from the Federal government, not big enough to save.</p><p>   And a quick snapshot of some of the other Dow standouts today.  American Express (AXP) again seeing fewer charge losses with bad credit  card loans, the first time that`s happened to them in a year.  The stock  rising $2.76.</p><p>       Caterpillar (CAT), IBM (IBM), United Technologies (UTX) all doing  very well today.</p><p>       Capital One Financial (COF) rising $2.73. Like American Express,  fewer card holders delinquent in their accounts. Some analysts don`t see  that trend sustainable though.</p><p>       Gannett Co (GCI) rising over $1. The newspaper chain aggressively  cutting costs.  That allowed them to beat analyst estimates. They see  better results in the second half of the year.</p><p>       Abbott Labs (ABT) falling $1.21.  Abbott cautious about forecasting  improved results.  Investors did not like that.  Second quarter profits  were in line with expectations.</p><p>       Yum! Brands (YUM) losing over $2.  The fast food operator beat  earnings estimates, but investors focused on a 1 percent decline in same  store sales and the company hoping that a Taco Bell expansion overseas will  boost bottom line results.</p><p>Bemis Company (BMS) back for a gain of $1.45. The packaging (ph) firm  telling investors it will report better than expected results thanks to a  drop in raw material costs.  Those second quarter results due out on  Friday.</p><p>       Shares in 3par (PAR) sank $1.77.  The data storage provider forecast  a first quarter loss due to sluggish demand for server systems.</p><p>       Now let`s we move onto the NASDAQ, Intel (INTC) rising $1.22.  Their  results now (INAUDIBLE), last night of course setting the stage for today`s  big tech rally.</p><p>       Apple (AAPL) shares jumped $4.61. That`s the highest price for Apple  shares since September of last year.  Also Apple upgraded its iTunes  service to block people who are trying to download music with their Palm  Pre smart phone.  Apple didn`t like that too much.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) rising $1.08.  A Citigroup analyst seeing Cisco  shares doing well in the early phase of an economic recovery.</p><p>       Google (GOOG) soaring over $13.  New numbers say Google still  dominates Internet search with 65 percent of all U.S. users using them.</p><p>       Microsoft (MSFT) climbing $1.01.  Their new Bing search product  getting good reviews, grabbing more than 8 percent of all Internet search  attempts.</p><p>   Research in Motion (RIMM) rising nearly $4.  Their Blackberry Truer  (ph) model appears to be a big hit selling well in Verizon stores.</p><p>       Baidu (BIDU) surging over $16.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM) jumping $1.41.</p><p>       Dell (DELL) advanced $0.35.</p><p>       Oracle (ORCL) up $0.88.</p><p>   Juniper Networks (JNPR) up $1.77.  UBS expects Juniper to report  results that match or perhaps slightly exceed Wall Street targets.</p><p>       And then there`s Targacept (TRGT) surging $4.19.  Their depression  drug did well in clinical trials and up a very nice gain with today`s  trading.</p><p>  And finally, JB Hunt Transportation (JBHT) plunged nearly $3, ouch.   Second quarter profits fell 52 percent because of the recession. On the  other  hand, their CEO said he`s seeing gradual improvement in demand for freight  hauling after three years of softness.</p><p>  Tonight`s \"Street Critique\" guest says it`s still too early to get  excited about an economic recovery.  He`s Patrick O`Hare, chief market  analyst at briefing.com where he writes the bargain hunting column.  Pat  welcome back to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. </p><p>  PATRICK O`HARE, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, BRIEFING.COM:  Hi, Jeff, thank  you. </p><p>  YASTINE:  First give us your sense of the markets today, the Dow up  250 plus.  The NASDAQ gaining 63.</p><p>  O`HARE:  Earlier in the week the S&amp;P was down four straight weeks or  about 7 percent so we think the market got some of its earnings-related  angst out of the way ahead of the actual reporting period. So what we  witnessed we believe was more of a relief trade at work over the fact that  earnings were coming in better than feared and Intel specifically more than  appeased the market`s concerns with its second quarter report and guidance.   Yet when you stop to consider at the midpoint of its third quarter revenue  guidance, it`s still 17 percent below the year ago period.  It`s clear that  Intel is still not operating in a normal environment ands and that`s a bit  daunting to us given that we`re 18 months into this recession.  So we  wouldn`t get too carried away with what we`re seeing so far. </p><p>  YASTINE:  In other words, still be patient if you`re somebody who`s  looking to try to get money into the markets.   You got to wait around a  bit. </p><p>  O`HARE:  Given the run we`ve had off the March lows, yes, we would  agree with that. </p><p>  YASTINE:  You write the bargain hunting column for briefing.com. Give  us your sense, what`s your thoughts here on how you define a bargain. </p><p>  O`HARE:  To start essentially from a top-down perspective, I`m looking  at the broader economy and based on where we believe the broader economy is  headed, we then go down in specific sectors and to industry groups.   Specifically one of the bigger value-oriented metrics in mind is the price  to earnings growth ratio, which is the P/E multiple divided by the growth  rate. </p><p>  YASTINE:  What`s your thought here as far as if you had to pick one  bargain, what would it be? </p><p>  O`HARE:  Sure.  Well given the top-down view here and our outlook that  isn`t quite as     rosy as the market`s trading on Wednesday suggests it should be, we look to  the deep value-oriented discounter, Dollar Tree Stores.   The symbol is  (DLTR) has done well very well through this recession period and we think  the unemployment rate projected to hit double digits over the very near  future here. We think it`s in a good position to continue to benefit from  the trade-down effect given that the consumer remains pinched by still  depressed asset prices and very limited wage growth. </p><p>  YASTINE:   The stock has had a tremendous run in recent months and  indeed over the past year or so.  Do you think there`s still room for the  stock to go further given some time for these gains to digest? </p><p>  O`HARE:  Sure.  It`s probably going to move with the ebb and flow of  the market so in other words, when you get a good up day here that hinged  on favorable prospects for the economic recovery in the market and the  stock is likely to under perform and vice versa when that view changes. The  stock because it has had a good  run probably going to settle down here a  little bit, but ultimately given where we think the  economy is headed in  the second half of the year and beyond, we still like its prospects here  for the long-term investor. </p><p>  YASTINE:  Briefly, I saw something of the CEO selling a big chunk of  stock.  Is that something to be concerned about?</p><p>  O`HARE:  Not really.  It`s prudent given the run that the stock has  had, he`s going to certainly take some money off the table and we won`t  fault him for doing that.  Not a lot of other insiders selling on top of  that.  So we`re comfortable with that happening right now. </p><p>  YASTINE: And Pat, any disclosures to make for us regarding Dollar  Tree? </p><p>  O`HARE:  No, I do not own stock at this time. </p><p>  YASTINE: Pat, welcome, thank you for coming back on to the program. </p><p>  O`HARE:  Thank you, Jeff. </p><p>  YASTINE:  Our guest, Pat O`Hare of briefing.com. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Tomorrow, we`ll see if investors go ga-ga for Google`s latest  earnings.  We`ll analyze the numbers and the outlook. </p><p>  A former Credit Suisse broker turned fugitive has been captured.   Julian Tzolov was picked up in Spain today, after going missing in June.   Tomorrow, a hearing is set to determine what impact the capture will have  on his upcoming trial.  It`s set to begin next week.  Tzolov is charged  with fraud and conspiracy for buying auction rate securities when his  clients thought they were purchasing Federally-backed student loans. </p><p>  YASTINE:  Cox Communications is sending the travel channel on a trip  to a new owner. Reuters is reporting an auction for the cable channel is  expected to begin in the next few days. Possible bidders include Scripps  Networks Interactive and Time Warner.  The travel channel is valued at up  to a billion dollars.  Cox bought it in 2007. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Here`s a look at what`s happening tomorrow.  Weekly jobless  claims are out and the National Association of Home Builders releases its  July survey.  Also, quarterly results from Harley-Davidson, IBM, JPMorgan,  Marriott and Nokia. </p><p>  Also tomorrow, Wal- Mart will unveil a new ratings system, but this  one isn`t for movies or music.  Instead, it`s designed to help shoppers  evaluate the social and environmental impact of the products they purchase.   But the sustainability ratings won`t be in place for a while.  First, Wal- Mart will send questionnaires to thousands of its suppliers asking about  water used and carbon-dioxide emissions created in the making of their  products.  The effort will be rolled out in steps over the next five years  and Wal-Mart hopes other retailers will get on board. </p><p>  YASTINE:  Recapping today`s market action, shares rally on Intel`s  outlook and a drop in credit card delinquencies.  The Dow gained 257  points.  The NASDAQ gained 63.

So says a key report on reforming financial regulation. Its co-author William Donaldson says a systemic risk regulator is needed now and it shouldn`t be the Federal reserve.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAMES ANGEL, FINANCE PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: They were buying a corpse when they thought they were buying a baby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: He`s talking about scams touting money making opportunities in the worthless shares of old GM. Coming up, an investor alert.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Tonight`s \"Street Critique\" guest says Wal-Mart`s not the only retailer cashing in on the recession. He`s Patrick O`Hare, chief market analyst at briefing.com.</p><p>YASTINE: Then, it looks like more people are paying their credit cards on time. American Express and Capital One both report delinquencies are down. The news helped stocks surge as the Dow added over 250 points.</p><p>GHARIB: I`m Susie Gharib.</p><p>YASTINE: And I`m Jeff Yastine. Paul Kangas is off tonight. This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, July 15.</p><p>YASTINE: Good evening everyone. We begin tonight with a developing story. The struggling commercial lender CIT Group says talks with the government for a possible financial bailout have ended. CIT says there is quote, no appreciable likelihood of additional government support over the near term, end quote. That means no money to help the cash-strapped firm. CIT is now evaluating alternatives. It is one of the nation`s largest small business lenders serving hundreds of thousands of firms. It has been on the verge of bankruptcy for days.</p><p>GHARIB: Harsh criticism today of President Obama`s plan to make the Federal Reserve the super regulator of the U.S. financial system. An institutional investors group led by two former heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission says that won`t work. They say the central bank should not get the job of preventing systemic risk in the financial system. That task is the centerpiece of the president`s plan to restructure how banks and other firms are regulated to prevent another financial collapse.</p><p>Arthur Levitt and William Donaldson`s criticism of the Fed was blunt. Their report compiled by the Investors` Working Group said quote, the Fed`s credibility has been tarnished by the easy credit policies it pursued and the lax regulatory oversight that let institutions ratchet higher their balance sheet leverage and amass huge concentrations of risky complex securitized products. Instead, they are recommending the creation of an independent oversight board to monitor risk management. That so-called systemic risk oversight board would be appointed by the president and approved by Congress with no affiliation to government agencies.</p><p>The task force is also recommending that hedge funds and private equity firms be required to register with the SEC and be subject to oversight. Over the counter derivatives, like credit default swaps, would trade on regulated exchanges and be subject to strict government regulation. And Congress should create a new agency to regulate consumer financial products, including mortgages.</p><p>I sat down with William Donaldson earlier today and asked him why he`s opposed to the Fed taking on the job of systemic risk regulator.</p><p>WILLIAM DONALDSON, CHAIRMAN, DONALDSON ENTERPRISES: We feel that the -- basically the Federal Reserve has got its hands full in terms of monetary policy and so forth. We have felt that an independent group that is not coming out of any one of the existing agencies, independent group with great strength in terms of the chairmanship, strength in terms of its commissioners and board members and particularly strong staff with the mandate and the authority to go anywhere they want, it is a way of really getting at the systemic risk problem.</p><p>GHARIB: But you`re proposing this oversight board and Treasury Secretary Geithner has said you can`t put out a fire with a committee.</p><p>DONALDSON: The type of editing we`re talking about here is a small group that by appointment and the people appointed to it have different dimensions of experience and so forth and has a strong chairman</p><p>GHARIB: You also proposed that hedge funds and private equity funds be required to register with the SEC. Now, Bernie Madoff`s fund was also registered with the SEC and he still cheated thousands of investors, so why would this work?</p><p>DONALDSON: Bernie Madoff didn`t register. Let me make that clear. The thing that was registered was a different business so that this business, his other business that was such a fraud was not registered. Nobody knew about it. It only seems logical that if funds are put together whether you call them hedge funds or whatever, that there should be some authority that has the right to go in and look at the procedures within that fund, look at things such as how they price their securities, what conflicts of interest they have, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>GHARIB: I`m sure you`ve heard it said that we really don`t need new regulation and new structures. We just need smart regulators who can enforce the rules that we already have. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>DONALDSON: There are a number of rules and regulations we don`t have. I mean the whole derivative area that has gotten us in so much trouble has no rules and regulations and no jurisdictional oversight from CFTC or the SEC. So I think that clearly we need effective regulators and clearly we need -- we need people who are trained and again this is a problem and a challenge and an opportunity to bring people into the regulatory agencies that are trained and know what they`re talking about and eager to work through that agency.</p><p>GHARIB: What`s your analysis of the Obama reform plan? Is it the right solution to reform the system?</p><p>DONALDSON: We say that it`s a very good start, a good start but we`re taking things a little bit further and we are also counseling that the whole systemic part of this and some of the conflicts of interest that are going require more study and we should not move too swiftly.</p><p>GHARIB: So what`s the one take away message you would like the Obama administration to take from your report?</p><p>DONALDSON: I hope the administration will take a good hard look at some of these areas we`ve pointed out and take and see if they want to add to their proposal.</p><p>GHARIB: I guess what it boils down to is what investors care about and will these reforms ultimately spot risks in the future and will they be able to prevent a Bernie Madoff situation from happening again. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>DONALDSON: There`s always going to be in a society as big as ours and a global and financial investment world, there are going to be people who are going to come up with schemes and so forth and some of them are going to be pretty devious I`m sure. So can you say that a Madoff kind of thing would never happen again with proper regulation, I don`t think you can say that. I think the best you can do is to address the causes of this situation which the congressional committee is taking this on is going to do and then to do the best you can.</p><p>GHARIB: Chairman Donaldson, it`s a pleasure talking to you. Thank you.</p><p>DONALDSON: Thanks.</p><p>YASTINE: While the investors` working group made recommendations aimed at preventing another financial crisis, Congress today named a panel to investigate the crisis. Former California state Treasurer Phil Angelides will lead the 10 member bipartisan group. Congress called for the probe into the worst meltdown since the great depression earlier this year. The panel will have just over a year to get to the bottom of things. It has to report back to Congress by December 15 of next year.</p><p>GHARIB: Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is defending his actions during the financial crisis. Tomorrow he will testify on Capitol Hill about Bank of America`s controversial acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Paulson released today his prepared remarks, saying Bank of America had no legal basis to nix the Merrill deal and doing so would have shown a quote, colossal lack of judgment. Paulson also says it was appropriate for him to warn BOA`s CEO Ken Lewis that the bank`s management could be ousted if it rejected the Merrill purchase.</p><p>YASTINE: Investors viewed today as a colossal buying opportunity, after Intel`s better than expected results last night. The Dow opened nearly 100 points higher at the bell. Intel shares leapt 8 percent, giving the Dow a 180 point gain by noontime. Adding to the bullishness, credit card issuers like American Express say they`re now seeing fewer defaults and delinquencies. That helped the financials and added more fuel to today`s rocket ride higher. The Dow rising 256.72, closing at 8,616.21. The NASDAQ adding 63 points to 1,862.90 and the S&amp;P 500 up 26.84 to 932.68. In the bond market, the 10-year note falling 1 4/32 to 96 and the yield at 3.61 percent.</p><p>GHARIB: Shares of the old General Motors lost half their value today as regulators lifted a trading ban on the penny stock. Trading was halted Friday after some investors confused the new GM that emerged from bankruptcy with the old GM stock that remains tangled up in court. To be clear, the new GM isn`t publicly traded now and most of the company is owned by the U.S. government. But what about those old GM shares? As Darren Gersh explains, they`re still virtually worthless.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It was stunning news. Last Friday, a reborn General Motors peeled out of bankruptcy far sooner than anyone thought and shares in GM jumped on the news. The only problem is, there are no shares in this new GM.</p><p>JAMES ANGEL, FINANCE PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: They were buying a corpse when they thought they were buying a baby.</p><p>GERSH: Finance professor James Angel said many would-be investors thought they were buying the new, post-bankruptcy GM, when in fact, they were buying GM.`s cast off parts -- the assets that are still languishing in bankruptcy court and might be stuck there for years.</p><p>ANGEL: Many of the online news wires basically said General Motors, GMGMQ today emerged from bankruptcy. So many people thought, ah ha! I can buy stock in the new company now, but it wasn`t the new company they were buying. It was the corpse of the old company.</p><p>GERSH: When GM went bankrupt, its old stock got a new trading symbol - - GMGMQ. That confused some investors so regulators have given the old company a new name -- Motors Liquidation Company. The financial industry regulatory authority`s John Gannon wants everyone to know buying stock in Motors Liquidation or any bankrupt company usually means you are buying a lemon.</p><p>JOHN GANNON, FINRA OFFICE OF INVESTOR EDUCATION: I think we took action when we could. Unfortunately, the Federal securities laws don`t allow us to determine whether or not a bankrupt stock should be in the market.</p><p>GERSH: Regulators did not halt trading in the old GM`s shares until just after 2:00 p.m. last Friday -- too late Professor Angel says. But Gannon says securities law requires them to wait for the kind of unusual trading that took place on Friday.</p><p>GANNON: People who think that if they buy the old stock, when the company emerges from bankruptcy, they are all of a sudden going to make a big return, are wrong. What is probably going to happen is the stock is going to get canceled. Their investment`s going to be worthless and there may be new stock issued, but they`re not going to have participation in that new company.</p><p>GERSH: The new GM plans to issue new shares next year. Shares in Motors Liquidation now cost about as much as a newspaper. And regulators warn the stock will probably be worth nothing by the time the bankruptcy court finishes its work. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>YASTINE: Municipal debt issuers could soon have to dot their I`s and cross their T`s in public. The SEC wants the nearly $3 trillion muni market to have the same disclosure rules as publicly traded companies. The agency wants states and counties to be up front about things like bankruptcies so investors can make better decisions. And it wants those disclosures quickly within 10 days. Right now, muni debt issuers have some gray areas to work with disclosing in what`s called a quote, timely manner.</p><p>And now let`s take a look at our stocks in the news tonight.</p><p>Citigroup (C) topping our list today, gaining $0.25. The financials all are running higher. Credit card issuers say they`re seeing fewer delinquencies. Citigroup shares have rallied 20 percent or more in recent days.</p><p>Bank of America (BAC) again another financial, adding $0.51.</p><p>Wells Fargo (WFC) up $0.90. A Federal judge upheld their buyout of Wachovia last year. Citigroup had claimed Wachovia didn`t have the authority to accept Wells Fargo`s rival bid.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase (JPM) moving up $1.56. Their quarterly results due out tomorrow.</p><p>And General Electric (GE) picking up $0.60.</p><p>Ford Motor Co (F) rising $0.21.</p><p>Then Vale (VALE) jumping $1.70, up in sympathy with today`s broad rally.</p><p>And ExxonMobil (XOM) surged more than $2. Oil prices rose $2 to nearly $62 a barrel. Exxon shares going along for the ride and analysts expect Exxon to report a 50 percent drop in profits compared to a year ago. It reports results on July 30th.</p><p>Pfizer (PFE) adding $0.12 to its gains.</p><p>CIT Group (CIT) rising a fraction before being halted and you heard the news, no support from the Federal government, not big enough to save.</p><p>And a quick snapshot of some of the other Dow standouts today. American Express (AXP) again seeing fewer charge losses with bad credit card loans, the first time that`s happened to them in a year. The stock rising $2.76.</p><p>Caterpillar (CAT), IBM (IBM), United Technologies (UTX) all doing very well today.</p><p>Capital One Financial (COF) rising $2.73. Like American Express, fewer card holders delinquent in their accounts. Some analysts don`t see that trend sustainable though.</p><p>Gannett Co (GCI) rising over $1. The newspaper chain aggressively cutting costs. That allowed them to beat analyst estimates. They see better results in the second half of the year.</p><p>Abbott Labs (ABT) falling $1.21. Abbott cautious about forecasting improved results. Investors did not like that. Second quarter profits were in line with expectations.</p><p>Yum! Brands (YUM) losing over $2. The fast food operator beat earnings estimates, but investors focused on a 1 percent decline in same store sales and the company hoping that a Taco Bell expansion overseas will boost bottom line results.</p><p>Bemis Company (BMS) back for a gain of $1.45. The packaging (ph) firm telling investors it will report better than expected results thanks to a drop in raw material costs. Those second quarter results due out on Friday.</p><p>Shares in 3par (PAR) sank $1.77. The data storage provider forecast a first quarter loss due to sluggish demand for server systems.</p><p>Now let`s we move onto the NASDAQ, Intel (INTC) rising $1.22. Their results now (INAUDIBLE), last night of course setting the stage for today`s big tech rally.</p><p>Apple (AAPL) shares jumped $4.61. That`s the highest price for Apple shares since September of last year. Also Apple upgraded its iTunes service to block people who are trying to download music with their Palm Pre smart phone. Apple didn`t like that too much.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) rising $1.08. A Citigroup analyst seeing Cisco shares doing well in the early phase of an economic recovery.</p><p>Google (GOOG) soaring over $13. New numbers say Google still dominates Internet search with 65 percent of all U.S. users using them.</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) climbing $1.01. Their new Bing search product getting good reviews, grabbing more than 8 percent of all Internet search attempts.</p><p>Research in Motion (RIMM) rising nearly $4. Their Blackberry Truer (ph) model appears to be a big hit selling well in Verizon stores.</p><p>Baidu (BIDU) surging over $16.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM) jumping $1.41.</p><p>Dell (DELL) advanced $0.35.</p><p>Oracle (ORCL) up $0.88.</p><p>Juniper Networks (JNPR) up $1.77. UBS expects Juniper to report results that match or perhaps slightly exceed Wall Street targets.</p><p>And then there`s Targacept (TRGT) surging $4.19. Their depression drug did well in clinical trials and up a very nice gain with today`s trading.</p><p>And finally, JB Hunt Transportation (JBHT) plunged nearly $3, ouch. Second quarter profits fell 52 percent because of the recession. On the other hand, their CEO said he`s seeing gradual improvement in demand for freight hauling after three years of softness.</p><p>Tonight`s \"Street Critique\" guest says it`s still too early to get excited about an economic recovery. He`s Patrick O`Hare, chief market analyst at briefing.com where he writes the bargain hunting column. Pat welcome back to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>PATRICK O`HARE, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, BRIEFING.COM: Hi, Jeff, thank you.</p><p>YASTINE: First give us your sense of the markets today, the Dow up 250 plus. The NASDAQ gaining 63.</p><p>O`HARE: Earlier in the week the S&amp;P was down four straight weeks or about 7 percent so we think the market got some of its earnings-related angst out of the way ahead of the actual reporting period. So what we witnessed we believe was more of a relief trade at work over the fact that earnings were coming in better than feared and Intel specifically more than appeased the market`s concerns with its second quarter report and guidance. Yet when you stop to consider at the midpoint of its third quarter revenue guidance, it`s still 17 percent below the year ago period. It`s clear that Intel is still not operating in a normal environment ands and that`s a bit daunting to us given that we`re 18 months into this recession. So we wouldn`t get too carried away with what we`re seeing so far.</p><p>YASTINE: In other words, still be patient if you`re somebody who`s looking to try to get money into the markets. You got to wait around a bit.</p><p>O`HARE: Given the run we`ve had off the March lows, yes, we would agree with that.</p><p>YASTINE: You write the bargain hunting column for briefing.com. Give us your sense, what`s your thoughts here on how you define a bargain.</p><p>O`HARE: To start essentially from a top-down perspective, I`m looking at the broader economy and based on where we believe the broader economy is headed, we then go down in specific sectors and to industry groups. Specifically one of the bigger value-oriented metrics in mind is the price to earnings growth ratio, which is the P/E multiple divided by the growth rate.</p><p>YASTINE: What`s your thought here as far as if you had to pick one bargain, what would it be?</p><p>O`HARE: Sure. Well given the top-down view here and our outlook that isn`t quite as rosy as the market`s trading on Wednesday suggests it should be, we look to the deep value-oriented discounter, Dollar Tree Stores. The symbol is (DLTR) has done well very well through this recession period and we think the unemployment rate projected to hit double digits over the very near future here. We think it`s in a good position to continue to benefit from the trade-down effect given that the consumer remains pinched by still depressed asset prices and very limited wage growth.</p><p>YASTINE: The stock has had a tremendous run in recent months and indeed over the past year or so. Do you think there`s still room for the stock to go further given some time for these gains to digest?</p><p>O`HARE: Sure. It`s probably going to move with the ebb and flow of the market so in other words, when you get a good up day here that hinged on favorable prospects for the economic recovery in the market and the stock is likely to under perform and vice versa when that view changes. The stock because it has had a good run probably going to settle down here a little bit, but ultimately given where we think the economy is headed in the second half of the year and beyond, we still like its prospects here for the long-term investor.</p><p>YASTINE: Briefly, I saw something of the CEO selling a big chunk of stock. Is that something to be concerned about?</p><p>O`HARE: Not really. It`s prudent given the run that the stock has had, he`s going to certainly take some money off the table and we won`t fault him for doing that. Not a lot of other insiders selling on top of that. So we`re comfortable with that happening right now.</p><p>YASTINE: And Pat, any disclosures to make for us regarding Dollar Tree?</p><p>O`HARE: No, I do not own stock at this time.</p><p>YASTINE: Pat, welcome, thank you for coming back on to the program.</p><p>O`HARE: Thank you, Jeff.</p><p>YASTINE: Our guest, Pat O`Hare of briefing.com.</p><p>GHARIB: Tomorrow, we`ll see if investors go ga-ga for Google`s latest earnings. We`ll analyze the numbers and the outlook.</p><p>A former Credit Suisse broker turned fugitive has been captured. Julian Tzolov was picked up in Spain today, after going missing in June. Tomorrow, a hearing is set to determine what impact the capture will have on his upcoming trial. It`s set to begin next week. Tzolov is charged with fraud and conspiracy for buying auction rate securities when his clients thought they were purchasing Federally-backed student loans.</p><p>YASTINE: Cox Communications is sending the travel channel on a trip to a new owner. Reuters is reporting an auction for the cable channel is expected to begin in the next few days. Possible bidders include Scripps Networks Interactive and Time Warner. The travel channel is valued at up to a billion dollars. Cox bought it in 2007.</p><p>GHARIB: Here`s a look at what`s happening tomorrow. Weekly jobless claims are out and the National Association of Home Builders releases its July survey. Also, quarterly results from Harley-Davidson, IBM, JPMorgan, Marriott and Nokia.</p><p>Also tomorrow, Wal- Mart will unveil a new ratings system, but this one isn`t for movies or music. Instead, it`s designed to help shoppers evaluate the social and environmental impact of the products they purchase. But the sustainability ratings won`t be in place for a while. First, Wal- Mart will send questionnaires to thousands of its suppliers asking about water used and carbon-dioxide emissions created in the making of their products. The effort will be rolled out in steps over the next five years and Wal-Mart hopes other retailers will get on board.</p><p>YASTINE: Recapping today`s market action, shares rally on Intel`s outlook and a drop in credit card delinquencies. The Dow gained 257 points. The NASDAQ gained 63.

So says a key report on reforming financial regulation. Its co-author William Donaldson says a systemic risk regulator is needed now and it shouldn`t be the Federal reserve.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAMES ANGEL, FINANCE PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: They were buying a corpse when they thought they were buying a baby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: He`s talking about scams touting money making opportunities in the worthless shares of old GM. Coming up, an investor alert.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Tonight`s \"Street Critique\" guest says Wal-Mart`s not the only retailer cashing in on the recession. He`s Patrick O`Hare, chief market analyst at briefing.com.</p><p>YASTINE: Then, it looks like more people are paying their credit cards on time. American Express and Capital One both report delinquencies are down. The news helped stocks surge as the Dow added over 250 points.</p><p>GHARIB: I`m Susie Gharib.</p><p>YASTINE: And I`m Jeff Yastine. Paul Kangas is off tonight. This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, July 15.</p><p>YASTINE: Good evening everyone. We begin tonight with a developing story. The struggling commercial lender CIT Group says talks with the government for a possible financial bailout have ended. CIT says there is quote, no appreciable likelihood of additional government support over the near term, end quote. That means no money to help the cash-strapped firm. CIT is now evaluating alternatives. It is one of the nation`s largest small business lenders serving hundreds of thousands of firms. It has been on the verge of bankruptcy for days.</p><p>GHARIB: Harsh criticism today of President Obama`s plan to make the Federal Reserve the super regulator of the U.S. financial system. An institutional investors group led by two former heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission says that won`t work. They say the central bank should not get the job of preventing systemic risk in the financial system. That task is the centerpiece of the president`s plan to restructure how banks and other firms are regulated to prevent another financial collapse.</p><p>Arthur Levitt and William Donaldson`s criticism of the Fed was blunt. Their report compiled by the Investors` Working Group said quote, the Fed`s credibility has been tarnished by the easy credit policies it pursued and the lax regulatory oversight that let institutions ratchet higher their balance sheet leverage and amass huge concentrations of risky complex securitized products. Instead, they are recommending the creation of an independent oversight board to monitor risk management. That so-called systemic risk oversight board would be appointed by the president and approved by Congress with no affiliation to government agencies.</p><p>The task force is also recommending that hedge funds and private equity firms be required to register with the SEC and be subject to oversight. Over the counter derivatives, like credit default swaps, would trade on regulated exchanges and be subject to strict government regulation. And Congress should create a new agency to regulate consumer financial products, including mortgages.</p><p>I sat down with William Donaldson earlier today and asked him why he`s opposed to the Fed taking on the job of systemic risk regulator.</p><p>WILLIAM DONALDSON, CHAIRMAN, DONALDSON ENTERPRISES: We feel that the -- basically the Federal Reserve has got its hands full in terms of monetary policy and so forth. We have felt that an independent group that is not coming out of any one of the existing agencies, independent group with great strength in terms of the chairmanship, strength in terms of its commissioners and board members and particularly strong staff with the mandate and the authority to go anywhere they want, it is a way of really getting at the systemic risk problem.</p><p>GHARIB: But you`re proposing this oversight board and Treasury Secretary Geithner has said you can`t put out a fire with a committee. </p><p>DONALDSON: The type of editing we`re talking about here is a small group that by appointment and the people appointed to it have different dimensions of experience and so forth and has a strong chairman</p><p>GHARIB: You also proposed that hedge funds and private equity funds be required to register with the SEC. Now, Bernie Madoff`s fund was also registered with the SEC and he still cheated thousands of investors, so why would this work?</p><p>DONALDSON: Bernie Madoff didn`t register. Let me make that clear. The thing that was registered was a different business so that this business, his other business that was such a fraud was not registered. Nobody knew about it. It only seems logical that if funds are put together whether you call them hedge funds or whatever, that there should be some authority that has the right to go in and look at the procedures within that fund, look at things such as how they price their securities, what conflicts of interest they have, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>GHARIB: I`m sure you`ve heard it said that we really don`t need new regulation and new structures. We just need smart regulators who can enforce the rules that we already have. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>DONALDSON: There are a number of rules and regulations we don`t have. I mean the whole derivative area that has gotten us in so much trouble has no rules and regulations and no jurisdictional oversight from CFTC or the SEC. So I think that clearly we need effective regulators and clearly we need -- we need people who are trained and again this is a problem and a challenge and an opportunity to bring people into the regulatory agencies that are trained and know what they`re talking about and eager to work through that agency.</p><p>GHARIB: What`s your analysis of the Obama reform plan? Is it the right solution to reform the system?</p><p>DONALDSON: We say that it`s a very good start, a good start but we`re taking things a little bit further and we are also counseling that the whole systemic part of this and some of the conflicts of interest that are going require more study and we should not move too swiftly.</p><p>GHARIB: So what`s the one take away message you would like the Obama administration to take from your report?</p><p>DONALDSON: I hope the administration will take a good hard look at some of these areas we`ve pointed out and take and see if they want to add to their proposal.</p><p>GHARIB: I guess what it boils down to is what investors care about and will these reforms ultimately spot risks in the future and will they be able to prevent a Bernie Madoff situation from happening again. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>DONALDSON: There`s always going to be in a society as big as ours and a global and financial investment world, there are going to be people who are going to come up with schemes and so forth and some of them are going to be pretty devious I`m sure. So can you say that a Madoff kind of thing would never happen again with proper regulation, I don`t think you can say that. I think the best you can do is to address the causes of this situation which the congressional committee is taking this on is going to do and then to do the best you can.</p><p>GHARIB: Chairman Donaldson, it`s a pleasure talking to you. Thank you.</p><p>DONALDSON: Thanks.</p><p>YASTINE: While the investors` working group made recommendations aimed at preventing another financial crisis, Congress today named a panel to investigate the crisis. Former California state Treasurer Phil Angelides will lead the 10 member bipartisan group. Congress called for the probe into the worst meltdown since the great depression earlier this year. The panel will have just over a year to get to the bottom of things. It has to report back to Congress by December 15 of next year.</p><p>GHARIB: Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is defending his actions during the financial crisis. Tomorrow he will testify on Capitol Hill about Bank of America`s controversial acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Paulson released today his prepared remarks, saying Bank of America had no legal basis to nix the Merrill deal and doing so would have shown a quote, colossal lack of judgment. Paulson also says it was appropriate for him to warn BOA`s CEO Ken Lewis that the bank`s management could be ousted if it rejected the Merrill purchase.</p><p>YASTINE: Investors viewed today as a colossal buying opportunity, after Intel`s better than expected results last night. The Dow opened nearly 100 points higher at the bell. Intel shares leapt 8 percent, giving the Dow a 180 point gain by noontime. Adding to the bullishness, credit card issuers like American Express say they`re now seeing fewer defaults and delinquencies. That helped the financials and added more fuel to today`s rocket ride higher. The Dow rising 256.72, closing at 8,616.21. The NASDAQ adding 63 points to 1,862.90 and the S&amp;P 500 up 26.84 to 932.68. In the bond market, the 10-year note falling 1 4/32 to 96 and the yield at 3.61 percent.</p><p>GHARIB: Shares of the old General Motors lost half their value today as regulators lifted a trading ban on the penny stock. Trading was halted Friday after some investors confused the new GM that emerged from bankruptcy with the old GM stock that remains tangled up in court. To be clear, the new GM isn`t publicly traded now and most of the company is owned by the U.S. government. But what about those old GM shares? As Darren Gersh explains, they`re still virtually worthless.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It was stunning news. Last Friday, a reborn General Motors peeled out of bankruptcy far sooner than anyone thought and shares in GM jumped on the news. The only problem is, there are no shares in this new GM.</p><p>JAMES ANGEL, FINANCE PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: They were buying a corpse when they thought they were buying a baby.</p><p>GERSH: Finance professor James Angel said many would-be investors thought they were buying the new, post-bankruptcy GM, when in fact, they were buying GM.`s cast off parts -- the assets that are still languishing in bankruptcy court and might be stuck there for years.</p><p>ANGEL: Many of the online news wires basically said General Motors, GMGMQ today emerged from bankruptcy. So many people thought, ah ha! I can buy stock in the new company now, but it wasn`t the new company they were buying. It was the corpse of the old company.</p><p>GERSH: When GM went bankrupt, its old stock got a new trading symbol - - GMGMQ. That confused some investors so regulators have given the old company a new name -- Motors Liquidation Company. The financial industry regulatory authority`s John Gannon wants everyone to know buying stock in Motors Liquidation or any bankrupt company usually means you are buying a lemon.</p><p>JOHN GANNON, FINRA OFFICE OF INVESTOR EDUCATION: I think we took action when we could. Unfortunately, the Federal securities laws don`t allow us to determine whether or not a bankrupt stock should be in the market.</p><p>GERSH: Regulators did not halt trading in the old GM`s shares until just after 2:00 p.m. last Friday -- too late Professor Angel says. But Gannon says securities law requires them to wait for the kind of unusual trading that took place on Friday.</p><p>GANNON: People who think that if they buy the old stock, when the company emerges from bankruptcy, they are all of a sudden going to make a big return, are wrong. What is probably going to happen is the stock is going to get canceled. Their investment`s going to be worthless and there may be new stock issued, but they`re not going to have participation in that new company.</p><p>GERSH: The new GM plans to issue new shares next year. Shares in Motors Liquidation now cost about as much as a newspaper. And regulators warn the stock will probably be worth nothing by the time the bankruptcy court finishes its work. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>YASTINE: Municipal debt issuers could soon have to dot their I`s and cross their T`s in public. The SEC wants the nearly $3 trillion muni market to have the same disclosure rules as publicly traded companies. The agency wants states and counties to be up front about things like bankruptcies so investors can make better decisions. And it wants those disclosures quickly within 10 days. Right now, muni debt issuers have some gray areas to work with disclosing in what`s called a quote, timely manner.</p><p>And now let`s take a look at our stocks in the news tonight.</p><p>Citigroup (C) topping our list today, gaining $0.25. The financials all are running higher. Credit card issuers say they`re seeing fewer delinquencies. Citigroup shares have rallied 20 percent or more in recent days.</p><p>Bank of America (BAC) again another financial, adding $0.51.</p><p>Wells Fargo (WFC) up $0.90. A Federal judge upheld their buyout of Wachovia last year. Citigroup had claimed Wachovia didn`t have the authority to accept Wells Fargo`s rival bid.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase (JPM) moving up $1.56. Their quarterly results due out tomorrow.</p><p>And General Electric (GE) picking up $0.60.</p><p>Ford Motor Co (F) rising $0.21.</p><p>Then Vale (VALE) jumping $1.70, up in sympathy with today`s broad rally.</p><p>And ExxonMobil (XOM) surged more than $2. Oil prices rose $2 to nearly $62 a barrel. Exxon shares going along for the ride and analysts expect Exxon to report a 50 percent drop in profits compared to a year ago. It reports results on July 30th.</p><p>Pfizer (PFE) adding $0.12 to its gains.</p><p>CIT Group (CIT) rising a fraction before being halted and you heard the news, no support from the Federal government, not big enough to save.</p><p>And a quick snapshot of some of the other Dow standouts today. American Express (AXP) again seeing fewer charge losses with bad credit card loans, the first time that`s happened to them in a year. The stock rising $2.76.</p><p>Caterpillar (CAT), IBM (IBM), United Technologies (UTX) all doing very well today.</p><p>Capital One Financial (COF) rising $2.73. Like American Express, fewer card holders delinquent in their accounts. Some analysts don`t see that trend sustainable though.</p><p>Gannett Co (GCI) rising over $1. The newspaper chain aggressively cutting costs. That allowed them to beat analyst estimates. They see better results in the second half of the year.</p><p>Abbott Labs (ABT) falling $1.21. Abbott cautious about forecasting improved results. Investors did not like that. Second quarter profits were in line with expectations.</p><p>Yum! Brands (YUM) losing over $2. The fast food operator beat earnings estimates, but investors focused on a 1 percent decline in same store sales and the company hoping that a Taco Bell expansion overseas will boost bottom line results.</p><p>Bemis Company (BMS) back for a gain of $1.45. The packaging (ph) firm telling investors it will report better than expected results thanks to a drop in raw material costs. Those second quarter results due out on Friday.</p><p>Shares in 3par (PAR) sank $1.77. The data storage provider forecast a first quarter loss due to sluggish demand for server systems.</p><p>Now let`s we move onto the NASDAQ, Intel (INTC) rising $1.22. Their results now (INAUDIBLE), last night of course setting the stage for today`s big tech rally.</p><p>Apple (AAPL) shares jumped $4.61. That`s the highest price for Apple shares since September of last year. Also Apple upgraded its iTunes service to block people who are trying to download music with their Palm Pre smart phone. Apple didn`t like that too much.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) rising $1.08. A Citigroup analyst seeing Cisco shares doing well in the early phase of an economic recovery.</p><p>Google (GOOG) soaring over $13.

Their depression drug did well in clinical trials and up a very nice gain with today`s trading.</p><p>And finally, JB Hunt Transportation (JBHT) plunged nearly $3, ouch. Second quarter profits fell 52 percent because of the recession. On the other hand, their CEO said he`s seeing gradual improvement in demand for freight hauling after three years of softness.</p><p>Tonight`s \"Street Critique\" guest says it`s still too early to get excited about an economic recovery. He`s Patrick O`Hare, chief market analyst at briefing.com where he writes the bargain hunting column. Pat welcome back to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>PATRICK O`HARE, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, BRIEFING.COM: Hi, Jeff, thank you.</p><p>YASTINE: First give us your sense of the markets today, the Dow up 250 plus. The NASDAQ gaining 63.</p><p>O`HARE: Earlier in the week the S&amp;P was down four straight weeks or about 7 percent so we think the market got some of its earnings-related angst out of the way ahead of the actual reporting period. So what we witnessed we believe was more of a relief trade at work over the fact that earnings were coming in better than feared and Intel specifically more than appeased the market`s concerns with its second quarter report and guidance. Yet when you stop to consider at the midpoint of its third quarter revenue guidance, it`s still 17 percent below the year ago period. It`s clear that Intel is still not operating in a normal environment ands and that`s a bit daunting to us given that we`re 18 months into this recession. So we wouldn`t get too carried away with what we`re seeing so far.</p><p>YASTINE: In other words, still be patient if you`re somebody who`s looking to try to get money into the markets. You got to wait around a bit.</p><p>O`HARE: Given the run we`ve had off the March lows, yes, we would agree with that.</p><p>YASTINE: You write the bargain hunting column for briefing.com. Give us your sense, what`s your thoughts here on how you define a bargain.</p><p>O`HARE: To start essentially from a top-down perspective, I`m looking at the broader economy and based on where we believe the broader economy is headed, we then go down in specific sectors and to industry groups. Specifically one of the bigger value-oriented metrics in mind is the price to earnings growth ratio, which is the P/E multiple divided by the growth rate.</p><p>YASTINE: What`s your thought here as far as if you had to pick one bargain, what would it be?</p><p>O`HARE: Sure. Well given the top-down view here and our outlook that isn`t quite as rosy as the market`s trading on Wednesday suggests it should be, we look to the deep value-oriented discounter, Dollar Tree Stores. The symbol is (DLTR) has done well very well through this recession period and we think the unemployment rate projected to hit double digits over the very near future here. We think it`s in a good position to continue to benefit from the trade-down effect given that the consumer remains pinched by still depressed asset prices and very limited wage growth.</p><p>YASTINE: The stock has had a tremendous run in recent months and indeed over the past year or so. Do you think there`s still room for the stock to go further given some time for these gains to digest?</p><p>O`HARE: Sure. It`s probably going to move with the ebb and flow of the market so in other words, when you get a good up day here that hinged on favorable prospects for the economic recovery in the market and the stock is likely to under perform and vice versa when that view changes. The stock because it has had a good run probably going to settle down here a little bit, but ultimately given where we think the economy is headed in the second half of the year and beyond, we still like its prospects here for the long-term investor.</p><p>YASTINE: Briefly, I saw something of the CEO selling a big chunk of stock. Is that something to be concerned about?</p><p>O`HARE: Not really. It`s prudent given the run that the stock has had, he`s going to certainly take some money off the table and we won`t fault him for doing that. Not a lot of other insiders selling on top of that. So we`re comfortable with that happening right now.</p><p>YASTINE: And Pat, any disclosures to make for us regarding Dollar Tree? </p><p>O`HARE: No, I do not own stock at this time.</p><p>YASTINE: Pat, welcome, thank you for coming back on to the program.</p><p>O`HARE: Thank you, Jeff.</p><p>YASTINE: Our guest, Pat O`Hare of briefing.com.</p><p>GHARIB: Tomorrow, we`ll see if investors go ga-ga for Google`s latest earnings. We`ll analyze the numbers and the outlook.</p><p>A former Credit Suisse broker turned fugitive has been captured. Julian Tzolov was picked up in Spain today, after going missing in June. Tomorrow, a hearing is set to determine what impact the capture will have on his upcoming trial. It`s set to begin next week. Tzolov is charged with fraud and conspiracy for buying auction rate securities when his clients thought they were purchasing Federally-backed student loans.</p><p>YASTINE: Cox Communications is sending the travel channel on a trip to a new owner. Reuters is reporting an auction for the cable channel is expected to begin in the next few days. Possible bidders include Scripps Networks Interactive and Time Warner. The travel channel is valued at up to a billion dollars. Cox bought it in 2007.</p><p>GHARIB: Here`s a look at what`s happening tomorrow. Weekly jobless claims are out and the National Association of Home Builders releases its July survey. Also, quarterly results from Harley-Davidson, IBM, JPMorgan, Marriott and Nokia.</p><p>Also tomorrow, Wal- Mart will unveil a new ratings system, but this one isn`t for movies or music. Instead, it`s designed to help shoppers evaluate the social and environmental impact of the products they purchase. But the sustainability ratings won`t be in place for a while. First, Wal- Mart will send questionnaires to thousands of its suppliers asking about water used and carbon-dioxide emissions created in the making of their products. The effort will be rolled out in steps over the next five years and Wal-Mart hopes other retailers will get on board.</p><p>YASTINE: Recapping today`s market action, shares rally on Intel`s outlook and a drop in credit card delinquencies. The Dow gained 257 points. The NASDAQ gained 63.

This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, May (sic) 22.</p><p>KANGAS: Good evening, everyone. One of the world`s largest private equity funds is going public. Late today, Blackstone Group announced a $4.4 or $4 billion initial public offering. The move lets investors buy into a risky business that has traditionally been the ground of wealthy individuals and large institutions. Blackstone generated more than $7.5 billion in investment gains in 2006. The company`s assets under management are worth almost $79 billion. Its portfolio includes real estate giant Equity Office Properties, Extended Stay America Hotels, publisher Houghton Mifflin and entertainment park Universal Orlando. Blackstone will trade on the New York Stock Exchange. But there`s no IPO date or ticker symbol specified in today`s filing with the SEC. But the company did say it won`t give quarterly guidance to Wall Street because its business is quote, unpredictable.</p><p>PRATT: The meltdown in the sub-prime lending market reached Capitol Hill today. The Senate Banking Committee called regulators, lenders and borrowers to learn more about the causes behind the sub-prime crisis. But as Stephanie Dhue reports, the committee quickly got down to the business of laying blame.</p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: With an increasing number of homeowners facing foreclosure, lawmakers, including New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, accused the Federal Reserve of being asleep at the switch.</p><p>SEN. ROBERT MENENDEZ (D) NEW JERSEY: How could it be this big and you have done your job?</p><p>ROGER COLE, DIR., BANKING SUPERVISION &amp; REGULATION, FEDERAL RESERVE: Given what we know now, yes, we could have done more sooner.</p><p>DHUE: Regulators say much of the sub-prime market falls outside their jurisdiction, which deals mostly with ensuring that banks are financially sound. But Senate Banking Committee Chairman <person><nameText>Chris Dodd </nameText></person>wasn`t buying that argument.</p><p><person><nameText>SEN. CHRIS DODD,</nameText></person> CHAIRMAN, BANKING COMMITTEE: The Fed had the responsibility in my view, as a good cop, to be on the beat, particularly going back several years ago, when the information first began to surface that there were serious problems with these sub-prime loans.</p><p>DHUE: Dodd called on the regulators to quickly finalize tighter sub- prime lending standards.

And so we hope the regulations can find a balance that will allow consumers to benefit from lower housing payments, while protecting them from unaffordable payment increases.</p><p>DHUE: The committee also heard from borrowers now at risk of losing their homes. Jennie Haliburton got an adjustable 2/28 sub-prime loan from Countrywide last year. Her payment is set to adjust in May to more than 70 percent of her income.</p><p>JENNIE HALIBURTON, BORROWER: I feel like they took advantage of me because I`m 77 and they figure, \"oh, well, she`s old.\"</p><p>DHUE: Countrywide says it will work with Mrs. Haliburton to keep her in her home. Senator Dodd says there are thousands of sub-prime borrowers struggling with their mortgages and he wants to find ways to help them. Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>PRATT: KB Home`s quarterly earnings plummeted 84 percent, as home prices dropped, inventories swelled and the sub-prime mortgage market began to implode. KB Home earned $0.34 a share in its fiscal first quarter. That`s down sharply from the year-ago period, but $0.09 ahead of analyst estimates. Sales fell 19 percent to $1 3/4 billion, but that was still ahead of estimates. KB Home`s CEO says housing conditions remain difficult, making it even harder to predict when the market will stabilize. The company also says 13 percent of the mortgages for KB Homes last year were financed with sub-prime loans.</p><p>KANGAS: Wall Street felt the sting of profit taking this morning after yesterday`s sharp rally. Selling was also linked to Motorola`s forecast of a first quarter loss and a rise in oil prices. By 11 a.m., the Dow was off 30 points, NASDAQ down 12. The blue chips improved this afternoon with the help of a brokerage upgrade on Procter &amp; Gamble and some strong oil stocks, but the broader market ended lower. The Dow Industrial Average closed up 13.62 at 12,461.14. NASDAQ Composite lost 4.18, ending at 2451.74. Standard &amp; Poor`s 500 Index fell exactly a half point to 1434.54. Over in the bond market, the 10-year note fell 12/32 to par and 10/32, lifting the yield to 4.59 percent.</p><p>PRATT: This week in our special housing series, we looked at market conditions in three U.S. cities: New York, Washington, DC and Miami. Tonight, we continue that series with a broader discussion of the national housing market. Our guest this evening is Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody`s economy.com. Mark, welcome.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`S ECONOMY.COM: Thanks for having me.</p><p>PRATT: So what is the current state of the U.S. housing market?</p><p>ZANDI: It`s struggling. The correction which began almost two years ago is ongoing. Since the peak, we have seen sales off about 10, 15 percent. Starts are done by a third. And prices are now falling in about half to two-thirds of the nation`s market.</p><p>PRATT: So this is a correction, though, not a meltdown?</p><p>ZANDI: I would characterize it as a correction. It is a severe correction. But at this point we`re not seeing double digit price declines. And the market is still holding together reasonably well so not a crash, at least not yet.</p><p>PRATT: So tell me about the weakest areas of the country. What are some of those?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, they would include California, primarily southern California. San Diego would be a good case in point. Arizona, Phoenix, Las Vegas, most of Florida, particularly south of Florida and parts of the northeast, Washington DC, the Boston region and of course the areas around Detroit are very weak because of job losses in the auto industry.</p><p>PRATT: And what about the strongest regions of the country, what are those?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, there are fewer but Texas would be a relatively strong housing market, some of the areas around the Carolinas, the farm belt and the pas civic northwest. In fact house prices in the Pacific northwest are still rising at a double-digit pace.</p><p>PRATT: So is it typical for a correction like this to be so uneven?</p><p>ZANDI: It is. The house market is a very local market. It really depends on where you are. Although I have to say this is the broadest the housing market correction that I think we`ve experienced at least since the great depression.</p><p>PRATT: So if it is so broad though is that, or does that have ominous predictions or does that mean that we should be more concerned?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, we should be concerned. The soft part of the economy lies in the housing and now of course in the mortgage market. Housing is weighing heavily on the economy. So far the problems in housing have been largely contained to housing. They haven`t bled out to consumer spending and business investment. But given the problems and the fact that they are ongoing, we need to watch that very carefully.</p><p>PRATT: So let`s talk a little bit about the sub-prime part of the market. I mean what does that mean? What is that likely to do to the overall housing market? Could it take it into a meltdown?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, it is a significant problem. If you consider all of the very aggressive loans that have been extended in recent years, that would include sub-prime, alternative A, prime loans that are interest only or negative am loans -- these are very aggressive loans. You combine all those and these are ones at a significant risk of default. They account for 40 percent of origination volume last year and roughly one quarter of all mortgage debt outstanding. So this a significant market that is going to be significantly affected. As a result, we will see some measurable impact on housing activity and probably as a result on the broader economy.</p><p>PRATT: One thing I want to make sure that we cover is the Fed and their statement yesterday. They sort of removed the bias, depending on who you ask. You think that that was because or directly because of the housing market.</p><p>ZANDI: Yeah, I think they did -- they did get rid of their bias towards future higher interest rates. They now have a neutral policy and I think they did that to have some latitude just in case if the housing market goes south and the mortgage market weakens, that they could ease if they needed to. At this point I don`t think they want to. Inflation is above their target. They would prefer not to, but they needed a little bit of flexibility and they got that in yesterday`s statement.</p><p>PRATT: OK, great. My guest this evening, Mark Zandi, chief economist at moodyseconomy.com, thanks for joining us.</p><p>ZANDI: Thank you.</p><p>KANGAS: Business software maker Oracle sued German rival SAP today, claiming SAP committed quote, corporate theft on a grand scale end quote. Oracle says SAP illegally logged on to its password-protected customer web sites many times, stealing huge amounts of software code, documents and other confidential material. Oracle claims it knows SAP excuse me, was the culprit because Oracle traced the log-ons back to an SAP-owned subsidiary in Texas. SAP said it had no comment on the lawsuit. Oracle wants a California court to assess damages, force SAP to return the stolen items and bar SAP from logging on to Oracle`s web sites.</p><p>Crude oil surged more than 2 percent today, jumping $2.08 to $61.69 a barrel. The rally was fueled by expectations energy demand will start to surge as we head into the summer driving season. And as Erika Miller explains, experts expect oil prices to spurt even higher.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Spring is supposed to be the time of year when energy prices dip due to weak demand. Instead, the opposite is happening. Analyst Fadel Gheit blames an across- the-board rally in energy prices on strong demand for gasoline.</p><p>FADEL GHEIT, ENERGY ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO.: Right now, gasoline prices are leading the energy markets in the U.S. But it doesn`t mean that oil prices are, you know, pulling back. Oil prices have shown tremendous resiliency that nobody had expected.</p><p>MILLER: Gasoline futures have surged over 20 percent since January. They`re now at a seven-month high. The rally is due in large part to fears of a supply crunch heading into the summer driving season. In the U.S., there has been an almost insatiable demand for motor fuel, despite higher prices at the pump. At the same time, supplies are dwindling. Energy trader Ira Eckstein blames that on glitches and seasonal maintenance at refineries.</p><p>IRA ECKSTEIN, OIL TRADER, AREA INTERNATIONAL TRADING: We have these outages, plus they are doing their usual spring -- they`re going from heating oil to gasoline, so they had to close down some refineries in order to switch over.</p><p>MILLER: There are also concerns about disruptions to crude supplies due to geopolitical tensions in places like Iran, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia. Another big unknown is weather. Hurricane season starts June 1, raising the risk of damage to U.S. oil infrastructure. In the near term, many traders expect oil prices to inch higher. The question is, how much?</p><p>ECKSTEIN: Crude oil is going to test that $62.50 level -- maybe not this week, but maybe early next week and I think that we could stay above there. We`ll see how we react when we get there.</p><p>MILLER: That`s bad news for motorists. In some places, including New York City, regular unleaded is approaching $3 a gallon. But few experts think we`ll head back to record levels just yet. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York</p><p>PRATT: Transatlantic air travel took a leap into the future today, as the European Union`s transport ministers approved plans to open the skies to more competition. The so-called open skies deal lets EU carriers fly from any city in the block to any city in the U.S. and vice versa. The Bush administration welcomed the decision, saying it will spur growth and give Americans more flying freedom. The plan had been set to take effect in October, but all sides agreed on a five-month delay. The new start date is March 30, 2008, Paul.</p><p>KANGAS: Suzanne, shares of the major air carriers hit some turbulence today on concerns that pact could trigger a price war. We`ll look at how they did as we take a look at our stocks in the news tonight.</p><p>Big board volume leader on nearly 51 million shares, Motorola (MOT) down $1.24. After the close yesterday as we reported, the company predicted a $0.07 to $0.09 per share first quarter loss.</p><p>Then Pfizer (PFE) down $0.06.</p><p>General Electric (GE) moved up $0.33. The company is teaming up with News Corporation to launch an online video site to compete with youtube. The details coming up shortly.</p><p>Ford Motor Co (F) was up $0.07.</p><p>CVS Caremark (CVS), this is the first day of trading for the new merger company of CVS Caremark, down $0.36 a share, fifth in volume.</p><p>AT&amp;T (T) rose $0.25.</p><p>Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) down a half a dollar. Goldman Sachs downgraded it from \"buy\" to \"neutral\" because it sees no sales recovery for the firm before the third quarter of this year.</p><p>ExxonMobil (XOM) up $1.13 on that sharp rise in oil.</p><p>Chesapeake Energy (CHK) down $0.15.</p><p>And Time Warner (TWX), tenth in volume, was off $0.28.</p><p>Procter Gamble (PG) moved up $0.89. Bear Stearns upgraded it from \"peer perform\" to \"out perform\" because of its attractive valuation in the price of the stock, according to Bear Stearns.</p><p>And then AMR (AMR) parent of American Airlines, down $1.54, not only today because of the sharp rise in oil, but airfares are expected to tumble next spring when the open skies package you just heard about goes into effect.</p><p>Let`s have a look at some other major carriers. Continental Air (CAL) down $1.60.</p><p>And UAL Corp (UAUA) losing $1.77.</p><p>Raytheon Co (RTN) off $1.41. The company boosted its annual dividend 6 percent from $0.96 to $1.02, but nevertheless, Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock from \"neutral\" to a \"sell.\"</p><p>Conagra Foods (CAG), the big packaged foods company down $0.02 despite a turnaround. Third quarter earnings of $0.38 versus a loss last year. Those earnings $0.03 above the Street estimate.</p><p>Another packaged foods company, General Mills (GIS) moving up $0.44. Third quarter earnings there were up nearly 9 percent to $0.74, $0.04 above the Street estimate and the company boosted its 2007 earnings guidance.</p><p>Nortel Networks (NT) fell $1.53. The company launched a $1 billion offering of convertible debt, which of course has potential earnings dilution.</p><p>Then we see Barnes &amp; Noble (BKS), the book seller, down $1.10. The company says preliminary fourth quarter earnings will be $1.84, up from $1.76 last year, but $0.04 below the Wall Street estimate.</p><p>IHS (IHS), a $3.90 gain. The aerospace defense contractor had nicely higher first quarter earnings, $0.32 versus $0.24 last year and revenues up 18 percent.</p><p>Clarcor (CLC) which is a big filtration company off $2.87. Third quarter earnings $0.32, a penny above last year, but $0.04 below the Street estimate. Sales actually fell 1.7 percent.</p><p>Google (GOOG) topped the active list on NASDAQ gaining $5.49.</p><p>Apple (AAPL) a $0.09 rise.</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) down $0.25.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) a $0.42 loss.</p><p>Intel (INTC) dropped $0.18 a share, fifth in dollar volume.</p><p>Research in Motion (RIMM) up $1.64.</p><p>Then Oracle (ORCL) a $0.32 gain there.</p><p>Palm (PALM) closed down $1.71. Speculation appears to be cooling that it might be the target of a takeover attempt. After the close, Palm reported third quarter earnings excluding items, $0.16 a share, $0.04 above the Street estimate. In after hours trading, the stock was about $0.20 higher than this.</p><p>Broadcom (BRCM) down $1.29, hurt by Motorola`s earnings warning.</p><p>And then Qualcomm (QCOM) tenth in volume was off $0.38 a share.</p><p>Intuit (INTU) down $2.46. The company says its Turbotax software sales are off to a slow start this tax season so far.</p><p>Those are the stocks in the news tonight. Suzanne.</p><p>PRATT: The SEC and the American Stock Exchange today settled their differences over problems with the exchange`s oversight of options trading. Regulators allege, from 1999 through June 2004, the Amex didn`t adequately enforce certain order-handling rules and comply with record-keeping guidelines. The settlement creates a $3 million fund to help pay for stepped up exchange surveillance. Still in the works, though, EC action against the Amex`s former Chairman Salvatore Sodano.</p><p>KANGAS: Tomorrow, our Friday \"market monitor\" guest is Jeffrey Everett, chief investment officer at Templeton Global Advisors.</p><p>PRATT: A Federal judge in Mississippi has turned down a request to allow a class-action suit against State Farm insurance for denial of damage claims from hurricane Katrina. At issue so-called slab cases where houses were destroyed down to the slab. The judge said while all the homes were ruined, there are other factors that make the cases unsuitable for class action.</p><p>KANGAS: Coca-Cola is rolling out a new version of its diet Coke drink, adding vitamins and minerals to the mix. The new diet Coke plus will contain small mounts of vitamins B-3, B-6 and B-12, as well as magnesium and zinc. But the recipe for the soda itself will be unchanged. Coke says the new soft drink should hit U.S. store shelves next month.</p><p>PRATT: Here`s a look at what`s happening tomorrow. February existing home sales come out, along with earnings from Freddie Mac.</p><p>Tonight`s commentator has a few thoughts on what the Blackstone Group`s $4 billion IPO could mean to Wall Street. Here`s Chrystia Freeland, U.S. managing editor of \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, US MANAGING EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES: The irony of the move is irresistible. After all, the private equity business is based on the idea that a lot of companies can be run more effectively if they are liberated from the short-term targets and regulatory red tape that bedevils the public market. But there are some powerful reasons for Blackstone to be tempted to go public. The greatest may be the simplest. Blackstone`s founders are surely keen in Wall Street`s uncharacteristically coy terminology to crystallize the value of their partnership.</p><p>In plainer language, that means they want to take their billions before they retire. In contrast with those pitied Goldman Sachs senior partners who left the legendary firm before its IPO and missed out on the windfall their younger colleagues collected. For those of us not in line to receive Blackstone`s billions, the greatest significance of an IPO would be to make the private equity revolution more sustainable. Private equity has become so powerful it is easy to forget that the dominant groups are just a few decades old, are still run by the men who founded them and are dependent on Internet and fund-raising (INAUDIBLE) for most of their capital. Going public would give them access to permanent money and thus make them a more permanent fixture in world business. And that is the real irony of the story. Public capital could well give private equity groups a more enduring power to take companies private. I`m Chrystia Freeland.</p><p>KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, a split decision on Wall Street. The Dow gained 13 points while the NASDAQ Composite lost four points.

And what does it take to make tax time less taxing? Scott Gurvey has those answers and more in tonight`s \"tech talk.\"</p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tonight`s big tech news is a partnership of two very unlikely bedfellows: NBC Universal and Newscorp, parent of the Fox network. Who could get these guys together? Try youtube, the popular video-sharing web site now owned by Google. Youtube members make and post videos, often using original material, but just as often using content recorded from TV and cable, raising copyright concerns. A competing site run by NBC and Newscorp would have lots of content it could legally distribute. Yahoo!, MSN, AOL and Newscorp`s myspace will be involved. Stay tuned.</p><p>All of these sites make money by selling ads. The more popular the site, the more it can sell, and it adds up! Cisco Systems, Intel and General Motors have already signed up to advertise on the new NBC-Newscorp site. There are big bucks involved. Google paid $1.6 billion to buy youtube and recently, Viacom sued youtube for $1 billion, charging it with copyright infringement. Youtube has yet to file a response. The digital millennium copyright act of 1998 was supposed to clarify copyright law in the Internet age. It appears there is more work to be done.</p><p>It is tax time and the IRS says more than 130 million returns will be filed this year. Thirty five million will be made with tax preparation software. I`ve tried the leading products and, while they all do a good job, once again I`ve found Intuit`s Turbotax to be the most comprehensive and easiest to use. It does tend to cost $10 to $15 more than H&amp;R Block`s tax cut. This year, Intuit added a home and business version, perfect if you file a Schedule C or need to generate W-2s for business or household employees. The tax software companies report their fastest growth is among taxpayers who enter all their data online, a process Intuit`s Bob Meighan says is simple and safe.</p><p>BOB MEIGHAN, VICE PRESIDENT, INTUIT: People don`t have to go to the store and buy the software. They don`t have to install it. They don`t have to worry about updates. I can go to the web and access tax software to do my return, so it`s convenient. All the products I know about use secure connections. If you`re transmitting your return to the IRS, it`s via secure connection, so the data is secure. All the companies that I know about guard your information very, very well, because we want to protect your privacy.</p><p>GURVEY: Even with the tax software, I haven`t sent in my return yet. How about you? Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>PRATT: That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, March 22. I`m Suzanne Pratt. Good night everyone and good night to you, Paul.</p><p>KANGAS: Good night, Suzanne.

I'm Tom  Hudson.  Susie is off tonight.  A rescue for Knight Capital today.  The  trading firm stays in business thanks to a $400 million investment.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Erika Miller reports tonight on a takeover offer for Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY).  The founder of the struggling electronics retail chain wants  to take it private.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the Mars rover has landed on the red planet.  We'll see what U.S.  companies hope to gain by signing on to the mission.  That and more coming  up tonight here on NBR.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We begin with this, a $400 million lifeline today for Knight Capital.   It's a company that makes some of the plumbing of the U.S. stock market.   The market maker has been fighting to survive since a trading software  update went hay-wire last week, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars  in losses, its stock price cut by two-thirds and now a rescue by some of  its competitors.  </p><p>The deal by a half dozen Wall Street firms to invest in Knight allowed  the company to, quote, resume normal operations immediately, end quote,  according to Knight.  Those behind the $400 million deal are investment  banking firms Jefferies, Stephens and Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF), private  equity giant Blackstone, trading competitor Getco and customer TD  Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD).  Ameritrade was one of Knight's big customers  that stopped doing business with it after Wednesday's trading trouble.   Ameritrade has since returned as have other big customers.  </p><p>As for its investment in Knight, an Ameritrade spokesperson tells NBR,  quote, we have an interest in preserving choice and competition in the  markets, end quote.  Knight Capital matches buyers and sellers of thousands  of stocks and billions of shares.  It also buys and sells stocks itself,  helping keep money flowing.  So when it's new trading software had a  problem, the firm was stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in losing  trades.  That sent shareholders fleeing, driving down its stock price,  leading Knight to look for help.  But the assistance comes at the expense  of diluting current shareholders' interest.  That pressured Knight stock  today, down 24 percent.  Knight's rescuers get preferred stock that may be  converted to common stock at $1.50 per share plus a 2 percent dividend.   The deal represents a 73 percent stake in the company.  The investor group  also gets three new seats on the board of directors.  </p><p>HUDSON:  All this week at NBR, we're looking at you, the everyday  investor and what problems like the one at Knight Capital are doing to  investor confidence.  You may remember the last time a computer system sent  the stock prices spiraling.  It happened back in May 2010 and was called  the flash crash.  It led to new rules on when firms get a do-over after a  computer error.  Knight asked for just such a do-over, pleading with the  Securities and Exchange Commission to be released from mistaken trades.   The answer back, no.  Darren Gersh tonight reports on the firm line from  Washington.  </p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   This is really  a story about a bailout that didn't happen.  Knight Capital Group  (NYSE:KCG) asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for special help.   Stock exchange rules set strict limits on when trades can be reversed.  In  Knight's case, the rules say trades made by mistake that are more than 30  percent off of the real market price can be undone.  Knight wanted more  trades busted, but regulators said no.  The message was clear.  </p><p>JAMES ANGEL, FINANCE PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY:  Once you make  a trade, unless something has gone incredibly wrong, your word is your  bond.  You make a trade, you are expected to live up to it.  </p><p>GERSH:  People familiar with the matter say regulators are sending a  clear message to investors:  the rules on erroneous trades are meant to  provide markets with certainty and they worked in this case.  Another  message:  firms need to have incentives to be careful and what happened to  Knight is a big incentive.  </p><p>ANGEL:  Right now I think that every IT manager is going to his boss  and saying, give me a bigger budget so I make sure this isn't going to  happen here.  </p><p>GERSH:  But that does not reassure critics who fear Wall Street firms  have created computer systems they can't control.  </p><p>DENNIS KELLEHER, CEO, BETTER MARKETS:  It is not a glitch when in less  than 30 minutes over 150 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange vary wildly  in purchases and sales and prices and there's essentially haywire in the  markets.  That's not a glitch.  That's a huge problem.  It's a red flag and  people better start paying attention.  </p><p>GERSH:  While the SEC took a tough line with Knight Capital, there are  growing concerns about the ability of regulators to police the Street.  </p><p>KELLEHER:  Regulators and regulation generally can't keep up with  what's going on in the markets.  It's just that simple.  Now one of the  main reasons for that is that there is a fairly massive effort led by Wall  Street and its allies to de-fund the agencies so they can prevent them from  putting financial reform into place.  </p><p>GERSH:  Before the computer mistake, Knight Capital handled 20 percent  of the trading in stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  It was well-respected  and innovative and all that blew up in less than half an hour.  Darren  Gersh, NBR, Washington.  </p><p>HUDSON:  (INAUDIBLE) Just the latest reminder of how technology  continues to reshape the investment market.  As part of our coverage this  week, join the discussion online on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter,  bizrpt.  How confident are you in the technology that powers the market?   Will it change how you trade and invest because of the technology?   Join  us online.  </p><p>On Wall Street today meantime, investors helped the major averages to  finish a fresh three-month highs tonight, despite some selling in Knight  Capital shares as we mentioned.  The Dow Industrials rising 21 points, the  NASDAQ up 22, the S&amp;P 500 gained three points.  One other quick note here  about policing the markets. A major British bank was accused today of  hiding over 60,000 illegal transactions with Iran over the past decade.   Those transactions made by Standard Charter PLC were valued at over $250  billion.  New York State's department of financial services threatened to  revoke the bank's U.S. license today and called it a quote, rogue  institution.  Standard Charter meantime said it's reviewing its compliance  with U.S. banking sanctions.  </p><p>A billion dollar plus bet could be paying off much sooner than Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) had hoped.  One week into the media company's NBC  Olympics coverage and it may actually turn a profit.  NBC has been hit by  the usual number of criticisms, too much focus on the Americans, not enough  live coverage, hasn't hurt the television audience numbers here in the U.S.  though. Through the first 10 days of coverage - look at this - Comcast's  Olympic ratings averaged 33.6 million viewers. That's up 12 percent from  Beijing, 28 percent higher than the Athens games in 2004.  </p><p>Porter Bibb is back with us, managing partner at Mediatech Capital  Partners at the NASDAQ.  Porter, is it something that Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is doing with its coverage of the games or is it  the games themselves?</p><p>PORTER BIBB, MANAGING PARTNER, MEDIATECH CAPITAL PARTNERS:  I think  it's mostly the games themselves and it's the fact that there's not a lot  else going on right now in the dog days of the summer of 2012.  Basically  it's the fact that this Olympics has drawn a tremendous amount of attention  from the public and it's reflected in these numbers which are historic.   They've never ever had such great ratings any television broadcast since  1960 when CBS (NYSE:CBS) first broadcast the Rome Olympics.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Talk to us about the opportunities here then.  This  opportunity comes at a significant cost, more than a billion dollars  invested.  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) sold a billion dollars worth  of advertising.  Can it go back to its advertisers and ask for more money  now that the ratings are in?</p><p>BIBB:  They did get a little bit of a premium when they exceed the  ratings, yes.  But the biggest advertiser, interestingly enough on this  Olympic tenure is NBC.  Every third or fourth commercial is promoting an  NBC series that's going to be breaking this fall and they're hoping to  shore up their ratings throughout the year because NBC has been wallowing  in the cellar behind all of the other major networks for the last seven  years.  </p><p>HUDSON:  I want to talk about the investor in the Olympics here before  we get to the broader NBC picture.  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) has  estimated a $200 million profit.  It spent about $1.2 billion for the  rights it has to pay to produce the programs.  Is this a good return on  investment for shareholders?  </p><p>BIBB:  It's never been a good return in terms of bottom line, but it's  considered by the TV executives in the suites to be the best promotion for  their networks that money can buy.  It rivals the Super Bowl and the way  the Oscars used to command this kind of an audience but don't anymore.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Certainly, shareholders are being attracted to this stock,  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) shares at a 52-week high even with this  billion dollar plus investment.  </p><p>BIBB:  You have to realize that NBC television is a very small part of  the Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) empire.  They're the largest cable  systems operators in the country, in the world in fact and they're also the  largest Internet service providers.  They reap huge profits from NBC  Universal (NYSE:UVV) cable channels, not just television networks.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Is that the way you leverage then the next Olympic games?  Is  that the lesson here?  </p><p>BIBB:  They have bought this Olympics and the summer and winter  Olympics in 2020 and they expect that they will have to change the model  because the next Rio in 2016 is going to be an online digital Internet, not  like this one.  These decisions that NBC made were two and a half years ago  when they acquired the rights and they didn't anticipate the iPad and the  profusion of smart phones that are out there. And their Internet delivery  is really patchy.  It's not very good, but it will be by the time they get  to Rio for sure.  </p><p>HUDSON:  That's going to be the big change for the next summer games  in four years.  Do you have any position in Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)  (NYSE:CCS) by the way, Porter?  </p><p>BIBB:  None.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Porter Bibb along with us here watching the Olympics and  commenting on the coverage, Mediatech Capital Partners.  </p><p>Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) founder and former chairman wants his stores back.   Richard Schulze has offered to take the struggling electronics retail chain  private.  The offer is $24 to $26 per share.  Now the higher price, it  values the company at just over $8.8 billion.  Erika Miller tonight in  Manhattan joining us with what could be one of the biggest buyouts in  recent years of an American retailer.  </p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  That's right.   Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) founder has made a generous offer for the stores but he  still faces an uphill battle getting the board to approve it.  In a public  letter addressed to Best Buy's board, Richard Schulze says quote, bold and  extensive changes are needed for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) to return to market  leadership.  He is proposing to buy out the company, using his own money,  private equity funds and some debt.  So would going public (sic) be the  right strategy for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY)?  </p><p>RJ HOTTOVY, SR. RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR:  It may make sense for  Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) to be a privately held company, especially if you have  the backing of a private equity company with retail and turnaround  experience.  Frankly, this company has got a lot of work ahead of them to  stay competitive and stay relevant in the eyes of consumers.  </p><p>MILLER: It's a moment of truth for the retail electronics chain  Schulze founded in 1966.  Part of Best Buy's problem is so-called  showrooming.  That's when customers browse the store, but actually place  their orders elsewhere, often at online sites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).   An even bigger issue is the enormous size of most stores, a relic of a  bygone era.  </p><p>HOTTOVY:  In the early part of the 90's through the early part of the  2000s, really consumers had no problem.  They were shopping in stores for  TVs, video games, CDs were all a big part of their consumer electronics  budget.  But as that shifted to a digital distribution format over the last  several years, it has left a gaping hole in Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) stores.  </p><p>MILLER:  Schulze will clearly face big challenges turning the offer  into a deal.  First, he needs to get the approval of all Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) board members before signing a deal with private equity  partners.  He will likely have trouble getting the support of interim CEO  Mike Mikan, who is gunning for a permanent position at the helm.  Second,  Schulze will have to detail his turnaround plans, which are vague at this  point.  The third issue is money.  The board will likely try to get a  higher offer, if it supports a deal at all and that could make it harder  for Schulze to secure financing.  And don't forget Schulze was elbowed out  as chairman in the spring, after an internal audit found he knew former CEO  Brian Dunn was having an inappropriate relationship with a female employee.   That alone is unlikely to be a deal breaker.  But it may mean some board  member resistance to putting him back in charge.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Erika is in New York tonight as we mentioned.  So, why does  Schulze make this offer in public?  Why not negotiate privately with the  board?  </p><p>MILLER:   In his letter, Schulze said he would have preferred to have  private negotiations, but the board was dragging its feet, so he felt he  had no choice but to take his campaign public and hope that Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) shareholders would support him.  </p><p>HUDSON:  It certainly caused a bit of a ruckus in the stock as we'll  mention in a moment.  But what happens now?  What's the next step?  What  can we expect to hear, when can we hear from the board?  </p><p>MILLER:  It's unclear at this point.  All that we know is that Best  Buy (NYSE:BBY) will confirm its made the offer, but don't know when it will  respond.  </p><p>HUDSON:   We are coming into a key time for retailers like Best Buys,  holidays right around the corner, turnarounds are easier said than done  this time of year.  What does is need to do to discourage the showrooming,  the shopping and actually and turn the shopping into buying?  </p><p>MILLER:   Best Buy's biggest problem is its format, 50,000 square feet  on average of retail space just doesn't make sense any more.  It needs to  go to a smaller format store.  That's its biggest challenge.  But it also  needs to emphasize its most profitable product lines.  We're talking about  things like mobile phones.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Erika Miller tonight in New York on Best Buy (NYSE:BBY).   Thanks, Erika.  From electronic retailing to auto sales, July was a  disappointing month of sales for General Motors (NYSE:GM) at home.  Not so  in China though.  The U.S. auto maker set a sales record there last month.   But the road ahead in China could be dicey for GM and other auto companies.   Diane Eastabrook has details.  </p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  GM bucked  fears of a slowing economy in China last month by selling 15 percent more  vehicles there than it did during the same month last year.  Among the  biggest sellers for GM were Buick Excel models.  While auto sales in China  have been strong compared to last year, they've actually been declining  month over month this year, a possible sign of a cooling Chinese economy.   June sales slid nearly 2.5 percent from May and sales were also down the  two months before that.  Still U.S. auto manufacturers are betting big on  China.  GM is the market leader, selling more than 2.5 million vehicles  there last year primarily through joint ventures.  Ford is increasing its  exposure there as well, planning to add six new plants in China that will  produce more than a million vehicles by 2015.  Diane Eastabrook, NBR,  Chicago.  </p><p>HUDSON:  In our \"Market Focus,\" Some modest gains driving the U.S.  major stock indices up to three-month highs tonight.  We begin with the  intraday S&amp;P 500 starting out with the index jumping on the heels of some  decent gains we saw overnight in European and Asian markets.  No headline  economic data today as the buying cooled somewhat into the closing bell.   The index finished up a fraction.  But it was enough for it to continue the  trend since June of higher highs and higher lows.  This is the S&amp;P 500's  highest close since May 2nd.  Trading volume meantime backing off from  Friday's pace, 645 million shares on the big board, just over one and a  half billion on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>It was a mixed market, six of the 10 major stock sectors were higher.   Material stocks leading the gainers, up 1.1 percent.  Technology added 0.7  of a percent and it was steel stocks behind today's gain in the materials  sector.  Many of these manufacturers have struggled under weaker building  demand and lower pricing.  But we have seen some buying lately after a  string of better than expected earnings and some of the stocks also hitting  recent lows.  </p><p>U.S. Steel up today 5.6 percent, Titanium Metals (NYSE:TIE) rallying  4.5 percent.  Both of these tonight are at their highest prices since mid- May.  Cliff's Natural Resources added 2.7 percent.  Today was the first  Monday since May that the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a gain.  Two  of the top 3 percentage gainers in fact for the Dow in the tech industry.   HPQ, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) up 2.4 percent.  This buying comes after HP  sank to a seven and a half year low late last week.  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)  the other big tech stock on the Dow that's been under pressure and shares  gained 2.1 percent, although volume was lighter than usual during today's  buying of CSCO.  </p><p>The biggest meat processor in the U.S., Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), may  have to turn to Brazil for corn.  The company put that option on the table  today thanks to the continued drought throughout the Midwestern U.S.  It  comes after Tyson reported weaker than expected earnings, coming in $0.04  below estimates.  Its beef business saw lower demand thanks to the  controversy over a ground beef additive called pink slime by critics.   Falling pork prices hurt that business in Tyson as well.  The company went  on to lower its revenue outlook for the year.  That hit shares, falling  eight percent.  Volume was more than three times normal for TSN.  This in  fact tonight is a new 52-week low for Tyson.  </p><p>Shares of semi-truck maker Navistar hit the gas, after Federal  regulators, environmental regulators submitted a final rule allowing, that  may allow the company to continue to pay fines and still sell engines that  do not meet EPA guidelines.  The stock has been under pressure as it has  been threatened with losing the ability to sell these new engines that  don't meet current emissions standards.  The details of today's final  ruling were not disclosed.  Shares jumped 10 percent though.  An interim  rule allowed Navistart to continue with its sales if it paid a fine.  </p><p>All five of the most actively traded ETF's seeing some modest gains.   The biggest for the Russell 2000 and NASDAQ 100 track funds.  And that is  tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>The virtual world of the Internet has changed businesses from  newspapers to retailing.  But the real world of video games continues to  favor established names and not new-comers.  That is tonight's \"Word on the  Street\"  -- gaming.  Debra Borchardt, markets analyst at thestreet.com with  us at the NASDAQ.  Deborah, first of all explain the business model  differences between the new digital gaming versus more traditional video  games?  </p><p>DEBRA BORCHARDT, MARKETS ANALYST, THESTREET.COM:  Well, a lot of the  digital gamers, the way that they earn money is putting advertising within  the games or trying to get you to pay for different additional items like  points and that type of model.  But they're finding that people really just  want to play their games on their phones for free.  They're called snacking  games.  You just play them for a little bit of a time when you're standing  in line, you're waiting in a restaurant, something like that.  So you  really don't want to pay any additional money, whereas your traditional  game company like an Activision or an EA, they make their money off one  upfront buying the game which is pretty expensive.  But they've now  determined ways to upsell you so that you can go and charge more for  additional accessories to the game.  </p><p>HUDSON:  You can have a multitude of revenue sources in the language  of an MBA student here.  So the new generation is perhaps best illustrated  by Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), ZNGA, big business through facebook, and this stock  has just been a disaster since its IPO, new lows last week here.  Farmville  is not working out for it.  Is the new model broken?</p><p>BORCHARDT:  Well it really is for Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) because they've  got all their playing time on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)  has started to push the old titles down in prominence and Zynga  (NASDAQ:ZNGA) hasn't got a new title to get in new revenue.  So as  Farmville loses its attraction, it has to come up with a new name to  attract new players.  So it's getting hurt with this relationship with  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and also by not having a new hit name.  </p><p>HUDSON:  But it's not alone in that. Even traditional video game  companies like Activision also are looked at as what's new, what's next?   Activision for instance had a pretty decent quarter earnings-wise, a third  of its sales coming through its digital channel to cut out the retail  space, nice bigger margins there.  But yet the stock sold off significantly  last week and rebounded a bit today.  </p><p>BORCHARDT:   Right.  They were beat up because they said that their  second quarter net income fell.  Some user were - some investors were  concerned that the users for \"World of Warcraft\" had dropped.   But here's  the thing.  They have new titles coming up this fall.  They're going to  making it to the holidays and this is what's interesting.  Here you've got  Farmville with Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and you can't really update it.  They  haven't really figured out how to built a franchise.  The established  companies were beat up for having franchises, but that's then the big  payoff.  \"Call of Duty,\"  \"Black Ops\" is coming out, (INAUDIBLE) Giant.\"    These titles just keep paying off.  Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) has  \"Madden.\"  </p><p>HUDSON:  Debra, do you own any positions in these stocks?  </p><p>BORCHARDT:  No, I don't.  </p><p>HUDSON:  But we're going to guess you're a gamer nonetheless.  Debra  Borchardt along with us.  She's with the street.com.  </p><p>Congress has fled Washington, DC for a five-week summer recess,  despite little progress on a host of bills covering everything from  extending the Bush-era tax cuts to interim drought relief and Internet  security.  Tonight's commentary says don't blame the G-word for all that  interaction or rather inaction.  She's Veronique de Rugy, senior research  fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.  </p><p>VERONIQUE DE RUGY, SR. RSCH. FELLOW, MERCATUS CENTER, GEORGE MASON  UNIVERSITY:  What's really the problem in Washington?  Well, if you ask  Washington, they'll tell you it's gridlock and blame inaction on some new  and hyper-partisan or ideological era.  But while gridlock might be blamed  for slowing things down, it can't be blamed for failing to address serious  issues.  Welfare reform and balanced budgets in the 1990s were the product  of gridlock that slowly gave way to consensus.  And today's Washington is  more than happy to come together when it suits its own interests.  </p><p>For instance, just last week, Congress managed bipartisan support for  another continuing resolution, an agreement that allows the legislators to,  once again, put off doing any real fiscal planning.  In fact, Congress  hasn't managed to produce a Federal budget in more than three years.   Washington's problem is not gridlock.  It is an increasingly irresponsible  government that has for far too long been let off the hook for performing  the most basic responsibilities.  So, whatever happens in November, this  much is certain:  unless taxpayers demand their president and Congress act  responsibly and do the work they were elected to do, so-called Washington  gridlock will be the least of our problems.  I'm Veronique de Rugy.  </p><p>HUDSON:  You can find some progress in outer space.  NASA's rover  \"Curiosity\" tonight on the surface of the red planet.  \"Curiosity\" pierced  Mars' atmosphere traveling at 13,000 miles per hour, safely touched down  after slowing to a mere two miles per hour.  It began transmitting photos  right away.  Ruben Ramirez tonight reports on the partnership between  government and business that made \"Curiosity\" possible.  </p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big  question of course, is there, or, has there ever been life on Mars?  Well,  this week starts a two-year, $2.5 billion mission on the red planet to try  and find the answer.  Nearly three years behind schedule and almost a  billion dollars over budget, NASA's \"Curiosity\" rover landed safely on  Mars.  It's the largest and most advanced spacecraft ever sent to outer  space.  Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics  (NYSE:GD) and Siemens were just some of the companies that participated in  the project.  Siemens licensed its 3D modeling technology to NASA's jet  propulsion lab to help cut prototype costs.  </p><p>TONY AFFUSO, CHAIRMAN, SIEMENS PLM SOFTWARE:  These techniques between  public and private and the way that they can share costs, share risks and  collaborate around technology is a great way to bring all the resources to  bear.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  According to NASA, the public private partnership created  about 7,000 jobs at various times during the eight years it took to develop  the rover.  And, unlike in past decades of space exploration, in true  social media fashion, you can follow the rover on Twitter at Marscuriosity.   Ruben Ramirez, NBR, Washington.  </p><p>HUDSON:  The red planet to Wall Street and Main Street. That is  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday, August 6.  Thanks for joining us.

I'm Tom Hudson. Susie is off tonight. A rescue for Knight Capital today. The trading firm stays in business thanks to a $400 million investment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Erika Miller reports tonight on a takeover offer for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). The founder of the struggling electronics retail chain wants to take it private.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the Mars rover has landed on the red planet. We'll see what U.S. companies hope to gain by signing on to the mission. That and more coming up tonight here on NBR.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We begin with this, a $400 million lifeline today for Knight Capital. It's a company that makes some of the plumbing of the U.S. stock market. The market maker has been fighting to survive since a trading software update went hay-wire last week, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, its stock price cut by two-thirds and now a rescue by some of its competitors.</p><p>The deal by a half dozen Wall Street firms to invest in Knight allowed the company to, quote, resume normal operations immediately, end quote, according to Knight. Those behind the $400 million deal are investment banking firms Jefferies, Stephens and Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF), private equity giant Blackstone, trading competitor Getco and customer TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD). Ameritrade was one of Knight's big customers that stopped doing business with it after Wednesday's trading trouble. Ameritrade has since returned as have other big customers.</p><p>As for its investment in Knight, an Ameritrade spokesperson tells NBR, quote, we have an interest in preserving choice and competition in the markets, end quote. Knight Capital matches buyers and sellers of thousands of stocks and billions of shares. It also buys and sells stocks itself, helping keep money flowing. So when it's new trading software had a problem, the firm was stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in losing trades. That sent shareholders fleeing, driving down its stock price, leading Knight to look for help. But the assistance comes at the expense of diluting current shareholders' interest. That pressured Knight stock today, down 24 percent. Knight's rescuers get preferred stock that may be converted to common stock at $1.50 per share plus a 2 percent dividend. The deal represents a 73 percent stake in the company. The investor group also gets three new seats on the board of directors.</p><p>HUDSON: All this week at NBR, we're looking at you, the everyday investor and what problems like the one at Knight Capital are doing to investor confidence. You may remember the last time a computer system sent the stock prices spiraling. It happened back in May 2010 and was called the flash crash. It led to new rules on when firms get a do-over after a computer error. Knight asked for just such a do-over, pleading with the Securities and Exchange Commission to be released from mistaken trades. The answer back, no. Darren Gersh tonight reports on the firm line from Washington.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This is really a story about a bailout that didn't happen. Knight Capital Group (NYSE:KCG) asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for special help. Stock exchange rules set strict limits on when trades can be reversed. In Knight's case, the rules say trades made by mistake that are more than 30 percent off of the real market price can be undone. Knight wanted more trades busted, but regulators said no. The message was clear.</p><p>JAMES ANGEL, FINANCE PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Once you make a trade, unless something has gone incredibly wrong, your word is your bond. You make a trade, you are expected to live up to it.</p><p>GERSH: People familiar with the matter say regulators are sending a clear message to investors: the rules on erroneous trades are meant to provide markets with certainty and they worked in this case. Another message: firms need to have incentives to be careful and what happened to Knight is a big incentive.</p><p>ANGEL: Right now I think that every IT manager is going to his boss and saying, give me a bigger budget so I make sure this isn't going to happen here.</p><p>GERSH: But that does not reassure critics who fear Wall Street firms have created computer systems they can't control.</p><p>DENNIS KELLEHER, CEO, BETTER MARKETS: It is not a glitch when in less than 30 minutes over 150 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange vary wildly in purchases and sales and prices and there's essentially haywire in the markets. That's not a glitch. That's a huge problem. It's a red flag and people better start paying attention.</p><p>GERSH: While the SEC took a tough line with Knight Capital, there are growing concerns about the ability of regulators to police the Street.</p><p>KELLEHER: Regulators and regulation generally can't keep up with what's going on in the markets. It's just that simple. Now one of the main reasons for that is that there is a fairly massive effort led by Wall Street and its allies to de-fund the agencies so they can prevent them from putting financial reform into place.</p><p>GERSH: Before the computer mistake, Knight Capital handled 20 percent of the trading in stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was well-respected and innovative and all that blew up in less than half an hour. Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: (INAUDIBLE) Just the latest reminder of how technology continues to reshape the investment market. As part of our coverage this week, join the discussion online on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter, bizrpt. How confident are you in the technology that powers the market? Will it change how you trade and invest because of the technology? Join us online.</p><p>On Wall Street today meantime, investors helped the major averages to finish a fresh three-month highs tonight, despite some selling in Knight Capital shares as we mentioned. The Dow Industrials rising 21 points, the NASDAQ up 22, the S&amp;P 500 gained three points. One other quick note here about policing the markets. A major British bank was accused today of hiding over 60,000 illegal transactions with Iran over the past decade. Those transactions made by Standard Charter PLC were valued at over $250 billion. New York State's department of financial services threatened to revoke the bank's U.S. license today and called it a quote, rogue institution. Standard Charter meantime said it's reviewing its compliance with U.S. banking sanctions.</p><p>A billion dollar plus bet could be paying off much sooner than Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) had hoped. One week into the media company's NBC Olympics coverage and it may actually turn a profit. NBC has been hit by the usual number of criticisms, too much focus on the Americans, not enough live coverage, hasn't hurt the television audience numbers here in the U.S. though. Through the first 10 days of coverage - look at this - Comcast's Olympic ratings averaged 33.6 million viewers. That's up 12 percent from Beijing, 28 percent higher than the Athens games in 2004.</p><p>Porter Bibb is back with us, managing partner at Mediatech Capital Partners at the NASDAQ. Porter, is it something that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is doing with its coverage of the games or is it the games themselves?</p><p>PORTER BIBB, MANAGING PARTNER, MEDIATECH CAPITAL PARTNERS: I think it's mostly the games themselves and it's the fact that there's not a lot else going on right now in the dog days of the summer of 2012. Basically it's the fact that this Olympics has drawn a tremendous amount of attention from the public and it's reflected in these numbers which are historic. They've never ever had such great ratings any television broadcast since 1960 when CBS (NYSE:CBS) first broadcast the Rome Olympics.</p><p>HUDSON: Talk to us about the opportunities here then. This opportunity comes at a significant cost, more than a billion dollars invested. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) sold a billion dollars worth of advertising. Can it go back to its advertisers and ask for more money now that the ratings are in?</p><p>BIBB: They did get a little bit of a premium when they exceed the ratings, yes. But the biggest advertiser, interestingly enough on this Olympic tenure is NBC. Every third or fourth commercial is promoting an NBC series that's going to be breaking this fall and they're hoping to shore up their ratings throughout the year because NBC has been wallowing in the cellar behind all of the other major networks for the last seven years.</p><p>HUDSON: I want to talk about the investor in the Olympics here before we get to the broader NBC picture. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) has estimated a $200 million profit. It spent about $1.2 billion for the rights it has to pay to produce the programs. Is this a good return on investment for shareholders?</p><p>BIBB: It's never been a good return in terms of bottom line, but it's considered by the TV executives in the suites to be the best promotion for their networks that money can buy. It rivals the Super Bowl and the way the Oscars used to command this kind of an audience but don't anymore.</p><p>HUDSON: Certainly, shareholders are being attracted to this stock, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) shares at a 52-week high even with this billion dollar plus investment.</p><p>BIBB: You have to realize that NBC television is a very small part of the Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) empire. They're the largest cable systems operators in the country, in the world in fact and they're also the largest Internet service providers. They reap huge profits from NBC Universal (NYSE:UVV) cable channels, not just television networks.</p><p>HUDSON: Is that the way you leverage then the next Olympic games? Is that the lesson here?</p><p>BIBB: They have bought this Olympics and the summer and winter Olympics in 2020 and they expect that they will have to change the model because the next Rio in 2016 is going to be an online digital Internet, not like this one. These decisions that NBC made were two and a half years ago when they acquired the rights and they didn't anticipate the iPad and the profusion of smart phones that are out there. And their Internet delivery is really patchy. It's not very good, but it will be by the time they get to Rio for sure.</p><p>HUDSON: That's going to be the big change for the next summer games in four years. Do you have any position in Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) by the way, Porter?</p><p>BIBB: None.</p><p>HUDSON: Porter Bibb along with us here watching the Olympics and commenting on the coverage, Mediatech Capital Partners.</p><p>Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) founder and former chairman wants his stores back. Richard Schulze has offered to take the struggling electronics retail chain private. The offer is $24 to $26 per share. Now the higher price, it values the company at just over $8.8 billion. Erika Miller tonight in Manhattan joining us with what could be one of the biggest buyouts in recent years of an American retailer.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) founder has made a generous offer for the stores but he still faces an uphill battle getting the board to approve it. In a public letter addressed to Best Buy's board, Richard Schulze says quote, bold and extensive changes are needed for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) to return to market leadership. He is proposing to buy out the company, using his own money, private equity funds and some debt. So would going public (sic) be the right strategy for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY)?</p><p>RJ HOTTOVY, SR. RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: It may make sense for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) to be a privately held company, especially if you have the backing of a private equity company with retail and turnaround experience. Frankly, this company has got a lot of work ahead of them to stay competitive and stay relevant in the eyes of consumers.</p><p>MILLER: It's a moment of truth for the retail electronics chain Schulze founded in 1966. Part of Best Buy's problem is so-called showrooming. That's when customers browse the store, but actually place their orders elsewhere, often at online sites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). An even bigger issue is the enormous size of most stores, a relic of a bygone era.</p><p>HOTTOVY: In the early part of the 90's through the early part of the 2000s, really consumers had no problem. They were shopping in stores for TVs, video games, CDs were all a big part of their consumer electronics budget. But as that shifted to a digital distribution format over the last several years, it has left a gaping hole in Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) stores.</p><p>MILLER: Schulze will clearly face big challenges turning the offer into a deal. First, he needs to get the approval of all Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) board members before signing a deal with private equity partners. He will likely have trouble getting the support of interim CEO Mike Mikan, who is gunning for a permanent position at the helm. Second, Schulze will have to detail his turnaround plans, which are vague at this point. The third issue is money. The board will likely try to get a higher offer, if it supports a deal at all and that could make it harder for Schulze to secure financing. And don't forget Schulze was elbowed out as chairman in the spring, after an internal audit found he knew former CEO Brian Dunn was having an inappropriate relationship with a female employee. That alone is unlikely to be a deal breaker. But it may mean some board member resistance to putting him back in charge.</p><p>HUDSON: Erika is in New York tonight as we mentioned. So, why does Schulze make this offer in public? Why not negotiate privately with the board?</p><p>MILLER: In his letter, Schulze said he would have preferred to have private negotiations, but the board was dragging its feet, so he felt he had no choice but to take his campaign public and hope that Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) shareholders would support him.</p><p>HUDSON: It certainly caused a bit of a ruckus in the stock as we'll mention in a moment. But what happens now? What's the next step? What can we expect to hear, when can we hear from the board?</p><p>MILLER: It's unclear at this point. All that we know is that Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) will confirm its made the offer, but don't know when it will respond.</p><p>HUDSON: We are coming into a key time for retailers like Best Buys, holidays right around the corner, turnarounds are easier said than done this time of year. What does is need to do to discourage the showrooming, the shopping and actually and turn the shopping into buying?</p><p>MILLER: Best Buy's biggest problem is its format, 50,000 square feet on average of retail space just doesn't make sense any more. It needs to go to a smaller format store. That's its biggest challenge. But it also needs to emphasize its most profitable product lines. We're talking about things like mobile phones.</p><p>HUDSON: Erika Miller tonight in New York on Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). Thanks, Erika. From electronic retailing to auto sales, July was a disappointing month of sales for General Motors (NYSE:GM) at home. Not so in China though. The U.S. auto maker set a sales record there last month. But the road ahead in China could be dicey for GM and other auto companies. Diane Eastabrook has details.</p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: GM bucked fears of a slowing economy in China last month by selling 15 percent more vehicles there than it did during the same month last year. Among the biggest sellers for GM were Buick Excel models. While auto sales in China have been strong compared to last year, they've actually been declining month over month this year, a possible sign of a cooling Chinese economy. June sales slid nearly 2.5 percent from May and sales were also down the two months before that. Still U.S. auto manufacturers are betting big on China. GM is the market leader, selling more than 2.5 million vehicles there last year primarily through joint ventures. Ford is increasing its exposure there as well, planning to add six new plants in China that will produce more than a million vehicles by 2015. Diane Eastabrook, NBR, Chicago.</p><p>HUDSON: In our \"Market Focus,\" Some modest gains driving the U.S. major stock indices up to three-month highs tonight. We begin with the intraday S&amp;P 500 starting out with the index jumping on the heels of some decent gains we saw overnight in European and Asian markets. No headline economic data today as the buying cooled somewhat into the closing bell. The index finished up a fraction. But it was enough for it to continue the trend since June of higher highs and higher lows. This is the S&amp;P 500's highest close since May 2nd. Trading volume meantime backing off from Friday's pace, 645 million shares on the big board, just over one and a half billion on the NASDAQ.</p><p>It was a mixed market, six of the 10 major stock sectors were higher. Material stocks leading the gainers, up 1.1 percent. Technology added 0.7 of a percent and it was steel stocks behind today's gain in the materials sector. Many of these manufacturers have struggled under weaker building demand and lower pricing. But we have seen some buying lately after a string of better than expected earnings and some of the stocks also hitting recent lows.</p><p>U.S. Steel up today 5.6 percent, Titanium Metals (NYSE:TIE) rallying 4.5 percent. Both of these tonight are at their highest prices since mid- May. Cliff's Natural Resources added 2.7 percent. Today was the first Monday since May that the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a gain. Two of the top 3 percentage gainers in fact for the Dow in the tech industry. HPQ, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) up 2.4 percent. This buying comes after HP sank to a seven and a half year low late last week. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) the other big tech stock on the Dow that's been under pressure and shares gained 2.1 percent, although volume was lighter than usual during today's buying of CSCO.</p><p>The biggest meat processor in the U.S., Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), may have to turn to Brazil for corn. The company put that option on the table today thanks to the continued drought throughout the Midwestern U.S. It comes after Tyson reported weaker than expected earnings, coming in $0.04 below estimates. Its beef business saw lower demand thanks to the controversy over a ground beef additive called pink slime by critics. Falling pork prices hurt that business in Tyson as well. The company went on to lower its revenue outlook for the year. That hit shares, falling eight percent. Volume was more than three times normal for TSN. This in fact tonight is a new 52-week low for Tyson.</p><p>Shares of semi-truck maker Navistar hit the gas, after Federal regulators, environmental regulators submitted a final rule allowing, that may allow the company to continue to pay fines and still sell engines that do not meet EPA guidelines. The stock has been under pressure as it has been threatened with losing the ability to sell these new engines that don't meet current emissions standards. The details of today's final ruling were not disclosed. Shares jumped 10 percent though. An interim rule allowed Navistart to continue with its sales if it paid a fine.</p><p>All five of the most actively traded ETF's seeing some modest gains. The biggest for the Russell 2000 and NASDAQ 100 track funds. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>The virtual world of the Internet has changed businesses from newspapers to retailing. But the real world of video games continues to favor established names and not new-comers. That is tonight's \"Word on the Street\" -- gaming. Debra Borchardt, markets analyst at thestreet.com with us at the NASDAQ. Deborah, first of all explain the business model differences between the new digital gaming versus more traditional video games?</p><p>DEBRA BORCHARDT, MARKETS ANALYST, THESTREET.COM: Well, a lot of the digital gamers, the way that they earn money is putting advertising within the games or trying to get you to pay for different additional items like points and that type of model. But they're finding that people really just want to play their games on their phones for free. They're called snacking games. You just play them for a little bit of a time when you're standing in line, you're waiting in a restaurant, something like that. So you really don't want to pay any additional money, whereas your traditional game company like an Activision or an EA, they make their money off one upfront buying the game which is pretty expensive. But they've now determined ways to upsell you so that you can go and charge more for additional accessories to the game.</p><p>HUDSON: You can have a multitude of revenue sources in the language of an MBA student here. So the new generation is perhaps best illustrated by Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), ZNGA, big business through facebook, and this stock has just been a disaster since its IPO, new lows last week here. Farmville is not working out for it. Is the new model broken?</p><p>BORCHARDT: Well it really is for Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) because they've got all their playing time on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has started to push the old titles down in prominence and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) hasn't got a new title to get in new revenue. So as Farmville loses its attraction, it has to come up with a new name to attract new players. So it's getting hurt with this relationship with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and also by not having a new hit name.</p><p>HUDSON: But it's not alone in that. Even traditional video game companies like Activision also are looked at as what's new, what's next? Activision for instance had a pretty decent quarter earnings-wise, a third of its sales coming through its digital channel to cut out the retail space, nice bigger margins there. But yet the stock sold off significantly last week and rebounded a bit today.</p><p>BORCHARDT: Right. They were beat up because they said that their second quarter net income fell. Some user were - some investors were concerned that the users for \"World of Warcraft\" had dropped. But here's the thing. They have new titles coming up this fall. They're going to making it to the holidays and this is what's interesting. Here you've got Farmville with Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and you can't really update it. They haven't really figured out how to built a franchise. The established companies were beat up for having franchises, but that's then the big payoff. \"Call of Duty,\" \"Black Ops\" is coming out, (INAUDIBLE) Giant.\" These titles just keep paying off. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) has \"Madden.\"</p><p>HUDSON: Debra, do you own any positions in these stocks?</p><p>BORCHARDT: No, I don't.</p><p>HUDSON: But we're going to guess you're a gamer nonetheless. Debra Borchardt along with us. She's with the street.com.</p><p>Congress has fled Washington, DC for a five-week summer recess, despite little progress on a host of bills covering everything from extending the Bush-era tax cuts to interim drought relief and Internet security. Tonight's commentary says don't blame the G-word for all that interaction or rather inaction. She's Veronique de Rugy, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.</p><p>VERONIQUE DE RUGY, SR. RSCH. FELLOW, MERCATUS CENTER, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY: What's really the problem in Washington? Well, if you ask Washington, they'll tell you it's gridlock and blame inaction on some new and hyper-partisan or ideological era. But while gridlock might be blamed for slowing things down, it can't be blamed for failing to address serious issues. Welfare reform and balanced budgets in the 1990s were the product of gridlock that slowly gave way to consensus. And today's Washington is more than happy to come together when it suits its own interests.</p><p>For instance, just last week, Congress managed bipartisan support for another continuing resolution, an agreement that allows the legislators to, once again, put off doing any real fiscal planning. In fact, Congress hasn't managed to produce a Federal budget in more than three years. Washington's problem is not gridlock. It is an increasingly irresponsible government that has for far too long been let off the hook for performing the most basic responsibilities. So, whatever happens in November, this much is certain: unless taxpayers demand their president and Congress act responsibly and do the work they were elected to do, so-called Washington gridlock will be the least of our problems. I'm Veronique de Rugy.</p><p>HUDSON: You can find some progress in outer space. NASA's rover \"Curiosity\" tonight on the surface of the red planet. \"Curiosity\" pierced Mars' atmosphere traveling at 13,000 miles per hour, safely touched down after slowing to a mere two miles per hour. It began transmitting photos right away. Ruben Ramirez tonight reports on the partnership between government and business that made \"Curiosity\" possible.</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The big question of course, is there, or, has there ever been life on Mars? Well, this week starts a two-year, $2.5 billion mission on the red planet to try and find the answer. Nearly three years behind schedule and almost a billion dollars over budget, NASA's \"Curiosity\" rover landed safely on Mars. It's the largest and most advanced spacecraft ever sent to outer space. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Siemens were just some of the companies that participated in the project. Siemens licensed its 3D modeling technology to NASA's jet propulsion lab to help cut prototype costs.</p><p>TONY AFFUSO, CHAIRMAN, SIEMENS PLM SOFTWARE: These techniques between public and private and the way that they can share costs, share risks and collaborate around technology is a great way to bring all the resources to bear.</p><p>RAMIREZ: According to NASA, the public private partnership created about 7,000 jobs at various times during the eight years it took to develop the rover. And, unlike in past decades of space exploration, in true social media fashion, you can follow the rover on Twitter at Marscuriosity. Ruben Ramirez, NBR, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: The red planet to Wall Street and Main Street. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday, August 6. Thanks for joining us.

I'm Tom  Hudson.  Susie is off tonight.  A rescue for Knight Capital today.  The  trading firm stays in business thanks to a $400 million investment.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Erika Miller reports tonight on a takeover offer for Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY).  The founder of the struggling electronics retail chain wants  to take it private.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  And the Mars rover has landed on the red planet.  We'll see what U.S.  companies hope to gain by signing on to the mission.  That and more coming  up tonight here on NBR.  </p><p/><p>  We begin with this, a $400 million lifeline today for Knight Capital.   It's a company that makes some of the plumbing of the U.S. stock market.   The market maker has been fighting to survive since a trading software  update went hay-wire last week, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars  in losses, its stock price cut by two-thirds and now a rescue by some of  its competitors.  </p><p/><p>  The deal by a half dozen Wall Street firms to invest in Knight allowed  the company to, quote, resume normal operations immediately, end quote,  according to Knight.  Those behind the $400 million deal are investment  banking firms Jefferies, Stephens and Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF), private  equity giant Blackstone, trading competitor Getco and customer TD  Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD).  Ameritrade was one of Knight's big customers  that stopped doing business with it after Wednesday's trading trouble.   Ameritrade has since returned as have other big customers.  </p><p/><p>  As for its investment in Knight, an Ameritrade spokesperson tells NBR,  quote, we have an interest in preserving choice and competition in the  markets, end quote.  Knight Capital matches buyers and sellers of thousands  of stocks and billions of shares.  It also buys and sells stocks itself,  helping keep money flowing.  So when it's new trading software had a  problem, the firm was stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in losing  trades.  That sent shareholders fleeing, driving down its stock price,  leading Knight to look for help.  But the assistance comes at the expense  of diluting current shareholders' interest.  That pressured Knight stock  today, down 24 percent.  Knight's rescuers get preferred stock that may be  converted to common stock at $1.50 per share plus a 2 percent dividend.   The deal represents a 73 percent stake in the company.  The investor group  also gets three new seats on the board of directors.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  All this week at NBR, we're looking at you, the everyday  investor and what problems like the one at Knight Capital are doing to  investor confidence.  You may remember the last time a computer system sent  the stock prices spiraling.  It happened back in May 2010 and was called  the flash crash.  It led to new rules on when firms get a do-over after a  computer error.  Knight asked for just such a do-over, pleading with the  Securities and Exchange Commission to be released from mistaken trades.   The answer back, no.  Darren Gersh tonight reports on the firm line from  Washington.  </p><p/><p>  DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   This is really  a story about a bailout that didn't happen.  Knight Capital Group  (NYSE:KCG) asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for special help.   Stock exchange rules set strict limits on when trades can be reversed.  In  Knight's case, the rules say trades made by mistake that are more than 30  percent off of the real market price can be undone.  Knight wanted more  trades busted, but regulators said no.  The message was clear.  </p><p/><p>  JAMES ANGEL, FINANCE PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY:  Once you make  a trade, unless something has gone incredibly wrong, your word is your  bond.  You make a trade, you are expected to live up to it.  </p><p/><p>  GERSH:  People familiar with the matter say regulators are sending a  clear message to investors:  the rules on erroneous trades are meant to  provide markets with certainty and they worked in this case.  Another  message:  firms need to have incentives to be careful and what happened to  Knight is a big incentive.  </p><p/><p>  ANGEL:  Right now I think that every IT manager is going to his boss  and saying, give me a bigger budget so I make sure this isn't going to  happen here.  </p><p/><p>  GERSH:  But that does not reassure critics who fear Wall Street firms  have created computer systems they can't control.  </p><p/><p>  DENNIS KELLEHER, CEO, BETTER MARKETS:  It is not a glitch when in less  than 30 minutes over 150 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange vary wildly  in purchases and sales and prices and there's essentially haywire in the  markets.  That's not a glitch.  That's a huge problem.  It's a red flag and  people better start paying attention.  </p><p/><p>  GERSH:  While the SEC took a tough line with Knight Capital, there are  growing concerns about the ability of regulators to police the Street.  </p><p/><p>  KELLEHER:  Regulators and regulation generally can't keep up with  what's going on in the markets.  It's just that simple.  Now one of the  main reasons for that is that there is a fairly massive effort led by Wall  Street and its allies to de-fund the agencies so they can prevent them from  putting financial reform into place.  </p><p/><p>  GERSH:  Before the computer mistake, Knight Capital handled 20 percent  of the trading in stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  It was well-respected  and innovative and all that blew up in less than half an hour.  Darren  Gersh, NBR, Washington.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  (INAUDIBLE) Just the latest reminder of how technology  continues to reshape the investment market.  As part of our coverage this  week, join the discussion online on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter,  bizrpt.  How confident are you in the technology that powers the market?   Will it change how you trade and invest because of the technology?   Join  us online.  </p><p/><p>  On Wall Street today meantime, investors helped the major averages to  finish a fresh three-month highs tonight, despite some selling in Knight  Capital shares as we mentioned.  The Dow Industrials rising 21 points, the  NASDAQ up 22, the S&amp;P 500 gained three points.  One other quick note here  about policing the markets. A major British bank was accused today of  hiding over 60,000 illegal transactions with Iran over the past decade.   Those transactions made by Standard Charter PLC were valued at over $250  billion.  New York State's department of financial services threatened to  revoke the bank's U.S. license today and called it a quote, rogue  institution.  Standard Charter meantime said it's reviewing its compliance  with U.S. banking sanctions.  </p><p/><p>  A billion dollar plus bet could be paying off much sooner than Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) had hoped.  One week into the media company's NBC  Olympics coverage and it may actually turn a profit.  NBC has been hit by  the usual number of criticisms, too much focus on the Americans, not enough  live coverage, hasn't hurt the television audience numbers here in the U.S.  though. Through the first 10 days of coverage - look at this - Comcast's  Olympic ratings averaged 33.6 million viewers. That's up 12 percent from  Beijing, 28 percent higher than the Athens games in 2004.  </p><p/><p>  Porter Bibb is back with us, managing partner at Mediatech Capital  Partners at the NASDAQ.  Porter, is it something that Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is doing with its coverage of the games or is it  the games themselves?</p><p/><p>  PORTER BIBB, MANAGING PARTNER, MEDIATECH CAPITAL PARTNERS:  I think  it's mostly the games themselves and it's the fact that there's not a lot  else going on right now in the dog days of the summer of 2012.  Basically  it's the fact that this Olympics has drawn a tremendous amount of attention  from the public and it's reflected in these numbers which are historic.   They've never ever had such great ratings any television broadcast since  1960 when CBS (NYSE:CBS) first broadcast the Rome Olympics.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Talk to us about the opportunities here then.  This  opportunity comes at a significant cost, more than a billion dollars  invested.  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) sold a billion dollars worth  of advertising.  Can it go back to its advertisers and ask for more money  now that the ratings are in?</p><p/><p>  BIBB:  They did get a little bit of a premium when they exceed the  ratings, yes.  But the biggest advertiser, interestingly enough on this  Olympic tenure is NBC.  Every third or fourth commercial is promoting an  NBC series that's going to be breaking this fall and they're hoping to  shore up their ratings throughout the year because NBC has been wallowing  in the cellar behind all of the other major networks for the last seven  years.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  I want to talk about the investor in the Olympics here before  we get to the broader NBC picture.  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) has  estimated a $200 million profit.  It spent about $1.2 billion for the  rights it has to pay to produce the programs.  Is this a good return on  investment for shareholders?  </p><p/><p>  BIBB:  It's never been a good return in terms of bottom line, but it's  considered by the TV executives in the suites to be the best promotion for  their networks that money can buy.  It rivals the Super Bowl and the way  the Oscars used to command this kind of an audience but don't anymore.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Certainly, shareholders are being attracted to this stock,  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) shares at a 52-week high even with this  billion dollar plus investment.  </p><p/><p>  BIBB:  You have to realize that NBC television is a very small part of  the Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) empire.  They're the largest cable  systems operators in the country, in the world in fact and they're also the  largest Internet service providers.  They reap huge profits from NBC  Universal (NYSE:UVV) cable channels, not just television networks.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Is that the way you leverage then the next Olympic games?  Is  that the lesson here?  </p><p/><p>  BIBB:  They have bought this Olympics and the summer and winter  Olympics in 2020 and they expect that they will have to change the model  because the next Rio in 2016 is going to be an online digital Internet, not  like this one.  These decisions that NBC made were two and a half years ago  when they acquired the rights and they didn't anticipate the iPad and the  profusion of smart phones that are out there. And their Internet delivery  is really patchy.  It's not very good, but it will be by the time they get  to Rio for sure.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  That's going to be the big change for the next summer games  in four years.  Do you have any position in Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)  (NYSE:CCS) by the way, Porter?  </p><p/><p>  BIBB:  None.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Porter Bibb along with us here watching the Olympics and  commenting on the coverage, Mediatech Capital Partners.  </p><p/><p>  Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) founder and former chairman wants his stores back.   Richard Schulze has offered to take the struggling electronics retail chain  private.  The offer is $24 to $26 per share.  Now the higher price, it  values the company at just over $8.8 billion.  Erika Miller tonight in  Manhattan joining us with what could be one of the biggest buyouts in  recent years of an American retailer.  </p><p/><p>  ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  That's right.   Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) founder has made a generous offer for the stores but he  still faces an uphill battle getting the board to approve it.  In a public  letter addressed to Best Buy's board, Richard Schulze says quote, bold and  extensive changes are needed for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) to return to market  leadership.  He is proposing to buy out the company, using his own money,  private equity funds and some debt.  So would going public (sic) be the  right strategy for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY)?  </p><p/><p>  RJ HOTTOVY, SR. RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR:  It may make sense for  Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) to be a privately held company, especially if you have  the backing of a private equity company with retail and turnaround  experience.  Frankly, this company has got a lot of work ahead of them to  stay competitive and stay relevant in the eyes of consumers.  </p><p/><p>  MILLER: It's a moment of truth for the retail electronics chain  Schulze founded in 1966.  Part of Best Buy's problem is so-called  showrooming.  That's when customers browse the store, but actually place  their orders elsewhere, often at online sites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).   An even bigger issue is the enormous size of most stores, a relic of a  bygone era.  </p><p/><p>  HOTTOVY:  In the early part of the 90's through the early part of the  2000s, really consumers had no problem.  They were shopping in stores for  TVs, video games, CDs were all a big part of their consumer electronics  budget.  But as that shifted to a digital distribution format over the last  several years, it has left a gaping hole in Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) stores.  </p><p/><p>  MILLER:  Schulze will clearly face big challenges turning the offer  into a deal.  First, he needs to get the approval of all Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) board members before signing a deal with private equity  partners.  He will likely have trouble getting the support of interim CEO  Mike Mikan, who is gunning for a permanent position at the helm.  Second,  Schulze will have to detail his turnaround plans, which are vague at this  point.  The third issue is money.  The board will likely try to get a  higher offer, if it supports a deal at all and that could make it harder  for Schulze to secure financing.  And don't forget Schulze was elbowed out  as chairman in the spring, after an internal audit found he knew former CEO  Brian Dunn was having an inappropriate relationship with a female employee.   That alone is unlikely to be a deal breaker.  But it may mean some board  member resistance to putting him back in charge.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Erika is in New York tonight as we mentioned.  So, why does  Schulze make this offer in public?  Why not negotiate privately with the  board?  </p><p/><p>  MILLER:   In his letter, Schulze said he would have preferred to have  private negotiations, but the board was dragging its feet, so he felt he  had no choice but to take his campaign public and hope that Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) shareholders would support him.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  It certainly caused a bit of a ruckus in the stock as we'll  mention in a moment.  But what happens now?  What's the next step?  What  can we expect to hear, when can we hear from the board?  </p><p/><p>  MILLER:  It's unclear at this point.  All that we know is that Best  Buy (NYSE:BBY) will confirm its made the offer, but don't know when it will  respond.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:   We are coming into a key time for retailers like Best Buys,  holidays right around the corner, turnarounds are easier said than done  this time of year.  What does is need to do to discourage the showrooming,  the shopping and actually and turn the shopping into buying?  </p><p/><p>  MILLER:   Best Buy's biggest problem is its format, 50,000 square feet  on average of retail space just doesn't make sense any more.  It needs to  go to a smaller format store.  That's its biggest challenge.  But it also  needs to emphasize its most profitable product lines.  We're talking about  things like mobile phones.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Erika Miller tonight in New York on Best Buy (NYSE:BBY).   Thanks, Erika.  From electronic retailing to auto sales, July was a  disappointing month of sales for General Motors (NYSE:GM) at home.  Not so  in China though.  The U.S. auto maker set a sales record there last month.   But the road ahead in China could be dicey for GM and other auto companies.   Diane Eastabrook has details.  </p><p/><p>  DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  GM bucked  fears of a slowing economy in China last month by selling 15 percent more  vehicles there than it did during the same month last year.  Among the  biggest sellers for GM were Buick Excel models.  While auto sales in China  have been strong compared to last year, they've actually been declining  month over month this year, a possible sign of a cooling Chinese economy.   June sales slid nearly 2.5 percent from May and sales were also down the  two months before that.  Still U.S. auto manufacturers are betting big on  China.  GM is the market leader, selling more than 2.5 million vehicles  there last year primarily through joint ventures.  Ford is increasing its  exposure there as well, planning to add six new plants in China that will  produce more than a million vehicles by 2015.  Diane Eastabrook, NBR,  Chicago.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  In our \"Market Focus,\" Some modest gains driving the U.S.  major stock indices up to three-month highs tonight.  We begin with the  intraday S&amp;P 500 starting out with the index jumping on the heels of some  decent gains we saw overnight in European and Asian markets.  No headline  economic data today as the buying cooled somewhat into the closing bell.   The index finished up a fraction.  But it was enough for it to continue the  trend since June of higher highs and higher lows.  This is the S&amp;P 500's  highest close since May 2nd.  Trading volume meantime backing off from  Friday's pace, 645 million shares on the big board, just over one and a  half billion on the NASDAQ.  </p><p/><p>  It was a mixed market, six of the 10 major stock sectors were higher.   Material stocks leading the gainers, up 1.1 percent.  Technology added 0.7  of a percent and it was steel stocks behind today's gain in the materials  sector.  Many of these manufacturers have struggled under weaker building  demand and lower pricing.  But we have seen some buying lately after a  string of better than expected earnings and some of the stocks also hitting  recent lows.  </p><p/><p>U.S. Steel up today 5.6 percent, Titanium Metals (NYSE:TIE) rallying  4.5 percent.  Both of these tonight are at their highest prices since mid- May.  Cliff's Natural Resources added 2.7 percent.  Today was the first  Monday since May that the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a gain.  Two  of the top 3 percentage gainers in fact for the Dow in the tech industry.   HPQ, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) up 2.4 percent.  This buying comes after HP  sank to a seven and a half year low late last week.  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)  the other big tech stock on the Dow that's been under pressure and shares  gained 2.1 percent, although volume was lighter than usual during today's  buying of CSCO.  </p><p/><p>  The biggest meat processor in the U.S., Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), may  have to turn to Brazil for corn.  The company put that option on the table  today thanks to the continued drought throughout the Midwestern U.S.  It  comes after Tyson reported weaker than expected earnings, coming in $0.04  below estimates.  Its beef business saw lower demand thanks to the  controversy over a ground beef additive called pink slime by critics.   Falling pork prices hurt that business in Tyson as well.  The company went  on to lower its revenue outlook for the year.  That hit shares, falling  eight percent.  Volume was more than three times normal for TSN.  This in  fact tonight is a new 52-week low for Tyson.  </p><p/><p>  Shares of semi-truck maker Navistar hit the gas, after Federal  regulators, environmental regulators submitted a final rule allowing, that  may allow the company to continue to pay fines and still sell engines that  do not meet EPA guidelines.  The stock has been under pressure as it has  been threatened with losing the ability to sell these new engines that  don't meet current emissions standards.  The details of today's final  ruling were not disclosed.  Shares jumped 10 percent though.  An interim  rule allowed Navistart to continue with its sales if it paid a fine.  </p><p/><p>  All five of the most actively traded ETF's seeing some modest gains.   The biggest for the Russell 2000 and NASDAQ 100 track funds.  And that is  tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p/><p>  The virtual world of the Internet has changed businesses from  newspapers to retailing.  But the real world of video games continues to  favor established names and not new-comers.  That is tonight's \"Word on the  Street\"  -- gaming.  Debra Borchardt, markets analyst at thestreet.com with  us at the NASDAQ.  Deborah, first of all explain the business model  differences between the new digital gaming versus more traditional video  games?  </p><p/><p>  DEBRA BORCHARDT, MARKETS ANALYST, THESTREET.COM:  Well, a lot of the  digital gamers, the way that they earn money is putting advertising within  the games or trying to get you to pay for different additional items like  points and that type of model.  But they're finding that people really just  want to play their games on their phones for free.  They're called snacking  games.  You just play them for a little bit of a time when you're standing  in line, you're waiting in a restaurant, something like that.  So you  really don't want to pay any additional money, whereas your traditional  game company like an Activision or an EA, they make their money off one  upfront buying the game which is pretty expensive.  But they've now  determined ways to upsell you so that you can go and charge more for  additional accessories to the game.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  You can have a multitude of revenue sources in the language  of an MBA student here.  So the new generation is perhaps best illustrated  by Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), ZNGA, big business through facebook, and this stock  has just been a disaster since its IPO, new lows last week here.  Farmville  is not working out for it.  Is the new model broken?</p><p/><p>  BORCHARDT:  Well it really is for Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) because they've  got all their playing time on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)  has started to push the old titles down in prominence and Zynga  (NASDAQ:ZNGA) hasn't got a new title to get in new revenue.  So as  Farmville loses its attraction, it has to come up with a new name to  attract new players.  So it's getting hurt with this relationship with  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and also by not having a new hit name.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  But it's not alone in that. Even traditional video game  companies like Activision also are looked at as what's new, what's next?   Activision for instance had a pretty decent quarter earnings-wise, a third  of its sales coming through its digital channel to cut out the retail  space, nice bigger margins there.  But yet the stock sold off significantly  last week and rebounded a bit today.  </p><p/><p>  BORCHARDT:   Right.  They were beat up because they said that their  second quarter net income fell.  Some user were - some investors were  concerned that the users for \"World of Warcraft\" had dropped.   But here's  the thing.  They have new titles coming up this fall.  They're going to  making it to the holidays and this is what's interesting.  Here you've got  Farmville with Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and you can't really update it.  They  haven't really figured out how to built a franchise.  The established  companies were beat up for having franchises, but that's then the big  payoff.  \"Call of Duty,\"  \"Black Ops\" is coming out, (INAUDIBLE) Giant.\"    These titles just keep paying off.  Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) has  \"Madden.\"  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Debra, do you own any positions in these stocks?  </p><p/><p>  BORCHARDT:  No, I don't.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  But we're going to guess you're a gamer nonetheless.  Debra  Borchardt along with us.  She's with the street.com.  </p><p/><p>Congress has fled Washington, DC for a five-week summer recess,  despite little progress on a host of bills covering everything from  extending the Bush-era tax cuts to interim drought relief and Internet  security.  Tonight's commentary says don't blame the G-word for all that  interaction or rather inaction.  She's Veronique de Rugy, senior research  fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.  </p><p/><p>  VERONIQUE DE RUGY, SR. RSCH. FELLOW, MERCATUS CENTER, GEORGE MASON  UNIVERSITY:  What's really the problem in Washington?  Well, if you ask  Washington, they'll tell you it's gridlock and blame inaction on some new  and hyper-partisan or ideological era.  But while gridlock might be blamed  for slowing things down, it can't be blamed for failing to address serious  issues.  Welfare reform and balanced budgets in the 1990s were the product  of gridlock that slowly gave way to consensus.  And today's Washington is  more than happy to come together when it suits its own interests.  </p><p/><p>  For instance, just last week, Congress managed bipartisan support for  another continuing resolution, an agreement that allows the legislators to,  once again, put off doing any real fiscal planning.  In fact, Congress  hasn't managed to produce a Federal budget in more than three years.   Washington's problem is not gridlock.  It is an increasingly irresponsible  government that has for far too long been let off the hook for performing  the most basic responsibilities.  So, whatever happens in November, this  much is certain:  unless taxpayers demand their president and Congress act  responsibly and do the work they were elected to do, so-called Washington  gridlock will be the least of our problems.  I'm Veronique de Rugy.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  You can find some progress in outer space.  NASA's rover  \"Curiosity\" tonight on the surface of the red planet.  \"Curiosity\" pierced  Mars' atmosphere traveling at 13,000 miles per hour, safely touched down  after slowing to a mere two miles per hour.  It began transmitting photos  right away.  Ruben Ramirez tonight reports on the partnership between  government and business that made \"Curiosity\" possible.  </p><p/><p>  RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big  question of course, is there, or, has there ever been life on Mars?  Well,  this week starts a two-year, $2.5 billion mission on the red planet to try  and find the answer.  Nearly three years behind schedule and almost a  billion dollars over budget, NASA's \"Curiosity\" rover landed safely on  Mars.  It's the largest and most advanced spacecraft ever sent to outer  space.  Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics  (NYSE:GD) and Siemens were just some of the companies that participated in  the project.  Siemens licensed its 3D modeling technology to NASA's jet  propulsion lab to help cut prototype costs.  </p><p/><p>  TONY AFFUSO, CHAIRMAN, SIEMENS PLM SOFTWARE:  These techniques between  public and private and the way that they can share costs, share risks and  collaborate around technology is a great way to bring all the resources to  bear.  </p><p/><p>  RAMIREZ:  According to NASA, the public private partnership created  about 7,000 jobs at various times during the eight years it took to develop  the rover.  And, unlike in past decades of space exploration, in true  social media fashion, you can follow the rover on Twitter at Marscuriosity.   Ruben Ramirez, NBR, Washington.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  The red planet to Wall Street and Main Street. That is  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday, August 6.  Thanks for joining us.

The Blackstone Group will take up residence here at the New York Stock Exchange. We`ll detail its $4 billion initial public offering.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Senate Banking Chairman <person><nameText>Christopher Dodd </nameText></person>scolded bank regulators today, saying they didn`t do enough to stop predatory lending in the sub-prime market. Dodd also put lenders on notice, saying they too are to blame for the sub-prime mess.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KANGAS: From sub-prime loans to sluggish sales and falling home prices, we go region by region for a look at the state of the American housing market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PRATT: Then, Oracle is taking on one of its biggest rivals in court. We`ll tell you who the software giant is suing and why.</p><p>KANGAS: I`m Paul Kangas.</p><p>PRATT: And I`m Suzanne Pratt. Susie Gharib is off tonight. This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, May (sic) 22.</p><p>KANGAS: Good evening, everyone. One of the world`s largest private equity funds is going public. Late today, Blackstone Group announced a $4.4 or $4 billion initial public offering. The move lets investors buy into a risky business that has traditionally been the ground of wealthy individuals and large institutions. Blackstone generated more than $7.5 billion in investment gains in 2006. The company`s assets under management are worth almost $79 billion. Its portfolio includes real estate giant Equity Office Properties, Extended Stay America Hotels, publisher Houghton Mifflin and entertainment park Universal Orlando. Blackstone will trade on the New York Stock Exchange. But there`s no IPO date or ticker symbol specified in today`s filing with the SEC. But the company did say it won`t give quarterly guidance to Wall Street because its business is quote, unpredictable.</p><p>PRATT: The meltdown in the sub-prime lending market reached Capitol Hill today. The Senate Banking Committee called regulators, lenders and borrowers to learn more about the causes behind the sub-prime crisis. But as Stephanie Dhue reports, the committee quickly got down to the business of laying blame.</p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: With an increasing number of homeowners facing foreclosure, lawmakers, including New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, accused the Federal Reserve of being asleep at the switch.</p><p>SEN. ROBERT MENENDEZ (D) NEW JERSEY: How could it be this big and you have done your job?</p><p>ROGER COLE, DIR., BANKING SUPERVISION &amp; REGULATION, FEDERAL RESERVE: Given what we know now, yes, we could have done more sooner.</p><p>DHUE: Regulators say much of the sub-prime market falls outside their jurisdiction, which deals mostly with ensuring that banks are financially sound. But Senate Banking Committee Chairman <person><nameText>Chris Dodd </nameText></person>wasn`t buying that argument.</p><p><person><nameText>SEN. CHRIS DODD, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, BANKING COMMITTEE: The Fed had the responsibility in my view, as a good cop, to be on the beat, particularly going back several years ago, when the information first began to surface that there were serious problems with these sub-prime loans.</p><p>DHUE: Dodd called on the regulators to quickly finalize tighter sub- prime lending standards. But lenders warn some borrowers will be shut out of the market. Countrywide Financial says it would lose 60 percent of its sub-prime business under the proposed tighter standards. Still, the company`s managing director, Sandor Samuels, says that`s not his key concern.</p><p>SANDOR SAMUELS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL: The concern that we have is the impact on the housing market and the impact on borrowers who are in the sub-prime market. And so we hope the regulations can find a balance that will allow consumers to benefit from lower housing payments, while protecting them from unaffordable payment increases.</p><p>DHUE: The committee also heard from borrowers now at risk of losing their homes. Jennie Haliburton got an adjustable 2/28 sub-prime loan from Countrywide last year. Her payment is set to adjust in May to more than 70 percent of her income.</p><p>JENNIE HALIBURTON, BORROWER: I feel like they took advantage of me because I`m 77 and they figure, \"oh, well, she`s old.\"</p><p>DHUE: Countrywide says it will work with Mrs. Haliburton to keep her in her home. Senator Dodd says there are thousands of sub-prime borrowers struggling with their mortgages and he wants to find ways to help them. Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>PRATT: KB Home`s quarterly earnings plummeted 84 percent, as home prices dropped, inventories swelled and the sub-prime mortgage market began to implode. KB Home earned $0.34 a share in its fiscal first quarter. That`s down sharply from the year-ago period, but $0.09 ahead of analyst estimates. Sales fell 19 percent to $1 3/4 billion, but that was still ahead of estimates. KB Home`s CEO says housing conditions remain difficult, making it even harder to predict when the market will stabilize. The company also says 13 percent of the mortgages for KB Homes last year were financed with sub-prime loans.</p><p>KANGAS: Wall Street felt the sting of profit taking this morning after yesterday`s sharp rally. Selling was also linked to Motorola`s forecast of a first quarter loss and a rise in oil prices. By 11 a.m., the Dow was off 30 points, NASDAQ down 12. The blue chips improved this afternoon with the help of a brokerage upgrade on Procter &amp; Gamble and some strong oil stocks, but the broader market ended lower. The Dow Industrial Average closed up 13.62 at 12,461.14. NASDAQ Composite lost 4.18, ending at 2451.74. Standard &amp; Poor`s 500 Index fell exactly a half point to 1434.54. Over in the bond market, the 10-year note fell 12/32 to par and 10/32, lifting the yield to 4.59 percent.</p><p>PRATT: This week in our special housing series, we looked at market conditions in three U.S. cities: New York, Washington, DC and Miami. Tonight, we continue that series with a broader discussion of the national housing market. Our guest this evening is Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody`s economy.com. Mark, welcome.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`S ECONOMY.COM: Thanks for having me.</p><p>PRATT: So what is the current state of the U.S. housing market?</p><p>ZANDI: It`s struggling. The correction which began almost two years ago is ongoing. Since the peak, we have seen sales off about 10, 15 percent. Starts are done by a third. And prices are now falling in about half to two-thirds of the nation`s market.</p><p>PRATT: So this is a correction, though, not a meltdown?</p><p>ZANDI: I would characterize it as a correction. It is a severe correction. But at this point we`re not seeing double digit price declines. And the market is still holding together reasonably well so not a crash, at least not yet.</p><p>PRATT: So tell me about the weakest areas of the country. What are some of those?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, they would include California, primarily southern California. San Diego would be a good case in point. Arizona, Phoenix, Las Vegas, most of Florida, particularly south of Florida and parts of the northeast, Washington DC, the Boston region and of course the areas around Detroit are very weak because of job losses in the auto industry.</p><p>PRATT: And what about the strongest regions of the country, what are those?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, there are fewer but Texas would be a relatively strong housing market, some of the areas around the Carolinas, the farm belt and the pas civic northwest. In fact house prices in the Pacific northwest are still rising at a double-digit pace.</p><p>PRATT: So is it typical for a correction like this to be so uneven?</p><p>ZANDI: It is. The house market is a very local market. It really depends on where you are. Although I have to say this is the broadest the housing market correction that I think we`ve experienced at least since the great depression.</p><p>PRATT: So if it is so broad though is that, or does that have ominous predictions or does that mean that we should be more concerned?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, we should be concerned. The soft part of the economy lies in the housing and now of course in the mortgage market. Housing is weighing heavily on the economy. So far the problems in housing have been largely contained to housing. They haven`t bled out to consumer spending and business investment. But given the problems and the fact that they are ongoing, we need to watch that very carefully.</p><p>PRATT: So let`s talk a little bit about the sub-prime part of the market. I mean what does that mean? What is that likely to do to the overall housing market? Could it take it into a meltdown?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, it is a significant problem. If you consider all of the very aggressive loans that have been extended in recent years, that would include sub-prime, alternative A, prime loans that are interest only or negative am loans -- these are very aggressive loans. You combine all those and these are ones at a significant risk of default. They account for 40 percent of origination volume last year and roughly one quarter of all mortgage debt outstanding. So this a significant market that is going to be significantly affected. As a result, we will see some measurable impact on housing activity and probably as a result on the broader economy.</p><p>PRATT: One thing I want to make sure that we cover is the Fed and their statement yesterday. They sort of removed the bias, depending on who you ask. You think that that was because or directly because of the housing market.</p><p>ZANDI: Yeah, I think they did -- they did get rid of their bias towards future higher interest rates. They now have a neutral policy and I think they did that to have some latitude just in case if the housing market goes south and the mortgage market weakens, that they could ease if they needed to. At this point I don`t think they want to. Inflation is above their target. They would prefer not to, but they needed a little bit of flexibility and they got that in yesterday`s statement.</p><p>PRATT: OK, great. My guest this evening, Mark Zandi, chief economist at moodyseconomy.com, thanks for joining us.</p><p>ZANDI: Thank you.</p><p>KANGAS: Business software maker Oracle sued German rival SAP today, claiming SAP committed quote, corporate theft on a grand scale end quote. Oracle says SAP illegally logged on to its password-protected customer web sites many times, stealing huge amounts of software code, documents and other confidential material. Oracle claims it knows SAP excuse me, was the culprit because Oracle traced the log-ons back to an SAP-owned subsidiary in Texas. SAP said it had no comment on the lawsuit. Oracle wants a California court to assess damages, force SAP to return the stolen items and bar SAP from logging on to Oracle`s web sites.</p><p>Crude oil surged more than 2 percent today, jumping $2.08 to $61.69 a barrel. The rally was fueled by expectations energy demand will start to surge as we head into the summer driving season. And as Erika Miller explains, experts expect oil prices to spurt even higher.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Spring is supposed to be the time of year when energy prices dip due to weak demand. Instead, the opposite is happening. Analyst Fadel Gheit blames an across- the-board rally in energy prices on strong demand for gasoline.</p><p>FADEL GHEIT, ENERGY ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO.: Right now, gasoline prices are leading the energy markets in the U.S. But it doesn`t mean that oil prices are, you know, pulling back. Oil prices have shown tremendous resiliency that nobody had expected.</p><p>MILLER: Gasoline futures have surged over 20 percent since January. They`re now at a seven-month high. The rally is due in large part to fears of a supply crunch heading into the summer driving season. In the U.S., there has been an almost insatiable demand for motor fuel, despite higher prices at the pump. At the same time, supplies are dwindling. Energy trader Ira Eckstein blames that on glitches and seasonal maintenance at refineries.</p><p>IRA ECKSTEIN, OIL TRADER, AREA INTERNATIONAL TRADING: We have these outages, plus they are doing their usual spring -- they`re going from heating oil to gasoline, so they had to close down some refineries in order to switch over.</p><p>MILLER: There are also concerns about disruptions to crude supplies due to geopolitical tensions in places like Iran, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia. Another big unknown is weather. Hurricane season starts June 1, raising the risk of damage to U.S. oil infrastructure. In the near term, many traders expect oil prices to inch higher. The question is, how much?</p><p>ECKSTEIN: Crude oil is going to test that $62.50 level -- maybe not this week, but maybe early next week and I think that we could stay above there. We`ll see how we react when we get there.</p><p>MILLER: That`s bad news for motorists. In some places, including New York City, regular unleaded is approaching $3 a gallon. But few experts think we`ll head back to record levels just yet. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York</p><p>PRATT: Transatlantic air travel took a leap into the future today, as the European Union`s transport ministers approved plans to open the skies to more competition. The so-called open skies deal lets EU carriers fly from any city in the block to any city in the U.S. and vice versa. The Bush administration welcomed the decision, saying it will spur growth and give Americans more flying freedom. The plan had been set to take effect in October, but all sides agreed on a five-month delay. The new start date is March 30, 2008, Paul.</p><p>KANGAS: Suzanne, shares of the major air carriers hit some turbulence today on concerns that pact could trigger a price war. We`ll look at how they did as we take a look at our stocks in the news tonight.</p><p>Big board volume leader on nearly 51 million shares, Motorola (MOT) down $1.24. After the close yesterday as we reported, the company predicted a $0.07 to $0.09 per share first quarter loss.</p><p>Then Pfizer (PFE) down $0.06.</p><p>General Electric (GE) moved up $0.33. The company is teaming up with News Corporation to launch an online video site to compete with youtube. The details coming up shortly.</p><p>Ford Motor Co (F) was up $0.07.</p><p>CVS Caremark (CVS), this is the first day of trading for the new merger company of CVS Caremark, down $0.36 a share, fifth in volume.</p><p>AT&amp;T (T) rose $0.25.</p><p>Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) down a half a dollar. Goldman Sachs downgraded it from \"buy\" to \"neutral\" because it sees no sales recovery for the firm before the third quarter of this year.</p><p>ExxonMobil (XOM) up $1.13 on that sharp rise in oil.</p><p>Chesapeake Energy (CHK) down $0.15.</p><p>And Time Warner (TWX), tenth in volume, was off $0.28.</p><p>Procter Gamble (PG) moved up $0.89. Bear Stearns upgraded it from \"peer perform\" to \"out perform\" because of its attractive valuation in the price of the stock, according to Bear Stearns.</p><p>And then AMR (AMR) parent of American Airlines, down $1.54, not only today because of the sharp rise in oil, but airfares are expected to tumble next spring when the open skies package you just heard about goes into effect.</p><p>Let`s have a look at some other major carriers. Continental Air (CAL) down $1.60.</p><p>And UAL Corp (UAUA) losing $1.77.</p><p>Raytheon Co (RTN) off $1.41. The company boosted its annual dividend 6 percent from $0.96 to $1.02, but nevertheless, Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock from \"neutral\" to a \"sell.\"</p><p>Conagra Foods (CAG), the big packaged foods company down $0.02 despite a turnaround. Third quarter earnings of $0.38 versus a loss last year. Those earnings $0.03 above the Street estimate.</p><p>Another packaged foods company, General Mills (GIS) moving up $0.44. Third quarter earnings there were up nearly 9 percent to $0.74, $0.04 above the Street estimate and the company boosted its 2007 earnings guidance.</p><p>Nortel Networks (NT) fell $1.53. The company launched a $1 billion offering of convertible debt, which of course has potential earnings dilution.</p><p>Then we see Barnes &amp; Noble (BKS), the book seller, down $1.10. The company says preliminary fourth quarter earnings will be $1.84, up from $1.76 last year, but $0.04 below the Wall Street estimate.</p><p>IHS (IHS), a $3.90 gain. The aerospace defense contractor had nicely higher first quarter earnings, $0.32 versus $0.24 last year and revenues up 18 percent.</p><p>Clarcor (CLC) which is a big filtration company off $2.87. Third quarter earnings $0.32, a penny above last year, but $0.04 below the Street estimate. Sales actually fell 1.7 percent.</p><p>Google (GOOG) topped the active list on NASDAQ gaining $5.49.</p><p>Apple (AAPL) a $0.09 rise.</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) down $0.25.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) a $0.42 loss.</p><p>Intel (INTC) dropped $0.18 a share, fifth in dollar volume.</p><p>Research in Motion (RIMM) up $1.64.</p><p>Then Oracle (ORCL) a $0.32 gain there.</p><p>Palm (PALM) closed down $1.71. Speculation appears to be cooling that it might be the target of a takeover attempt. After the close, Palm reported third quarter earnings excluding items, $0.16 a share, $0.04 above the Street estimate. In after hours trading, the stock was about $0.20 higher than this.</p><p>Broadcom (BRCM) down $1.29, hurt by Motorola`s earnings warning.</p><p>And then Qualcomm (QCOM) tenth in volume was off $0.38 a share.</p><p>Intuit (INTU) down $2.46. The company says its Turbotax software sales are off to a slow start this tax season so far.</p><p>Those are the stocks in the news tonight. Suzanne.</p><p>PRATT: The SEC and the American Stock Exchange today settled their differences over problems with the exchange`s oversight of options trading. Regulators allege, from 1999 through June 2004, the Amex didn`t adequately enforce certain order-handling rules and comply with record-keeping guidelines. The settlement creates a $3 million fund to help pay for stepped up exchange surveillance. Still in the works, though, EC action against the Amex`s former Chairman Salvatore Sodano.</p><p>KANGAS: Tomorrow, our Friday \"market monitor\" guest is Jeffrey Everett, chief investment officer at Templeton Global Advisors.</p><p>PRATT: A Federal judge in Mississippi has turned down a request to allow a class-action suit against State Farm insurance for denial of damage claims from hurricane Katrina. At issue so-called slab cases where houses were destroyed down to the slab. The judge said while all the homes were ruined, there are other factors that make the cases unsuitable for class action.</p><p>KANGAS: Coca-Cola is rolling out a new version of its diet Coke drink, adding vitamins and minerals to the mix. The new diet Coke plus will contain small mounts of vitamins B-3, B-6 and B-12, as well as magnesium and zinc. But the recipe for the soda itself will be unchanged. Coke says the new soft drink should hit U.S. store shelves next month.</p><p>PRATT: Here`s a look at what`s happening tomorrow. February existing home sales come out, along with earnings from Freddie Mac.</p><p>Tonight`s commentator has a few thoughts on what the Blackstone Group`s $4 billion IPO could mean to Wall Street. Here`s Chrystia Freeland, U.S. managing editor of \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, US MANAGING EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES: The irony of the move is irresistible. After all, the private equity business is based on the idea that a lot of companies can be run more effectively if they are liberated from the short-term targets and regulatory red tape that bedevils the public market. But there are some powerful reasons for Blackstone to be tempted to go public. The greatest may be the simplest. Blackstone`s founders are surely keen in Wall Street`s uncharacteristically coy terminology to crystallize the value of their partnership.</p><p>In plainer language, that means they want to take their billions before they retire. In contrast with those pitied Goldman Sachs senior partners who left the legendary firm before its IPO and missed out on the windfall their younger colleagues collected. For those of us not in line to receive Blackstone`s billions, the greatest significance of an IPO would be to make the private equity revolution more sustainable. Private equity has become so powerful it is easy to forget that the dominant groups are just a few decades old, are still run by the men who founded them and are dependent on Internet and fund-raising (INAUDIBLE) for most of their capital. Going public would give them access to permanent money and thus make them a more permanent fixture in world business. And that is the real irony of the story. Public capital could well give private equity groups a more enduring power to take companies private. I`m Chrystia Freeland.</p><p>KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, a split decision on Wall Street. The Dow gained 13 points while the NASDAQ Composite lost four points.

And what does it take to make tax time less taxing? Scott Gurvey has those answers and more in tonight`s \"tech talk.\"</p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tonight`s big tech news is a partnership of two very unlikely bedfellows: NBC Universal and Newscorp, parent of the Fox network. Who could get these guys together? Try youtube, the popular video-sharing web site now owned by Google. Youtube members make and post videos, often using original material, but just as often using content recorded from TV and cable, raising copyright concerns. A competing site run by NBC and Newscorp would have lots of content it could legally distribute. Yahoo!, MSN, AOL and Newscorp`s myspace will be involved. Stay tuned.</p><p>All of these sites make money by selling ads. The more popular the site, the more it can sell, and it adds up! Cisco Systems, Intel and General Motors have already signed up to advertise on the new NBC-Newscorp site. There are big bucks involved. Google paid $1.6 billion to buy youtube and recently, Viacom sued youtube for $1 billion, charging it with copyright infringement. Youtube has yet to file a response. The digital millennium copyright act of 1998 was supposed to clarify copyright law in the Internet age. It appears there is more work to be done.</p><p>It is tax time and the IRS says more than 130 million returns will be filed this year. Thirty five million will be made with tax preparation software. I`ve tried the leading products and, while they all do a good job, once again I`ve found Intuit`s Turbotax to be the most comprehensive and easiest to use. It does tend to cost $10 to $15 more than H&amp;R Block`s tax cut. This year, Intuit added a home and business version, perfect if you file a Schedule C or need to generate W-2s for business or household employees. The tax software companies report their fastest growth is among taxpayers who enter all their data online, a process Intuit`s Bob Meighan says is simple and safe.</p><p>BOB MEIGHAN, VICE PRESIDENT, INTUIT: People don`t have to go to the store and buy the software. They don`t have to install it. They don`t have to worry about updates. I can go to the web and access tax software to do my return, so it`s convenient. All the products I know about use secure connections. If you`re transmitting your return to the IRS, it`s via secure connection, so the data is secure. All the companies that I know about guard your information very, very well, because we want to protect your privacy.</p><p>GURVEY: Even with the tax software, I haven`t sent in my return yet. How about you? Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>PRATT: That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, March 22. I`m Suzanne Pratt. Good night everyone and good night to you, Paul.</p><p>KANGAS: Good night, Suzanne. I`m Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the best of good buys.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast. The program is transcribed by Voxant, Inc.

I'm Tom Hudson. Susie is off tonight. A rescue for Knight Capital today. The trading firm stays in business thanks to a $400 million investment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Erika Miller reports tonight on a takeover offer for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). The founder of the struggling electronics retail chain wants to take it private.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the Mars rover has landed on the red planet. We'll see what U.S. companies hope to gain by signing on to the mission. That and more coming up tonight here on NBR.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We begin with this, a $400 million lifeline today for Knight Capital. It's a company that makes some of the plumbing of the U.S. stock market. The market maker has been fighting to survive since a trading software update went hay-wire last week, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, its stock price cut by two-thirds and now a rescue by some of its competitors.</p><p>The deal by a half dozen Wall Street firms to invest in Knight allowed the company to, quote, resume normal operations immediately, end quote, according to Knight. Those behind the $400 million deal are investment banking firms Jefferies, Stephens and Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF), private equity giant Blackstone, trading competitor Getco and customer TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD). Ameritrade was one of Knight's big customers that stopped doing business with it after Wednesday's trading trouble. Ameritrade has since returned as have other big customers.</p><p>As for its investment in Knight, an Ameritrade spokesperson tells NBR, quote, we have an interest in preserving choice and competition in the markets, end quote. Knight Capital matches buyers and sellers of thousands of stocks and billions of shares. It also buys and sells stocks itself, helping keep money flowing. So when it's new trading software had a problem, the firm was stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in losing trades. That sent shareholders fleeing, driving down its stock price, leading Knight to look for help. But the assistance comes at the expense of diluting current shareholders' interest. That pressured Knight stock today, down 24 percent. Knight's rescuers get preferred stock that may be converted to common stock at $1.50 per share plus a 2 percent dividend. The deal represents a 73 percent stake in the company. The investor group also gets three new seats on the board of directors.</p><p>HUDSON: All this week at NBR, we're looking at you, the everyday investor and what problems like the one at Knight Capital are doing to investor confidence. You may remember the last time a computer system sent the stock prices spiraling. It happened back in May 2010 and was called the flash crash. It led to new rules on when firms get a do-over after a computer error. Knight asked for just such a do-over, pleading with the Securities and Exchange Commission to be released from mistaken trades. The answer back, no. Darren Gersh tonight reports on the firm line from Washington.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This is really a story about a bailout that didn't happen. Knight Capital Group (NYSE:KCG) asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for special help. Stock exchange rules set strict limits on when trades can be reversed. In Knight's case, the rules say trades made by mistake that are more than 30 percent off of the real market price can be undone. Knight wanted more trades busted, but regulators said no. The message was clear.</p><p>JAMES ANGEL, FINANCE PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Once you make a trade, unless something has gone incredibly wrong, your word is your bond. You make a trade, you are expected to live up to it.</p><p>GERSH: People familiar with the matter say regulators are sending a clear message to investors: the rules on erroneous trades are meant to provide markets with certainty and they worked in this case. Another message: firms need to have incentives to be careful and what happened to Knight is a big incentive.</p><p>ANGEL: Right now I think that every IT manager is going to his boss and saying, give me a bigger budget so I make sure this isn't going to happen here.</p><p>GERSH: But that does not reassure critics who fear Wall Street firms have created computer systems they can't control.</p><p>DENNIS KELLEHER, CEO, BETTER MARKETS: It is not a glitch when in less than 30 minutes over 150 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange vary wildly in purchases and sales and prices and there's essentially haywire in the markets. That's not a glitch. That's a huge problem. It's a red flag and people better start paying attention.</p><p>GERSH: While the SEC took a tough line with Knight Capital, there are growing concerns about the ability of regulators to police the Street.</p><p>KELLEHER: Regulators and regulation generally can't keep up with what's going on in the markets. It's just that simple. Now one of the main reasons for that is that there is a fairly massive effort led by Wall Street and its allies to de-fund the agencies so they can prevent them from putting financial reform into place.</p><p>GERSH: Before the computer mistake, Knight Capital handled 20 percent of the trading in stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was well-respected and innovative and all that blew up in less than half an hour. Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: (INAUDIBLE) Just the latest reminder of how technology continues to reshape the investment market. As part of our coverage this week, join the discussion online on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter, bizrpt. How confident are you in the technology that powers the market? Will it change how you trade and invest because of the technology? Join us online.</p><p>On Wall Street today meantime, investors helped the major averages to finish a fresh three-month highs tonight, despite some selling in Knight Capital shares as we mentioned. The Dow Industrials rising 21 points, the NASDAQ up 22, the S&amp;P 500 gained three points. One other quick note here about policing the markets. A major British bank was accused today of hiding over 60,000 illegal transactions with Iran over the past decade. Those transactions made by Standard Charter PLC were valued at over $250 billion. New York State's department of financial services threatened to revoke the bank's U.S. license today and called it a quote, rogue institution. Standard Charter meantime said it's reviewing its compliance with U.S. banking sanctions.</p><p>A billion dollar plus bet could be paying off much sooner than Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) had hoped. One week into the media company's NBC Olympics coverage and it may actually turn a profit. NBC has been hit by the usual number of criticisms, too much focus on the Americans, not enough live coverage, hasn't hurt the television audience numbers here in the U.S. though. Through the first 10 days of coverage - look at this - Comcast's Olympic ratings averaged 33.6 million viewers. That's up 12 percent from Beijing, 28 percent higher than the Athens games in 2004.</p><p>Porter Bibb is back with us, managing partner at Mediatech Capital Partners at the NASDAQ. Porter, is it something that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is doing with its coverage of the games or is it the games themselves?</p><p>PORTER BIBB, MANAGING PARTNER, MEDIATECH CAPITAL PARTNERS: I think it's mostly the games themselves and it's the fact that there's not a lot else going on right now in the dog days of the summer of 2012. Basically it's the fact that this Olympics has drawn a tremendous amount of attention from the public and it's reflected in these numbers which are historic. They've never ever had such great ratings any television broadcast since 1960 when CBS (NYSE:CBS) first broadcast the Rome Olympics.</p><p>HUDSON: Talk to us about the opportunities here then. This opportunity comes at a significant cost, more than a billion dollars invested. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) sold a billion dollars worth of advertising. Can it go back to its advertisers and ask for more money now that the ratings are in?</p><p>BIBB: They did get a little bit of a premium when they exceed the ratings, yes. But the biggest advertiser, interestingly enough on this Olympic tenure is NBC. Every third or fourth commercial is promoting an NBC series that's going to be breaking this fall and they're hoping to shore up their ratings throughout the year because NBC has been wallowing in the cellar behind all of the other major networks for the last seven years.</p><p>HUDSON: I want to talk about the investor in the Olympics here before we get to the broader NBC picture. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) has estimated a $200 million profit. It spent about $1.2 billion for the rights it has to pay to produce the programs. Is this a good return on investment for shareholders?</p><p>BIBB: It's never been a good return in terms of bottom line, but it's considered by the TV executives in the suites to be the best promotion for their networks that money can buy. It rivals the Super Bowl and the way the Oscars used to command this kind of an audience but don't anymore.</p><p>HUDSON: Certainly, shareholders are being attracted to this stock, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) shares at a 52-week high even with this billion dollar plus investment.</p><p>BIBB: You have to realize that NBC television is a very small part of the Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) empire. They're the largest cable systems operators in the country, in the world in fact and they're also the largest Internet service providers. They reap huge profits from NBC Universal (NYSE:UVV) cable channels, not just television networks.</p><p>HUDSON: Is that the way you leverage then the next Olympic games? Is that the lesson here?</p><p>BIBB: They have bought this Olympics and the summer and winter Olympics in 2020 and they expect that they will have to change the model because the next Rio in 2016 is going to be an online digital Internet, not like this one. These decisions that NBC made were two and a half years ago when they acquired the rights and they didn't anticipate the iPad and the profusion of smart phones that are out there. And their Internet delivery is really patchy. It's not very good, but it will be by the time they get to Rio for sure.</p><p>HUDSON: That's going to be the big change for the next summer games in four years. Do you have any position in Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) by the way, Porter?</p><p>BIBB: None.</p><p>HUDSON: Porter Bibb along with us here watching the Olympics and commenting on the coverage, Mediatech Capital Partners.</p><p>Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) founder and former chairman wants his stores back. Richard Schulze has offered to take the struggling electronics retail chain private. The offer is $24 to $26 per share. Now the higher price, it values the company at just over $8.8 billion. Erika Miller tonight in Manhattan joining us with what could be one of the biggest buyouts in recent years of an American retailer.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) founder has made a generous offer for the stores but he still faces an uphill battle getting the board to approve it. In a public letter addressed to Best Buy's board, Richard Schulze says quote, bold and extensive changes are needed for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) to return to market leadership. He is proposing to buy out the company, using his own money, private equity funds and some debt. So would going public (sic) be the right strategy for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY)?</p><p>RJ HOTTOVY, SR. RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: It may make sense for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) to be a privately held company, especially if you have the backing of a private equity company with retail and turnaround experience. Frankly, this company has got a lot of work ahead of them to stay competitive and stay relevant in the eyes of consumers.</p><p>MILLER: It's a moment of truth for the retail electronics chain Schulze founded in 1966. Part of Best Buy's problem is so-called showrooming. That's when customers browse the store, but actually place their orders elsewhere, often at online sites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). An even bigger issue is the enormous size of most stores, a relic of a bygone era.</p><p>HOTTOVY: In the early part of the 90's through the early part of the 2000s, really consumers had no problem. They were shopping in stores for TVs, video games, CDs were all a big part of their consumer electronics budget. But as that shifted to a digital distribution format over the last several years, it has left a gaping hole in Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) stores.</p><p>MILLER: Schulze will clearly face big challenges turning the offer into a deal. First, he needs to get the approval of all Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) board members before signing a deal with private equity partners. He will likely have trouble getting the support of interim CEO Mike Mikan, who is gunning for a permanent position at the helm. Second, Schulze will have to detail his turnaround plans, which are vague at this point. The third issue is money. The board will likely try to get a higher offer, if it supports a deal at all and that could make it harder for Schulze to secure financing. And don't forget Schulze was elbowed out as chairman in the spring, after an internal audit found he knew former CEO Brian Dunn was having an inappropriate relationship with a female employee. That alone is unlikely to be a deal breaker. But it may mean some board member resistance to putting him back in charge.</p><p>HUDSON: Erika is in New York tonight as we mentioned. So, why does Schulze make this offer in public? Why not negotiate privately with the board?</p><p>MILLER: In his letter, Schulze said he would have preferred to have private negotiations, but the board was dragging its feet, so he felt he had no choice but to take his campaign public and hope that Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) shareholders would support him.</p><p>HUDSON: It certainly caused a bit of a ruckus in the stock as we'll mention in a moment. But what happens now? What's the next step? What can we expect to hear, when can we hear from the board?</p><p>MILLER: It's unclear at this point. All that we know is that Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) will confirm its made the offer, but don't know when it will respond.</p><p>HUDSON: We are coming into a key time for retailers like Best Buys, holidays right around the corner, turnarounds are easier said than done this time of year. What does is need to do to discourage the showrooming, the shopping and actually and turn the shopping into buying?</p><p>MILLER: Best Buy's biggest problem is its format, 50,000 square feet on average of retail space just doesn't make sense any more. It needs to go to a smaller format store. That's its biggest challenge. But it also needs to emphasize its most profitable product lines. We're talking about things like mobile phones.</p><p>HUDSON: Erika Miller tonight in New York on Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). Thanks, Erika. From electronic retailing to auto sales, July was a disappointing month of sales for General Motors (NYSE:GM) at home. Not so in China though. The U.S. auto maker set a sales record there last month. But the road ahead in China could be dicey for GM and other auto companies. Diane Eastabrook has details.</p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: GM bucked fears of a slowing economy in China last month by selling 15 percent more vehicles there than it did during the same month last year. Among the biggest sellers for GM were Buick Excel models. While auto sales in China have been strong compared to last year, they've actually been declining month over month this year, a possible sign of a cooling Chinese economy. June sales slid nearly 2.5 percent from May and sales were also down the two months before that. Still U.S. auto manufacturers are betting big on China. GM is the market leader, selling more than 2.5 million vehicles there last year primarily through joint ventures. Ford is increasing its exposure there as well, planning to add six new plants in China that will produce more than a million vehicles by 2015. Diane Eastabrook, NBR, Chicago.</p><p>HUDSON: In our \"Market Focus,\" Some modest gains driving the U.S. major stock indices up to three-month highs tonight. We begin with the intraday S&amp;P 500 starting out with the index jumping on the heels of some decent gains we saw overnight in European and Asian markets. No headline economic data today as the buying cooled somewhat into the closing bell. The index finished up a fraction. But it was enough for it to continue the trend since June of higher highs and higher lows. This is the S&amp;P 500's highest close since May 2nd. Trading volume meantime backing off from Friday's pace, 645 million shares on the big board, just over one and a half billion on the NASDAQ.</p><p>It was a mixed market, six of the 10 major stock sectors were higher. Material stocks leading the gainers, up 1.1 percent. Technology added 0.7 of a percent and it was steel stocks behind today's gain in the materials sector. Many of these manufacturers have struggled under weaker building demand and lower pricing. But we have seen some buying lately after a string of better than expected earnings and some of the stocks also hitting recent lows.</p><p>U.S. Steel up today 5.6 percent, Titanium Metals (NYSE:TIE) rallying 4.5 percent. Both of these tonight are at their highest prices since mid- May. Cliff's Natural Resources added 2.7 percent. Today was the first Monday since May that the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a gain. Two of the top 3 percentage gainers in fact for the Dow in the tech industry. HPQ, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) up 2.4 percent. This buying comes after HP sank to a seven and a half year low late last week. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) the other big tech stock on the Dow that's been under pressure and shares gained 2.1 percent, although volume was lighter than usual during today's buying of CSCO.</p><p>The biggest meat processor in the U.S., Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), may have to turn to Brazil for corn. The company put that option on the table today thanks to the continued drought throughout the Midwestern U.S. It comes after Tyson reported weaker than expected earnings, coming in $0.04 below estimates. Its beef business saw lower demand thanks to the controversy over a ground beef additive called pink slime by critics. Falling pork prices hurt that business in Tyson as well. The company went on to lower its revenue outlook for the year. That hit shares, falling eight percent. Volume was more than three times normal for TSN. This in fact tonight is a new 52-week low for Tyson.</p><p>Shares of semi-truck maker Navistar hit the gas, after Federal regulators, environmental regulators submitted a final rule allowing, that may allow the company to continue to pay fines and still sell engines that do not meet EPA guidelines. The stock has been under pressure as it has been threatened with losing the ability to sell these new engines that don't meet current emissions standards. The details of today's final ruling were not disclosed. Shares jumped 10 percent though. An interim rule allowed Navistart to continue with its sales if it paid a fine.</p><p>All five of the most actively traded ETF's seeing some modest gains. The biggest for the Russell 2000 and NASDAQ 100 track funds. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>The virtual world of the Internet has changed businesses from newspapers to retailing. But the real world of video games continues to favor established names and not new-comers. That is tonight's \"Word on the Street\" -- gaming. Debra Borchardt, markets analyst at thestreet.com with us at the NASDAQ. Deborah, first of all explain the business model differences between the new digital gaming versus more traditional video games?</p><p>DEBRA BORCHARDT, MARKETS ANALYST, THESTREET.COM: Well, a lot of the digital gamers, the way that they earn money is putting advertising within the games or trying to get you to pay for different additional items like points and that type of model. But they're finding that people really just want to play their games on their phones for free. They're called snacking games. You just play them for a little bit of a time when you're standing in line, you're waiting in a restaurant, something like that. So you really don't want to pay any additional money, whereas your traditional game company like an Activision or an EA, they make their money off one upfront buying the game which is pretty expensive. But they've now determined ways to upsell you so that you can go and charge more for additional accessories to the game.</p><p>HUDSON: You can have a multitude of revenue sources in the language of an MBA student here. So the new generation is perhaps best illustrated by Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), ZNGA, big business through facebook, and this stock has just been a disaster since its IPO, new lows last week here. Farmville is not working out for it. Is the new model broken?</p><p>BORCHARDT: Well it really is for Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) because they've got all their playing time on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has started to push the old titles down in prominence and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) hasn't got a new title to get in new revenue. So as Farmville loses its attraction, it has to come up with a new name to attract new players. So it's getting hurt with this relationship with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and also by not having a new hit name.</p><p>HUDSON: But it's not alone in that. Even traditional video game companies like Activision also are looked at as what's new, what's next? Activision for instance had a pretty decent quarter earnings-wise, a third of its sales coming through its digital channel to cut out the retail space, nice bigger margins there. But yet the stock sold off significantly last week and rebounded a bit today.</p><p>BORCHARDT: Right. They were beat up because they said that their second quarter net income fell. Some user were - some investors were concerned that the users for \"World of Warcraft\" had dropped. But here's the thing. They have new titles coming up this fall. They're going to making it to the holidays and this is what's interesting. Here you've got Farmville with Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and you can't really update it. They haven't really figured out how to built a franchise. The established companies were beat up for having franchises, but that's then the big payoff. \"Call of Duty,\" \"Black Ops\" is coming out, (INAUDIBLE) Giant.\" These titles just keep paying off. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) has \"Madden.\"</p><p>HUDSON: Debra, do you own any positions in these stocks?</p><p>BORCHARDT: No, I don't.</p><p>HUDSON: But we're going to guess you're a gamer nonetheless. Debra Borchardt along with us. She's with the street.com.</p><p>Congress has fled Washington, DC for a five-week summer recess, despite little progress on a host of bills covering everything from extending the Bush-era tax cuts to interim drought relief and Internet security. Tonight's commentary says don't blame the G-word for all that interaction or rather inaction. She's Veronique de Rugy, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.</p><p>VERONIQUE DE RUGY, SR. RSCH. FELLOW, MERCATUS CENTER, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY: What's really the problem in Washington? Well, if you ask Washington, they'll tell you it's gridlock and blame inaction on some new and hyper-partisan or ideological era. But while gridlock might be blamed for slowing things down, it can't be blamed for failing to address serious issues. Welfare reform and balanced budgets in the 1990s were the product of gridlock that slowly gave way to consensus. And today's Washington is more than happy to come together when it suits its own interests.</p><p>For instance, just last week, Congress managed bipartisan support for another continuing resolution, an agreement that allows the legislators to, once again, put off doing any real fiscal planning. In fact, Congress hasn't managed to produce a Federal budget in more than three years. Washington's problem is not gridlock. It is an increasingly irresponsible government that has for far too long been let off the hook for performing the most basic responsibilities. So, whatever happens in November, this much is certain: unless taxpayers demand their president and Congress act responsibly and do the work they were elected to do, so-called Washington gridlock will be the least of our problems. I'm Veronique de Rugy.</p><p>HUDSON: You can find some progress in outer space. NASA's rover \"Curiosity\" tonight on the surface of the red planet. \"Curiosity\" pierced Mars' atmosphere traveling at 13,000 miles per hour, safely touched down after slowing to a mere two miles per hour. It began transmitting photos right away. Ruben Ramirez tonight reports on the partnership between government and business that made \"Curiosity\" possible.</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The big question of course, is there, or, has there ever been life on Mars? Well, this week starts a two-year, $2.5 billion mission on the red planet to try and find the answer. Nearly three years behind schedule and almost a billion dollars over budget, NASA's \"Curiosity\" rover landed safely on Mars. It's the largest and most advanced spacecraft ever sent to outer space. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Siemens were just some of the companies that participated in the project. Siemens licensed its 3D modeling technology to NASA's jet propulsion lab to help cut prototype costs.</p><p>TONY AFFUSO, CHAIRMAN, SIEMENS PLM SOFTWARE: These techniques between public and private and the way that they can share costs, share risks and collaborate around technology is a great way to bring all the resources to bear.</p><p>RAMIREZ: According to NASA, the public private partnership created about 7,000 jobs at various times during the eight years it took to develop the rover. And, unlike in past decades of space exploration, in true social media fashion, you can follow the rover on Twitter at Marscuriosity. Ruben Ramirez, NBR, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: The red planet to Wall Street and Main Street. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday, August 6. Thanks for joining us.

You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, October 18.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening everyone. The financial sector was under the microscope today because of big earnings news and more worries about the foreclosure crisis. Tom, Bank of America came out saying it`s planning to end its moratorium on foreclosures in 23 states. But it`s still studying foreclosure paperwork in 27 other states.</p><p>HUDSON: Meantime Susie on the earnings front, it was Citi that reported better than expected quarterly results. Take a look at the results here with the bank earning $0.07 per share, a penny more than analyst estimates in the third quarter. This is Citi`s third straight quarterly profit.</p><p>GHARIB: Now bank stocks rallied on those results from Citi. Still, there are continuing concerns about the impact of the foreclosure crisis on banks and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. We have two reports tonight. We begin with Suzanne Pratt in New York.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. These are the banks with the biggest potential exposure to what`s now being called foreclosuregate. But just how much could faulty mortgage foreclosures cost the U.S. financial sector? On Wall Street, the range of estimates is staggering. JPMorgan`s own research staff says, worst case scenario, the price tag could reach a hefty $120 billion. That would cover the expense of buying back mortgages. Most banking experts however, are projecting losses closer to half that number, over a period of several years. S&amp;P analyst Erik Oja puts the cost somewhere in between financial fiasco and minor blip.</p><p>ERIK OJA, EQUITY ANALYST, STANDARD &amp; POOR`S: At this point I`m not sure if it`s a minor blip. I`m sure that as these banks go through their foreclosure pipeline, they will find instances of paperwork that needs to be redone.</p><p>PRATT: And Robert Albertson of Sandler O`Neill says speculating about the size of the losses is silly because the banks can handle it.</p><p>ROBERT ALBERTSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, SANDLER O`NEILL: People fail to understand how much the banks have reserved in case things drag out. It is massive. It is something beyond what they got to even in the great depression. So, I do not think there`s a number we should worry about.</p><p>PRATT: But worry is exactly what bank stock investors have been doing. In the last month, as mortgage foreclosure practices have come under increased scrutiny, the KBW bank stock index has fallen about 6 percent. Still, some bank analysts say selling the shares now is probably a big mistake.</p><p>ALBERTSON: In my judgment, all other things being equal, it`s probably a reason to buy. People are overreaching for negatives and they`re imagining things that make no common sense at all.</p><p>PRATT: Analysts say one thing about this foreclosure mess is that it`s overshadowing an improving earnings picture. Not only are banks posting profits, but credit quality is getting better. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This is Stephanie Dhue in Washington. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee nearly $200 billion worth of past due mortgages that could be foreclosed. Uncle Sam took control of the mortgage siblings in September 2008. Since then, taxpayers have given the companies $150 billion just to stay afloat. James Lockhart spent three years as the chief regulator of Fannie and Freddie, beginning at the height of the housing bubble. He thinks the foreclosure paperwork mess will cost taxpayers more.</p><p>JAMES LOCKHART, FORMER DIR., FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY: There is a foreclosure process. Different states have a different process. In many states it takes a very long time and in the meantime, Fannie and Freddie are not making any money, not getting any principal payment on the mortgage and as a result, effectively the taxpayer is giving a free loan to the homeowner.</p><p>DHUE: The average homeowner in default hasn`t made a payment in over a year. But it`s not just homeowners who may get a free ride. Investors in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie keep getting paid until a home is foreclosed and taken off the books. Karen Shaw Petrou says foreclosure delays put a further squeeze on the government-controlled firms.</p><p>KAREN SHAW PETROU, FEDERAL FINANCIAL ANALYTICS: In this Never Never land, Fannie and Freddie are paying the mortgage backed security investor, but they`re not getting any money in their hands with which to do it, so they`re in a real cash flow squeeze.</p><p>DHUE: That squeeze may not fall completely on taxpayers. Federal regulators are working to recoup $11 billion in losses by forcing banks to buy back mortgages that didn`t meet Fannie and Freddie underwriting standards. Known as putbacks in the industry, those sums could multiply as more shoddy paperwork is revealed. Lockhart says the issue may complicate the government`s ability to unwind Fannie and Freddie.</p><p>LOCKHART: To the extent we`re still fighting through this mortgage mess, it will be harder to get the will to fix Fannie and Freddie. There will be, unfortunately, a desire just to keep them sort of moving along without what we really need to do, is a resolution of their future and, more importantly, a resolution of the future in the mortgage market in this country.</p><p>DHUE: Many blame politics for helping get Fannie and Freddie into the mortgage mess in the first place and many think politics will make it just as difficult to get out. Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: Here are the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. Those strong results from Citigroup helped Wall Street start the week with some modest gains. By the time the closing bell was heard, the Dow jumped 80 points, the NASDAQ added 11, the S&amp;P 500 gained 8.5. Trading volume was light at the start of this week, with less than a billion shares changing hands on the big board, under two billion on the NASDAQ. Now stocks moved higher despite a pullback at the nation`s factories last month. The Federal Reserve reports industrial production fell 0.2 of a percent in September. Economists had expected a gain in output. And European Union finance ministers agreed in theory today to penalize member countries that overspend. They`re hoping to nip debt problems in the bud before they become full-blown crises. EU leaders are expected to adopt the new rules next week.</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead on the program, with the housing industry still struggling and the jobs picture still bleak, we talk with Morgan Stanley`s chief economist Richard Berner about the outlook for the U.S. economy.</p><p>HUDSON: From ninja loans, those so-called no income, no job needed home mortgages written at the height of housing bubble, to today`s robo signing foreclosure document mess is something broke with the way the home mortgage system works in America? Susan Wachter is a professor of real estate at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and she joins us tonight from Philadelphia. Professor, welcome to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. Nice to see you.</p><p>SUSAN WACHTER, REAL ESTATE PROFESSOR, WHARTON: Pleasure to be here.</p><p>HUDSON: So is the U.S. home mortgage system broken today?</p><p>WACHTER: Yes, Tom it is broken. The foreclosure documentation crisis is just one more example of a system that is, in fact, broken.</p><p>HUDSON: One of the reasons why you say it`s broken and what exactly is broken is the loss of control that has happened in the mortgage market. Control by whom? Who lost control?</p><p>WACHTER: Underwriters, lenders, securitizers across the board. There is a lack of control and a partial lack of control reflects a lack of oversight as well by regulators.</p><p>HUDSON: Talk about that second point in terms of the lack of oversight, because it is usually seen as mortgages are regulated at the state level, that there is not a lot of Federal oversight. Ought there be?</p><p>WACHTER: Absolutely there needs to be. The systemic risk that is generated is not a state-by-state, although I`m not saying there shouldn`t be state oversight as well. It is clearly in this case and very well can be going forward nationwide, so there needs to be oversight by regulators that are able to see the entire markets, Federal regulators.</p><p>HUDSON: I want to ask you about how to rebuild confidence but do you think it ought to be part of the new consumer financial products commission where that kind of oversight lies?</p><p>WACHTER: That could very well be there, absolutely.</p><p>HUDSON: Let`s take a look at some of your ideas to rebuild the mortgage system. You first say keep securitization. This is the idea that banks can tell mortgages into the secondary market and allow them to be securitized with mortgage-backed securities. Why do you think it is important to keep this system in place?</p><p>WACHTER: Securitization is necessary and worked for decades. Without securitization we won`t have a long-term fixed-rate mortgage. Now is not the time to rely only on short-term adjust (ph) rate mortgages because that puts the homeowner, the borrower facing interest rate risks that they can`t really deal with. Interest rates eventually are likely to go up and we will have another crisis. So we need securitization, but we need a securitization system that is transparent and where there are controls and oversight.</p><p>HUDSON: You talk about more transparency as well as an idea to rebuild confidence in the mortgage system. Transparency how and provided by whom by the home buyer, by the lender?</p><p>WACHTER: By the lender and by the securitizer. Information needs to be available, provided for mortgages and for mortgage-backed securities by both lenders, originators and securitizers in ways that can be analyzed by investors and overseen by regulators.</p><p>HUDSON: What exactly would you like to see, more FICA scores or credit scores and the ability of a homeowner to pay the mortgage, talking about appraisals? What types of transparencies do you think would help?</p><p>WACHTER: That information, absolutely. But more actually, the key point is that the information needs to be standardized, so that the information can be compared across mortgages and can be tracked over time. And the transparency that would then allow, that would allow transparency for investors and regulators to monitor what is happening to the mortgage system -- monitoring which we completely failed in this crisis.</p><p>HUDSON: Do you think that more uniform standards, more transparency would ultimately increase the cost of securitization thus increase the cost of a mortgage?</p><p>WACHTER: Not necessarily. In fact, quite the reverse. With more transparency, the more information, the risks should be less.</p><p>HUDSON: Our guest this evening taking a look at the mortgage system in the United States as it has been in trouble here, Susan Wachter along with us. She`s a professor of real estate at the Wharton School.</p><p>Not exactly a jump higher, instead stocks really kind of drifting higher throughout the day with a full schedule of corporate earnings this week led by a couple of tech giants after the close tonight. Get you updated here. The first one of course, the big Apple (AAPL) turning in results for its first full quarter to include sales of its new iPad. This quarter also saw the release of its latest iPhone, each of those really driving results and here they are. Earnings easily beating estimates, they were up almost 70 percent from just one year ago. Iphone was one of the biggest contributors, with sales up 91 percent compared to a year ago. IPad sales totaling 4.2 million units. Of course, the iPad did not even exist last year at this time. IPod sales though, continued slowing-- down 11 percent year over year. Some analysts point to the iPad and iPod sales in the past quarter as a bit disappointing. Now Apple stock came into this report hitting new all-time highs, but sold off a brief trading halt in after hours. Apple stock in fact was down as much as 6.5 percent after hours, dropping below $300 per share, clearly one to watch tomorrow.</p><p>Big blue the other big tech out after the close, IBM (IBM) beating the Street. A fifth of its revenue came from emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, the BRIC countries. Shares were at all- time highs for this report. They sold off 4 percent after the close. That came despite the company`s hiking guidance for the third time since July.</p><p>Taking the lead during the trading session were the big banks, repairing some of the losses last week from the foreclosure documentation problem. Here`s a trio led by Citigroup (C) leading the sector gainers, up more than 5 percent on huge volume. As we mentioned, its earnings were better than expected. Bank of America (BAC), the biggest gainer in the Dow Industrials, up 3 percent. B. of A. earnings one to watch, due out tomorrow morning. JPMorgan (JPM) the second best Dow component of the day, up almost 3 percent.</p><p>The energy sector also higher, but quarterly results from a couple of players really sapped their stocks. Halliburton (HAL) and McMoran Exploration (MMR) each fell after their earnings. Here`s Halliburton first of all. The stock falling from a six-month high despite beating the Street with a pick-up in drilling. Some analysts voiced concerns about high expectations for future earnings at Halliburton. McMoran Exploration meantime also fell from a six-month high after reporting a loss that was worse than expected. Energy production dropped and revenues fell at the company too, the stock off 13 percent.</p><p>While we`re talking about energy, in the utility space a multi- billion-dollar Monday buyout. The Massachusetts-based Northeast Utilities (NU) wants to buy Nstar (NST), based in Boston, for $4.3 billion in stock. This deal did not create many sparks for investors as you can see. Both Northeast and Nstar dropping about 1 percent. The purchase values Nstar at $40.28 a share. That is $1 above tonight`s closing price tonight. One other possible deal in energy, natural gas producer Quicksilver (KWK) jumped 17 percent. The firm`s ruling shareholder family is looking at alternatives, including taking it private possibly.</p><p>In medical devices meantime, St. Jude (STJ) looking to beef up its product pipeline, making a $1 billion play for AGA Medical (AGAM). It was a big volume gainer (ph), huge volume for AGA Medical on this 41 percent pop. The deal values AGA at $20.80 per share, clearly just a dime above tonight`s closing price. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Just two more weeks until the next meeting of the Federal Reserve and investors expect policymakers will announce a plan to pump more money into the financial system. Will that strategy give a boost to the economy? Joining us now, Morgan Stanley`s chief economist, Richard Berner. Hi Dick. Nice to you have back.</p><p>RICHARD BERNER, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, MORGAN STANLEY: Nice to be with you.</p><p>GHARIB: So it looks like the Fed is going to go ahead to add more money into the financial system come November. Six to nine months after that, will we be saying that the strategy paid off?</p><p>BERNER: Well, I think we will, Susie, although the benefits to quantitative easing are probably going to be pretty limited. And that`s because the transmission mechanism and monetary policy is not functioning as well as it should be. In your earlier piece you heard Susan Wachter talk about our housing finance system that`s not functioning well. And that`s one of the key reasons that the benefits are likely to be limited. There is one channel, there is one channel through which policy could have a boost though and that is the global or international channel. As the dollar weakens in foreign exchange markets and perhaps as other central banks decide also to adopt a more accommodative policy, that could be a boost forth U.S. economy.</p><p>GHARIB: But going back to the Fed, are you saying that this strategy then will accomplish little and if so, what are the alternatives, to get the economy, U.S. economy growing again?</p><p>BERNER: Well, let`s look at what the Fed is facing. The Fed as you know has a dual mandate. They`re missing on both sides of that dual mandate. The unemployment rate is too high and inflation is a little too low. And from what we`ve seen in the marketplace, the Fed I think has accomplished a lot without really doing anything, just talking about quantitative easing. Because long-term rates have come down and in particular, rates adjusted for inflation or real rates have come down very significantly. And that should be a boost to the economy.</p><p>Second, the Fed has already also accomplished another of its goals which is to boost inflation expectations. And that is part of the process of raising inflation back to where they think it should be. So at least from those two points of view, they have already accomplished something. But I think that the headwinds that are out there in the economy mean that the benefits to the economy itself are probably going to be somewhat limited.</p><p>GHARIB: The key thing for most people the proof that they want to see is what happens to the unemployment rate and even the Fed is saying that that is priority number one to get people working again. Where do you see the unemployment rate in 2011?</p><p>BERNER: Well, by the end of 2011 Susie it is probably going to be half a point lower than where it is today and it could go up in the meantime.</p><p>GHARIB: That`s not much of a change. What about in terms of growth? Right now the economy is growing at less than 2 percent. Do you see any pickup there?</p><p>BERNER: We think that next year we`ll see about a 3 percent growth rate compared to two to two and a half percent in the second half of this year.</p><p>GHARIB: All right, so just for most of Americans and people who are watching this program, they`ve put through a lot of pain with this economic crisis over the last couple of years and they want to know when are things going to get back to normal if at all? When do you see that happening, if ever?</p><p>BERNER: Well, if ever is a long time. I think it will happen in the next few years. But it`s pretty clear that we have some longer-term issues out there to solve in our economy, some problems and monetary policy is only part of the solution. We have structural problems. They require structural solutions and monetary policy can only be a partial help.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. We`re going to have to leave it there. Unfortunately we`ve run out of time. Thank you so much for coming on the program this evening.</p><p>BERNER: Thanks, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: We`ve been speaking with Richard Berner, chief economist at Morgan Stanley.</p><p>HUDSON: Here`s what we are watching for tomorrow. We will see September`s housing starts and building permits along with quarterly results due in from Bank of America as we mentioned, also Coca-Cola, Goldman Sachs and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Also tomorrow, our \"Word on the Street\" oil. It`s about 300 million years old, but the energy stocks you may want in your portfolio depend on how old you are.</p><p>GHARIB: If you can`t sell it, make it better. General Electric today said it will spend $432 million to update its appliance division. The focus on designing and building new energy-efficient refrigerators will add 500 jobs at new plants in Kentucky, Indiana, Alabama and Tennessee. GE spent much of 2008 trying to sell its appliance unit and since has invested nearly $1 billion on upgrades.</p><p>HUDSON: Cablevision subscribers in the New York City area and Philadelphia still cannot watch Fox programs. Cablevision and Fox parent News Corp are back at the negotiating table. Fox programming has been blocked out on Cablevision for three days so far. Cablevision says it pays $70 million a year for Fox programming and News Corp now wants $150 million. Cablevision customers have already missed playoff baseball and yesterday`s New York Giants game.</p><p>GHARIB: With the mid-term elections over two weeks away, tonight`s commentator believes there are really just two issues facing voters. Here`s Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia`s graduate school of business and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush.</p><p>GLENN HUBBARD, DEAN, COLUMBIA GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: To listen to the tax debate in Washington, the nation is having a tug of war over whose taxes should rise to cover the Federal government`s large budget deficits. President Obama argues that raising taxes only on individuals earning over $250,000 per year will return us to fiscal health. That is simply not true, given the large current and future deficits. Many Republicans argue against raising taxes on anyone. But what spending reductions would they recommend to stop the spiraling public debt burden?</p><p>Memo to Washington: we`re actually all in this together. The real questions are how big do we want government to be? And how can we pay for it with the least cost to economic growth and job creation? Keeping the government we now have will require major tax increases on all Americans. The budget holes of 5 percent of GDP in the near term, growing to twice that in the long term, cannot be fixed by raising taxes only on high-income families. Alternatively, we can reduce the growth of entitlement spending, while keeping a strong safety net. So what do we do now? We should extend the current tax code through 2012. Such a move will provide support to the struggling recovery and reduce uncertainty holding back business and household decisions. And the 2012 elections permit the tough conversation about those real questions. We all have a stake in the outcome. I`m Glenn Hubbard.</p><p>HUDSON: That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday evening, October 18. Thanks for joining us. I`m Tom Hudson. Have a great night, you too, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom you have a great night too. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night everyone and we hope to see all of you again tomorrow night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

The  Blackstone Group will take up residence here at the New York Stock  Exchange.  We`ll detail its $4 billion initial public offering.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Senate Banking  Chairman Christopher Dodd scolded bank regulators today, saying they didn`t  do enough to stop predatory lending in the sub-prime market.  Dodd also put  lenders on notice, saying they too are to blame for the sub-prime mess.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KANGAS: From sub-prime loans to sluggish sales and falling home  prices, we go region by region for a look at the state of the American  housing market.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  PRATT: Then, Oracle is taking on one of its biggest rivals in court.   We`ll tell you who the software giant is suing and why.  </p><p>KANGAS: I`m Paul Kangas.  </p><p>  PRATT: And I`m Suzanne Pratt.  Susie Gharib is off tonight.  This is  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, May (sic) 22.</p><p>KANGAS: Good evening, everyone.  One of the world`s largest private  equity funds is going public.  Late today, Blackstone Group announced a  $4.4 or $4 billion initial public offering.  The move lets investors buy  into a risky business that has traditionally been the ground of wealthy  individuals and large institutions.  Blackstone generated more than $7.5  billion in investment gains in 2006.  The company`s assets under management  are worth almost $79 billion.  Its portfolio includes real estate giant  Equity Office Properties, Extended Stay America Hotels, publisher Houghton  Mifflin and entertainment park Universal Orlando.  Blackstone will trade on  the New York Stock Exchange.  But there`s no IPO date or ticker symbol  specified in today`s filing with the SEC. But the company did say it won`t  give quarterly guidance to Wall Street because its business is quote,  unpredictable.</p><p>  PRATT: The meltdown in the sub-prime lending market reached Capitol  Hill today.  The Senate Banking Committee called regulators, lenders and  borrowers to learn more about the causes behind the sub-prime crisis.  But  as Stephanie Dhue reports, the committee quickly got down to the business  of laying blame.  </p><p>  STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With an  increasing number of homeowners facing foreclosure, lawmakers, including  New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, accused the Federal Reserve of being  asleep at the switch.  </p><p>  SEN. ROBERT MENENDEZ (D) NEW JERSEY: How could it be this big and you  have done your job? </p><p>   ROGER COLE, DIR., BANKING SUPERVISION &amp; REGULATION, FEDERAL RESERVE:  Given what we know now, yes, we could have done more sooner.  </p><p>  DHUE: Regulators say much of the sub-prime market falls outside their  jurisdiction, which deals mostly with ensuring that banks are financially  sound.  But Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd wasn`t buying that  argument.  </p><p>   SEN. CHRIS DODD, CHAIRMAN, BANKING COMMITTEE: The Fed had the  responsibility in my view, as a good cop, to be on the beat, particularly  going back several years ago, when the information first began to surface  that there were serious problems with these sub-prime loans.  </p><p>  DHUE: Dodd called on the regulators to quickly finalize tighter sub- prime lending standards.  But lenders warn some borrowers will be shut out  of the market.  Countrywide Financial says it would lose 60 percent of its  sub-prime business under the proposed tighter standards.  Still, the  company`s managing director, Sandor Samuels, says that`s not his key  concern.  </p><p>   SANDOR SAMUELS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL: The concern  that we have is the impact on the housing market and the impact on  borrowers who are in the sub-prime market.  And so we hope the regulations  can find a balance that will allow consumers to benefit from lower housing  payments, while protecting them from unaffordable payment increases.  </p><p>  DHUE: The committee also heard from borrowers now at risk of losing  their homes.  Jennie Haliburton got an adjustable 2/28 sub-prime loan from  Countrywide last year.  Her payment is set to adjust in May to more than 70  percent of her income.  </p><p>   JENNIE HALIBURTON, BORROWER:  I feel like they took advantage of me  because I`m 77 and they figure, \"oh, well, she`s old.\" </p><p>  DHUE: Countrywide says it will work with Mrs. Haliburton to keep her  in her home.  Senator Dodd says there are thousands of sub-prime borrowers  struggling with their mortgages and he wants to find ways to help them.   Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.  </p><p>  PRATT: KB Home`s quarterly earnings plummeted 84 percent, as home  prices dropped, inventories swelled and the sub-prime mortgage market began  to implode.  KB Home earned $0.34 a share in its fiscal first quarter.   That`s down sharply from the year-ago period, but $0.09 ahead of analyst  estimates.  Sales fell 19 percent to $1 3/4 billion, but that was still  ahead of estimates.  KB Home`s CEO says housing conditions remain  difficult, making it even harder to predict when the market will stabilize.   The company also says 13 percent of the mortgages for KB Homes last year  were financed with sub-prime loans.  </p><p>KANGAS: Wall Street felt the sting of profit taking this morning after  yesterday`s sharp rally.  Selling was also linked to Motorola`s forecast of  a first quarter loss and a rise in oil prices.  By 11 a.m., the Dow was off  30 points, NASDAQ down 12.  The blue chips improved this afternoon with the  help of a brokerage upgrade on Procter &amp; Gamble and some strong oil stocks,  but the broader market ended lower. The Dow Industrial Average closed up  13.62 at 12,461.14. NASDAQ Composite lost 4.18, ending at 2451.74.   Standard &amp; Poor`s 500 Index fell exactly a half point to 1434.54. Over in  the bond market, the 10-year note fell 12/32 to par and 10/32, lifting the  yield to 4.59 percent.</p><p>  PRATT: This week in our special housing series, we looked at market  conditions in three U.S. cities: New York, Washington, DC and Miami.   Tonight, we continue that series with a broader discussion of the national  housing market.  Our guest this evening is Mark Zandi, chief economist at  Moody`s economy.com.  Mark, welcome.  </p><p>       MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`S ECONOMY.COM: Thanks for having  me.</p><p>  PRATT: So what is the current state of the U.S. housing market? </p><p>  ZANDI:  It`s struggling.  The correction which began almost two years  ago is ongoing.  Since the peak, we have seen sales off about 10, 15  percent.  Starts are done by a third.  And prices are now falling in about  half to two-thirds of the nation`s market.  </p><p>  PRATT: So this is a correction, though, not a meltdown? </p><p>  ZANDI:  I would characterize it as a correction.  It is a severe  correction.  But at this point we`re not seeing double digit price  declines.  And the market is still holding together reasonably well so not  a crash, at least not yet.  </p><p>  PRATT: So tell me about the weakest areas of the country.  What are  some of those? </p><p>  ZANDI:  Well, they would include California, primarily southern  California.  San Diego would be a good case in point.  Arizona, Phoenix,  Las Vegas, most of Florida, particularly south of Florida and parts of the  northeast, Washington DC, the Boston region and of course the areas around  Detroit are very weak because of job losses in the auto industry.  </p><p>  PRATT:  And what about the strongest regions of the country, what are  those? </p><p>  ZANDI:  Well, there are fewer but Texas would be a relatively strong  housing market, some of the areas around the Carolinas, the farm belt and  the pas civic northwest.  In fact house prices in the Pacific northwest are  still rising at a double-digit pace.  </p><p>  PRATT:  So is it typical for a correction like this to be so uneven? </p><p>  ZANDI:  It is.  The house market is a very local market.  It really  depends on where you are.  Although I have to say this is the broadest the  housing market correction that I think we`ve experienced at least since the  great depression.  </p><p>  PRATT: So if it is so broad though is that, or does that have ominous  predictions or does that mean that we should be more concerned? </p><p>  ZANDI:  Well, we should be concerned.  The soft part of the economy  lies in the housing and now of course in the mortgage market.  Housing is  weighing heavily on the economy.  So far the problems in housing have been  largely contained to housing. They haven`t bled out to consumer spending  and business investment.  But given the problems and the fact that they are  ongoing, we need to watch that very carefully.  </p><p>  PRATT: So let`s talk a little bit about the sub-prime part of the  market.  I mean what does that mean? What is that likely to do to the  overall housing market? Could it take it into a meltdown? </p><p>  ZANDI:  Well, it is a significant problem.  If you consider all of the  very aggressive loans that have been extended in recent years, that would  include sub-prime, alternative A, prime loans that are interest only or  negative am loans -- these are very aggressive loans.  You combine all  those and these are ones at a significant risk of default.  They account  for 40 percent of origination volume last year and roughly one quarter of  all mortgage debt outstanding.  So this a significant market that is going  to be significantly affected.  As a result, we will see some measurable  impact on housing activity and probably as a result on the broader economy.  </p><p>  PRATT: One thing I want to make sure that we cover is the Fed and  their statement yesterday.  They sort of removed the bias, depending on who  you ask.  You think that that was because or directly because of the  housing market.  </p><p>  ZANDI:  Yeah, I think they did -- they did get rid of their bias  towards future higher interest rates.  They now have a neutral policy and I  think they did that to have some latitude just in case if the housing  market goes south and the mortgage market weakens, that they could ease if  they needed to.  At this point I don`t think they want to.  Inflation is  above their target.  They would prefer not to, but they needed a little bit  of flexibility and they got that in yesterday`s statement.  </p><p>  PRATT:  OK, great.  My guest this evening, Mark Zandi, chief economist  at moodyseconomy.com, thanks for joining us.  </p><p>  ZANDI:  Thank you.  </p><p>KANGAS: Business software maker Oracle sued German rival SAP today,  claiming SAP committed quote, corporate theft on a grand scale end quote.   Oracle says SAP illegally logged on to its password-protected customer web  sites many times, stealing huge amounts of software code, documents and  other confidential material.  Oracle claims it knows SAP excuse me, was the  culprit because Oracle traced the log-ons back to an SAP-owned subsidiary  in Texas.  SAP said it had no comment on the lawsuit.  Oracle wants a  California court to assess damages, force SAP to return the stolen items  and bar SAP from logging on to Oracle`s web sites.  </p><p>  Crude oil surged more than 2 percent today, jumping $2.08 to $61.69 a  barrel.  The rally was fueled by expectations energy demand will start to  surge as we head into the summer driving season.  And as Erika Miller  explains, experts expect oil prices to spurt even higher.  </p><p>  ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   Spring is  supposed to be the time of year when energy prices dip due to weak demand.   Instead, the opposite is happening.  Analyst Fadel Gheit blames an across- the-board rally in energy prices on strong demand for gasoline.  </p><p>  FADEL GHEIT, ENERGY ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO.: Right now, gasoline  prices are leading the energy markets in the U.S.  But it doesn`t mean that  oil prices are, you know, pulling back.  Oil prices have shown tremendous  resiliency that nobody had expected.  </p><p>  MILLER: Gasoline futures have surged over 20 percent since January.   They`re now at a seven-month high.  The rally is due in large part to fears  of a supply crunch heading into the summer driving season.  In the U.S.,  there has been an almost insatiable demand for motor fuel, despite higher  prices at the pump.  At the same time, supplies are dwindling.  Energy  trader Ira Eckstein blames that on glitches and seasonal maintenance at  refineries.  </p><p>   IRA ECKSTEIN, OIL TRADER, AREA INTERNATIONAL TRADING: We have these  outages, plus they are doing their usual spring -- they`re going from  heating oil to gasoline, so they had to close down some refineries in order  to switch over.  </p><p>  MILLER: There are also concerns about disruptions to crude supplies  due to geopolitical tensions in places like Iran, Nigeria, and Saudi  Arabia.  Another big unknown is weather. Hurricane season starts June 1,  raising the risk of damage to U.S. oil infrastructure.  In the near term,  many traders expect oil prices to inch higher.  The question is, how much? </p><p>   ECKSTEIN: Crude oil is going to test that $62.50 level -- maybe not  this week, but maybe early next week and I think that we could stay above  there.  We`ll see how we react when we get there.  </p><p>  MILLER: That`s bad news for motorists.  In some places, including New  York City, regular unleaded is approaching $3 a gallon.  But few experts  think we`ll head back to record levels just yet.  Erika Miller, NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT, New York </p><p>  PRATT: Transatlantic air travel took a leap into the future today, as  the European Union`s transport ministers approved plans to open the skies  to more competition.  The so-called open skies deal lets EU carriers fly  from any city in the block to any city in the U.S. and vice versa.  The  Bush administration welcomed the decision, saying it will spur growth and  give Americans more flying freedom.  The plan had been set to take effect  in October, but all sides agreed on a five-month delay.  The new start date  is March 30, 2008, Paul.  </p><p>KANGAS: Suzanne, shares of the major air carriers hit some turbulence  today on concerns that pact could trigger a price war.  We`ll look at how  they did as we take a look at our stocks in the news tonight.   </p><p>       Big board volume leader on nearly 51 million shares, Motorola (MOT)  down $1.24. After the close yesterday as we reported, the company predicted  a $0.07 to $0.09 per share first quarter loss.</p><p>  Then Pfizer (PFE) down $0.06.</p><p>  General Electric (GE) moved up $0.33. The company is teaming up with  News Corporation to launch an online video site to compete with youtube.  The details coming up shortly.</p><p>  Ford Motor Co (F) was up $0.07.</p><p>  CVS Caremark (CVS), this is the first day of trading for the new  merger company of CVS Caremark, down $0.36 a share, fifth in volume.</p><p>   AT&amp;T (T) rose $0.25.</p><p>Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) down a half a dollar.  Goldman Sachs downgraded  it from \"buy\" to \"neutral\" because it sees no sales recovery for the firm  before the third quarter of this year.</p><p>  ExxonMobil (XOM) up $1.13 on that sharp rise in oil.</p><p>  Chesapeake Energy (CHK) down $0.15.</p><p>  And Time Warner (TWX), tenth in volume, was off $0.28.</p><p>   Procter Gamble (PG) moved up $0.89. Bear Stearns upgraded it from  \"peer perform\" to \"out perform\" because of its attractive valuation in the  price of the stock, according to Bear Stearns.</p><p>  And then AMR (AMR) parent of American Airlines, down $1.54, not only  today because of the sharp rise in oil, but airfares are expected to tumble  next spring when the open skies package you just heard about goes into  effect.</p><p>  Let`s have a look at some other major carriers. Continental Air (CAL)  down $1.60.</p><p>  And UAL Corp (UAUA) losing $1.77.</p><p>   Raytheon Co (RTN) off $1.41.  The company boosted its annual dividend  6 percent from $0.96 to $1.02, but nevertheless, Goldman Sachs downgraded  the stock from \"neutral\" to a \"sell.\"</p><p>Conagra Foods (CAG), the big packaged foods company down $0.02 despite  a turnaround. Third quarter earnings of $0.38 versus a loss last year.   Those earnings $0.03 above the Street estimate.</p><p>  Another packaged foods company, General Mills (GIS) moving up $0.44.  Third quarter earnings there were up nearly 9 percent to $0.74, $0.04 above  the Street estimate and the company boosted its 2007 earnings guidance.</p><p>  Nortel Networks (NT) fell $1.53.  The company launched a $1 billion  offering of convertible debt, which of course has potential earnings  dilution.</p><p>  Then we see Barnes &amp; Noble (BKS), the book seller, down $1.10. The  company says preliminary fourth quarter earnings will be $1.84, up from  $1.76 last year, but $0.04 below the Wall Street estimate.</p><p>  IHS (IHS), a $3.90 gain. The aerospace defense contractor had nicely  higher first quarter earnings, $0.32 versus $0.24 last year and revenues up  18 percent.</p><p>  Clarcor (CLC) which is a big filtration company off $2.87.  Third  quarter earnings $0.32, a penny above last year, but $0.04 below the Street  estimate. Sales actually fell 1.7 percent.</p><p>  Google (GOOG) topped the active list on NASDAQ gaining $5.49.</p><p>  Apple (AAPL) a $0.09 rise.</p><p>  Microsoft (MSFT) down $0.25.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) a $0.42 loss.</p><p>  Intel (INTC) dropped $0.18 a share, fifth in dollar volume.</p><p>   Research in Motion (RIMM) up $1.64.</p><p>  Then Oracle (ORCL) a $0.32 gain there.</p><p>  Palm (PALM) closed down $1.71. Speculation appears to be cooling that  it might be the target of a takeover attempt. After the close, Palm  reported third quarter earnings excluding items, $0.16 a share, $0.04 above  the Street estimate. In after hours trading, the stock was about $0.20  higher than this.</p><p>  Broadcom (BRCM) down $1.29, hurt by Motorola`s earnings warning.</p><p>  And then Qualcomm (QCOM) tenth in volume was off $0.38 a share.</p><p>   Intuit (INTU) down $2.46. The company says its Turbotax software sales  are off to a slow start this tax season so far.</p><p>  Those are the stocks in the news tonight. Suzanne.</p><p>  PRATT: The SEC and the American Stock Exchange today settled their  differences over problems with the exchange`s oversight of options trading.   Regulators allege, from 1999 through June 2004, the Amex didn`t adequately  enforce certain order-handling rules and comply with record-keeping  guidelines.  The settlement creates a $3 million fund to help pay for  stepped up exchange surveillance.  Still in the works, though, EC action  against the Amex`s former Chairman Salvatore Sodano.  </p><p>KANGAS: Tomorrow, our Friday \"market monitor\" guest is Jeffrey  Everett, chief investment officer at Templeton Global Advisors.  </p><p>  PRATT: A Federal judge in Mississippi has turned down a request to  allow a class-action suit against State Farm insurance for denial of damage  claims from hurricane Katrina.  At issue so-called slab cases where houses  were destroyed down to the slab.  The judge said while all the homes were  ruined, there are other factors that make the cases unsuitable for class  action.  </p><p>KANGAS: Coca-Cola is rolling out a new version of its diet Coke drink,  adding vitamins and minerals to the mix.  The new diet Coke plus will  contain small mounts of vitamins B-3, B-6 and B-12, as well as magnesium  and zinc.  But the recipe for the soda itself will be unchanged.  Coke says  the new soft drink should hit U.S. store shelves next month.  </p><p>  PRATT: Here`s a look at what`s happening tomorrow.  February existing  home sales come out, along with earnings from Freddie Mac.  </p><p>  Tonight`s commentator has a few thoughts on what the Blackstone  Group`s $4 billion IPO could mean to Wall Street.  Here`s Chrystia  Freeland, U.S. managing editor of \"The Financial Times.\"  </p><p>  CHRYSTIA FREELAND, US MANAGING EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES: The irony of  the move is irresistible.  After all, the private equity business is based  on the idea that a lot of companies can be run more effectively if they are  liberated from the short-term targets and regulatory red tape that bedevils  the public market.  But there are some powerful reasons for Blackstone to  be tempted to go public.  The greatest may be the simplest.  Blackstone`s  founders are surely keen in Wall Street`s uncharacteristically coy  terminology to crystallize the value of their partnership.  </p><p>  In plainer language, that means they want to take their billions  before they retire.  In contrast with those pitied Goldman Sachs senior  partners who left the legendary firm before its IPO and missed out on the  windfall their younger colleagues collected.  For those of us not in line  to receive Blackstone`s billions, the greatest significance of an IPO would  be to make the private equity revolution more sustainable.  Private equity  has become so powerful it is easy to forget that the dominant groups are  just a few decades old, are still run by the men who founded them and are  dependent on Internet and fund-raising (INAUDIBLE) for most of their  capital.  Going public would give them access to permanent money and thus  make them a more permanent fixture in world business.  And that is the real  irony of the story.  Public capital could well give private equity groups a  more enduring power to take companies private.  I`m Chrystia Freeland.  </p><p>KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, a split decision on Wall  Street. The Dow gained 13 points while the NASDAQ Composite lost four  points.

And what does it take to make tax time less taxing? Scott Gurvey  has those answers and more in tonight`s \"tech talk.\"  </p><p>  SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   Tonight`s big  tech news is a partnership of two very unlikely bedfellows: NBC Universal  and Newscorp, parent of the Fox network.  Who could get these guys  together? Try youtube, the popular video-sharing web site now owned by  Google.  Youtube members make and post videos, often using original  material, but just as often using content recorded from TV and cable,  raising copyright concerns.  A competing site run by NBC and Newscorp would  have lots of content it could legally distribute.  Yahoo!, MSN, AOL and  Newscorp`s myspace will be involved.  Stay tuned.</p><p>  All of these sites make money by selling ads.  The more popular the  site, the more it can sell, and it adds up! Cisco Systems, Intel and  General Motors have already signed up to advertise on the new NBC-Newscorp  site.  There are big bucks involved.  Google paid $1.6 billion to buy  youtube and recently, Viacom sued youtube for $1 billion, charging it with  copyright infringement.  Youtube has yet to file a response.  The digital  millennium copyright act of 1998 was supposed to clarify copyright law in  the Internet age.  It appears there is more work to be done.  </p><p>  It is tax time and the IRS says more than 130 million returns will be  filed this year.  Thirty five million will be made with tax preparation  software.  I`ve tried the leading products and, while they all do a good  job, once again I`ve found Intuit`s Turbotax to be the most comprehensive  and easiest to use.  It does tend to cost $10 to $15 more than H&amp;R Block`s  tax cut.  This year, Intuit added a home and business version, perfect if  you file a Schedule C or need to generate W-2s for business or household  employees.  The tax software companies report their fastest growth is among  taxpayers who enter all their data online, a process Intuit`s Bob Meighan  says is simple and safe.  </p><p>   BOB MEIGHAN, VICE PRESIDENT, INTUIT: People don`t have to go to the  store and buy the software.  They don`t have to install it.  They don`t  have to worry about updates.  I can go to the web and access tax software  to do my return, so it`s convenient.  All the products I know about use  secure connections.  If you`re transmitting your return to the IRS, it`s  via secure connection, so the data is secure.  All the companies that I  know about guard your information very, very well, because we want to  protect your privacy.  </p><p>  GURVEY: Even with the tax software, I haven`t sent in my return yet.   How about you? Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.  </p><p>  PRATT: That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, March 22.  I`m  Suzanne Pratt.  Good night everyone and good night to you, Paul.  </p><p>KANGAS: Good night, Suzanne.  I`m Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the  best of good buys.   </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.  The program is transcribed by Voxant, Inc.

This is  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, May (sic) 22.</p><p>KANGAS: Good evening, everyone.  One of the world`s largest private  equity funds is going public.  Late today, Blackstone Group announced a  $4.4 or $4 billion initial public offering.  The move lets investors buy  into a risky business that has traditionally been the ground of wealthy  individuals and large institutions.  Blackstone generated more than $7.5  billion in investment gains in 2006.  The company`s assets under management  are worth almost $79 billion.  Its portfolio includes real estate giant  Equity Office Properties, Extended Stay America Hotels, publisher Houghton  Mifflin and entertainment park Universal Orlando.  Blackstone will trade on  the New York Stock Exchange.  But there`s no IPO date or ticker symbol  specified in today`s filing with the SEC. But the company did say it won`t  give quarterly guidance to Wall Street because its business is quote,  unpredictable.</p><p>PRATT: The meltdown in the sub-prime lending market reached Capitol  Hill today.  The Senate Banking Committee called regulators, lenders and  borrowers to learn more about the causes behind the sub-prime crisis.  But  as Stephanie Dhue reports, the committee quickly got down to the business  of laying blame.  </p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With an  increasing number of homeowners facing foreclosure, lawmakers, including  New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, accused the Federal Reserve of being  asleep at the switch.  </p><p>SEN. ROBERT MENENDEZ (D) NEW JERSEY: How could it be this big and you  have done your job? </p><p>ROGER COLE, DIR., BANKING SUPERVISION &amp; REGULATION, FEDERAL RESERVE:  Given what we know now, yes, we could have done more sooner.  </p><p>DHUE: Regulators say much of the sub-prime market falls outside their  jurisdiction, which deals mostly with ensuring that banks are financially  sound.  But Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd wasn`t buying that  argument.  </p><p>SEN. CHRIS DODD, CHAIRMAN, BANKING COMMITTEE: The Fed had the  responsibility in my view, as a good cop, to be on the beat, particularly  going back several years ago, when the information first began to surface  that there were serious problems with these sub-prime loans.  </p><p>DHUE: Dodd called on the regulators to quickly finalize tighter sub- prime lending standards.  But lenders warn some borrowers will be shut out  of the market.  Countrywide Financial says it would lose 60 percent of its  sub-prime business under the proposed tighter standards.  Still, the  company`s managing director, Sandor Samuels, says that`s not his key  concern.  </p><p>SANDOR SAMUELS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL: The concern  that we have is the impact on the housing market and the impact on  borrowers who are in the sub-prime market.  And so we hope the regulations  can find a balance that will allow consumers to benefit from lower housing  payments, while protecting them from unaffordable payment increases.  </p><p>DHUE: The committee also heard from borrowers now at risk of losing  their homes.  Jennie Haliburton got an adjustable 2/28 sub-prime loan from  Countrywide last year.  Her payment is set to adjust in May to more than 70  percent of her income.  </p><p>JENNIE HALIBURTON, BORROWER:  I feel like they took advantage of me  because I`m 77 and they figure, \"oh, well, she`s old.\" </p><p>DHUE: Countrywide says it will work with Mrs. Haliburton to keep her  in her home.  Senator Dodd says there are thousands of sub-prime borrowers  struggling with their mortgages and he wants to find ways to help them.   Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.  </p><p>PRATT: KB Home`s quarterly earnings plummeted 84 percent, as home  prices dropped, inventories swelled and the sub-prime mortgage market began  to implode.  KB Home earned $0.34 a share in its fiscal first quarter.   That`s down sharply from the year-ago period, but $0.09 ahead of analyst  estimates.  Sales fell 19 percent to $1 3/4 billion, but that was still  ahead of estimates.  KB Home`s CEO says housing conditions remain  difficult, making it even harder to predict when the market will stabilize.   The company also says 13 percent of the mortgages for KB Homes last year  were financed with sub-prime loans.  </p><p>KANGAS: Wall Street felt the sting of profit taking this morning after  yesterday`s sharp rally.  Selling was also linked to Motorola`s forecast of  a first quarter loss and a rise in oil prices.  By 11 a.m., the Dow was off  30 points, NASDAQ down 12.  The blue chips improved this afternoon with the  help of a brokerage upgrade on Procter &amp; Gamble and some strong oil stocks,  but the broader market ended lower. The Dow Industrial Average closed up  13.62 at 12,461.14. NASDAQ Composite lost 4.18, ending at 2451.74.   Standard &amp; Poor`s 500 Index fell exactly a half point to 1434.54. Over in  the bond market, the 10-year note fell 12/32 to par and 10/32, lifting the  yield to 4.59 percent.</p><p>PRATT: This week in our special housing series, we looked at market  conditions in three U.S. cities: New York, Washington, DC and Miami.   Tonight, we continue that series with a broader discussion of the national  housing market.  Our guest this evening is Mark Zandi, chief economist at  Moody`s economy.com.  Mark, welcome.  </p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`S ECONOMY.COM: Thanks for having  me.</p><p>PRATT: So what is the current state of the U.S. housing market? </p><p>ZANDI:  It`s struggling.  The correction which began almost two years  ago is ongoing.  Since the peak, we have seen sales off about 10, 15  percent.  Starts are done by a third.  And prices are now falling in about  half to two-thirds of the nation`s market.  </p><p>PRATT: So this is a correction, though, not a meltdown? </p><p>ZANDI:  I would characterize it as a correction.  It is a severe  correction.  But at this point we`re not seeing double digit price  declines.  And the market is still holding together reasonably well so not  a crash, at least not yet.  </p><p>PRATT: So tell me about the weakest areas of the country.  What are  some of those? </p><p>ZANDI:  Well, they would include California, primarily southern  California.  San Diego would be a good case in point.  Arizona, Phoenix,  Las Vegas, most of Florida, particularly south of Florida and parts of the  northeast, Washington DC, the Boston region and of course the areas around  Detroit are very weak because of job losses in the auto industry.  </p><p>PRATT:  And what about the strongest regions of the country, what are  those? </p><p>ZANDI:  Well, there are fewer but Texas would be a relatively strong  housing market, some of the areas around the Carolinas, the farm belt and  the pas civic northwest.  In fact house prices in the Pacific northwest are  still rising at a double-digit pace.  </p><p>PRATT:  So is it typical for a correction like this to be so uneven? </p><p>ZANDI:  It is.  The house market is a very local market.  It really  depends on where you are.  Although I have to say this is the broadest the  housing market correction that I think we`ve experienced at least since the  great depression.  </p><p>PRATT: So if it is so broad though is that, or does that have ominous  predictions or does that mean that we should be more concerned? </p><p>ZANDI:  Well, we should be concerned.  The soft part of the economy  lies in the housing and now of course in the mortgage market.  Housing is  weighing heavily on the economy.  So far the problems in housing have been  largely contained to housing. They haven`t bled out to consumer spending  and business investment.  But given the problems and the fact that they are  ongoing, we need to watch that very carefully.  </p><p>PRATT: So let`s talk a little bit about the sub-prime part of the  market.  I mean what does that mean? What is that likely to do to the  overall housing market? Could it take it into a meltdown? </p><p>ZANDI:  Well, it is a significant problem.  If you consider all of the  very aggressive loans that have been extended in recent years, that would  include sub-prime, alternative A, prime loans that are interest only or  negative am loans -- these are very aggressive loans.  You combine all  those and these are ones at a significant risk of default.  They account  for 40 percent of origination volume last year and roughly one quarter of  all mortgage debt outstanding.  So this a significant market that is going  to be significantly affected.  As a result, we will see some measurable  impact on housing activity and probably as a result on the broader economy.  </p><p>PRATT: One thing I want to make sure that we cover is the Fed and  their statement yesterday.  They sort of removed the bias, depending on who  you ask.  You think that that was because or directly because of the  housing market.  </p><p>ZANDI:  Yeah, I think they did -- they did get rid of their bias  towards future higher interest rates.  They now have a neutral policy and I  think they did that to have some latitude just in case if the housing  market goes south and the mortgage market weakens, that they could ease if  they needed to.  At this point I don`t think they want to.  Inflation is  above their target.  They would prefer not to, but they needed a little bit  of flexibility and they got that in yesterday`s statement.  </p><p>PRATT:  OK, great.  My guest this evening, Mark Zandi, chief economist  at moodyseconomy.com, thanks for joining us.  </p><p>ZANDI:  Thank you.  </p><p>KANGAS: Business software maker Oracle sued German rival SAP today,  claiming SAP committed quote, corporate theft on a grand scale end quote.   Oracle says SAP illegally logged on to its password-protected customer web  sites many times, stealing huge amounts of software code, documents and  other confidential material.  Oracle claims it knows SAP excuse me, was the  culprit because Oracle traced the log-ons back to an SAP-owned subsidiary  in Texas.  SAP said it had no comment on the lawsuit.  Oracle wants a  California court to assess damages, force SAP to return the stolen items  and bar SAP from logging on to Oracle`s web sites.  </p><p>Crude oil surged more than 2 percent today, jumping $2.08 to $61.69 a  barrel.  The rally was fueled by expectations energy demand will start to  surge as we head into the summer driving season.  And as Erika Miller  explains, experts expect oil prices to spurt even higher.  </p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   Spring is  supposed to be the time of year when energy prices dip due to weak demand.   Instead, the opposite is happening.  Analyst Fadel Gheit blames an across- the-board rally in energy prices on strong demand for gasoline.  </p><p>FADEL GHEIT, ENERGY ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO.: Right now, gasoline  prices are leading the energy markets in the U.S.  But it doesn`t mean that  oil prices are, you know, pulling back.  Oil prices have shown tremendous  resiliency that nobody had expected.  </p><p>MILLER: Gasoline futures have surged over 20 percent since January.   They`re now at a seven-month high.  The rally is due in large part to fears  of a supply crunch heading into the summer driving season.  In the U.S.,  there has been an almost insatiable demand for motor fuel, despite higher  prices at the pump.  At the same time, supplies are dwindling.  Energy  trader Ira Eckstein blames that on glitches and seasonal maintenance at  refineries.  </p><p>IRA ECKSTEIN, OIL TRADER, AREA INTERNATIONAL TRADING: We have these  outages, plus they are doing their usual spring -- they`re going from  heating oil to gasoline, so they had to close down some refineries in order  to switch over.  </p><p>MILLER: There are also concerns about disruptions to crude supplies  due to geopolitical tensions in places like Iran, Nigeria, and Saudi  Arabia.  Another big unknown is weather. Hurricane season starts June 1,  raising the risk of damage to U.S. oil infrastructure.  In the near term,  many traders expect oil prices to inch higher.  The question is, how much? </p><p>ECKSTEIN: Crude oil is going to test that $62.50 level -- maybe not  this week, but maybe early next week and I think that we could stay above  there.  We`ll see how we react when we get there.  </p><p>MILLER: That`s bad news for motorists.  In some places, including New  York City, regular unleaded is approaching $3 a gallon.  But few experts  think we`ll head back to record levels just yet.  Erika Miller, NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT, New York </p><p>PRATT: Transatlantic air travel took a leap into the future today, as  the European Union`s transport ministers approved plans to open the skies  to more competition.  The so-called open skies deal lets EU carriers fly  from any city in the block to any city in the U.S. and vice versa.  The  Bush administration welcomed the decision, saying it will spur growth and  give Americans more flying freedom.  The plan had been set to take effect  in October, but all sides agreed on a five-month delay.  The new start date  is March 30, 2008, Paul.  </p><p>KANGAS: Suzanne, shares of the major air carriers hit some turbulence  today on concerns that pact could trigger a price war.  We`ll look at how  they did as we take a look at our stocks in the news tonight.   </p><p>Big board volume leader on nearly 51 million shares, Motorola (MOT)  down $1.24.

Goldman Sachs downgraded  it from \"buy\" to \"neutral\" because it sees no sales recovery for the firm  before the third quarter of this year.</p><p>ExxonMobil (XOM) up $1.13 on that sharp rise in oil.</p><p>Chesapeake Energy (CHK) down $0.15.</p><p>And Time Warner (TWX), tenth in volume, was off $0.28.</p><p>Procter Gamble (PG) moved up $0.89. Bear Stearns upgraded it from  \"peer perform\" to \"out perform\" because of its attractive valuation in the  price of the stock, according to Bear Stearns.</p><p>And then AMR (AMR) parent of American Airlines, down $1.54, not only  today because of the sharp rise in oil, but airfares are expected to tumble  next spring when the open skies package you just heard about goes into  effect.</p><p>Let`s have a look at some other major carriers. Continental Air (CAL)  down $1.60.</p><p>And UAL Corp (UAUA) losing $1.77.</p><p>Raytheon Co (RTN) off $1.41.  The company boosted its annual dividend  6 percent from $0.96 to $1.02, but nevertheless, Goldman Sachs downgraded  the stock from \"neutral\" to a \"sell.\"</p><p>Conagra Foods (CAG), the big packaged foods company down $0.02 despite  a turnaround. Third quarter earnings of $0.38 versus a loss last year.   Those earnings $0.03 above the Street estimate.</p><p>Another packaged foods company, General Mills (GIS) moving up $0.44.  Third quarter earnings there were up nearly 9 percent to $0.74, $0.04 above  the Street estimate and the company boosted its 2007 earnings guidance.</p><p>Nortel Networks (NT) fell $1.53.  The company launched a $1 billion  offering of convertible debt, which of course has potential earnings  dilution.</p><p>Then we see Barnes &amp; Noble (BKS), the book seller, down $1.10. The  company says preliminary fourth quarter earnings will be $1.84, up from  $1.76 last year, but $0.04 below the Wall Street estimate.</p><p>IHS (IHS), a $3.90 gain. The aerospace defense contractor had nicely  higher first quarter earnings, $0.32 versus $0.24 last year and revenues up  18 percent.</p><p>Clarcor (CLC) which is a big filtration company off $2.87.  Third  quarter earnings $0.32, a penny above last year, but $0.04 below the Street  estimate. Sales actually fell 1.7 percent.</p><p>Google (GOOG) topped the active list on NASDAQ gaining $5.49.</p><p>Apple (AAPL) a $0.09 rise.</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) down $0.25.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) a $0.42 loss.</p><p>Intel (INTC) dropped $0.18 a share, fifth in dollar volume.</p><p>Research in Motion (RIMM) up $1.64.</p><p>Then Oracle (ORCL) a $0.32 gain there.</p><p>Palm (PALM) closed down $1.71. Speculation appears to be cooling that  it might be the target of a takeover attempt.

In after hours trading, the stock was about $0.20  higher than this.</p><p>Broadcom (BRCM) down $1.29, hurt by Motorola`s earnings warning.</p><p>And then Qualcomm (QCOM) tenth in volume was off $0.38 a share.</p><p>Intuit (INTU) down $2.46. The company says its Turbotax software sales  are off to a slow start this tax season so far.</p><p>Those are the stocks in the news tonight. Suzanne.</p><p>PRATT: The SEC and the American Stock Exchange today settled their  differences over problems with the exchange`s oversight of options trading.   Regulators allege, from 1999 through June 2004, the Amex didn`t adequately  enforce certain order-handling rules and comply with record-keeping  guidelines.  The settlement creates a $3 million fund to help pay for  stepped up exchange surveillance.  Still in the works, though, EC action  against the Amex`s former Chairman Salvatore Sodano.  </p><p>KANGAS: Tomorrow, our Friday \"market monitor\" guest is Jeffrey  Everett, chief investment officer at Templeton Global Advisors.  </p><p>PRATT: A Federal judge in Mississippi has turned down a request to  allow a class-action suit against State Farm insurance for denial of damage  claims from hurricane Katrina.  At issue so-called slab cases where houses  were destroyed down to the slab.  The judge said while all the homes were  ruined, there are other factors that make the cases unsuitable for class  action.  </p><p>KANGAS: Coca-Cola is rolling out a new version of its diet Coke drink,  adding vitamins and minerals to the mix.  The new diet Coke plus will  contain small mounts of vitamins B-3, B-6 and B-12, as well as magnesium  and zinc.  But the recipe for the soda itself will be unchanged.  Coke says  the new soft drink should hit U.S. store shelves next month.  </p><p>PRATT: Here`s a look at what`s happening tomorrow.  February existing  home sales come out, along with earnings from Freddie Mac.  </p><p>Tonight`s commentator has a few thoughts on what the Blackstone  Group`s $4 billion IPO could mean to Wall Street.  Here`s Chrystia  Freeland, U.S. managing editor of \"The Financial Times.\"  </p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, US MANAGING EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES: The irony of  the move is irresistible.  After all, the private equity business is based  on the idea that a lot of companies can be run more effectively if they are  liberated from the short-term targets and regulatory red tape that bedevils  the public market.  But there are some powerful reasons for Blackstone to  be tempted to go public.  The greatest may be the simplest.  Blackstone`s  founders are surely keen in Wall Street`s uncharacteristically coy  terminology to crystallize the value of their partnership.  </p><p>In plainer language, that means they want to take their billions  before they retire.  In contrast with those pitied Goldman Sachs senior  partners who left the legendary firm before its IPO and missed out on the  windfall their younger colleagues collected.  For those of us not in line  to receive Blackstone`s billions, the greatest significance of an IPO would  be to make the private equity revolution more sustainable.  Private equity  has become so powerful it is easy to forget that the dominant groups are  just a few decades old, are still run by the men who founded them and are  dependent on Internet and fund-raising (INAUDIBLE) for most of their  capital.  Going public would give them access to permanent money and thus  make them a more permanent fixture in world business.  And that is the real  irony of the story.  Public capital could well give private equity groups a  more enduring power to take companies private.  I`m Chrystia Freeland.  </p><p>KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, a split decision on Wall  Street. The Dow gained 13 points while the NASDAQ Composite lost four  points.

And what does it take to make tax time less taxing? Scott Gurvey  has those answers and more in tonight`s \"tech talk.\"  </p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   Tonight`s big  tech news is a partnership of two very unlikely bedfellows: NBC Universal  and Newscorp, parent of the Fox network.  Who could get these guys  together? Try youtube, the popular video-sharing web site now owned by  Google.  Youtube members make and post videos, often using original  material, but just as often using content recorded from TV and cable,  raising copyright concerns.  A competing site run by NBC and Newscorp would  have lots of content it could legally distribute.  Yahoo!, MSN, AOL and  Newscorp`s myspace will be involved.  Stay tuned.</p><p>All of these sites make money by selling ads.  The more popular the  site, the more it can sell, and it adds up! Cisco Systems, Intel and  General Motors have already signed up to advertise on the new NBC-Newscorp  site.  There are big bucks involved.  Google paid $1.6 billion to buy  youtube and recently, Viacom sued youtube for $1 billion, charging it with  copyright infringement.  Youtube has yet to file a response.  The digital  millennium copyright act of 1998 was supposed to clarify copyright law in  the Internet age.  It appears there is more work to be done.  </p><p>It is tax time and the IRS says more than 130 million returns will be  filed this year.  Thirty five million will be made with tax preparation  software.  I`ve tried the leading products and, while they all do a good  job, once again I`ve found Intuit`s Turbotax to be the most comprehensive  and easiest to use.  It does tend to cost $10 to $15 more than H&amp;R Block`s  tax cut.  This year, Intuit added a home and business version, perfect if  you file a Schedule C or need to generate W-2s for business or household  employees.  The tax software companies report their fastest growth is among  taxpayers who enter all their data online, a process Intuit`s Bob Meighan  says is simple and safe.  </p><p>BOB MEIGHAN, VICE PRESIDENT, INTUIT: People don`t have to go to the  store and buy the software.  They don`t have to install it.  They don`t  have to worry about updates.  I can go to the web and access tax software  to do my return, so it`s convenient.  All the products I know about use  secure connections.  If you`re transmitting your return to the IRS, it`s  via secure connection, so the data is secure.  All the companies that I  know about guard your information very, very well, because we want to  protect your privacy.  </p><p>GURVEY: Even with the tax software, I haven`t sent in my return yet.   How about you? Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.  </p><p>PRATT: That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, March 22.  I`m  Suzanne Pratt.  Good night everyone and good night to you, Paul.  </p><p>KANGAS: Good night, Suzanne.  I`m Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the  best of good buys.   </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.  The program is transcribed by Voxant, Inc.

Dodd also put lenders on notice, saying they too are to blame for the sub-prime mess.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KANGAS: From sub-prime loans to sluggish sales and falling home prices, we go region by region for a look at the state of the American housing market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PRATT: Then, Oracle is taking on one of its biggest rivals in court.

This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, May (sic) 22.</p><p>KANGAS: Good evening, everyone. One of the world`s largest private equity funds is going public. Late today, Blackstone Group announced a $4.4 or $4 billion initial public offering. The move lets investors buy into a risky business that has traditionally been the ground of wealthy individuals and large institutions. Blackstone generated more than $7.5 billion in investment gains in 2006. The company`s assets under management are worth almost $79 billion. Its portfolio includes real estate giant Equity Office Properties, Extended Stay America Hotels, publisher Houghton Mifflin and entertainment park Universal Orlando. Blackstone will trade on the New York Stock Exchange. But there`s no IPO date or ticker symbol specified in today`s filing with the SEC. But the company did say it won`t give quarterly guidance to Wall Street because its business is quote, unpredictable.</p><p>PRATT: The meltdown in the sub-prime lending market reached Capitol Hill today. The Senate Banking Committee called regulators, lenders and borrowers to learn more about the causes behind the sub-prime crisis. But as Stephanie Dhue reports, the committee quickly got down to the business of laying blame.</p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: With an increasing number of homeowners facing foreclosure, lawmakers, including New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, accused the Federal Reserve of being asleep at the switch.</p><p>SEN. ROBERT MENENDEZ (D) NEW JERSEY: How could it be this big and you have done your job?</p><p>ROGER COLE, DIR., BANKING SUPERVISION &amp; REGULATION, FEDERAL RESERVE: Given what we know now, yes, we could have done more sooner.</p><p>DHUE: Regulators say much of the sub-prime market falls outside their jurisdiction, which deals mostly with ensuring that banks are financially sound. But Senate Banking Committee Chairman <person><nameText>Chris Dodd </nameText></person>wasn`t buying that argument.</p><p><person><nameText>SEN. CHRIS DODD, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, BANKING COMMITTEE: The Fed had the responsibility in my view, as a good cop, to be on the beat, particularly going back several years ago, when the information first began to surface that there were serious problems with these sub-prime loans.</p><p>DHUE: Dodd called on the regulators to quickly finalize tighter sub- prime lending standards. But lenders warn some borrowers will be shut out of the market. Countrywide Financial says it would lose 60 percent of its sub-prime business under the proposed tighter standards. Still, the company`s managing director, Sandor Samuels, says that`s not his key concern.</p><p>SANDOR SAMUELS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL: The concern that we have is the impact on the housing market and the impact on borrowers who are in the sub-prime market. And so we hope the regulations can find a balance that will allow consumers to benefit from lower housing payments, while protecting them from unaffordable payment increases.</p><p>DHUE: The committee also heard from borrowers now at risk of losing their homes. Jennie Haliburton got an adjustable 2/28 sub-prime loan from Countrywide last year. Her payment is set to adjust in May to more than 70 percent of her income.</p><p>JENNIE HALIBURTON, BORROWER: I feel like they took advantage of me because I`m 77 and they figure, \"oh, well, she`s old.\"</p><p>DHUE: Countrywide says it will work with Mrs. Haliburton to keep her in her home. Senator Dodd says there are thousands of sub-prime borrowers struggling with their mortgages and he wants to find ways to help them. Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>PRATT: KB Home`s quarterly earnings plummeted 84 percent, as home prices dropped, inventories swelled and the sub-prime mortgage market began to implode. KB Home earned $0.34 a share in its fiscal first quarter. That`s down sharply from the year-ago period, but $0.09 ahead of analyst estimates. Sales fell 19 percent to $1 3/4 billion, but that was still ahead of estimates. KB Home`s CEO says housing conditions remain difficult, making it even harder to predict when the market will stabilize. The company also says 13 percent of the mortgages for KB Homes last year were financed with sub-prime loans.</p><p>KANGAS: Wall Street felt the sting of profit taking this morning after yesterday`s sharp rally. Selling was also linked to Motorola`s forecast of a first quarter loss and a rise in oil prices. By 11 a.m., the Dow was off 30 points, NASDAQ down 12. The blue chips improved this afternoon with the help of a brokerage upgrade on Procter &amp; Gamble and some strong oil stocks, but the broader market ended lower. The Dow Industrial Average closed up 13.62 at 12,461.14. NASDAQ Composite lost 4.18, ending at 2451.74. Standard &amp; Poor`s 500 Index fell exactly a half point to 1434.54. Over in the bond market, the 10-year note fell 12/32 to par and 10/32, lifting the yield to 4.59 percent.</p><p>PRATT: This week in our special housing series, we looked at market conditions in three U.S. cities: New York, Washington, DC and Miami. Tonight, we continue that series with a broader discussion of the national housing market. Our guest this evening is Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody`s economy.com. Mark, welcome.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`S ECONOMY.COM: Thanks for having me.</p><p>PRATT: So what is the current state of the U.S. housing market?</p><p>ZANDI: It`s struggling. The correction which began almost two years ago is ongoing. Since the peak, we have seen sales off about 10, 15 percent. Starts are done by a third. And prices are now falling in about half to two-thirds of the nation`s market.</p><p>PRATT: So this is a correction, though, not a meltdown?</p><p>ZANDI: I would characterize it as a correction. It is a severe correction. But at this point we`re not seeing double digit price declines. And the market is still holding together reasonably well so not a crash, at least not yet.</p><p>PRATT: So tell me about the weakest areas of the country. What are some of those?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, they would include California, primarily southern California. San Diego would be a good case in point. Arizona, Phoenix, Las Vegas, most of Florida, particularly south of Florida and parts of the northeast, Washington DC, the Boston region and of course the areas around Detroit are very weak because of job losses in the auto industry.</p><p>PRATT: And what about the strongest regions of the country, what are those?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, there are fewer but Texas would be a relatively strong housing market, some of the areas around the Carolinas, the farm belt and the pas civic northwest. In fact house prices in the Pacific northwest are still rising at a double-digit pace.</p><p>PRATT: So is it typical for a correction like this to be so uneven?</p><p>ZANDI: It is. The house market is a very local market. It really depends on where you are. Although I have to say this is the broadest the housing market correction that I think we`ve experienced at least since the great depression.</p><p>PRATT: So if it is so broad though is that, or does that have ominous predictions or does that mean that we should be more concerned?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, we should be concerned. The soft part of the economy lies in the housing and now of course in the mortgage market. Housing is weighing heavily on the economy. So far the problems in housing have been largely contained to housing. They haven`t bled out to consumer spending and business investment. But given the problems and the fact that they are ongoing, we need to watch that very carefully.</p><p>PRATT: So let`s talk a little bit about the sub-prime part of the market. I mean what does that mean? What is that likely to do to the overall housing market? Could it take it into a meltdown?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, it is a significant problem. If you consider all of the very aggressive loans that have been extended in recent years, that would include sub-prime, alternative A, prime loans that are interest only or negative am loans -- these are very aggressive loans. You combine all those and these are ones at a significant risk of default. They account for 40 percent of origination volume last year and roughly one quarter of all mortgage debt outstanding. So this a significant market that is going to be significantly affected. As a result, we will see some measurable impact on housing activity and probably as a result on the broader economy.</p><p>PRATT: One thing I want to make sure that we cover is the Fed and their statement yesterday. They sort of removed the bias, depending on who you ask. You think that that was because or directly because of the housing market.</p><p>ZANDI: Yeah, I think they did -- they did get rid of their bias towards future higher interest rates. They now have a neutral policy and I think they did that to have some latitude just in case if the housing market goes south and the mortgage market weakens, that they could ease if they needed to. At this point I don`t think they want to. Inflation is above their target. They would prefer not to, but they needed a little bit of flexibility and they got that in yesterday`s statement.</p><p>PRATT: OK, great. My guest this evening, Mark Zandi, chief economist at moodyseconomy.com, thanks for joining us.</p><p>ZANDI: Thank you.</p><p>KANGAS: Business software maker Oracle sued German rival SAP today, claiming SAP committed quote, corporate theft on a grand scale end quote. Oracle says SAP illegally logged on to its password-protected customer web sites many times, stealing huge amounts of software code, documents and other confidential material. Oracle claims it knows SAP excuse me, was the culprit because Oracle traced the log-ons back to an SAP-owned subsidiary in Texas. SAP said it had no comment on the lawsuit. Oracle wants a California court to assess damages, force SAP to return the stolen items and bar SAP from logging on to Oracle`s web sites.</p><p>Crude oil surged more than 2 percent today, jumping $2.08 to $61.69 a barrel. The rally was fueled by expectations energy demand will start to surge as we head into the summer driving season. And as Erika Miller explains, experts expect oil prices to spurt even higher.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Spring is supposed to be the time of year when energy prices dip due to weak demand. Instead, the opposite is happening. Analyst Fadel Gheit blames an across- the-board rally in energy prices on strong demand for gasoline.</p><p>FADEL GHEIT, ENERGY ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO.: Right now, gasoline prices are leading the energy markets in the U.S. But it doesn`t mean that oil prices are, you know, pulling back. Oil prices have shown tremendous resiliency that nobody had expected.</p><p>MILLER: Gasoline futures have surged over 20 percent since January. They`re now at a seven-month high. The rally is due in large part to fears of a supply crunch heading into the summer driving season. In the U.S., there has been an almost insatiable demand for motor fuel, despite higher prices at the pump. At the same time, supplies are dwindling. Energy trader Ira Eckstein blames that on glitches and seasonal maintenance at refineries.</p><p>IRA ECKSTEIN, OIL TRADER, AREA INTERNATIONAL TRADING: We have these outages, plus they are doing their usual spring -- they`re going from heating oil to gasoline, so they had to close down some refineries in order to switch over.</p><p>MILLER: There are also concerns about disruptions to crude supplies due to geopolitical tensions in places like Iran, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia. Another big unknown is weather. Hurricane season starts June 1, raising the risk of damage to U.S. oil infrastructure. In the near term, many traders expect oil prices to inch higher. The question is, how much?</p><p>ECKSTEIN: Crude oil is going to test that $62.50 level -- maybe not this week, but maybe early next week and I think that we could stay above there. We`ll see how we react when we get there.</p><p>MILLER: That`s bad news for motorists. In some places, including New York City, regular unleaded is approaching $3 a gallon. But few experts think we`ll head back to record levels just yet. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York</p><p>PRATT: Transatlantic air travel took a leap into the future today, as the European Union`s transport ministers approved plans to open the skies to more competition. The so-called open skies deal lets EU carriers fly from any city in the block to any city in the U.S. and vice versa. The Bush administration welcomed the decision, saying it will spur growth and give Americans more flying freedom. The plan had been set to take effect in October, but all sides agreed on a five-month delay. The new start date is March 30, 2008, Paul.</p><p>KANGAS: Suzanne, shares of the major air carriers hit some turbulence today on concerns that pact could trigger a price war. We`ll look at how they did as we take a look at our stocks in the news tonight.</p><p>Big board volume leader on nearly 51 million shares, Motorola (MOT) down $1.24. After the close yesterday as we reported, the company predicted a $0.07 to $0.09 per share first quarter loss.</p><p>Then Pfizer (PFE) down $0.06.</p><p>General Electric (GE) moved up $0.33. The company is teaming up with News Corporation to launch an online video site to compete with youtube. The details coming up shortly.</p><p>Ford Motor Co (F) was up $0.07.</p><p>CVS Caremark (CVS), this is the first day of trading for the new merger company of CVS Caremark, down $0.36 a share, fifth in volume.</p><p>AT&amp;T (T) rose $0.25.</p><p>Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) down a half a dollar. Goldman Sachs downgraded it from \"buy\" to \"neutral\" because it sees no sales recovery for the firm before the third quarter of this year.</p><p>ExxonMobil (XOM) up $1.13 on that sharp rise in oil.</p><p>Chesapeake Energy (CHK) down $0.15.</p><p>And Time Warner (TWX), tenth in volume, was off $0.28.</p><p>Procter Gamble (PG) moved up $0.89. Bear Stearns upgraded it from \"peer perform\" to \"out perform\" because of its attractive valuation in the price of the stock, according to Bear Stearns.</p><p>And then AMR (AMR) parent of American Airlines, down $1.54, not only today because of the sharp rise in oil, but airfares are expected to tumble next spring when the open skies package you just heard about goes into effect.</p><p>Let`s have a look at some other major carriers. Continental Air (CAL) down $1.60.</p><p>And UAL Corp (UAUA) losing $1.77.</p><p>Raytheon Co (RTN) off $1.41. The company boosted its annual dividend 6 percent from $0.96 to $1.02, but nevertheless, Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock from \"neutral\" to a \"sell.\"</p><p>Conagra Foods (CAG), the big packaged foods company down $0.02 despite a turnaround. Third quarter earnings of $0.38 versus a loss last year. Those earnings $0.03 above the Street estimate.</p><p>Another packaged foods company, General Mills (GIS) moving up $0.44. Third quarter earnings there were up nearly 9 percent to $0.74, $0.04 above the Street estimate and the company boosted its 2007 earnings guidance.</p><p>Nortel Networks (NT) fell $1.53. The company launched a $1 billion offering of convertible debt, which of course has potential earnings dilution.</p><p>Then we see Barnes &amp; Noble (BKS), the book seller, down $1.10. The company says preliminary fourth quarter earnings will be $1.84, up from $1.76 last year, but $0.04 below the Wall Street estimate.</p><p>IHS (IHS), a $3.90 gain. The aerospace defense contractor had nicely higher first quarter earnings, $0.32 versus $0.24 last year and revenues up 18 percent.</p><p>Clarcor (CLC) which is a big filtration company off $2.87. Third quarter earnings $0.32, a penny above last year, but $0.04 below the Street estimate. Sales actually fell 1.7 percent.</p><p>Google (GOOG) topped the active list on NASDAQ gaining $5.49.</p><p>Apple (AAPL) a $0.09 rise.</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) down $0.25.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) a $0.42 loss.</p><p>Intel (INTC) dropped $0.18 a share, fifth in dollar volume.</p><p>Research in Motion (RIMM) up $1.64.</p><p>Then Oracle (ORCL) a $0.32 gain there.</p><p>Palm (PALM) closed down $1.71. Speculation appears to be cooling that it might be the target of a takeover attempt. After the close, Palm reported third quarter earnings excluding items, $0.16 a share, $0.04 above the Street estimate. In after hours trading, the stock was about $0.20 higher than this.</p><p>Broadcom (BRCM) down $1.29, hurt by Motorola`s earnings warning.</p><p>And then Qualcomm (QCOM) tenth in volume was off $0.38 a share.</p><p>Intuit (INTU) down $2.46. The company says its Turbotax software sales are off to a slow start this tax season so far.</p><p>Those are the stocks in the news tonight. Suzanne.</p><p>PRATT: The SEC and the American Stock Exchange today settled their differences over problems with the exchange`s oversight of options trading. Regulators allege, from 1999 through June 2004, the Amex didn`t adequately enforce certain order-handling rules and comply with record-keeping guidelines. The settlement creates a $3 million fund to help pay for stepped up exchange surveillance. Still in the works, though, EC action against the Amex`s former Chairman Salvatore Sodano.</p><p>KANGAS: Tomorrow, our Friday \"market monitor\" guest is Jeffrey Everett, chief investment officer at Templeton Global Advisors.</p><p>PRATT: A Federal judge in Mississippi has turned down a request to allow a class-action suit against State Farm insurance for denial of damage claims from hurricane Katrina. At issue so-called slab cases where houses were destroyed down to the slab. The judge said while all the homes were ruined, there are other factors that make the cases unsuitable for class action.</p><p>KANGAS: Coca-Cola is rolling out a new version of its diet Coke drink, adding vitamins and minerals to the mix. The new diet Coke plus will contain small mounts of vitamins B-3, B-6 and B-12, as well as magnesium and zinc. But the recipe for the soda itself will be unchanged. Coke says the new soft drink should hit U.S. store shelves next month.</p><p>PRATT: Here`s a look at what`s happening tomorrow. February existing home sales come out, along with earnings from Freddie Mac.</p><p>Tonight`s commentator has a few thoughts on what the Blackstone Group`s $4 billion IPO could mean to Wall Street. Here`s Chrystia Freeland, U.S. managing editor of \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, US MANAGING EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES: The irony of the move is irresistible. After all, the private equity business is based on the idea that a lot of companies can be run more effectively if they are liberated from the short-term targets and regulatory red tape that bedevils the public market. But there are some powerful reasons for Blackstone to be tempted to go public. The greatest may be the simplest. Blackstone`s founders are surely keen in Wall Street`s uncharacteristically coy terminology to crystallize the value of their partnership.</p><p>In plainer language, that means they want to take their billions before they retire. In contrast with those pitied Goldman Sachs senior partners who left the legendary firm before its IPO and missed out on the windfall their younger colleagues collected. For those of us not in line to receive Blackstone`s billions, the greatest significance of an IPO would be to make the private equity revolution more sustainable. Private equity has become so powerful it is easy to forget that the dominant groups are just a few decades old, are still run by the men who founded them and are dependent on Internet and fund-raising (INAUDIBLE) for most of their capital. Going public would give them access to permanent money and thus make them a more permanent fixture in world business. And that is the real irony of the story. Public capital could well give private equity groups a more enduring power to take companies private. I`m Chrystia Freeland.</p><p>KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, a split decision on Wall Street. The Dow gained 13 points while the NASDAQ Composite lost four points.

And what does it take to make tax time less taxing? Scott Gurvey has those answers and more in tonight`s \"tech talk.\"</p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tonight`s big tech news is a partnership of two very unlikely bedfellows: NBC Universal and Newscorp, parent of the Fox network. Who could get these guys together? Try youtube, the popular video-sharing web site now owned by Google. Youtube members make and post videos, often using original material, but just as often using content recorded from TV and cable, raising copyright concerns. A competing site run by NBC and Newscorp would have lots of content it could legally distribute. Yahoo!, MSN, AOL and Newscorp`s myspace will be involved. Stay tuned.</p><p>All of these sites make money by selling ads. The more popular the site, the more it can sell, and it adds up! Cisco Systems, Intel and General Motors have already signed up to advertise on the new NBC-Newscorp site. There are big bucks involved. Google paid $1.6 billion to buy youtube and recently, Viacom sued youtube for $1 billion, charging it with copyright infringement. Youtube has yet to file a response. The digital millennium copyright act of 1998 was supposed to clarify copyright law in the Internet age. It appears there is more work to be done.</p><p>It is tax time and the IRS says more than 130 million returns will be filed this year. Thirty five million will be made with tax preparation software. I`ve tried the leading products and, while they all do a good job, once again I`ve found Intuit`s Turbotax to be the most comprehensive and easiest to use. It does tend to cost $10 to $15 more than H&amp;R Block`s tax cut. This year, Intuit added a home and business version, perfect if you file a Schedule C or need to generate W-2s for business or household employees. The tax software companies report their fastest growth is among taxpayers who enter all their data online, a process Intuit`s Bob Meighan says is simple and safe.</p><p>BOB MEIGHAN, VICE PRESIDENT, INTUIT: People don`t have to go to the store and buy the software. They don`t have to install it. They don`t have to worry about updates. I can go to the web and access tax software to do my return, so it`s convenient. All the products I know about use secure connections. If you`re transmitting your return to the IRS, it`s via secure connection, so the data is secure. All the companies that I know about guard your information very, very well, because we want to protect your privacy.</p><p>GURVEY: Even with the tax software, I haven`t sent in my return yet. How about you? Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>PRATT: That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, March 22. I`m Suzanne Pratt. Good night everyone and good night to you, Paul.</p><p>KANGAS: Good night, Suzanne. I`m Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the best of good buys.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast. The program is transcribed by Voxant, Inc.

I`m Tom Hudson. Susie is off tonight. A rescue for Knight Capital today. The trading firm stays in business thanks to a $400 million investment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Erika Miller reports tonight on a takeover offer for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). The founder of the struggling electronics retail chain wants to take it private.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the Mars rover has landed on the red planet. We`ll see what U.S. companies hope to gain by signing on to the mission. That and more coming up tonight here on NBR.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We begin with this, a $400 million lifeline today for Knight Capital. It`s a company that makes some of the plumbing of the U.S. stock market. The market maker has been fighting to survive since a trading software update went hay-wire last week, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, its stock price cut by two-thirds and now a rescue by some of its competitors.</p><p>The deal by a half dozen Wall Street firms to invest in Knight allowed the company to, quote, resume normal operations immediately, end quote, according to Knight. Those behind the $400 million deal are investment banking firms Jefferies, Stephens and Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF), private equity giant Blackstone, trading competitor Getco and customer TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD). Ameritrade was one of Knight`s big customers that stopped doing business with it after Wednesday`s trading trouble. Ameritrade has since returned as have other big customers.</p><p>As for its investment in Knight, an Ameritrade spokesperson tells NBR, quote, we have an interest in preserving choice and competition in the markets, end quote. Knight Capital matches buyers and sellers of thousands of stocks and billions of shares. It also buys and sells stocks itself, helping keep money flowing. So when it`s new trading software had a problem, the firm was stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in losing trades. That sent shareholders fleeing, driving down its stock price, leading Knight to look for help. But the assistance comes at the expense of diluting current shareholders` interest. That pressured Knight stock today, down 24 percent. Knight`s rescuers get preferred stock that may be converted to common stock at $1.50 per share plus a 2 percent dividend. The deal represents a 73 percent stake in the company. The investor group also gets three new seats on the board of directors.</p><p>HUDSON: All this week at NBR, we`re looking at you, the everyday investor and what problems like the one at Knight Capital are doing to investor confidence. You may remember the last time a computer system sent the stock prices spiraling. It happened back in May 2010 and was called the flash crash. It led to new rules on when firms get a do-over after a computer error. Knight asked for just such a do-over, pleading with the Securities and Exchange Commission to be released from mistaken trades. The answer back, no. Darren Gersh tonight reports on the firm line from Washington.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This is really a story about a bailout that didn`t happen. Knight Capital Group (NYSE:KCG) asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for special help. Stock exchange rules set strict limits on when trades can be reversed. In Knight`s case, the rules say trades made by mistake that are more than 30 percent off of the real market price can be undone. Knight wanted more trades busted, but regulators said no. The message was clear.</p><p>JAMES ANGEL, FINANCE PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Once you make a trade, unless something has gone incredibly wrong, your word is your bond. You make a trade, you are expected to live up to it.</p><p>GERSH: People familiar with the matter say regulators are sending a clear message to investors: the rules on erroneous trades are meant to provide markets with certainty and they worked in this case. Another message: firms need to have incentives to be careful and what happened to Knight is a big incentive.</p><p>ANGEL: Right now I think that every IT manager is going to his boss and saying, give me a bigger budget so I make sure this isn`t going to happen here.</p><p>GERSH: But that does not reassure critics who fear Wall Street firms have created computer systems they can`t control.</p><p>DENNIS KELLEHER, CEO, BETTER MARKETS: It is not a glitch when in less than 30 minutes over 150 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange vary wildly in purchases and sales and prices and there`s essentially haywire in the markets. That`s not a glitch. That`s a huge problem. It`s a red flag and people better start paying attention.</p><p>GERSH: While the SEC took a tough line with Knight Capital, there are growing concerns about the ability of regulators to police the Street.</p><p>KELLEHER: Regulators and regulation generally can`t keep up with what`s going on in the markets. It`s just that simple. Now one of the main reasons for that is that there is a fairly massive effort led by Wall Street and its allies to de-fund the agencies so they can prevent them from putting financial reform into place.</p><p>GERSH: Before the computer mistake, Knight Capital handled 20 percent of the trading in stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was well-respected and innovative and all that blew up in less than half an hour. Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: (INAUDIBLE) Just the latest reminder of how technology continues to reshape the investment market. As part of our coverage this week, join the discussion online on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter, bizrpt. How confident are you in the technology that powers the market? Will it change how you trade and invest because of the technology? Join us online.</p><p>On Wall Street today meantime, investors helped the major averages to finish a fresh three-month highs tonight, despite some selling in Knight Capital shares as we mentioned. The Dow Industrials rising 21 points, the NASDAQ up 22, the S&amp;P 500 gained three points. One other quick note here about policing the markets. A major British bank was accused today of hiding over 60,000 illegal transactions with Iran over the past decade. Those transactions made by Standard Charter PLC were valued at over $250 billion. New York State`s department of financial services threatened to revoke the bank`s U.S. license today and called it a quote, rogue institution. Standard Charter meantime said it`s reviewing its compliance with U.S. banking sanctions.</p><p>A billion dollar plus bet could be paying off much sooner than Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) had hoped. One week into the media company`s NBC Olympics coverage and it may actually turn a profit. NBC has been hit by the usual number of criticisms, too much focus on the Americans, not enough live coverage, hasn`t hurt the television audience numbers here in the U.S. though. Through the first 10 days of coverage - look at this - Comcast`s Olympic ratings averaged 33.6 million viewers. That`s up 12 percent from Beijing, 28 percent higher than the Athens games in 2004.</p><p>Porter Bibb is back with us, managing partner at Mediatech Capital Partners at the NASDAQ. Porter, is it something that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is doing with its coverage of the games or is it the games themselves?</p><p>PORTER BIBB, MANAGING PARTNER, MEDIATECH CAPITAL PARTNERS: I think it`s mostly the games themselves and it`s the fact that there`s not a lot else going on right now in the dog days of the summer of 2012. Basically it`s the fact that this Olympics has drawn a tremendous amount of attention from the public and it`s reflected in these numbers which are historic. They`ve never ever had such great ratings any television broadcast since 1960 when CBS (NYSE:CBS) first broadcast the Rome Olympics.</p><p>HUDSON: Talk to us about the opportunities here then. This opportunity comes at a significant cost, more than a billion dollars invested. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) sold a billion dollars worth of advertising. Can it go back to its advertisers and ask for more money now that the ratings are in?</p><p>BIBB: They did get a little bit of a premium when they exceed the ratings, yes. But the biggest advertiser, interestingly enough on this Olympic tenure is NBC. Every third or fourth commercial is promoting an NBC series that`s going to be breaking this fall and they`re hoping to shore up their ratings throughout the year because NBC has been wallowing in the cellar behind all of the other major networks for the last seven years.</p><p>HUDSON: I want to talk about the investor in the Olympics here before we get to the broader NBC picture. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) has estimated a $200 million profit. It spent about $1.2 billion for the rights it has to pay to produce the programs. Is this a good return on investment for shareholders?</p><p>BIBB: It`s never been a good return in terms of bottom line, but it`s considered by the TV executives in the suites to be the best promotion for their networks that money can buy. It rivals the Super Bowl and the way the Oscars used to command this kind of an audience but don`t anymore.</p><p>HUDSON: Certainly, shareholders are being attracted to this stock, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) shares at a 52-week high even with this billion dollar plus investment.</p><p>BIBB: You have to realize that NBC television is a very small part of the Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) empire. They`re the largest cable systems operators in the country, in the world in fact and they`re also the largest Internet service providers. They reap huge profits from NBC Universal (NYSE:UVV) cable channels, not just television networks.</p><p>HUDSON: Is that the way you leverage then the next Olympic games? Is that the lesson here?</p><p>BIBB: They have bought this Olympics and the summer and winter Olympics in 2020 and they expect that they will have to change the model because the next Rio in 2016 is going to be an online digital Internet, not like this one. These decisions that NBC made were two and a half years ago when they acquired the rights and they didn`t anticipate the iPad and the profusion of smart phones that are out there. And their Internet delivery is really patchy. It`s not very good, but it will be by the time they get to Rio for sure.</p><p>HUDSON: That`s going to be the big change for the next summer games in four years. Do you have any position in Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) by the way, Porter?</p><p>BIBB: None.</p><p>HUDSON: Porter Bibb along with us here watching the Olympics and commenting on the coverage, Mediatech Capital Partners.</p><p>Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) founder and former chairman wants his stores back. Richard Schulze has offered to take the struggling electronics retail chain private. The offer is $24 to $26 per share. Now the higher price, it values the company at just over $8.8 billion. Erika Miller tonight in Manhattan joining us with what could be one of the biggest buyouts in recent years of an American retailer.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: That`s right. Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) founder has made a generous offer for the stores but he still faces an uphill battle getting the board to approve it. In a public letter addressed to Best Buy`s board, Richard Schulze says quote, bold and extensive changes are needed for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) to return to market leadership. He is proposing to buy out the company, using his own money, private equity funds and some debt. So would going public (sic) be the right strategy for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY)?</p><p>RJ HOTTOVY, SR. RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: It may make sense for Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) to be a privately held company, especially if you have the backing of a private equity company with retail and turnaround experience. Frankly, this company has got a lot of work ahead of them to stay competitive and stay relevant in the eyes of consumers.</p><p>MILLER: It`s a moment of truth for the retail electronics chain Schulze founded in 1966. Part of Best Buy`s problem is so-called showrooming. That`s when customers browse the store, but actually place their orders elsewhere, often at online sites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). An even bigger issue is the enormous size of most stores, a relic of a bygone era.</p><p>HOTTOVY: In the early part of the 90`s through the early part of the 2000s, really consumers had no problem. They were shopping in stores for TVs, video games, CDs were all a big part of their consumer electronics budget. But as that shifted to a digital distribution format over the last several years, it has left a gaping hole in Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) stores.</p><p>MILLER: Schulze will clearly face big challenges turning the offer into a deal. First, he needs to get the approval of all Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) board members before signing a deal with private equity partners. He will likely have trouble getting the support of interim CEO Mike Mikan, who is gunning for a permanent position at the helm. Second, Schulze will have to detail his turnaround plans, which are vague at this point. The third issue is money. The board will likely try to get a higher offer, if it supports a deal at all and that could make it harder for Schulze to secure financing. And don`t forget Schulze was elbowed out as chairman in the spring, after an internal audit found he knew former CEO Brian Dunn was having an inappropriate relationship with a female employee. That alone is unlikely to be a deal breaker. But it may mean some board member resistance to putting him back in charge.</p><p>HUDSON: Erika is in New York tonight as we mentioned. So, why does Schulze make this offer in public? Why not negotiate privately with the board?</p><p>MILLER: In his letter, Schulze said he would have preferred to have private negotiations, but the board was dragging its feet, so he felt he had no choice but to take his campaign public and hope that Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) shareholders would support him.</p><p>HUDSON: It certainly caused a bit of a ruckus in the stock as we`ll mention in a moment. But what happens now? What`s the next step? What can we expect to hear, when can we hear from the board?</p><p>MILLER: It`s unclear at this point. All that we know is that Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) will confirm its made the offer, but don`t know when it will respond.</p><p>HUDSON: We are coming into a key time for retailers like Best Buys, holidays right around the corner, turnarounds are easier said than done this time of year. What does is need to do to discourage the showrooming, the shopping and actually and turn the shopping into buying?</p><p>MILLER: Best Buy`s biggest problem is its format, 50,000 square feet on average of retail space just doesn`t make sense any more. It needs to go to a smaller format store. That`s its biggest challenge. But it also needs to emphasize its most profitable product lines. We`re talking about things like mobile phones.</p><p>HUDSON: Erika Miller tonight in New York on Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). Thanks, Erika. From electronic retailing to auto sales, July was a disappointing month of sales for General Motors (NYSE:GM) at home. Not so in China though. The U.S. auto maker set a sales record there last month. But the road ahead in China could be dicey for GM and other auto companies. Diane Eastabrook has details.</p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: GM bucked fears of a slowing economy in China last month by selling 15 percent more vehicles there than it did during the same month last year. Among the biggest sellers for GM were Buick Excel models. While auto sales in China have been strong compared to last year, they`ve actually been declining month over month this year, a possible sign of a cooling Chinese economy. June sales slid nearly 2.5 percent from May and sales were also down the two months before that. Still U.S. auto manufacturers are betting big on China. GM is the market leader, selling more than 2.5 million vehicles there last year primarily through joint ventures. Ford is increasing its exposure there as well, planning to add six new plants in China that will produce more than a million vehicles by 2015. Diane Eastabrook, NBR, Chicago.</p><p>HUDSON: In our \"Market Focus,\" Some modest gains driving the U.S. major stock indices up to three-month highs tonight. We begin with the intraday S&amp;P 500 starting out with the index jumping on the heels of some decent gains we saw overnight in European and Asian markets. No headline economic data today as the buying cooled somewhat into the closing bell. The index finished up a fraction. But it was enough for it to continue the trend since June of higher highs and higher lows. This is the S&amp;P 500`s highest close since May 2nd. Trading volume meantime backing off from Friday`s pace, 645 million shares on the big board, just over one and a half billion on the NASDAQ.</p><p>It was a mixed market, six of the 10 major stock sectors were higher. Material stocks leading the gainers, up 1.1 percent. Technology added 0.7 of a percent and it was steel stocks behind today`s gain in the materials sector. Many of these manufacturers have struggled under weaker building demand and lower pricing. But we have seen some buying lately after a string of better than expected earnings and some of the stocks also hitting recent lows.</p><p>U.S. Steel up today 5.6 percent, Titanium Metals (NYSE:TIE) rallying 4.5 percent. Both of these tonight are at their highest prices since mid- May. Cliff`s Natural Resources added 2.7 percent. Today was the first Monday since May that the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a gain. Two of the top 3 percentage gainers in fact for the Dow in the tech industry. HPQ, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) up 2.4 percent. This buying comes after HP sank to a seven and a half year low late last week. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) the other big tech stock on the Dow that`s been under pressure and shares gained 2.1 percent, although volume was lighter than usual during today`s buying of CSCO.</p><p>The biggest meat processor in the U.S., Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), may have to turn to Brazil for corn. The company put that option on the table today thanks to the continued drought throughout the Midwestern U.S. It comes after Tyson reported weaker than expected earnings, coming in $0.04 below estimates. Its beef business saw lower demand thanks to the controversy over a ground beef additive called pink slime by critics. Falling pork prices hurt that business in Tyson as well. The company went on to lower its revenue outlook for the year. That hit shares, falling eight percent. Volume was more than three times normal for TSN. This in fact tonight is a new 52-week low for Tyson.</p><p>Shares of semi-truck maker Navistar hit the gas, after Federal regulators, environmental regulators submitted a final rule allowing, that may allow the company to continue to pay fines and still sell engines that do not meet EPA guidelines. The stock has been under pressure as it has been threatened with losing the ability to sell these new engines that don`t meet current emissions standards. The details of today`s final ruling were not disclosed. Shares jumped 10 percent though. An interim rule allowed Navistart to continue with its sales if it paid a fine.</p><p>All five of the most actively traded ETF`s seeing some modest gains. The biggest for the Russell 2000 and NASDAQ 100 track funds. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>The virtual world of the Internet has changed businesses from newspapers to retailing. But the real world of video games continues to favor established names and not new-comers. That is tonight`s \"Word on the Street\" -- gaming. Debra Borchardt, markets analyst at thestreet.com with us at the NASDAQ. Deborah, first of all explain the business model differences between the new digital gaming versus more traditional video games?</p><p>DEBRA BORCHARDT, MARKETS ANALYST, THESTREET.COM: Well, a lot of the digital gamers, the way that they earn money is putting advertising within the games or trying to get you to pay for different additional items like points and that type of model. But they`re finding that people really just want to play their games on their phones for free. They`re called snacking games. You just play them for a little bit of a time when you`re standing in line, you`re waiting in a restaurant, something like that. So you really don`t want to pay any additional money, whereas your traditional game company like an Activision or an EA, they make their money off one upfront buying the game which is pretty expensive. But they`ve now determined ways to upsell you so that you can go and charge more for additional accessories to the game.</p><p>HUDSON: You can have a multitude of revenue sources in the language of an MBA student here. So the new generation is perhaps best illustrated by Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), ZNGA, big business through facebook, and this stock has just been a disaster since its IPO, new lows last week here. Farmville is not working out for it. Is the new model broken?</p><p>BORCHARDT: Well it really is for Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) because they`ve got all their playing time on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has started to push the old titles down in prominence and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) hasn`t got a new title to get in new revenue. So as Farmville loses its attraction, it has to come up with a new name to attract new players. So it`s getting hurt with this relationship with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and also by not having a new hit name.</p><p>HUDSON: But it`s not alone in that. Even traditional video game companies like Activision also are looked at as what`s new, what`s next? Activision for instance had a pretty decent quarter earnings-wise, a third of its sales coming through its digital channel to cut out the retail space, nice bigger margins there. But yet the stock sold off significantly last week and rebounded a bit today.</p><p>BORCHARDT: Right. They were beat up because they said that their second quarter net income fell. Some user were - some investors were concerned that the users for \"World of Warcraft\" had dropped. But here`s the thing. They have new titles coming up this fall. They`re going to making it to the holidays and this is what`s interesting. Here you`ve got Farmville with Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and you can`t really update it. They haven`t really figured out how to built a franchise. The established companies were beat up for having franchises, but that`s then the big payoff. \"Call of Duty,\" \"Black Ops\" is coming out, (INAUDIBLE) Giant.\" These titles just keep paying off. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) has \"Madden.\"</p><p>HUDSON: Debra, do you own any positions in these stocks?</p><p>BORCHARDT: No, I don`t.</p><p>HUDSON: But we`re going to guess you`re a gamer nonetheless. Debra Borchardt along with us. She`s with the street.com.</p><p>Congress has fled Washington, DC for a five-week summer recess, despite little progress on a host of bills covering everything from extending the Bush-era tax cuts to interim drought relief and Internet security. Tonight`s commentary says don`t blame the G-word for all that interaction or rather inaction. She`s Veronique de Rugy, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.</p><p>VERONIQUE DE RUGY, SR. RSCH. FELLOW, MERCATUS CENTER, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY: What`s really the problem in Washington? Well, if you ask Washington, they`ll tell you it`s gridlock and blame inaction on some new and hyper-partisan or ideological era. But while gridlock might be blamed for slowing things down, it can`t be blamed for failing to address serious issues. Welfare reform and balanced budgets in the 1990s were the product of gridlock that slowly gave way to consensus. And today`s Washington is more than happy to come together when it suits its own interests.</p><p>For instance, just last week, Congress managed bipartisan support for another continuing resolution, an agreement that allows the legislators to, once again, put off doing any real fiscal planning. In fact, Congress hasn`t managed to produce a Federal budget in more than three years. Washington`s problem is not gridlock. It is an increasingly irresponsible government that has for far too long been let off the hook for performing the most basic responsibilities. So, whatever happens in November, this much is certain: unless taxpayers demand their president and Congress act responsibly and do the work they were elected to do, so-called Washington gridlock will be the least of our problems. I`m Veronique de Rugy.</p><p>HUDSON: You can find some progress in outer space. NASA`s rover \"Curiosity\" tonight on the surface of the red planet. \"Curiosity\" pierced Mars` atmosphere traveling at 13,000 miles per hour, safely touched down after slowing to a mere two miles per hour. It began transmitting photos right away. Ruben Ramirez tonight reports on the partnership between government and business that made \"Curiosity\" possible.</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The big question of course, is there, or, has there ever been life on Mars? Well, this week starts a two-year, $2.5 billion mission on the red planet to try and find the answer. Nearly three years behind schedule and almost a billion dollars over budget, NASA`s \"Curiosity\" rover landed safely on Mars. It`s the largest and most advanced spacecraft ever sent to outer space. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Siemens were just some of the companies that participated in the project. Siemens licensed its 3D modeling technology to NASA`s jet propulsion lab to help cut prototype costs.</p><p>TONY AFFUSO, CHAIRMAN, SIEMENS PLM SOFTWARE: These techniques between public and private and the way that they can share costs, share risks and collaborate around technology is a great way to bring all the resources to bear.</p><p>RAMIREZ: According to NASA, the public private partnership created about 7,000 jobs at various times during the eight years it took to develop the rover. And, unlike in past decades of space exploration, in true social media fashion, you can follow the rover on Twitter at Marscuriosity. Ruben Ramirez, NBR, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: The red planet to Wall Street and Main Street. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday, August 6. Thanks for joining us.

It`s a hot topic on Capitol Hill, but this man says there`s  nothing political about needing a job. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  BILL BOTELER: You`re going to have a lot of people out there who  aren`t going to have jobs.  They are not going to have anywhere to turn. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:   From compassion to the  cost, we look at the pros and cons of extending jobless benefits for  millions of Americans.  You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  July 19. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB:  Good evening everyone, a plea today from President Obama for  Congress to pass the unemployment bill.  The president urged lawmakers,  Tom, to put aside politics and to approve an extension of benefits to  millions of Americans out of work. </p><p>  HUDSON:   Susie, this unemployment insurance bill is expected back on  the Senate floor tomorrow.  Republicans say they`ll only support an  extension if the bill does not add to the national debt. </p><p>  GHARIB: Still the president said lawmakers need to help Americans who  have been laid off during this recession. </p><p>  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:   We`ve got a  responsibility to help them make ends meet and support their families, even  as they`re looking for another job.  That`s why it`s so essential to pass  the unemployment insurance extension that comes up for a vote tomorrow. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Millions of Americans will be watching that vote tomorrow to  find out what`s ahead for their weekly unemployment insurance check and one  of them will be Bill Boteler. We first introduced you to Bill almost a year  ago when he had already been unemployed for several months.  Today he still  is looking for work.  Now as we revisit him, Bill tells us how he`s keeping  his spirits up and planning for an uncertain future.  Darren Gersh reports. </p><p>   BILL BOTELER: It`s the top one. Open it up. They gave me $290. </p><p>  DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   For almost two  years Bill Boteler has relied on a weekly unemployment insurance check.   Not to make ends meet but to get them a little closer. </p><p>  BOTELER:  This to me is like a cushion.  To try to live off this is  challenging. </p><p>  GERSH: When we first met Boteler almost a year ago, he hadn`t had a  permanent job for 10 months.  Since then he`s tried to keep his credit up  which he says is important when you`re searching for work.  He`s now  looking for a cheaper apartment and Boteler says his weekly benefit check  helps him focus on finding a job. </p><p>  BOTELER: If you put the two together-- that you don`t have enough  money to pay for anything and you are having to face a lot of rejection and  a lot of disappointment in trying to find a job -- then I think that`s a  little bit too much of a burden to put on people. </p><p>  GERSH:  In the last year, Boteler figures he`s applied for hundreds of  jobs.  He even set a daily production quota. His day begins with a trip to  the new office of the great recession --  </p><p>  BOTELER:  Hi, my name is Bill Boteler.  I have experience as a writer  and an editor. </p><p>  GERSH:  . the local cafe. </p><p>  BOTELER:  I mean, I`m here. I`m doing this. I`m dressed up. I have a  goal.  I`m not sitting in my room thinking about whether I should do the  dishes or whether I should look for a job or something like that.  I`m not  aimless. </p><p>  GERSH:  Boteler has taken temp jobs including a stint as a census  worker.  Now he`s focused on the quality of his networking, not the  quantity of resumes he sends out. </p><p>  BOTELER:  It`s unbelievable how much time it takes for people to find  jobs.  People who have not had to do that, who have been fortunate who have  let`s say a job that`s been secure for many years, will be shocked when  they discover just how difficult it is. </p><p>  GERSH:  We`ve talked to many people who are looking for work and they  say there`s an unstated bias against the unemployed.  Bill Boteler worries  about that too.  He wants people to know he`s a hard worker and he can`t  understand why Congress is having such a tough time extending benefits. </p><p>  BOTELER:  If they cut the budget back, then you`re going to have a lot  of people out there who aren`t going to have jobs.  They`re not going to  have anywhere to turn.  And it`s... it will have an economic impact on  people who consider themselves more fortunate. </p><p>  GERSH:  He has just nine weeks of unemployment insurance left.  But  the last few days, he says, have been good ones. </p><p>  BOTELER:  I`m not feeling really down right now because I`ve been  doing a lot.  I think something will pan out this time. </p><p>  GERSH:  Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. </p><p>  HUDSON:  We`ll have more on the debate over extending jobless benefits  a little bit later on in this program.  But first let`s get you updated in  the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. Stocks shook off some new worries  about the housing sector at the closing bell, the Dow rising 56 points, the  NASDAQ adding 19, the S&amp;P 500 up six.  NYSE exchange volume fell below a  billion down from Friday`s pace.  NASDAQ fell below two billion also down  from Friday.  Stocks moved higher despite home builders singing the blues.  This month the National Association of Home Builders confidence index fell  to its lowest level in 15 months on a slump in economic growth and  persistent high unemployment.  </p><p>       BP can keep testing the cap fitted over its broken well head. Now the  tests have shown a methane gas leak on the sea floor near the well is not  related  Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen has OKd BP to continue  testing for another 24 hours.  Meanwhile costs tied to the spill are  nearing $4 billion, including over $200 million to settle individual  claims.  And Ken Feinberg, the man overseeing BP`s huge compensation fund,  says fishermen and others with claims would be, in his words, crazy to  bypass the fund and sue.  Feinberg says he`ll be more generous than any  court and claimants won`t face court delays. </p><p>  GHARIB:  And coming up on the program, stocks too volatile?  Treasury  yields got you down? How about lending money to your favorite company  instead?  We look at why corporate debt offerings are jumping. </p><p>  HUDSON:  More now on the debate over extending unemployment benefits.   If Congress OKs this this week, it would be the sixth time since the  recession began that unemployment payments have been extended.  Over the  past two years, looking at everyone without a job, the percent of people  who have been jobless for six months or more has jumped from under 20  percent to almost half.  Jeff Miron is a senior fellow at the Cato  Institute.  Christian Weller is a senior fellow at the Center for American  Progress. Gentlemen, welcome to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. </p><p>  JEFF MIRON, SENIOR FELLOW, CATO INSTITUTE: Thank you very much for  having me.</p><p>  CHRISTIAN WELLER, SR. FELLOW, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: Nice to be  here. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Let`s begin with what the Department of Labor says about the  purpose of these unemployment checks. The benefits, quote, are intended to  provide temporary financial assistance to unemployed workers.  Jeff, let`s  begin with you. Should there be a limit to unemployment benefits? </p><p>  MIRON:  I think there should be a limit. We need to have a balance  between compassion which is the temporary word in the Department of Labor`s  language suggests and productivity in giving people an incentive to go out  and find jobs and particular to be willing to lower their wage demands, to  accept jobs that are not exactly what they had before. They`re not  necessarily as good as they had before. But have to take some  responsibility themselves for the fact that economic conditions are worse  and therefore take a broader set of jobs and have some limit to how long  people can collect unemployment insurance. </p><p>  HUDSON:  That presumes there are jobs out there and that job demand is  not being fulfilled.  Christian, how about you?  How do you define  temporary in that definition from the Department of Labor? </p><p>  WELLER:  We need to have a new definition of temporary.  We have to be  mindful of the fact that this is the worst recession since the great  depression.  We have over 14 million people looking for jobs who cannot  find jobs.  We have about five people looking for each opening.  We have  millions of people who have given up looking for a job.  And as you already  mentioned, those who are looking are looking longer than at any point since  World War II.  Still clearly temporary now means something else given the  severity of the labor market recession.  And I think extending unemployment  benefits is compassionate, but it also makes economic sense. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Talk to us Christian, talk to us just about that idea. We saw  earlier in Darren`s piece from Bill Boteler, $290 a week. That doesn`t go  very far.  What do we know about the economic impact of these checks? </p><p>  WELLER:  We know that these checks make a real difference obviously in  peoples` lives,  those who are hurt the most by the current crisis.  But in  the aggregate, we`re talking about $30 billion.  The money will be spent  very quickly because these are people who have been struggling for quite  some time. You`re extending the unemployment benefits. The money won`t be  saved.  It will go very quickly to consumption. It will boost retail sales  which is the big worry of businesses at this point that they may fall off.   Forty percent of businesses worry about sales not being high enough. That`s  the biggest worry for them. So it will help the private sector and will  protect the private sector momentum that we`ve seen that since the end of  2009.  It`s strengthened the recovery to help us continue building jobs in  the private sector. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Jeff, how about that?  In order to stimulate job growth, you  need folks spending money.  At least this gets people to have some dollars  in their pocket to spend. </p><p>  MIRON:  I think it`s a very unpersuasive position.  First of all, the  check that we`re sending the unemployed came from somewhere. They came from  the taxes of other people who are for the most part employed.  So if  transferring money to these people who are unemployed helps stimulate the  economy, then taking it away from the people who are paying the taxes to  pay for it de-stimulates the economy.  Overall it`s hard the see how that  is on net a beneficial thing.  More broadly, the fact that we`re  consistently trying to promote sort of redistribution in helping people  rather than trying to create rules and a system which is productive gives  the private sector pause.  It makes the private sector think we`re not  getting the deficit and the debt under control. It makes them think we`re  not worry about productivity. That`s in the long term much worse for people  having jobs and being employed than the temporary aspect related to the  recession. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Jeff, it`s estimated that since the extended unemployment  benefits expired back in early June, about $3 billion has not been spent.   Over that same month interest on the U.S. debt in June was $107 billion.   We seem to be, you know, talking about spending pennies or saving pennies  when we`re spending dollars. </p><p>  MIRON:  I totally agree.  It`s a very small amount of money. The fact  that it`s a very small amount of money also means that any possible effect  in stimulating the economy is also very trivial because we`re talking about  a very small amount of money. The broader thing is it creates the wrong  incentive.  There`s clear evidence that people who are unemployed tend to  leave unemployment just before their unemployment benefits run out. It`s  not just a question -- it`s not the right way to think about it -- are  there jobs?  The right way is are there jobs at what wages?  If people  lower their wage demands, if they offer to take say their old job for 50  percent of what they were getting, there would be a lot more jobs out  there. That`s the adjustment that needs to happen in many cases.  But  unemployment insurance and especially very, very long-term unemployment  insurance impedes that kind of adjustment. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Guys less than a minute left. Christian, I want to address  that job demand issue. </p><p>  WELLER: That`s just simply robbing Peter to pay Paul. If we lower our  wages to create more jobs, ultimately the overall consumption won`t change  and sales won`t change. The important point is that unemployment benefits  are incredibly targeted, very good. Benefits for the economy, every dollar  spent on unemployment increases economic activity, $1.6 (ph). So it makes  economic sense. It helps the most vulnerable and ultimately boosts economic  growth.  I think this is the time is right at this point to extend the  unemployment benefit. </p><p>       HUDSON: It will be in front of the Senate tomorrow, Christian. Does  it get approved? </p><p>  WELLER: It will get approved but probably with a very slim margin. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Jeff, how about it? </p><p>  MIRON:  Unfortunately I think it will get approved too. </p><p>  HUDSON: Our guests this evening on extending unemployment benefits,  Christian Weller, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. We`ve  also got Jeff Miron.  He is with the Cato Institute. </p><p>  WELLER: Thank you very much. </p><p>  GHARIB:  And moving along now to financial regulatory reform. On  Wednesday President Obama will sign the biggest overhaul of financial rules  since the great depression. The head of the Securities and Exchange  Commission says she`ll need helps enforcing those rules -- a lot of help.  Mary Shapiro says her agency will need 800 new workers for what she calls a  logistical and labor intensive challenge.  Her comments came in prepared  testimony that`s expected before a House committee tomorrow. The Dodd Frank  Reform Act gives sweeping new powers to the SEC, including supervising  hedge funds and the huge derivatives market. </p><p>  GHARIB: A big step forward in the break-up of Motorola.  It is selling  most of its wireless network equipment business to Nokia Siemens.  The  price tag $1.2 billion. The all-cash sale boosts the standing of Nokia  Siemens joint venture in the U.S. and Japan. Those companies say it brings  layoffs.  As for Motorola, by the first quarter of next year, it will have  two business units, one selling equipment for the business market and  another making mobile phones and other consumer products.  </p><p>       And speaking of technology, Tom, IBM came out with those earnings and  disappointing revenues after the bell.  Looks like that could set the tone  for the markets tomorrow. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Kind of a similar refrain we`re hearing from IBM which was a  pretty good bottom line but some concerns on the top line. We talked about  it late last week. It is back in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>  Before we get there throughout the day, investors bought both the  defensive-minded utility sector as well as the growth-focused technology  stocks. We`ll talk about big blue and tech in a moment.  Utility stocks as  measured by this exchange-traded fund XLU clearly was a pretty good winner  today, traded up throughout the day almost making up what they lost during  last Friday`s sell- off.  A move over $31 for this ETF would take this fund  up to a six-month high.  </p><p>       As we mentioned the focus after the close settled on a couple of big  tech giants including IBM (IBM).  Bottom line at big blue came in better  than expected, but the top line revenues were lighter than anticipated.  Also despite rising its full-year guidance, it still remains below Street  estimates.  Shares of IBM were up in advance of these earnings as you can  see but after the report the stock was down as much as 4 percent after  hours. </p><p>       Chip maker Texas Instruments (TXN) was the other tech reporting after  the close.  Profits here coming in right as expected, no surprises.   Operating profits did set a record. Gross margins also on the increase and  positive news there for shareholders. Now TXN stock jumped 3 percent during  the regular session.  But after hours the stock gave up that and then some,  falling by better than 6 percent.  Apple (AAPL) is the big tech firm  tomorrow with earnings as questions continue swirling about its iPhone-4.  For a moment today intra-day, Apple stock fell below $240 per share,  closing at $245 and change. That is the lowest price since mid May.  Research in Motion, Motorola and others arguing today that Apple`s claim  that all smart phones have reception problems is wrong. Apple`s earnings  tomorrow by the way will be the first full quarter to include iPad sales.  We`ll have a report tomorrow evening. </p><p>       Energy stocks got a boost with some strong results from services  company Halliburton (HAL).  We`ll get you updated here. Growth across all  of its markets helped Halliburton easily beat estimates. It`s the first  major oil services firm to report earnings for the quarter that includes  the BP disaster and the deep water drilling moratorium. Halliburton jumped  6 percent to a two-month high on the trade (ph). Schlumberger (SLB) will be  next up with earnings in the group on Friday. Baker Hughes (BHI) is due out  in two weeks. </p><p>       More seats in the air may be good news for air travelers, but it  could put pressure on airline profits. Delta (DAL) plans to increase  capacity at the tail end of this year and into next year. That announcement  came after earnings in the second quarter were much better than estimates.   But echoing what we`ve seen from several others, revenues were less than  anticipated.  Delta stock dropped on three times the usual volume. Also  caught up in the sell-off and concerns about more capacity leading to lower  ticket prices, U.S. Airways (LCC) and even budget carrier Southwest (LUV),  each falling on heavier volume. </p><p>       Now we did see some biotech buying today in Gilead Sciences (GILD).   It may be one to watch tomorrow.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" tonight reports  that a gel containing an HIV treatment made by Gilead cuts the chances of  getting AIDS if used by women before and after sex. This study was led by  South African researchers.  Shares bounced off a 52-week low which was hit  just on Friday. The drug is used to treat the AIDS virus, but this  experiment looked at using it to help prevent HIV.</p><p>       Catching you up on one of those biotechs working on an experimental  weight loss drug, Vivus (VVUS) continued falling adding to Friday`s losses  after an FDA advisory panel decided against recommending its treatment for  approval, selling 8 percent to the downside.  </p><p>       Finally merger talk, today that centered around H&amp;R Block (HRB).   Shareholders have had a tough go of it this year, since January the stock  down by a third hitting a new 52-week low on Friday.  Today though, shares  bouncing on word that another tax giant wants to talk.  John Hewitt (ph)  put together (ph) Jackson Hewitt and another Liberty Tax services. He`s  interested in H&amp;R Block. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>  GHARIB: With worries about the economy and the stock market heating  up, investors have been seeking the safety of bonds. For many that means  Treasuries despite the puny returns. But if you can stomach more risk as  some investment advisors believe corporate bonds are a better bet.  Erika  Miller looks at why you may want to consider jumping on the corporate bond  boat. </p><p>   ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  When sailing in  choppy waters, boaters have life vests for safety. When it comes to market  volatility, investors have their own form of protection: bonds.  So far  this year, investors have yanked nearly $11 trillion out of domestic stock  funds. They`ve poured more than 10 times that amount into U.S. bond funds.   The money is not just going into Treasury.  Top quality corporate bonds are  also benefiting from the flight to safety.  But credit strategist Brad  Rogoff believes high yield corporates, otherwise known as junk bonds, are a  much better option. </p><p>   BRADLEY ROGOFF, CO-HEAD, US CREDIT STRATEGY, BARCLAY`S CAPITAL:   High  yield bonds are paying on average, you know, 9 plus percent right now.  Fundamentals are still improving for a lot of these companies. We`re seeing  that come through as we get into earnings season right now. </p><p>  MILLER:  An easy way to get broad exposure to the corporate bond  sector is to buy an exchange-traded fund.  The Ishares high-yield corporate  bond index is currently yielding 9 percent. The investment grade version is  yielding 5 percent.  Both are paying out a lot more than 10-year Treasuries  which yield less than 3 percent.   One of the biggest risks to corporate  bonds is the possibility the Fed might start raising interest rates.  Even  if that happens, Rogoff thinks junk bonds will hold up fairly well. </p><p>   ROGOFF:   From a price standpoint, you will not see much of a move  with respect to high-yield bonds.  Obviously with a sizable coupon that  they have on them that makes for an attractive investment in the current  environment. Investment grade bonds will be much more sensitive to rates. </p><p>  MILLER:  Still financial planner Cliff Michaels believes investment  grade bonds are the better bet these days because they have less likelihood  of default. </p><p>   CLIFFORD MICHAELS, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER:  If in fact we are  double dipping -- I`m not in that camp necessarily -- but if we are slowing  down, that would affect the corporate high-yield bond market, the junk bond  market.  So we are going much more for investment grade corporate bonds  now. </p><p>  MILLER:  So you might think of investment grade then as more of a  tanker than a sailboat, not terribly exciting but the safer option if seas  get rough.  Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>  GHARIB:  And here`s what we`re watching for you for tomorrow. Housing  starts for June come out.  Analysts are expecting a second straight monthly  fall. That`s due to the end of the home buyer tax credit.  A big day for  earnings -- results for Apple, Goldman Sachs, Johnson &amp; Johnson and  Pepsico.  Also gold, our \"Word on the Street\" segment looks at lifelong  strategies when it comes to investing in the precious metals. </p><p>       A setback today for Ireland`s recovery. Moody`s downgraded the  country`s credit rating. Moody`s lowered Ireland one notch. It still  remains above junk level though. The ratings agency cited a weak banking  system and rising debt.  But Moody`s still boosted its outlook from Ireland  from negative to stable, saying another downgrade is unlikely.  Ireland was  the first Eurozone nation to enter recession. It was out in the first  quarter of this year. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Meanwhile major banks in Greece are expected to pass a series  of stress tests. The country`s finance minister said today he`s certain  they will.  Six Greek banks are among the 91 undergoing stress tests by the  European Union. The results are due Friday. The Greek government is  considering a $911 million offer by a private bank to take control of two  state lenders.  Greece is said to be closely examining that proposal. </p><p>  GHARIB: From tax cuts to curbing spending, tonight`s commentator is  thinking about controlling our budget deficit.  He`s Glen Hubbard, dean of  Columbia University`s graduate school of business and former chairman of  the Council of Economic Advisors under President George W. Bush. </p><p>  GLENN HUBBARD, GRADUATE SCHL. OF BUSINESS, COLUMBIA UNIV.:  Many  congressional leaders have suggested that tax revenues are too low and will  remain low without a tax increase.  This year`s Federal revenues will be  about 15 percent of GDP, less than the 40-year average of about 18 percent.   But revenues are already on track to exceed 23 percent of GDP in just 25  years, greater than in World War II.  How would this happen? </p><p>        First a recovery will boost revenues. And over time rising incomes  will lift taxpayers into higher brackets, real bracket creep.  And tax cuts  from 2001 and 2003 and the 2009 stimulus will expire.  New taxes are  helping to pay for health care reform while the AMT not indexed for  inflation will hike taxes for millions.  </p><p>        About a third of the revenue growth comes from expiring tax  provisions, a third from real bracket creep and a third from remaining tax  increases.  Now the Congress is unlikely to let all tax cuts expire.  So  won`t we have a revenue gap exactly as congressional leaders argue? Not  necessarily. We can extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and limit the growth  of the AMT and still have tax revenues more than 19 percent of GDP by the  end of this decade, well over the 40-year average.  The real question is  whether we can keep Federal spending in check. If not, we will need to  raise taxes and to levels well beyond the heights of World War II.  I`m  Glenn Hubbard. </p><p>  HUDSON:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT on this Monday evening,  July 19. That`s for joining us. I`m Tom Hudson. Good night.  Have a great  evening Susie. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Take care, Tom. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night everyone. Hope  to see all of you again tomorrow night.   </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

We`ll look at how that`s playing out in the economy and the upcoming election. You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, October 8.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening everyone, 95,000 American workers lost jobs in September. And you know Tom, when you look at the numbers, there was some hiring by U.S. businesses, but just not enough to offset those huge cuts in government jobs.</p><p>HUDSON: No there wasn`t Susie, the Labor Department in fact said the unemployment rate did hold steady at 9.6 percent. But add in people who`ve stopped looking or who cannot find full-time work and the so-called underemployment rate is much higher: 17.1 percent.</p><p>GHARIB: That`s right and those dreary numbers could be the trigger for Federal Reserve policymakers to pump more money into the financial system, hoping to spur economic activity and hiring. Scott Gurvey reports.</p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The employment report for September looks a lot like the report for August -- more government layoffs than new hires in the private sector. There are also signs cautious employers are making due with part-time and temporary workers, adding to the number of so-called underemployed. And with consumers still cutting spending to pay down debt, economist Chris Low sees the sluggish pattern continuing.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL: The obvious bad news is that we`ve got an unacceptably high level of unemployment in the U.S. And we will continue to have an unacceptably high level of unemployment. The good news is that at least the economy is growing.</p><p>GURVEY: Growing yes, but job growth remains slow. So slow in fact it is not keeping up with population growth. The president`s top economist today admitted his disappointment with the data.</p><p>AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER: It`s clearly the right trajectory, but it`s got to be much higher because this is the deepest hole since 1929.</p><p>GURVEY: Even with short-term interest rates near zero, JPMorgan`s Bruce Kasman says today`s employment report should prompt the central bank to take additional steps to stimulate growth by injecting more money into the economy.</p><p>BRUCE KASMAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JP MORGAN CHASE: This is a report which feeds that concern on the part of the Fed that they`re not hitting their mandate. And I think they made it clear that unless they feel that something has changed, they`re going to move towards asset purchases.</p><p>GURVEY: The Fed could announce plans to buy additional assets as early as next month. It meets in three weeks to review policy. Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: Here are the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. That weak jobs market did not stop stocks from moving higher. At the closing bell, the Dow had gained 58 points, closing above 11,000 for the first time since May. The NASDAQ added 18, the S&amp;P 500 up seven. Volume grew slightly from yesterday`s pace but still under one billion shares on the big board, just over two billion on the NASDAQ.</p><p>A big move today by Bank of America. It stopped sales of foreclosed homes nationwide for the next few weeks. The move comes amid growing concern about the validity of foreclosure documents. B of A had already stopped sales in 23 states where foreclosures must be OKd by a judge. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill weigh in on the foreclosure mess at a hearing scheduled for November 16. Two ranking Democrats want other lenders to follow Bank of America`s lead. Meantime, California lawmakers finally approved a budget, ending a record budget impasse and closing a $19 billion gap. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger brokered this budget deal, which includes no new taxes or fees. And New Jersey`s governor will re-think his decision to cancel a rail tunnel between his state and Manhattan. Yesterday, Governor Chris Christie scrapped the nation`s biggest public transit project, saying the $14 billion price tag was too high. Still ahead, the neck-and-neck race for Nevada`s third congressional district. It`s one of the tightest election contests in the country and it`s all about economic survival. We`ll explain.</p><p>GHARIB: More analysis now on today`s jobs report that we told you about. Joining us from Washington, Mohamed el-Erian, CEO and co-chief investment officer at Pimco -- the world`s largest bond fund company. Hi, Mohamed, nice to see you again.</p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CEO &amp; CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PIMCO: Hi, Susie. Thanks for having me on.</p><p>GHARIB: So what`s your take on this employment report? Did it tell you anything new about the state of the U.S. economy?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: There were some bright spots, but they were very limited. Overall it`s a disappointing report and it concerns an (ph) unemployment will remain the main economic, political and social issue going forward.</p><p>GHARIB: As we reported a moment ago, the markets rallied on speculation that the Federal Reserve is going to take some action to pump money into the economy. But we`ve had so many people come on our program saying that they don`t think that action will do much to pump up the economy. Where do you stand on that?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: You know, the market is torn right now. The unemployment numbers tell you that we have a very sluggish economy. We`re not creating enough jobs and state and local governments are shedding a lot of jobs. So the markets should not like that. However, the market says, ah, but because of this, the Fed is going to have to do more. The Fed is going to have to use its printing press to come and buy securities and therefore, that is going to be good for us. The way we look at it, Susie, is there is going to be two effects: one is technical and the markets have been pricing in the entry again of the Fed as a buyer of security. But the one we are most concerned about is the economics. We do not believe that this policy action will be sufficient to get this economy growing again, to get the unemployment rate well below where it is now.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, the other thing that we`re hearing and I think the American public is also hoping that these mid-term elections are going to make a difference. They`re hoping that a new Congress will be good for the economy. What`s your take on that?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: I hope so. We desperately need, Susie, a common objective and a common analysis of this country`s economic situation. Otherwise we are going to continue to face very sluggish growth and unacceptably high unemployment. Remember one in six Americans today is either unemployed or under employed which means those who are employed, those who have jobs become more cautious and spend less because they see how many people are unemployed.</p><p>GHARIB: Exactly. And we know that this is not a quick fix. Everybody says that. So if Congress can`t do much and the Fed might not be effective in all of this, so how do we improve the job market and the housing market where we continue to see massive foreclosures? Is it just a matter of a waiting game?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: Susie, what you say is important. It is about jobs. It is about housing. It is about structural change. This economy is going through a fundamental change and it`s very important to bring in the different agencies of government, with the Federal Reserve, in a room and have a common objective, have a common analysis and then have the political support for a comprehensive solution.</p><p>GHARIB: Now, you`re talking about here in the U.S. I know that you`re in Washington today at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund where there are hundreds of world leaders and finance ministers. If you had to compress it to one thought, what is it that everybody is talking about there when it comes to the economy?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: People are nervous. They don`t like the fact that the super power is facing these head winds. They also don`t like all of this brinksmanship and positioning over currencies and all these threats that have come out over the last through days. There is a sense in anxiety in the air. There`s a sense of tension. And the hope is that discussions over the weekend can lower this tension because it is not good for the global economy.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. We`ll leave it there. Thank you so much for coming on the program. It is always a pleasure to hear your thoughts.</p><p>EL-ERIAN: Thank you, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: My guest tonight Mohamed el-Erian, CEO and co-chief investment officer at Pimco.</p><p>HUDSON: The major indices resumed their march higher this week with the Dow Industrials back over 11,000. So let`s get you updated in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" In five of the past six weeks, we`ve see stocks climb higher. The gains more modest this week. Take a look. We begin with the Dow Industrials (DJI) adding 1.6 percent, up three of the past five sessions. The NASDAQ (IXIC) up 1.3 percent compared to a week ago. Several big tech bellwethers do have earnings reports next week. We`ll mention one in a moment. The S&amp;P 500 (GSPC) added 1.7 percent thanks to two days of gains this week.</p><p>While stocks resumed their climb this week, today the big moves in the grain markets. Corn (3CZ0), soybeans and wheat all rallied as much as they`re allowed to in one day. That`s called limit up. Here`s the past six months for corn. This high tonight is a two-year high, close to a two-year high. The government cut its harvest forecast today. Back in August, the U.S. Ag Department had predicted a record haul, no longer though. Bad weather gets the blame. Adding to the anxieties, corn leftover from last year`s harvest is down too. Scott Shelladay with XFA Futures says it`s not just a drop in U.S. crops that has the market spooked.</p><p>SCOTT SHELLADY, MANAGER, XFA FUTURES: The problems that we`ve had in China, the problems that we`ve had in Russia, Canada and Australia. If you overlay that on top of what we got today, we have a food issue in the world not just a corn issue. We`ve got less rice. We`ve got less oats. We`ve got less wheat.</p><p>HUDSON: Companies doing business in American farm fields did catch a bid on this grain rally. Deere (DE) and Caterpillar (CAT) each rallied to new 52-week highs on good volume. Fertilizer makers CF Industries (CF) and Agrium (AGU), these are also new 52-week highs. In fact CF Industries was the single biggest percentage gainer of the S&amp;P 500 today, up almost 11.5 percent. The food price rally helped companies that help grow it. It hurt companies that have to buy it. Tyson (TSN) plummeted almost 8 percent on three times its usual volume. Tonight this is an eight-month low for this stock. Tyson is one of the world`s biggest meat processors buying loads of grain for feed. Smithfield (SFD) is another big meat processor. Its shares sank almost seven percent on big volume. Meat prices have been rising helping these companies, but higher food costs clearly are worrying the market today.</p><p>Retailer JC Penney (JCP) added to its rally we reported on last night as an activist hedge fund has been buying that and others. The stock added another three 3 percent on strong volume today. Hedge fund Pershing Square now controls almost 17 percent of the stock. This same fund disclosed an 11 percent stake in Fortune Brands (FO). That company best known for its Jim Beam whiskey and Titleist golf products. Fortune FO, the stock jumping more than 7 percent.</p><p>The ripple effect around Micron Technologies (MU) helped some chip makers. Micron added almost 7 percent on the trade today even after missing estimates in its most recent quarter. Revenues and margins though were up. It also has a new licensing deal with Samsung. Fellow memory chip maker Sandisk (SNDK) up 6 percent. Intel (INTC) makes a different kind of semiconductor. Its results are due out next week, just a fractional gain. A couple of new stocks come to market this week, including yet another Chinese IPO in the United States. Ellington Financial (EFC) first, it focuses on mortgage-related assets. It closed below its IPO price of $22.50. Chinese solar products maker Daqo (DQ) came public at $9.50 per share this week and clearly it moved higher. That is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>The political party that controls Congress can affect your job and your retirement savings. It also affects businesses and our economy. The outcome of next month`s elections rides on candidates slugging it out in communities across the country. In tonight`s midterm 2010, it`s the economy election coverage, Darren Gersh looks at one district and how the economy is shaping the campaigns of the two people competing to represent it.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Nevada`s third congressional district is the most populous in the nation: one million people spread across a ring of suburbs, many just a few years old. And there is bipartisan agreement on the economic pain here. Representative Dina Titus, a Democrat, won her seat in 2008.</p><p>REP DINA TITUS, (D) NEVADA: The main thing I hear is jobs. We got to create jobs.</p><p>GERSH: And this is the Republican challenger Joe Heck. He`s seen the unemployment rate here -- the highest in the nation at over 14 percent -- hit his family. One daughter, a new college graduate, is having trouble finding work. Another daughter was laid off six months ago.</p><p>JOE HECK, (R) CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: She`s actually on unemployment trying to find another job.</p><p>GERSH: To say this election is about the economy doesn`t quite capture what is going on here. It`s more basic than that. For many people, it`s about survival which is why Titus emphasizes the basics when she talks to voters.</p><p>TITUS: I`m committed to helping them with the VA, with their Social Security, with their Medicare, with their foreclosure problem. And that`s what they need right now. It`s not the big theories or the big ideologies. It`s keeping body and soul together.</p><p>GERSH: And far from running from her vote for the Obama stimulus plan, she says it`s critical to Nevada`s future and saved jobs.</p><p>TITUS: A lot of people say the failed stimulus, the failed stimulus. Well, it saved 1800 jobs at the airport new terminal. I stood outside that at shift change one morning about 4:00 in the morning, shook a lot of hands and those were working hands and those are people who`d say, thank you. We needed to keep working.</p><p>GERSH: Joe Heck is also a doctor and his economic treatment plan begins with controlling spending.</p><p>HECK: And I think that goes back to looking at, do we need to go back to a certain year and cap spending at that level, control non-defense, discretionary spending.</p><p>GERSH: And he would remove what he calls the uncertainty over regulation and taxes.</p><p>HECK: We`ve got to make sure that we can instill confidence into those that are trying to create jobs by saying look, for a certain period of time, the `01-`03 tax cuts are going to remain in effect so you don`t have to worry about hiring somebody today only to worry about your taxes going up in January and then maybe having to let that person go in March.</p><p>GERSH: Their plans would move the country in opposite directions. But polls show this race is one of the tightest in the nation in Vegas terms, even money. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Las Vegas.</p><p>GHARIB: And here`s what we`re watching for you for next week. Our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest is Stephen Wood. He`s chief market strategist at Russell Investments. We`ll also see quarterly results from some big tech companies including Intel, Google and AMD. And then on Monday, with oil prices hovering around $80, we`ll look at what even higher crude prices could do to a very slow economic recovery.</p><p>One of the world`s biggest drug companies is getting smaller. Sanofi Aventis today announced plans to cut a quarter of the jobs in its U.S. pharmaceutical business. That works out to about 1,700 people, mostly sales reps and administrative staff. Sanofi is slashing staff and costs to better face growing challenges to its products. Three of its four top selling drugs either have or are about to have, generic competitors.</p><p>HUDSON: Blackberry maker Research in Motion and the United Arab Emirates have reached a truce before a ban of the mobile devices was to take effect there. The Emirates was planning to shut Blackberry`s email, messaging and web services on Monday, shut them down due to security issues. That would have meant big problems for half a million local users and thousands of passengers who use Dubai`s airport every day. RIMM and the UAE offered few details on how things were worked out. However it appears the reprieve is permanent.</p><p>Safety has become the strategy for stock investors. So says tonight`s \"Market Monitor.\" He`s Randall Eley, president of the Edgar Lomax Company, an investment advisory firm based in Springfield, Virginia. He joins us tonight from our Washington bureau. Randall, it`s nice to see you. Welcome back to NBR.</p><p>RANDALL ELEY, PRESIDENT, THE EDGAR LOMAX COMPANY: It is good to see you also, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: So we have seen the economy growing slightly. We have seen private payrolls that are up over the last several months. So why play it so safe?</p><p>ELEY: Because of one factor, which at first is a good factor for the value of stocks and that`s long-term interest rates. When I was last with you about six months ago, the 10-year Treasury for example was yielding about 3.8 percent. We`re down to 2.4 percent today. So on the one hand, it makes us feel better about the current prices of stocks. But on the other hand, we know the Federal Reserve will not be able to keep interest rates this low forever. So the short rate being zero.</p><p>HUDSON: Right. So with that in mind, be a one-handed investor over the next 12 to 18 months. Cautious or even pessimistic when it comes to the overall stock market?</p><p>ELEY: Cautious in the intermediate term. I would even say feeling a bit warm toward the market in the short-term, three to six months, but pessimistic over the longer term.</p><p>HUDSON: It was April Fool`s day, no coincidence however, April 1st last time you were in that chair. A couple of stocks you liked back then were Pfizer and the Traveler`s Company. Clearly big firms here, kind of a split performance. You still like these two?</p><p>ELEY: I like both of them.</p><p>HUDSON: You also brought along AT&amp;T and Merck. AT&amp;T up 8 percent, Merck down 2 percent and you`re putting new money to work in Merck, MRK. Why do you still like this drug maker here?</p><p>ELEY: Here is a company which should do well, whatever the economic environment. And you get a very high dividend yield, 4.1 percent. So you`re almost twice the 10-year Treasury and this company ought to be a cash machine.</p><p>HUDSON: Any concern about Brandon Pharmaceuticals in the pipeline?</p><p>ELEY: No. Not at all. The company is so cash rich and earning so much, their research capability should be good.</p><p>HUDSON: Lots of folks like dividends these days and you`re looking for them elsewhere in the oil market, big oil here with Chevron, CVX, you like that. The stock here has been on a nice rally lately as oil pro prices have rebounded. Also like ExxonMobil, XOM, the world`s largest company which its stock price has not been responding as its others. Why these two?</p><p>ELEY: Not yet. These are clearly the leaders or certainly among the leaders. And the fact of life is they should continue to be profitable, strong balance sheets. Also, these companies do not need government assistance to the extent we run into any future credit crisis.</p><p>HUDSON: However, what if you see the economy weakening substantially and perhaps oil prices moving lower?</p><p>ELEY: There is no doubt the earnings would fall, but that is very different from raising questions about the ability to earn money as would be the case elsewhere.</p><p>HUDSON: You`re also looking at And Johnson &amp; Johnson, not just a pharmaceutical company, but medical products across the board. The stock had fallen on hard times this summertime, but has seen a nice rebound here in the month of September and October. What`s to come?</p><p>ELEY: That`s right. With Johnson &amp; Johnson, I think we`re getting a unique opportunity to buy a good earning situation because of the recent concerns. This company has a great history of getting through crisis. And I feel comfortable they will get through this one, too.</p><p>HUDSON: It is global and it`s dividend-seeking in the short-term. You mentioned about three months, maybe, for a holding period?</p><p>ELEY: Actually, I think all of these companies at three years is probably a good holding.</p><p>HUDSON: And you have positions for your clients?</p><p>ELEY: Yes. Well, for our clients, and I also own them.</p><p>HUDSON: All right, great. Some interesting picks here. We`ll catch up in another half year or so. Tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" this evening is Randall Eley, president of the Edgar Lomax Company.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally, companies are hiring, just not enough to make a dent in the unemployment rate. One person who found work in the past couple of months is Marci Sigel. She got a job in Miami as a nurse consultant. In a continuing series that we`re calling \"You`re Hired\" Sigel tells us about her journey on and off the unemployment line.</p><p>MARCI SIGEL, LEGAL NURSE CONSULTANT: My name is Marci Sigel and I was unemployed from November until August. I was at a private school that was an exclusive environment for dyslexic kids and we would all work together how to help these kids. If there was a teaching need, I would teach a science class and then I turned into administration. Over time, with the economy, they laid me off. Every day is a full-time job to look for a job. You have to sit there and spend hours writing your cover letters, writing your resume over again, sending them out, looking at different sites all day long.</p><p>After a while, when I realized I wasn`t able to go back to a hospital because I didn`t have two years recent clinical, when I kept getting turned down in that area, I knew that I had skills that I would have to diversify with. It just popped up. And then all of a sudden a few popped up in this industry and I just sent out the resume. I knew I could do it and I made that clear. I can do this work. About three months later I got a call. And she said, I`m very sorry and I thought she was going to say we`ve hired someone else. She said, we`d like to have you come in and talk about the job. I was like, you`re kidding me. Being employed is like a holiday all the time. There is no pressure. I can have a weekend. I can have an evening. I don`t have to go see if there is a job that has been posted. I don`t have to worry about how to not show face to the kids that I`m terrified. Yeah.</p><p>HUDSON: Pretty amazing story, Susie, 150,000 Americans have gotten jobs since August. She is one of them and hopefully in the months ahead we can bring more positive stories like that.</p><p>GHARIB: I was going to say the same thing. There are 15 million Americans who could learn a lot from Marci.</p><p>HUDSON: Stay positive, stay optimistic. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Friday evening, October 8th. Thanks for joining us. Have a great weekend. I`m Tom Hudson. Have a wonderful weekend too Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Same to you, Tom. I`m Susie Gharib. Have a great weekend everyone and we hope to see all of you again on Monday.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, July 19.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening everyone, a plea today from <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>for Congress to pass the unemployment bill. The president urged lawmakers, Tom, to put aside politics and to approve an extension of benefits to millions of Americans out of work.</p><p>HUDSON: Susie, this unemployment insurance bill is expected back on the Senate floor tomorrow. Republicans say they`ll only support an extension if the bill does not add to the national debt.</p><p>GHARIB: Still the president said lawmakers need to help Americans who have been laid off during this recession.</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We`ve got a responsibility to help them make ends meet and support their families, even as they`re looking for another job. That`s why it`s so essential to pass the unemployment insurance extension that comes up for a vote tomorrow.</p><p>GHARIB: Millions of Americans will be watching that vote tomorrow to find out what`s ahead for their weekly unemployment insurance check and one of them will be Bill Boteler. We first introduced you to Bill almost a year ago when he had already been unemployed for several months. Today he still is looking for work. Now as we revisit him, Bill tells us how he`s keeping his spirits up and planning for an uncertain future. Darren Gersh reports.</p><p>BILL BOTELER: It`s the top one. Open it up. They gave me $290.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For almost two years Bill Boteler has relied on a weekly unemployment insurance check. Not to make ends meet but to get them a little closer.</p><p>BOTELER: This to me is like a cushion. To try to live off this is challenging.</p><p>GERSH: When we first met Boteler almost a year ago, he hadn`t had a permanent job for 10 months. Since then he`s tried to keep his credit up which he says is important when you`re searching for work. He`s now looking for a cheaper apartment and Boteler says his weekly benefit check helps him focus on finding a job.</p><p>BOTELER: If you put the two together-- that you don`t have enough money to pay for anything and you are having to face a lot of rejection and a lot of disappointment in trying to find a job -- then I think that`s a little bit too much of a burden to put on people.</p><p>GERSH: In the last year, Boteler figures he`s applied for hundreds of jobs. He even set a daily production quota. His day begins with a trip to the new office of the great recession --</p><p>BOTELER: Hi, my name is Bill Boteler. I have experience as a writer and an editor.</p><p>GERSH: . the local cafe.</p><p>BOTELER: I mean, I`m here. I`m doing this. I`m dressed up. I have a goal. I`m not sitting in my room thinking about whether I should do the dishes or whether I should look for a job or something like that. I`m not aimless.</p><p>GERSH: Boteler has taken temp jobs including a stint as a census worker. Now he`s focused on the quality of his networking, not the quantity of resumes he sends out.</p><p>BOTELER: It`s unbelievable how much time it takes for people to find jobs. People who have not had to do that, who have been fortunate who have let`s say a job that`s been secure for many years, will be shocked when they discover just how difficult it is.</p><p>GERSH: We`ve talked to many people who are looking for work and they say there`s an unstated bias against the unemployed. Bill Boteler worries about that too. He wants people to know he`s a hard worker and he can`t understand why Congress is having such a tough time extending benefits.</p><p>BOTELER: If they cut the budget back, then you`re going to have a lot of people out there who aren`t going to have jobs. They`re not going to have anywhere to turn. And it`s... it will have an economic impact on people who consider themselves more fortunate.</p><p>GERSH: He has just nine weeks of unemployment insurance left. But the last few days, he says, have been good ones.</p><p>BOTELER: I`m not feeling really down right now because I`ve been doing a lot. I think something will pan out this time.</p><p>GERSH: Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: We`ll have more on the debate over extending jobless benefits a little bit later on in this program. But first let`s get you updated in the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. Stocks shook off some new worries about the housing sector at the closing bell, the Dow rising 56 points, the NASDAQ adding 19, the S&amp;P 500 up six. NYSE exchange volume fell below a billion down from Friday`s pace. NASDAQ fell below two billion also down from Friday. Stocks moved higher despite home builders singing the blues. This month the National Association of Home Builders confidence index fell to its lowest level in 15 months on a slump in economic growth and persistent high unemployment.</p><p>BP can keep testing the cap fitted over its broken well head. Now the tests have shown a methane gas leak on the sea floor near the well is not related Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen has OKd BP to continue testing for another 24 hours. Meanwhile costs tied to the spill are nearing $4 billion, including over $200 million to settle individual claims. And Ken Feinberg, the man overseeing BP`s huge compensation fund, says fishermen and others with claims would be, in his words, crazy to bypass the fund and sue. Feinberg says he`ll be more generous than any court and claimants won`t face court delays.</p><p>GHARIB: And coming up on the program, stocks too volatile? Treasury yields got you down? How about lending money to your favorite company instead? We look at why corporate debt offerings are jumping.</p><p>HUDSON: More now on the debate over extending unemployment benefits. If Congress OKs this this week, it would be the sixth time since the recession began that unemployment payments have been extended. Over the past two years, looking at everyone without a job, the percent of people who have been jobless for six months or more has jumped from under 20 percent to almost half. Jeff Miron is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. Christian Weller is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. Gentlemen, welcome to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>JEFF MIRON, SENIOR FELLOW, CATO INSTITUTE: Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>CHRISTIAN WELLER, SR. FELLOW, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: Nice to be here.</p><p>HUDSON: Let`s begin with what the Department of Labor says about the purpose of these unemployment checks. The benefits, quote, are intended to provide temporary financial assistance to unemployed workers. Jeff, let`s begin with you. Should there be a limit to unemployment benefits?</p><p>MIRON: I think there should be a limit. We need to have a balance between compassion which is the temporary word in the Department of Labor`s language suggests and productivity in giving people an incentive to go out and find jobs and particular to be willing to lower their wage demands, to accept jobs that are not exactly what they had before. They`re not necessarily as good as they had before. But have to take some responsibility themselves for the fact that economic conditions are worse and therefore take a broader set of jobs and have some limit to how long people can collect unemployment insurance.</p><p>HUDSON: That presumes there are jobs out there and that job demand is not being fulfilled. Christian, how about you? How do you define temporary in that definition from the Department of Labor?</p><p>WELLER: We need to have a new definition of temporary. We have to be mindful of the fact that this is the worst recession since the great depression. We have over 14 million people looking for jobs who cannot find jobs. We have about five people looking for each opening. We have millions of people who have given up looking for a job. And as you already mentioned, those who are looking are looking longer than at any point since World War II. Still clearly temporary now means something else given the severity of the labor market recession. And I think extending unemployment benefits is compassionate, but it also makes economic sense.</p><p>HUDSON: Talk to us Christian, talk to us just about that idea. We saw earlier in Darren`s piece from Bill Boteler, $290 a week. That doesn`t go very far. What do we know about the economic impact of these checks?</p><p>WELLER: We know that these checks make a real difference obviously in peoples` lives, those who are hurt the most by the current crisis. But in the aggregate, we`re talking about $30 billion. The money will be spent very quickly because these are people who have been struggling for quite some time. You`re extending the unemployment benefits. The money won`t be saved. It will go very quickly to consumption. It will boost retail sales which is the big worry of businesses at this point that they may fall off. Forty percent of businesses worry about sales not being high enough. That`s the biggest worry for them. So it will help the private sector and will protect the private sector momentum that we`ve seen that since the end of 2009. It`s strengthened the recovery to help us continue building jobs in the private sector.</p><p>HUDSON: Jeff, how about that? In order to stimulate job growth, you need folks spending money. At least this gets people to have some dollars in their pocket to spend.</p><p>MIRON: I think it`s a very unpersuasive position. First of all, the check that we`re sending the unemployed came from somewhere. They came from the taxes of other people who are for the most part employed. So if transferring money to these people who are unemployed helps stimulate the economy, then taking it away from the people who are paying the taxes to pay for it de-stimulates the economy. Overall it`s hard the see how that is on net a beneficial thing. More broadly, the fact that we`re consistently trying to promote sort of redistribution in helping people rather than trying to create rules and a system which is productive gives the private sector pause. It makes the private sector think we`re not getting the deficit and the debt under control. It makes them think we`re not worry about productivity. That`s in the long term much worse for people having jobs and being employed than the temporary aspect related to the recession.</p><p>HUDSON: Jeff, it`s estimated that since the extended unemployment benefits expired back in early June, about $3 billion has not been spent. Over that same month interest on the U.S. debt in June was $107 billion. We seem to be, you know, talking about spending pennies or saving pennies when we`re spending dollars.</p><p>MIRON: I totally agree. It`s a very small amount of money. The fact that it`s a very small amount of money also means that any possible effect in stimulating the economy is also very trivial because we`re talking about a very small amount of money. The broader thing is it creates the wrong incentive. There`s clear evidence that people who are unemployed tend to leave unemployment just before their unemployment benefits run out. It`s not just a question -- it`s not the right way to think about it -- are there jobs? The right way is are there jobs at what wages? If people lower their wage demands, if they offer to take say their old job for 50 percent of what they were getting, there would be a lot more jobs out there. That`s the adjustment that needs to happen in many cases. But unemployment insurance and especially very, very long-term unemployment insurance impedes that kind of adjustment.</p><p>HUDSON: Guys less than a minute left. Christian, I want to address that job demand issue.</p><p>WELLER: That`s just simply robbing Peter to pay Paul. If we lower our wages to create more jobs, ultimately the overall consumption won`t change and sales won`t change. The important point is that unemployment benefits are incredibly targeted, very good. Benefits for the economy, every dollar spent on unemployment increases economic activity, $1.6 (ph). So it makes economic sense. It helps the most vulnerable and ultimately boosts economic growth. I think this is the time is right at this point to extend the unemployment benefit.</p><p>HUDSON: It will be in front of the Senate tomorrow, Christian. Does it get approved?</p><p>WELLER: It will get approved but probably with a very slim margin.</p><p>HUDSON: Jeff, how about it?</p><p>MIRON: Unfortunately I think it will get approved too.</p><p>HUDSON: Our guests this evening on extending unemployment benefits, Christian Weller, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. We`ve also got Jeff Miron. He is with the Cato Institute.</p><p>WELLER: Thank you very much.</p><p>GHARIB: And moving along now to financial regulatory reform. On Wednesday <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>will sign the biggest overhaul of financial rules since the great depression. The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission says she`ll need helps enforcing those rules -- a lot of help. Mary Shapiro says her agency will need 800 new workers for what she calls a logistical and labor intensive challenge. Her comments came in prepared testimony that`s expected before a House committee tomorrow. The Dodd Frank Reform Act gives sweeping new powers to the SEC, including supervising hedge funds and the huge derivatives market.</p><p>GHARIB: A big step forward in the break-up of Motorola. It is selling most of its wireless network equipment business to Nokia Siemens. The price tag $1.2 billion. The all-cash sale boosts the standing of Nokia Siemens joint venture in the U.S. and Japan. Those companies say it brings layoffs. As for Motorola, by the first quarter of next year, it will have two business units, one selling equipment for the business market and another making mobile phones and other consumer products.</p><p>And speaking of technology, Tom, IBM came out with those earnings and disappointing revenues after the bell. Looks like that could set the tone for the markets tomorrow.</p><p>HUDSON: Kind of a similar refrain we`re hearing from IBM which was a pretty good bottom line but some concerns on the top line. We talked about it late last week. It is back in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>Before we get there throughout the day, investors bought both the defensive-minded utility sector as well as the growth-focused technology stocks. We`ll talk about big blue and tech in a moment. Utility stocks as measured by this exchange-traded fund XLU clearly was a pretty good winner today, traded up throughout the day almost making up what they lost during last Friday`s sell- off. A move over $31 for this ETF would take this fund up to a six-month high.</p><p>As we mentioned the focus after the close settled on a couple of big tech giants including IBM (IBM). Bottom line at big blue came in better than expected, but the top line revenues were lighter than anticipated. Also despite rising its full-year guidance, it still remains below Street estimates. Shares of IBM were up in advance of these earnings as you can see but after the report the stock was down as much as 4 percent after hours.</p><p>Chip maker Texas Instruments (TXN) was the other tech reporting after the close. Profits here coming in right as expected, no surprises. Operating profits did set a record. Gross margins also on the increase and positive news there for shareholders. Now TXN stock jumped 3 percent during the regular session. But after hours the stock gave up that and then some, falling by better than 6 percent. Apple (AAPL) is the big tech firm tomorrow with earnings as questions continue swirling about its iPhone-4. For a moment today intra-day, Apple stock fell below $240 per share, closing at $245 and change. That is the lowest price since mid May. Research in Motion, Motorola and others arguing today that Apple`s claim that all smart phones have reception problems is wrong. Apple`s earnings tomorrow by the way will be the first full quarter to include iPad sales. We`ll have a report tomorrow evening.</p><p>Energy stocks got a boost with some strong results from services company Halliburton (HAL). We`ll get you updated here. Growth across all of its markets helped Halliburton easily beat estimates. It`s the first major oil services firm to report earnings for the quarter that includes the BP disaster and the deep water drilling moratorium. Halliburton jumped 6 percent to a two-month high on the trade (ph). Schlumberger (SLB) will be next up with earnings in the group on Friday. Baker Hughes (BHI) is due out in two weeks.</p><p>More seats in the air may be good news for air travelers, but it could put pressure on airline profits. Delta (DAL) plans to increase capacity at the tail end of this year and into next year. That announcement came after earnings in the second quarter were much better than estimates. But echoing what we`ve seen from several others, revenues were less than anticipated. Delta stock dropped on three times the usual volume. Also caught up in the sell-off and concerns about more capacity leading to lower ticket prices, U.S. Airways (LCC) and even budget carrier Southwest (LUV), each falling on heavier volume.</p><p>Now we did see some biotech buying today in Gilead Sciences (GILD). It may be one to watch tomorrow. The \"Wall Street Journal\" tonight reports that a gel containing an HIV treatment made by Gilead cuts the chances of getting AIDS if used by women before and after sex. This study was led by South African researchers. Shares bounced off a 52-week low which was hit just on Friday. The drug is used to treat the AIDS virus, but this experiment looked at using it to help prevent HIV.</p><p>Catching you up on one of those biotechs working on an experimental weight loss drug, Vivus (VVUS) continued falling adding to Friday`s losses after an FDA advisory panel decided against recommending its treatment for approval, selling 8 percent to the downside.</p><p>Finally merger talk, today that centered around H&amp;R Block (HRB). Shareholders have had a tough go of it this year, since January the stock down by a third hitting a new 52-week low on Friday. Today though, shares bouncing on word that another tax giant wants to talk. John Hewitt (ph) put together (ph) Jackson Hewitt and another Liberty Tax services. He`s interested in H&amp;R Block. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: With worries about the economy and the stock market heating up, investors have been seeking the safety of bonds. For many that means Treasuries despite the puny returns. But if you can stomach more risk as some investment advisors believe corporate bonds are a better bet. Erika Miller looks at why you may want to consider jumping on the corporate bond boat.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: When sailing in choppy waters, boaters have life vests for safety. When it comes to market volatility, investors have their own form of protection: bonds. So far this year, investors have yanked nearly $11 trillion out of domestic stock funds. They`ve poured more than 10 times that amount into U.S. bond funds. The money is not just going into Treasury. Top quality corporate bonds are also benefiting from the flight to safety. But credit strategist Brad Rogoff believes high yield corporates, otherwise known as junk bonds, are a much better option.</p><p>BRADLEY ROGOFF, CO-HEAD, US CREDIT STRATEGY, BARCLAY`S CAPITAL: High yield bonds are paying on average, you know, 9 plus percent right now. Fundamentals are still improving for a lot of these companies. We`re seeing that come through as we get into earnings season right now.</p><p>MILLER: An easy way to get broad exposure to the corporate bond sector is to buy an exchange-traded fund. The Ishares high-yield corporate bond index is currently yielding 9 percent. The investment grade version is yielding 5 percent. Both are paying out a lot more than 10-year Treasuries which yield less than 3 percent. One of the biggest risks to corporate bonds is the possibility the Fed might start raising interest rates. Even if that happens, Rogoff thinks junk bonds will hold up fairly well.</p><p>ROGOFF: From a price standpoint, you will not see much of a move with respect to high-yield bonds. Obviously with a sizable coupon that they have on them that makes for an attractive investment in the current environment. Investment grade bonds will be much more sensitive to rates.</p><p>MILLER: Still financial planner Cliff Michaels believes investment grade bonds are the better bet these days because they have less likelihood of default.</p><p>CLIFFORD MICHAELS, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER: If in fact we are double dipping -- I`m not in that camp necessarily -- but if we are slowing down, that would affect the corporate high-yield bond market, the junk bond market. So we are going much more for investment grade corporate bonds now.</p><p>MILLER: So you might think of investment grade then as more of a tanker than a sailboat, not terribly exciting but the safer option if seas get rough. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: And here`s what we`re watching for you for tomorrow. Housing starts for June come out. Analysts are expecting a second straight monthly fall. That`s due to the end of the home buyer tax credit. A big day for earnings -- results for Apple, Goldman Sachs, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pepsico. Also gold, our \"Word on the Street\" segment looks at lifelong strategies when it comes to investing in the precious metals.</p><p>A setback today for Ireland`s recovery. Moody`s downgraded the country`s credit rating. Moody`s lowered Ireland one notch. It still remains above junk level though. The ratings agency cited a weak banking system and rising debt. But Moody`s still boosted its outlook from Ireland from negative to stable, saying another downgrade is unlikely. Ireland was the first Eurozone nation to enter recession. It was out in the first quarter of this year.</p><p>HUDSON: Meanwhile major banks in Greece are expected to pass a series of stress tests. The country`s finance minister said today he`s certain they will. Six Greek banks are among the 91 undergoing stress tests by the European Union. The results are due Friday. The Greek government is considering a $911 million offer by a private bank to take control of two state lenders. Greece is said to be closely examining that proposal.</p><p>GHARIB: From tax cuts to curbing spending, tonight`s commentator is thinking about controlling our budget deficit. He`s Glen Hubbard, dean of Columbia University`s graduate school of business and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President George W. Bush.</p><p>GLENN HUBBARD, GRADUATE SCHL. OF BUSINESS, COLUMBIA UNIV.: Many congressional leaders have suggested that tax revenues are too low and will remain low without a tax increase. This year`s Federal revenues will be about 15 percent of GDP, less than the 40-year average of about 18 percent. But revenues are already on track to exceed 23 percent of GDP in just 25 years, greater than in World War II. How would this happen?</p><p>First a recovery will boost revenues. And over time rising incomes will lift taxpayers into higher brackets, real bracket creep. And tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 and the 2009 stimulus will expire. New taxes are helping to pay for health care reform while the AMT not indexed for inflation will hike taxes for millions.</p><p>About a third of the revenue growth comes from expiring tax provisions, a third from real bracket creep and a third from remaining tax increases. Now the Congress is unlikely to let all tax cuts expire. So won`t we have a revenue gap exactly as congressional leaders argue? Not necessarily. We can extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and limit the growth of the AMT and still have tax revenues more than 19 percent of GDP by the end of this decade, well over the 40-year average. The real question is whether we can keep Federal spending in check. If not, we will need to raise taxes and to levels well beyond the heights of World War II. I`m Glenn Hubbard.</p><p>HUDSON: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT on this Monday evening, July 19. That`s for joining us. I`m Tom Hudson. Good night. Have a great evening Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Take care, Tom. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night everyone.

It`s a hot topic on Capitol Hill, but this man says there`s nothing political about needing a job.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL BOTELER: You`re going to have a lot of people out there who aren`t going to have jobs. They are not going to have anywhere to turn.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: From compassion to the cost, we look at the pros and cons of extending jobless benefits for millions of Americans. You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, July 19.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening everyone, a plea today from <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>for Congress to pass the unemployment bill. The president urged lawmakers, Tom, to put aside politics and to approve an extension of benefits to millions of Americans out of work.</p><p>HUDSON: Susie, this unemployment insurance bill is expected back on the Senate floor tomorrow. Republicans say they`ll only support an extension if the bill does not add to the national debt.</p><p>GHARIB: Still the president said lawmakers need to help Americans who have been laid off during this recession.</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We`ve got a responsibility to help them make ends meet and support their families, even as they`re looking for another job. That`s why it`s so essential to pass the unemployment insurance extension that comes up for a vote tomorrow.</p><p>GHARIB: Millions of Americans will be watching that vote tomorrow to find out what`s ahead for their weekly unemployment insurance check and one of them will be Bill Boteler. We first introduced you to Bill almost a year ago when he had already been unemployed for several months. Today he still is looking for work. Now as we revisit him, Bill tells us how he`s keeping his spirits up and planning for an uncertain future. Darren Gersh reports.</p><p>BILL BOTELER: It`s the top one. Open it up. They gave me $290.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For almost two years Bill Boteler has relied on a weekly unemployment insurance check. Not to make ends meet but to get them a little closer.</p><p>BOTELER: This to me is like a cushion. To try to live off this is challenging.</p><p>GERSH: When we first met Boteler almost a year ago, he hadn`t had a permanent job for 10 months. Since then he`s tried to keep his credit up which he says is important when you`re searching for work. He`s now looking for a cheaper apartment and Boteler says his weekly benefit check helps him focus on finding a job.</p><p>BOTELER: If you put the two together-- that you don`t have enough money to pay for anything and you are having to face a lot of rejection and a lot of disappointment in trying to find a job -- then I think that`s a little bit too much of a burden to put on people.</p><p>GERSH: In the last year, Boteler figures he`s applied for hundreds of jobs. He even set a daily production quota. His day begins with a trip to the new office of the great recession --</p><p>BOTELER: Hi, my name is Bill Boteler. I have experience as a writer and an editor.</p><p>GERSH: . the local cafe.</p><p>BOTELER: I mean, I`m here. I`m doing this. I`m dressed up. I have a goal. I`m not sitting in my room thinking about whether I should do the dishes or whether I should look for a job or something like that. I`m not aimless.</p><p>GERSH: Boteler has taken temp jobs including a stint as a census worker. Now he`s focused on the quality of his networking, not the quantity of resumes he sends out.</p><p>BOTELER: It`s unbelievable how much time it takes for people to find jobs. People who have not had to do that, who have been fortunate who have let`s say a job that`s been secure for many years, will be shocked when they discover just how difficult it is.</p><p>GERSH: We`ve talked to many people who are looking for work and they say there`s an unstated bias against the unemployed. Bill Boteler worries about that too. He wants people to know he`s a hard worker and he can`t understand why Congress is having such a tough time extending benefits.</p><p>BOTELER: If they cut the budget back, then you`re going to have a lot of people out there who aren`t going to have jobs. They`re not going to have anywhere to turn. And it`s... it will have an economic impact on people who consider themselves more fortunate.</p><p>GERSH: He has just nine weeks of unemployment insurance left. But the last few days, he says, have been good ones.</p><p>BOTELER: I`m not feeling really down right now because I`ve been doing a lot. I think something will pan out this time.</p><p>GERSH: Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: We`ll have more on the debate over extending jobless benefits a little bit later on in this program. But first let`s get you updated in the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. Stocks shook off some new worries about the housing sector at the closing bell, the Dow rising 56 points, the NASDAQ adding 19, the S&amp;P 500 up six. NYSE exchange volume fell below a billion down from Friday`s pace. NASDAQ fell below two billion also down from Friday. Stocks moved higher despite home builders singing the blues. This month the National Association of Home Builders confidence index fell to its lowest level in 15 months on a slump in economic growth and persistent high unemployment.</p><p>BP can keep testing the cap fitted over its broken well head. Now the tests have shown a methane gas leak on the sea floor near the well is not related Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen has OKd BP to continue testing for another 24 hours. Meanwhile costs tied to the spill are nearing $4 billion, including over $200 million to settle individual claims. And Ken Feinberg, the man overseeing BP`s huge compensation fund, says fishermen and others with claims would be, in his words, crazy to bypass the fund and sue. Feinberg says he`ll be more generous than any court and claimants won`t face court delays.</p><p>GHARIB: And coming up on the program, stocks too volatile? Treasury yields got you down? How about lending money to your favorite company instead? We look at why corporate debt offerings are jumping.</p><p>HUDSON: More now on the debate over extending unemployment benefits. If Congress OKs this this week, it would be the sixth time since the recession began that unemployment payments have been extended. Over the past two years, looking at everyone without a job, the percent of people who have been jobless for six months or more has jumped from under 20 percent to almost half. Jeff Miron is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. Christian Weller is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. Gentlemen, welcome to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>JEFF MIRON, SENIOR FELLOW, CATO INSTITUTE: Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>CHRISTIAN WELLER, SR. FELLOW, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: Nice to be here.</p><p>HUDSON: Let`s begin with what the Department of Labor says about the purpose of these unemployment checks. The benefits, quote, are intended to provide temporary financial assistance to unemployed workers. Jeff, let`s begin with you. Should there be a limit to unemployment benefits?</p><p>MIRON: I think there should be a limit. We need to have a balance between compassion which is the temporary word in the Department of Labor`s language suggests and productivity in giving people an incentive to go out and find jobs and particular to be willing to lower their wage demands, to accept jobs that are not exactly what they had before. They`re not necessarily as good as they had before. But have to take some responsibility themselves for the fact that economic conditions are worse and therefore take a broader set of jobs and have some limit to how long people can collect unemployment insurance.</p><p>HUDSON: That presumes there are jobs out there and that job demand is not being fulfilled. Christian, how about you? How do you define temporary in that definition from the Department of Labor?</p><p>WELLER: We need to have a new definition of temporary. We have to be mindful of the fact that this is the worst recession since the great depression. We have over 14 million people looking for jobs who cannot find jobs. We have about five people looking for each opening. We have millions of people who have given up looking for a job. And as you already mentioned, those who are looking are looking longer than at any point since World War II. Still clearly temporary now means something else given the severity of the labor market recession. And I think extending unemployment benefits is compassionate, but it also makes economic sense.</p><p>HUDSON: Talk to us Christian, talk to us just about that idea. We saw earlier in Darren`s piece from Bill Boteler, $290 a week. That doesn`t go very far. What do we know about the economic impact of these checks?</p><p>WELLER: We know that these checks make a real difference obviously in peoples` lives, those who are hurt the most by the current crisis. But in the aggregate, we`re talking about $30 billion. The money will be spent very quickly because these are people who have been struggling for quite some time. You`re extending the unemployment benefits. The money won`t be saved. It will go very quickly to consumption. It will boost retail sales which is the big worry of businesses at this point that they may fall off. Forty percent of businesses worry about sales not being high enough. That`s the biggest worry for them. So it will help the private sector and will protect the private sector momentum that we`ve seen that since the end of 2009. It`s strengthened the recovery to help us continue building jobs in the private sector.</p><p>HUDSON: Jeff, how about that? In order to stimulate job growth, you need folks spending money. At least this gets people to have some dollars in their pocket to spend.</p><p>MIRON: I think it`s a very unpersuasive position. First of all, the check that we`re sending the unemployed came from somewhere. They came from the taxes of other people who are for the most part employed. So if transferring money to these people who are unemployed helps stimulate the economy, then taking it away from the people who are paying the taxes to pay for it de-stimulates the economy. Overall it`s hard the see how that is on net a beneficial thing. More broadly, the fact that we`re consistently trying to promote sort of redistribution in helping people rather than trying to create rules and a system which is productive gives the private sector pause. It makes the private sector think we`re not getting the deficit and the debt under control. It makes them think we`re not worry about productivity. That`s in the long term much worse for people having jobs and being employed than the temporary aspect related to the recession.</p><p>HUDSON: Jeff, it`s estimated that since the extended unemployment benefits expired back in early June, about $3 billion has not been spent. Over that same month interest on the U.S. debt in June was $107 billion. We seem to be, you know, talking about spending pennies or saving pennies when we`re spending dollars.</p><p>MIRON: I totally agree. It`s a very small amount of money. The fact that it`s a very small amount of money also means that any possible effect in stimulating the economy is also very trivial because we`re talking about a very small amount of money. The broader thing is it creates the wrong incentive. There`s clear evidence that people who are unemployed tend to leave unemployment just before their unemployment benefits run out. It`s not just a question -- it`s not the right way to think about it -- are there jobs? The right way is are there jobs at what wages? If people lower their wage demands, if they offer to take say their old job for 50 percent of what they were getting, there would be a lot more jobs out there. That`s the adjustment that needs to happen in many cases. But unemployment insurance and especially very, very long-term unemployment insurance impedes that kind of adjustment.</p><p>HUDSON: Guys less than a minute left. Christian, I want to address that job demand issue.</p><p>WELLER: That`s just simply robbing Peter to pay Paul. If we lower our wages to create more jobs, ultimately the overall consumption won`t change and sales won`t change. The important point is that unemployment benefits are incredibly targeted, very good. Benefits for the economy, every dollar spent on unemployment increases economic activity, $1.6 (ph). So it makes economic sense. It helps the most vulnerable and ultimately boosts economic growth. I think this is the time is right at this point to extend the unemployment benefit.</p><p>HUDSON: It will be in front of the Senate tomorrow, Christian. Does it get approved?</p><p>WELLER: It will get approved but probably with a very slim margin.</p><p>HUDSON: Jeff, how about it?</p><p>MIRON: Unfortunately I think it will get approved too.</p><p>HUDSON: Our guests this evening on extending unemployment benefits, Christian Weller, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. We`ve also got Jeff Miron. He is with the Cato Institute.</p><p>WELLER: Thank you very much.</p><p>GHARIB: And moving along now to financial regulatory reform. On Wednesday <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>will sign the biggest overhaul of financial rules since the great depression. The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission says she`ll need helps enforcing those rules -- a lot of help. Mary Shapiro says her agency will need 800 new workers for what she calls a logistical and labor intensive challenge. Her comments came in prepared testimony that`s expected before a House committee tomorrow. The Dodd Frank Reform Act gives sweeping new powers to the SEC, including supervising hedge funds and the huge derivatives market.</p><p>GHARIB: A big step forward in the break-up of Motorola. It is selling most of its wireless network equipment business to Nokia Siemens. The price tag $1.2 billion. The all-cash sale boosts the standing of Nokia Siemens joint venture in the U.S. and Japan. Those companies say it brings layoffs. As for Motorola, by the first quarter of next year, it will have two business units, one selling equipment for the business market and another making mobile phones and other consumer products.</p><p>And speaking of technology, Tom, IBM came out with those earnings and disappointing revenues after the bell. Looks like that could set the tone for the markets tomorrow.</p><p>HUDSON: Kind of a similar refrain we`re hearing from IBM which was a pretty good bottom line but some concerns on the top line. We talked about it late last week. It is back in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>Before we get there throughout the day, investors bought both the defensive-minded utility sector as well as the growth-focused technology stocks. We`ll talk about big blue and tech in a moment. Utility stocks as measured by this exchange-traded fund XLU clearly was a pretty good winner today, traded up throughout the day almost making up what they lost during last Friday`s sell- off. A move over $31 for this ETF would take this fund up to a six-month high.</p><p>As we mentioned the focus after the close settled on a couple of big tech giants including IBM (IBM). Bottom line at big blue came in better than expected, but the top line revenues were lighter than anticipated. Also despite rising its full-year guidance, it still remains below Street estimates. Shares of IBM were up in advance of these earnings as you can see but after the report the stock was down as much as 4 percent after hours.</p><p>Chip maker Texas Instruments (TXN) was the other tech reporting after the close. Profits here coming in right as expected, no surprises. Operating profits did set a record. Gross margins also on the increase and positive news there for shareholders. Now TXN stock jumped 3 percent during the regular session. But after hours the stock gave up that and then some, falling by better than 6 percent. Apple (AAPL) is the big tech firm tomorrow with earnings as questions continue swirling about its iPhone-4. For a moment today intra-day, Apple stock fell below $240 per share, closing at $245 and change. That is the lowest price since mid May. Research in Motion, Motorola and others arguing today that Apple`s claim that all smart phones have reception problems is wrong. Apple`s earnings tomorrow by the way will be the first full quarter to include iPad sales. We`ll have a report tomorrow evening.</p><p>Energy stocks got a boost with some strong results from services company Halliburton (HAL). We`ll get you updated here. Growth across all of its markets helped Halliburton easily beat estimates. It`s the first major oil services firm to report earnings for the quarter that includes the BP disaster and the deep water drilling moratorium. Halliburton jumped 6 percent to a two-month high on the trade (ph). Schlumberger (SLB) will be next up with earnings in the group on Friday. Baker Hughes (BHI) is due out in two weeks.</p><p>More seats in the air may be good news for air travelers, but it could put pressure on airline profits. Delta (DAL) plans to increase capacity at the tail end of this year and into next year. That announcement came after earnings in the second quarter were much better than estimates. But echoing what we`ve seen from several others, revenues were less than anticipated. Delta stock dropped on three times the usual volume. Also caught up in the sell-off and concerns about more capacity leading to lower ticket prices, U.S. Airways (LCC) and even budget carrier Southwest (LUV), each falling on heavier volume.</p><p>Now we did see some biotech buying today in Gilead Sciences (GILD). It may be one to watch tomorrow. The \"Wall Street Journal\" tonight reports that a gel containing an HIV treatment made by Gilead cuts the chances of getting AIDS if used by women before and after sex. This study was led by South African researchers. Shares bounced off a 52-week low which was hit just on Friday. The drug is used to treat the AIDS virus, but this experiment looked at using it to help prevent HIV.</p><p>Catching you up on one of those biotechs working on an experimental weight loss drug, Vivus (VVUS) continued falling adding to Friday`s losses after an FDA advisory panel decided against recommending its treatment for approval, selling 8 percent to the downside.</p><p>Finally merger talk, today that centered around H&amp;R Block (HRB). Shareholders have had a tough go of it this year, since January the stock down by a third hitting a new 52-week low on Friday. Today though, shares bouncing on word that another tax giant wants to talk. John Hewitt (ph) put together (ph) Jackson Hewitt and another Liberty Tax services. He`s interested in H&amp;R Block. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: With worries about the economy and the stock market heating up, investors have been seeking the safety of bonds. For many that means Treasuries despite the puny returns. But if you can stomach more risk as some investment advisors believe corporate bonds are a better bet. Erika Miller looks at why you may want to consider jumping on the corporate bond boat.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: When sailing in choppy waters, boaters have life vests for safety. When it comes to market volatility, investors have their own form of protection: bonds. So far this year, investors have yanked nearly $11 trillion out of domestic stock funds. They`ve poured more than 10 times that amount into U.S. bond funds. The money is not just going into Treasury. Top quality corporate bonds are also benefiting from the flight to safety. But credit strategist Brad Rogoff believes high yield corporates, otherwise known as junk bonds, are a much better option.</p><p>BRADLEY ROGOFF, CO-HEAD, US CREDIT STRATEGY, BARCLAY`S CAPITAL: High yield bonds are paying on average, you know, 9 plus percent right now. Fundamentals are still improving for a lot of these companies. We`re seeing that come through as we get into earnings season right now.</p><p>MILLER: An easy way to get broad exposure to the corporate bond sector is to buy an exchange-traded fund. The Ishares high-yield corporate bond index is currently yielding 9 percent. The investment grade version is yielding 5 percent. Both are paying out a lot more than 10-year Treasuries which yield less than 3 percent. One of the biggest risks to corporate bonds is the possibility the Fed might start raising interest rates. Even if that happens, Rogoff thinks junk bonds will hold up fairly well.</p><p>ROGOFF: From a price standpoint, you will not see much of a move with respect to high-yield bonds. Obviously with a sizable coupon that they have on them that makes for an attractive investment in the current environment. Investment grade bonds will be much more sensitive to rates.</p><p>MILLER: Still financial planner Cliff Michaels believes investment grade bonds are the better bet these days because they have less likelihood of default.</p><p>CLIFFORD MICHAELS, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER: If in fact we are double dipping -- I`m not in that camp necessarily -- but if we are slowing down, that would affect the corporate high-yield bond market, the junk bond market. So we are going much more for investment grade corporate bonds now.</p><p>MILLER: So you might think of investment grade then as more of a tanker than a sailboat, not terribly exciting but the safer option if seas get rough. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: And here`s what we`re watching for you for tomorrow. Housing starts for June come out. Analysts are expecting a second straight monthly fall. That`s due to the end of the home buyer tax credit. A big day for earnings -- results for Apple, Goldman Sachs, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pepsico. Also gold, our \"Word on the Street\" segment looks at lifelong strategies when it comes to investing in the precious metals.</p><p>A setback today for Ireland`s recovery. Moody`s downgraded the country`s credit rating. Moody`s lowered Ireland one notch. It still remains above junk level though. The ratings agency cited a weak banking system and rising debt. But Moody`s still boosted its outlook from Ireland from negative to stable, saying another downgrade is unlikely. Ireland was the first Eurozone nation to enter recession. It was out in the first quarter of this year.</p><p>HUDSON: Meanwhile major banks in Greece are expected to pass a series of stress tests. The country`s finance minister said today he`s certain they will. Six Greek banks are among the 91 undergoing stress tests by the European Union. The results are due Friday. The Greek government is considering a $911 million offer by a private bank to take control of two state lenders. Greece is said to be closely examining that proposal.</p><p>GHARIB: From tax cuts to curbing spending, tonight`s commentator is thinking about controlling our budget deficit. He`s Glen Hubbard, dean of Columbia University`s graduate school of business and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President George W. Bush.</p><p>GLENN HUBBARD, GRADUATE SCHL. OF BUSINESS, COLUMBIA UNIV.: Many congressional leaders have suggested that tax revenues are too low and will remain low without a tax increase. This year`s Federal revenues will be about 15 percent of GDP, less than the 40-year average of about 18 percent. But revenues are already on track to exceed 23 percent of GDP in just 25 years, greater than in World War II. How would this happen?</p><p>First a recovery will boost revenues. And over time rising incomes will lift taxpayers into higher brackets, real bracket creep. And tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 and the 2009 stimulus will expire. New taxes are helping to pay for health care reform while the AMT not indexed for inflation will hike taxes for millions.</p><p>About a third of the revenue growth comes from expiring tax provisions, a third from real bracket creep and a third from remaining tax increases. Now the Congress is unlikely to let all tax cuts expire. So won`t we have a revenue gap exactly as congressional leaders argue? Not necessarily. We can extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and limit the growth of the AMT and still have tax revenues more than 19 percent of GDP by the end of this decade, well over the 40-year average. The real question is whether we can keep Federal spending in check. If not, we will need to raise taxes and to levels well beyond the heights of World War II. I`m Glenn Hubbard.</p><p>HUDSON: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT on this Monday evening, July 19. That`s for joining us. I`m Tom Hudson. Good night. Have a great evening Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Take care, Tom. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night everyone.

We`ll look at how that`s  playing out in the economy and the upcoming election. You`re watching  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, October 8. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB: Good evening everyone, 95,000 American workers lost jobs in  September. And you know Tom, when you look at the numbers, there was some  hiring by U.S. businesses, but just not enough to offset those huge cuts in  government jobs. </p><p>  HUDSON:  No there wasn`t Susie, the Labor Department in fact said the  unemployment rate did hold steady at 9.6 percent.  But add in people who`ve  stopped looking or who cannot find full-time work and the so-called  underemployment rate is much higher:  17.1 percent. </p><p>  GHARIB: That`s right and those dreary numbers could be the trigger for  Federal Reserve policymakers to pump more money into the financial system,  hoping to spur economic activity and hiring. Scott Gurvey reports. </p><p>  SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The employment  report for September looks a lot like the report for August -- more  government layoffs than new hires in the private sector. There are also  signs cautious employers are making due with part-time and temporary  workers, adding to the number of so-called underemployed.  And with  consumers still cutting spending to pay down debt, economist Chris Low sees  the sluggish pattern continuing. </p><p>   CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL:  The obvious bad news  is that we`ve got an unacceptably high level of unemployment in the U.S.   And we will continue to have an unacceptably high level of unemployment.  The good news is that at least the economy is growing. </p><p>  GURVEY:  Growing yes, but job growth remains slow. So slow in fact it  is not keeping up with population growth. The president`s top economist  today admitted his disappointment with the data. </p><p>   AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER:  It`s clearly the right  trajectory, but it`s got to be much higher because this is the deepest hole  since 1929. </p><p>  GURVEY: Even with short-term interest rates near zero, JPMorgan`s  Bruce Kasman says today`s employment report should prompt the central bank  to take additional steps to stimulate growth by injecting more money into  the economy. </p><p>   BRUCE KASMAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JP MORGAN CHASE:  This is a report  which feeds that concern on the part of the Fed that they`re not hitting  their mandate. And I think they made it clear that unless they feel that  something has changed, they`re going to move towards asset purchases. </p><p>  GURVEY:  The Fed could announce plans to buy additional assets as  early as next month. It meets in three weeks to review policy.  Scott  Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Here are the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel.  That weak  jobs market did not stop stocks from moving higher.  At the closing bell,  the Dow had gained 58 points, closing above 11,000 for the first time since  May. The NASDAQ added 18, the S&amp;P 500 up seven. Volume grew slightly from  yesterday`s pace but still under one billion shares on the big board, just  over two billion on the NASDAQ. </p><p>       A big move today by Bank of America.  It stopped sales of foreclosed  homes nationwide for the next few weeks. The move comes amid growing  concern about the validity of foreclosure documents. B of A had already  stopped sales in 23 states where foreclosures must be OKd by a judge.  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill weigh in on the foreclosure mess at a hearing  scheduled for November 16. Two ranking Democrats want other lenders to  follow Bank of America`s lead. </p><p>       Meantime, California lawmakers finally approved a budget, ending a  record budget impasse and closing a $19 billion gap. Governor Arnold  Schwarzenegger brokered this budget deal, which includes no new taxes or  fees.  And New Jersey`s governor will re-think his decision to cancel a  rail tunnel between his state and Manhattan. Yesterday, Governor Chris  Christie scrapped the nation`s biggest public transit project, saying the  $14 billion price tag was too high. </p><p>       Still ahead, the neck-and-neck race for Nevada`s third congressional  district. It`s one of the tightest election contests in the country and  it`s all about economic survival. We`ll explain. </p><p>  GHARIB: More analysis now on today`s jobs report that we told you  about. Joining us from Washington, Mohamed el-Erian, CEO and co-chief  investment officer at Pimco -- the world`s largest bond fund company. Hi,  Mohamed, nice to see you again. </p><p>  MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CEO &amp; CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PIMCO:  Hi,  Susie. Thanks for having me on. </p><p>  GHARIB:  So what`s your take on this employment report?  Did it tell  you anything new about the state of the U.S. economy? </p><p>  EL-ERIAN:  There were some bright spots, but they were very limited.   Overall it`s a disappointing report and it concerns an (ph) unemployment  will remain the main economic, political and social issue going forward. </p><p>  GHARIB: As we reported a moment ago, the markets rallied on  speculation that the Federal Reserve is going to take some action to pump  money into the economy.  But we`ve had so many people come on our program  saying that they don`t think that action will do much to pump up the  economy.  Where do you stand on that? </p><p>  EL-ERIAN:  You know, the market is torn right now. The unemployment  numbers tell you that we have a very sluggish economy. We`re not creating  enough jobs and state and local governments are shedding a lot of jobs.  So  the markets should not like that. However, the market says, ah, but because  of this, the Fed is going to have to do more. The Fed is going to have to  use its printing press to come and buy securities and therefore, that is  going to be good for us. The way we look at it, Susie, is there is going to  be two effects: one is technical and the markets have been pricing in the  entry again of the Fed as a buyer of security.  But the one we are most  concerned about is the economics. We do not believe that this policy action  will be sufficient to get this economy growing again, to get the  unemployment rate well below where it is now. </p><p>  GHARIB: Well, the other thing that we`re hearing and I think the  American public is also hoping that these mid-term elections are going to  make a difference. They`re hoping that a new Congress will be good for the  economy. What`s your take on that? </p><p>  EL-ERIAN:  I hope so. We desperately need, Susie, a common objective  and a common analysis of this country`s economic situation.  Otherwise we  are going to continue to face very sluggish growth and unacceptably high  unemployment. Remember one in six Americans today is either unemployed or  under employed which means those who are employed, those who have jobs  become more cautious and spend less because they see how many people are  unemployed. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Exactly.  And we know that this is not a quick fix. Everybody  says that. So if Congress can`t do much and the Fed might not be effective  in all of this, so how do we improve the job market and the housing market  where we continue to see massive foreclosures?  Is it just a matter of a  waiting game? </p><p>  EL-ERIAN:  Susie, what you say is important. It is about jobs. It is  about housing. It is about structural change. This economy is going through  a fundamental change and it`s very important to bring in the different  agencies of government, with the Federal Reserve, in a room and have a  common objective, have a common analysis and then have the political  support for a comprehensive solution. </p><p>  GHARIB: Now, you`re talking about here in the U.S. I know that you`re  in Washington today at the annual meeting of the International Monetary  Fund where there are hundreds of world leaders and finance ministers. If  you had to compress it to one thought, what is it that everybody is talking  about there when it comes to the economy? </p><p>  EL-ERIAN:  People are nervous. They don`t like the fact that the super  power is facing these head winds. They also don`t like all of this  brinksmanship and positioning over currencies and all these threats that  have come out over the last through days. There is a sense in anxiety in  the air. There`s a sense of tension. And the hope is that discussions over  the weekend can lower this tension because it is not good for the global  economy. </p><p>  GHARIB: All right. We`ll leave it there. Thank you so much for coming  on the program.  It is always a pleasure to hear your thoughts. </p><p>  EL-ERIAN:  Thank you, Susie. </p><p>  GHARIB: My guest tonight Mohamed el-Erian, CEO and co-chief investment  officer at Pimco. </p><p>  HUDSON:  The major indices resumed their march higher this week with  the Dow Industrials back over 11,000.  So let`s get you updated in  tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"  In five of the past six weeks, we`ve see stocks  climb higher. The gains more modest this week. Take a look. We begin with  the Dow Industrials (DJI) adding 1.6 percent, up three of the past five  sessions. The NASDAQ (IXIC) up 1.3 percent compared to a week ago. Several  big tech bellwethers do have earnings reports next week.  We`ll mention one  in a moment.  The S&amp;P 500 (GSPC) added 1.7 percent thanks to two days of  gains this week. </p><p>  While stocks resumed their climb this week, today the big moves in the  grain markets. Corn (3CZ0), soybeans and wheat all rallied as much as  they`re allowed to in one day. That`s called limit up. Here`s the past six  months for corn. This high tonight is a two-year high, close to a two-year  high. The government cut its harvest forecast today.  Back in August, the  U.S. Ag Department had predicted a record haul, no longer though. Bad  weather gets the blame. Adding to the anxieties, corn leftover from last  year`s harvest is down too.  Scott Shelladay with XFA Futures says it`s not  just a drop in U.S. crops that has the market spooked. </p><p>  SCOTT SHELLADY, MANAGER, XFA FUTURES:  The problems that we`ve had in  China, the problems that we`ve had in Russia, Canada and Australia. If you  overlay that on top of what we got today, we have a food issue in the world  not just a corn issue. We`ve got less rice. We`ve got less oats. We`ve got  less wheat. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Companies doing business in American farm fields did catch a  bid on this grain rally.  Deere (DE) and Caterpillar (CAT) each rallied to  new 52-week highs on good volume. Fertilizer makers CF Industries (CF) and  Agrium (AGU), these are also new 52-week highs.  In fact CF Industries was  the single biggest percentage gainer of the S&amp;P 500 today, up almost 11.5  percent. The food price rally helped companies that help grow it.  It hurt  companies that have to buy it. Tyson (TSN) plummeted almost 8 percent on  three times its usual volume. Tonight this is an eight-month low for this  stock. Tyson is one of the world`s biggest meat processors buying loads of  grain for feed. Smithfield (SFD) is another big meat processor. Its shares  sank almost seven percent on big volume. Meat prices have been rising  helping these companies, but higher food costs clearly are worrying the  market today. </p><p>  Retailer JC Penney (JCP) added to its rally we reported on last night  as an activist hedge fund has been buying that and others. The stock added  another three 3 percent on strong volume today.  Hedge fund Pershing Square  now controls almost 17 percent of the stock. This same fund disclosed an 11  percent stake in Fortune Brands (FO). That company best known for its Jim  Beam whiskey and Titleist golf products. Fortune FO, the stock jumping more  than 7 percent. </p><p>       The ripple effect around Micron Technologies (MU) helped some chip  makers. Micron added almost 7 percent on the trade today even after missing  estimates in its most recent quarter.  Revenues and margins though were up.  It also has a new licensing deal with Samsung. Fellow memory chip maker  Sandisk (SNDK) up 6 percent. Intel (INTC) makes a different kind of  semiconductor.  Its results are due out next week, just a fractional gain. </p><p>       A couple of new stocks come to market this week, including yet  another Chinese IPO in the United States. Ellington Financial (EFC) first,  it focuses on mortgage-related assets. It closed below its IPO price of  $22.50. Chinese solar products maker Daqo (DQ) came public at $9.50 per  share this week and clearly it moved higher.   That is tonight`s \"Market  Focus.\" </p><p>  The political party that controls Congress can affect your job and  your retirement savings.  It also affects businesses and our economy. The  outcome of next month`s elections rides on candidates slugging it out in  communities across the country. In tonight`s midterm 2010, it`s the economy  election coverage, Darren Gersh looks at one district and how the economy  is shaping the campaigns of the two people competing to represent it. </p><p>  DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Nevada`s third  congressional district is the most populous in the nation: one million  people spread across a ring of suburbs, many just a few years old. And  there is bipartisan agreement on the economic pain here.  Representative  Dina Titus, a Democrat, won her seat in 2008. </p><p>  REP DINA TITUS, (D) NEVADA: The main thing I hear is jobs. We got to  create jobs. </p><p>  GERSH: And this is the Republican challenger Joe Heck. He`s seen the  unemployment rate here -- the highest in the nation at over 14 percent --  hit his family. One daughter, a new college graduate, is having trouble  finding work. Another daughter was laid off six months ago. </p><p>   JOE HECK, (R) CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  She`s actually on unemployment  trying to find another job. </p><p>  GERSH: To say this election is about the economy doesn`t quite capture  what is going on here. It`s more basic than that.  For many people, it`s  about survival which is why Titus emphasizes the basics when she talks to  voters. </p><p>   TITUS: I`m committed to helping them with the VA, with their Social  Security, with their Medicare, with their foreclosure problem. And that`s  what they need right now.  It`s not the big theories or the big ideologies.  It`s keeping body and soul together. </p><p>  GERSH: And far from running from her vote for the Obama stimulus plan,  she says it`s critical to Nevada`s future and saved jobs.</p><p>  TITUS: A lot of people say the failed stimulus, the failed stimulus.   Well, it saved 1800 jobs at the airport new terminal. I stood outside that  at shift change one morning about 4:00 in the morning, shook a lot of hands  and those were working hands and those are people who`d say, thank you.  We  needed to keep working.</p><p>       GERSH:   Joe Heck is also a doctor and his economic treatment plan  begins with controlling spending. </p><p>  HECK:  And I think that goes back to looking at, do we need to go back  to a certain year and cap spending at that level, control non-defense,  discretionary spending. </p><p>  GERSH: And he would remove what he calls the uncertainty over  regulation and taxes. </p><p>   HECK:  We`ve got to make sure that we can instill confidence into  those that are trying to create jobs by saying look, for a certain period  of time, the `01-`03 tax cuts are going to remain in effect so you don`t  have to worry about hiring somebody today only to worry about your taxes  going up in January and then maybe having to let that person go in March. </p><p>        GERSH:  Their plans would move the country in opposite directions.  But polls show this race is one of the tightest in the nation in Vegas  terms, even money. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Las Vegas. </p><p>  GHARIB:  And here`s what we`re watching for you for next week. Our  Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest is Stephen Wood.  He`s chief market  strategist at Russell Investments. We`ll also see quarterly results from  some big tech companies including Intel, Google and AMD.  And then on  Monday, with oil prices hovering around $80, we`ll look at what even higher  crude prices could do to a very slow economic recovery. </p><p>       One of the world`s biggest drug companies is getting smaller. Sanofi  Aventis today announced plans to cut a quarter of the jobs in its U.S.  pharmaceutical business. That works out to about 1,700 people, mostly sales  reps and administrative staff.  Sanofi is slashing staff and costs to  better face growing challenges to its products.  Three of its four top  selling drugs either have or are about to have, generic competitors. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Blackberry maker Research in Motion and the United Arab  Emirates have reached a truce before a ban of the mobile devices was to  take effect there. The Emirates was planning to shut Blackberry`s email,  messaging and web services on Monday, shut them down due to security  issues. That would have meant big problems for half a million local users  and thousands of passengers who use Dubai`s airport every day.  RIMM and  the UAE offered few details on how things were worked out. However it  appears the reprieve is permanent. </p><p>       Safety has become the strategy for stock investors. So says tonight`s  \"Market Monitor.\"  He`s Randall Eley, president of the Edgar Lomax Company,  an investment advisory firm based in Springfield, Virginia. He joins us  tonight from our Washington bureau.  Randall, it`s nice to see you.   Welcome back to NBR. </p><p>  RANDALL ELEY, PRESIDENT, THE EDGAR LOMAX COMPANY:  It is good to see  you also, Tom. </p><p>  HUDSON:  So we have seen the economy growing slightly. We have seen  private payrolls that are up over the last several months.  So why play it  so safe? </p><p>  ELEY:  Because of one factor, which at first is a good factor for the  value of stocks and that`s long-term interest rates. When I was last with  you about six months ago, the 10-year Treasury for example was yielding  about 3.8 percent. We`re down to 2.4 percent today.  So on the one hand, it  makes us feel better about the current prices of stocks. But on the other  hand, we know the Federal Reserve will not be able to keep interest rates  this low forever. So the short rate being zero. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Right.  So with that in mind, be a one-handed investor over  the next 12 to 18 months.  Cautious or even pessimistic when it comes to  the overall stock market? </p><p>  ELEY:  Cautious in the intermediate term. I would even say feeling a  bit warm toward the market in the short-term, three to six months, but  pessimistic over the longer term. </p><p>  HUDSON:  It was April Fool`s day, no coincidence however, April 1st  last time you were in that chair. A couple of stocks you liked back then  were Pfizer and the Traveler`s Company. Clearly big firms here, kind of a  split performance. You still like these two? </p><p>  ELEY:  I like both of them. </p><p>  HUDSON:   You also brought along AT&amp;T and Merck.  AT&amp;T up 8 percent,  Merck down 2 percent and you`re putting new money to work in Merck, MRK.   Why do you still like this drug maker here? </p><p>  ELEY:  Here is a company which should do well, whatever the economic  environment. And you get a very high dividend yield, 4.1 percent.  So  you`re almost twice the 10-year Treasury and this company ought to be a  cash machine. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Any concern about Brandon Pharmaceuticals in the pipeline? </p><p>  ELEY:  No. Not at all. The company is so cash rich and earning so  much, their research capability should be good. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Lots of folks like dividends these days and you`re looking  for them elsewhere in the oil market, big oil here with Chevron, CVX, you  like that. The stock here has been on a nice rally lately as oil pro prices  have rebounded.  Also like ExxonMobil, XOM, the world`s largest company  which its stock price has not been responding as its others. Why these two? </p><p>  ELEY:  Not yet. These are clearly the leaders or certainly among the  leaders. And the fact of life is they should continue to be profitable,  strong balance sheets.  Also, these companies do not need government  assistance to the extent we run into any future credit crisis. </p><p>  HUDSON:  However, what if you see the economy weakening substantially  and perhaps oil prices moving lower? </p><p>  ELEY:  There is no doubt the earnings would fall, but that is very  different from raising questions about the ability to earn money as would  be the case elsewhere. </p><p>  HUDSON:  You`re also looking at And Johnson &amp; Johnson, not just a  pharmaceutical company, but medical products across the board.  The stock  had fallen on hard times this summertime, but has seen a nice rebound here  in the month of September and October.  What`s to come?</p><p>  ELEY:  That`s right. With Johnson &amp; Johnson, I think we`re getting a  unique opportunity to buy a good earning situation because of the recent  concerns. This company has a great history of getting through crisis. And I  feel comfortable they will get through this one, too. </p><p>  HUDSON:  It is global and it`s dividend-seeking in the short-term. You  mentioned about three months, maybe, for a holding period? </p><p>  ELEY:  Actually, I think all of these companies at three years is  probably a good holding. </p><p>  HUDSON:  And you have positions for your clients? </p><p>  ELEY:  Yes.  Well, for our clients, and I also own them. </p><p>  HUDSON:  All right, great. Some interesting picks here. We`ll catch up  in another half year or so. Tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" this evening is  Randall Eley, president of the Edgar Lomax Company. </p><p>  GHARIB:  And finally, companies are hiring, just not enough to make a  dent in the unemployment rate. One person who found work in the past couple  of months is Marci Sigel. She got a job in Miami as a nurse consultant.  In  a continuing series that we`re calling \"You`re Hired\" Sigel tells us about  her journey on and off the unemployment line. </p><p>  MARCI SIGEL, LEGAL NURSE CONSULTANT:  My name is Marci Sigel and I was  unemployed from November until August. I was at a private school that was  an exclusive environment for dyslexic kids and we would all work together  how to help these kids. If there was a teaching need, I would teach a  science class and then I turned into administration. Over time, with the  economy, they laid me off. Every day is a full-time job to look for a job.  You have to sit there and spend hours writing your cover letters, writing  your resume over again, sending them out, looking at different sites all  day long. </p><p>        After a while, when I realized I wasn`t able to go back to a  hospital because I didn`t have two years recent clinical, when I kept  getting turned down in that area, I knew that I had skills that I would  have to diversify with. It just popped up. And then all of a sudden a few  popped up in this industry and I just sent out the resume. I knew I could  do it and I made that clear. I can do this work. About three months later I  got a call. And she said, I`m very sorry and I thought she was going to say  we`ve hired someone else. She said, we`d like to have you come in and talk  about the job. I was like, you`re kidding me. Being employed is like a  holiday all the time. There is no pressure. I can have a weekend. I can  have an evening. I don`t have to go see if there is a job that has been  posted. I don`t have to worry about how to not show face to the kids that  I`m terrified. Yeah. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Pretty amazing story, Susie, 150,000 Americans have gotten  jobs since August. She is one of them and hopefully in the months ahead we  can bring more positive stories like that. </p><p>  GHARIB: I was going to say the same thing. There are 15 million  Americans who could learn a lot from Marci. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Stay positive, stay optimistic. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS  REPORT for this Friday evening, October 8th.  Thanks for joining us. Have a  great weekend.  I`m Tom Hudson.  Have a wonderful weekend too Susie.</p><p>  GHARIB: Same to you, Tom.  I`m Susie Gharib. Have a great weekend  everyone and we hope to see all of you again on Monday.   </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

We`ll look at how that`s playing out in the economy and the upcoming election. You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, October 8.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening everyone, 95,000 American workers lost jobs in September. And you know Tom, when you look at the numbers, there was some hiring by U.S. businesses, but just not enough to offset those huge cuts in government jobs.</p><p>HUDSON: No there wasn`t Susie, the Labor Department in fact said the unemployment rate did hold steady at 9.6 percent. But add in people who`ve stopped looking or who cannot find full-time work and the so-called underemployment rate is much higher: 17.1 percent.</p><p>GHARIB: That`s right and those dreary numbers could be the trigger for Federal Reserve policymakers to pump more money into the financial system, hoping to spur economic activity and hiring. Scott Gurvey reports.</p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The employment report for September looks a lot like the report for August -- more government layoffs than new hires in the private sector. There are also signs cautious employers are making due with part-time and temporary workers, adding to the number of so-called underemployed. And with consumers still cutting spending to pay down debt, economist Chris Low sees the sluggish pattern continuing.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL: The obvious bad news is that we`ve got an unacceptably high level of unemployment in the U.S. And we will continue to have an unacceptably high level of unemployment. The good news is that at least the economy is growing.</p><p>GURVEY: Growing yes, but job growth remains slow. So slow in fact it is not keeping up with population growth. The president`s top economist today admitted his disappointment with the data.</p><p>AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER: It`s clearly the right trajectory, but it`s got to be much higher because this is the deepest hole since 1929.</p><p>GURVEY: Even with short-term interest rates near zero, JPMorgan`s Bruce Kasman says today`s employment report should prompt the central bank to take additional steps to stimulate growth by injecting more money into the economy.</p><p>BRUCE KASMAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JP MORGAN CHASE: This is a report which feeds that concern on the part of the Fed that they`re not hitting their mandate. And I think they made it clear that unless they feel that something has changed, they`re going to move towards asset purchases.</p><p>GURVEY: The Fed could announce plans to buy additional assets as early as next month. It meets in three weeks to review policy. Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: Here are the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. That weak jobs market did not stop stocks from moving higher. At the closing bell, the Dow had gained 58 points, closing above 11,000 for the first time since May. The NASDAQ added 18, the S&amp;P 500 up seven. Volume grew slightly from yesterday`s pace but still under one billion shares on the big board, just over two billion on the NASDAQ.</p><p>A big move today by Bank of America. It stopped sales of foreclosed homes nationwide for the next few weeks. The move comes amid growing concern about the validity of foreclosure documents. B of A had already stopped sales in 23 states where foreclosures must be OKd by a judge. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill weigh in on the foreclosure mess at a hearing scheduled for November 16. Two ranking Democrats want other lenders to follow Bank of America`s lead.</p><p>Meantime, California lawmakers finally approved a budget, ending a record budget impasse and closing a $19 billion gap. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger brokered this budget deal, which includes no new taxes or fees. And New Jersey`s governor will re-think his decision to cancel a rail tunnel between his state and Manhattan. Yesterday, Governor Chris Christie scrapped the nation`s biggest public transit project, saying the $14 billion price tag was too high.</p><p>Still ahead, the neck-and-neck race for Nevada`s third congressional district. It`s one of the tightest election contests in the country and it`s all about economic survival. We`ll explain.</p><p>GHARIB: More analysis now on today`s jobs report that we told you about. Joining us from Washington, Mohamed el-Erian, CEO and co-chief investment officer at Pimco -- the world`s largest bond fund company. Hi, Mohamed, nice to see you again.</p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CEO &amp; CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PIMCO: Hi, Susie. Thanks for having me on.</p><p>GHARIB: So what`s your take on this employment report? Did it tell you anything new about the state of the U.S. economy?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: There were some bright spots, but they were very limited. Overall it`s a disappointing report and it concerns an (ph) unemployment will remain the main economic, political and social issue going forward.</p><p>GHARIB: As we reported a moment ago, the markets rallied on speculation that the Federal Reserve is going to take some action to pump money into the economy. But we`ve had so many people come on our program saying that they don`t think that action will do much to pump up the economy. Where do you stand on that?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: You know, the market is torn right now. The unemployment numbers tell you that we have a very sluggish economy. We`re not creating enough jobs and state and local governments are shedding a lot of jobs. So the markets should not like that. However, the market says, ah, but because of this, the Fed is going to have to do more. The Fed is going to have to use its printing press to come and buy securities and therefore, that is going to be good for us. The way we look at it, Susie, is there is going to be two effects: one is technical and the markets have been pricing in the entry again of the Fed as a buyer of security. But the one we are most concerned about is the economics. We do not believe that this policy action will be sufficient to get this economy growing again, to get the unemployment rate well below where it is now.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, the other thing that we`re hearing and I think the American public is also hoping that these mid-term elections are going to make a difference. They`re hoping that a new Congress will be good for the economy. What`s your take on that?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: I hope so. We desperately need, Susie, a common objective and a common analysis of this country`s economic situation. Otherwise we are going to continue to face very sluggish growth and unacceptably high unemployment. Remember one in six Americans today is either unemployed or under employed which means those who are employed, those who have jobs become more cautious and spend less because they see how many people are unemployed.</p><p>GHARIB: Exactly. And we know that this is not a quick fix. Everybody says that. So if Congress can`t do much and the Fed might not be effective in all of this, so how do we improve the job market and the housing market where we continue to see massive foreclosures? Is it just a matter of a waiting game?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: Susie, what you say is important. It is about jobs. It is about housing. It is about structural change. This economy is going through a fundamental change and it`s very important to bring in the different agencies of government, with the Federal Reserve, in a room and have a common objective, have a common analysis and then have the political support for a comprehensive solution.</p><p>GHARIB: Now, you`re talking about here in the U.S. I know that you`re in Washington today at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund where there are hundreds of world leaders and finance ministers. If you had to compress it to one thought, what is it that everybody is talking about there when it comes to the economy?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: People are nervous. They don`t like the fact that the super power is facing these head winds. They also don`t like all of this brinksmanship and positioning over currencies and all these threats that have come out over the last through days. There is a sense in anxiety in the air. There`s a sense of tension. And the hope is that discussions over the weekend can lower this tension because it is not good for the global economy.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. We`ll leave it there. Thank you so much for coming on the program. It is always a pleasure to hear your thoughts.</p><p>EL-ERIAN: Thank you, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: My guest tonight Mohamed el-Erian, CEO and co-chief investment officer at Pimco.</p><p>HUDSON: The major indices resumed their march higher this week with the Dow Industrials back over 11,000. So let`s get you updated in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" In five of the past six weeks, we`ve see stocks climb higher. The gains more modest this week. Take a look. We begin with the Dow Industrials (DJI) adding 1.6 percent, up three of the past five sessions. The NASDAQ (IXIC) up 1.3 percent compared to a week ago. Several big tech bellwethers do have earnings reports next week. We`ll mention one in a moment. The S&amp;P 500 (GSPC) added 1.7 percent thanks to two days of gains this week.</p><p>While stocks resumed their climb this week, today the big moves in the grain markets. Corn (3CZ0), soybeans and wheat all rallied as much as they`re allowed to in one day. That`s called limit up. Here`s the past six months for corn. This high tonight is a two-year high, close to a two-year high. The government cut its harvest forecast today. Back in August, the U.S. Ag Department had predicted a record haul, no longer though. Bad weather gets the blame. Adding to the anxieties, corn leftover from last year`s harvest is down too. Scott Shelladay with XFA Futures says it`s not just a drop in U.S. crops that has the market spooked.</p><p>SCOTT SHELLADY, MANAGER, XFA FUTURES: The problems that we`ve had in China, the problems that we`ve had in Russia, Canada and Australia. If you overlay that on top of what we got today, we have a food issue in the world not just a corn issue. We`ve got less rice. We`ve got less oats. We`ve got less wheat.</p><p>HUDSON: Companies doing business in American farm fields did catch a bid on this grain rally. Deere (DE) and Caterpillar (CAT) each rallied to new 52-week highs on good volume. Fertilizer makers CF Industries (CF) and Agrium (AGU), these are also new 52-week highs. In fact CF Industries was the single biggest percentage gainer of the S&amp;P 500 today, up almost 11.5 percent. The food price rally helped companies that help grow it. It hurt companies that have to buy it. Tyson (TSN) plummeted almost 8 percent on three times its usual volume. Tonight this is an eight-month low for this stock. Tyson is one of the world`s biggest meat processors buying loads of grain for feed. Smithfield (SFD) is another big meat processor. Its shares sank almost seven percent on big volume. Meat prices have been rising helping these companies, but higher food costs clearly are worrying the market today.</p><p>Retailer JC Penney (JCP) added to its rally we reported on last night as an activist hedge fund has been buying that and others. The stock added another three 3 percent on strong volume today. Hedge fund Pershing Square now controls almost 17 percent of the stock. This same fund disclosed an 11 percent stake in Fortune Brands (FO). That company best known for its Jim Beam whiskey and Titleist golf products. Fortune FO, the stock jumping more than 7 percent.</p><p>The ripple effect around Micron Technologies (MU) helped some chip makers. Micron added almost 7 percent on the trade today even after missing estimates in its most recent quarter. Revenues and margins though were up. It also has a new licensing deal with Samsung. Fellow memory chip maker Sandisk (SNDK) up 6 percent. Intel (INTC) makes a different kind of semiconductor. Its results are due out next week, just a fractional gain.</p><p>A couple of new stocks come to market this week, including yet another Chinese IPO in the United States. Ellington Financial (EFC) first, it focuses on mortgage-related assets. It closed below its IPO price of $22.50. Chinese solar products maker Daqo (DQ) came public at $9.50 per share this week and clearly it moved higher. That is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>The political party that controls Congress can affect your job and your retirement savings. It also affects businesses and our economy. The outcome of next month`s elections rides on candidates slugging it out in communities across the country. In tonight`s midterm 2010, it`s the economy election coverage, Darren Gersh looks at one district and how the economy is shaping the campaigns of the two people competing to represent it.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Nevada`s third congressional district is the most populous in the nation: one million people spread across a ring of suburbs, many just a few years old. And there is bipartisan agreement on the economic pain here. Representative Dina Titus, a Democrat, won her seat in 2008.</p><p>REP DINA TITUS, (D) NEVADA: The main thing I hear is jobs. We got to create jobs.</p><p>GERSH: And this is the Republican challenger Joe Heck. He`s seen the unemployment rate here -- the highest in the nation at over 14 percent -- hit his family. One daughter, a new college graduate, is having trouble finding work. Another daughter was laid off six months ago.</p><p>JOE HECK, (R) CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: She`s actually on unemployment trying to find another job.</p><p>GERSH: To say this election is about the economy doesn`t quite capture what is going on here. It`s more basic than that. For many people, it`s about survival which is why Titus emphasizes the basics when she talks to voters.</p><p>TITUS: I`m committed to helping them with the VA, with their Social Security, with their Medicare, with their foreclosure problem. And that`s what they need right now. It`s not the big theories or the big ideologies. It`s keeping body and soul together.</p><p>GERSH: And far from running from her vote for the Obama stimulus plan, she says it`s critical to Nevada`s future and saved jobs.</p><p>TITUS: A lot of people say the failed stimulus, the failed stimulus. Well, it saved 1800 jobs at the airport new terminal. I stood outside that at shift change one morning about 4:00 in the morning, shook a lot of hands and those were working hands and those are people who`d say, thank you. We needed to keep working.</p><p>GERSH: Joe Heck is also a doctor and his economic treatment plan begins with controlling spending.</p><p>HECK: And I think that goes back to looking at, do we need to go back to a certain year and cap spending at that level, control non-defense, discretionary spending.</p><p>GERSH: And he would remove what he calls the uncertainty over regulation and taxes.</p><p>HECK: We`ve got to make sure that we can instill confidence into those that are trying to create jobs by saying look, for a certain period of time, the `01-`03 tax cuts are going to remain in effect so you don`t have to worry about hiring somebody today only to worry about your taxes going up in January and then maybe having to let that person go in March.</p><p>GERSH: Their plans would move the country in opposite directions. But polls show this race is one of the tightest in the nation in Vegas terms, even money. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Las Vegas.</p><p>GHARIB: And here`s what we`re watching for you for next week. Our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest is Stephen Wood. He`s chief market strategist at Russell Investments. We`ll also see quarterly results from some big tech companies including Intel, Google and AMD. And then on Monday, with oil prices hovering around $80, we`ll look at what even higher crude prices could do to a very slow economic recovery.</p><p>One of the world`s biggest drug companies is getting smaller. Sanofi Aventis today announced plans to cut a quarter of the jobs in its U.S. pharmaceutical business. That works out to about 1,700 people, mostly sales reps and administrative staff. Sanofi is slashing staff and costs to better face growing challenges to its products. Three of its four top selling drugs either have or are about to have, generic competitors.</p><p>HUDSON: Blackberry maker Research in Motion and the United Arab Emirates have reached a truce before a ban of the mobile devices was to take effect there. The Emirates was planning to shut Blackberry`s email, messaging and web services on Monday, shut them down due to security issues. That would have meant big problems for half a million local users and thousands of passengers who use Dubai`s airport every day. RIMM and the UAE offered few details on how things were worked out. However it appears the reprieve is permanent.</p><p>Safety has become the strategy for stock investors. So says tonight`s \"Market Monitor.\" He`s Randall Eley, president of the Edgar Lomax Company, an investment advisory firm based in Springfield, Virginia. He joins us tonight from our Washington bureau. Randall, it`s nice to see you. Welcome back to NBR.</p><p>RANDALL ELEY, PRESIDENT, THE EDGAR LOMAX COMPANY: It is good to see you also, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: So we have seen the economy growing slightly. We have seen private payrolls that are up over the last several months. So why play it so safe?</p><p>ELEY: Because of one factor, which at first is a good factor for the value of stocks and that`s long-term interest rates. When I was last with you about six months ago, the 10-year Treasury for example was yielding about 3.8 percent. We`re down to 2.4 percent today. So on the one hand, it makes us feel better about the current prices of stocks. But on the other hand, we know the Federal Reserve will not be able to keep interest rates this low forever. So the short rate being zero.</p><p>HUDSON: Right. So with that in mind, be a one-handed investor over the next 12 to 18 months. Cautious or even pessimistic when it comes to the overall stock market?</p><p>ELEY: Cautious in the intermediate term. I would even say feeling a bit warm toward the market in the short-term, three to six months, but pessimistic over the longer term.</p><p>HUDSON: It was April Fool`s day, no coincidence however, April 1st last time you were in that chair. A couple of stocks you liked back then were Pfizer and the Traveler`s Company. Clearly big firms here, kind of a split performance. You still like these two?</p><p>ELEY: I like both of them.</p><p>HUDSON: You also brought along AT&amp;T and Merck. AT&amp;T up 8 percent, Merck down 2 percent and you`re putting new money to work in Merck, MRK. Why do you still like this drug maker here?</p><p>ELEY: Here is a company which should do well, whatever the economic environment. And you get a very high dividend yield, 4.1 percent. So you`re almost twice the 10-year Treasury and this company ought to be a cash machine.</p><p>HUDSON: Any concern about Brandon Pharmaceuticals in the pipeline?</p><p>ELEY: No. Not at all. The company is so cash rich and earning so much, their research capability should be good.</p><p>HUDSON: Lots of folks like dividends these days and you`re looking for them elsewhere in the oil market, big oil here with Chevron, CVX, you like that. The stock here has been on a nice rally lately as oil pro prices have rebounded. Also like ExxonMobil, XOM, the world`s largest company which its stock price has not been responding as its others. Why these two?</p><p>ELEY: Not yet. These are clearly the leaders or certainly among the leaders. And the fact of life is they should continue to be profitable, strong balance sheets. Also, these companies do not need government assistance to the extent we run into any future credit crisis.</p><p>HUDSON: However, what if you see the economy weakening substantially and perhaps oil prices moving lower?</p><p>ELEY: There is no doubt the earnings would fall, but that is very different from raising questions about the ability to earn money as would be the case elsewhere.</p><p>HUDSON: You`re also looking at And Johnson &amp; Johnson, not just a pharmaceutical company, but medical products across the board. The stock had fallen on hard times this summertime, but has seen a nice rebound here in the month of September and October. What`s to come?</p><p>ELEY: That`s right. With Johnson &amp; Johnson, I think we`re getting a unique opportunity to buy a good earning situation because of the recent concerns. This company has a great history of getting through crisis. And I feel comfortable they will get through this one, too.</p><p>HUDSON: It is global and it`s dividend-seeking in the short-term. You mentioned about three months, maybe, for a holding period?</p><p>ELEY: Actually, I think all of these companies at three years is probably a good holding.</p><p>HUDSON: And you have positions for your clients?</p><p>ELEY: Yes. Well, for our clients, and I also own them.</p><p>HUDSON: All right, great. Some interesting picks here. We`ll catch up in another half year or so. Tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" this evening is Randall Eley, president of the Edgar Lomax Company.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally, companies are hiring, just not enough to make a dent in the unemployment rate. One person who found work in the past couple of months is Marci Sigel. She got a job in Miami as a nurse consultant. In a continuing series that we`re calling \"You`re Hired\" Sigel tells us about her journey on and off the unemployment line.</p><p>MARCI SIGEL, LEGAL NURSE CONSULTANT: My name is Marci Sigel and I was unemployed from November until August. I was at a private school that was an exclusive environment for dyslexic kids and we would all work together how to help these kids. If there was a teaching need, I would teach a science class and then I turned into administration. Over time, with the economy, they laid me off. Every day is a full-time job to look for a job. You have to sit there and spend hours writing your cover letters, writing your resume over again, sending them out, looking at different sites all day long.</p><p>After a while, when I realized I wasn`t able to go back to a hospital because I didn`t have two years recent clinical, when I kept getting turned down in that area, I knew that I had skills that I would have to diversify with. It just popped up. And then all of a sudden a few popped up in this industry and I just sent out the resume. I knew I could do it and I made that clear. I can do this work. About three months later I got a call. And she said, I`m very sorry and I thought she was going to say we`ve hired someone else. She said, we`d like to have you come in and talk about the job. I was like, you`re kidding me. Being employed is like a holiday all the time. There is no pressure. I can have a weekend. I can have an evening. I don`t have to go see if there is a job that has been posted. I don`t have to worry about how to not show face to the kids that I`m terrified. Yeah.</p><p>HUDSON: Pretty amazing story, Susie, 150,000 Americans have gotten jobs since August. She is one of them and hopefully in the months ahead we can bring more positive stories like that.</p><p>GHARIB: I was going to say the same thing. There are 15 million Americans who could learn a lot from Marci.</p><p>HUDSON: Stay positive, stay optimistic. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Friday evening, October 8th. Thanks for joining us. Have a great weekend. I`m Tom Hudson. Have a wonderful weekend too Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Same to you, Tom. I`m Susie Gharib. Have a great weekend everyone and we hope to see all of you again on Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

We`ll hear from one analyst who says now is the time to invest certain financial firms, and from another who says stay away. It`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, July 18th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, everyone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We`re less than a week away from President Obama`s deadline for raising the government`s debt ceiling. And, Tom, today the president said he and Republican lawmakers were, quote, \"making progress\" after a series of weekend meetings.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes, Susie, with the clock clearly continues to tick, and here are the latest developments tonight as we know them. The leader of the U.S. Senate says that chamber will meet every day until Congress sends the president legislation making sure Uncle Sam does not default on its obligations.</p><p>The U.S. House, meantime, is set to pass a budget \"cut, cap, and balance\" bill tomorrow. That includes a proposed budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but credit rating agency Moody`s (NYSE: MCO) says the U.S. would be better off if the debt ceiling was eliminated entirely.</p><p>GHARIB: Now the debt showdown wasn`t the only financial topic in the nation`s capital today.

He has a strong track record of going after people and he has done it in mortgage servicing. He did it against the rating agencies. So if he can ultimately control the agency, he`ll really move it.</p><p>GERSH: That`s if he gets confirmed by the Senate, and that will be a tough battle. Republicans are demanding more oversight of the CFPB`s proposed $550 million budget and a new leadership structure, replacing a single director with a five-member board.</p><p>That`s also the position of many banks, says the Financial Services Roundtable`s Scott Talbott.</p><p>SCOTT TALBOTT, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES ROUNDTABLE: We are for creating a five-person panel. It doesn`t dilute the total power of the CFPB, it simply spreads it out. So that if an idea is a good one, then let`s have a panel agree to it. That provides the checks and the balances necessary.</p><p>GERSH: One thing seems clear, without a strong leader in place, the CFPB is off to an uncertain start.</p><p>PATRIKIS: They will be doing a lot of thinking, a lot of preparatory work for what they want to do, organizing, drafting, but nothing will be effective.</p><p>GERSH: Consumer groups endorsed Cordray, but they were clearly disappointed the president sidestepped selecting Elizabeth Warren. The CFPB was her idea, and <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>put her in charge of setting up the office, but she was considered too confrontational to have any chance of winning support from Senate Republicans.</p><p>Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: If <person><nameText>Richard Cordray </nameText></person>is confirmed, part of his job will be checking the books of big banks. And we`re going to get a better idea of how those books are doing in coming days when many report quarterly earnings. By the end of this week, 40 percent of financial firms in the S&amp;P 500 will have reported their latest numbers.</p><p>As a group, the results are expected to be downright awful. Erika Miller reports.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Banks are the heartbeat of the economy, so their health is often used as a barometer of the recovery, and the stock market.</p><p>Unfortunately for investors, bank analyst Jim Sinegal sees plenty of uncertainties ahead.</p><p>JIM SINEGAL, BANK ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: In addition to macroeconomic uncertainties, you know, with unemployment high, GDP growth slow, you know, will the banks be able to add new loans? That`s number one. Number two is the regulatory uncertainty. We are still not sure exactly where capital levels are going to fall out, and how that`s going to affect profitability.</p><p>MILLER: As for profitability, diversified financials are expected to be the worst performer this earnings season, down 94 percent. This is the group that includes Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Citi, and JPMorgan.</p><p>But there`s a catch. Take out Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), and earnings for the group are expected to rise 23 percent, better than the 8 percent gain for the overall market. Against that backdrop, analyst Jim Sinegal says now is a good time to buy select financial stocks: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB).</p><p>SINEGAL: We think if you stick to high quality names at current prices, current earnings, and with most of their capital problems behind them, you know, we think they are one of the best sectors in terms of investment opportunities.</p><p>MILLER: But Burt White of LPL Financial warns it`s too risky to buy any bank stocks now.</p><p>BURT WHITE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, LPL FINANCIAL: We think that there are way too many questions and just not enough answers, between housing and foreclosures and the euro crisis and regulatory reform. Plus, just some of the simple negatives like a flat yield curve and zero interest rates, so they can`t earn money on money market reserves.</p><p>MILLER: Those concerns have weighed on stocks in the sector. The BKX Index of bank stocks has fallen nearly 20 percent from its high back in February. And if you are thinking of buying financial stocks for their dividends, think again. In their heyday in 2007, the group yielded 3.3 percent. Now they pay out just 1.8 percent, the lowest of any industry group in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead tonight, the Murdoch mess. Rupert Murdoch`s News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is under scrutiny for questionable journalism on both sides of the Atlantic, but we`ll talk with an analyst who still likes the stock.</p><p>GHARIB: Government debt worries put investors in a selling mood today. At the close, the Dow lost 94 points, the NASDAQ fell nearly 25, the S&amp;P 500 off almost 11. Now as for volume, 871 million shares were traded here at the Big Board and just shy of 1.8 billion at the NASDAQ.</p><p>Meanwhile, all that glitters is gold. The yellow metal closed above $1,600 for the first time ever. Gold for August delivery settled at $1,602 an ounce, up $12. That`s a record in dollar terms, but below the peak reached in the 1980s, after accounting for inflation.</p><p>Big layoffs announced late today at Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO). It will lay off 6,500 workers, or about 9 percent of its full-time workforce. Analysts predicted thousands of job cuts after Cisco announced plans to reorganize back in May. The company had been losing ground in the network equipment business. Cisco says the move will cut annual expenses by about $1 billion.</p><p>HUDSON: Big Blue saw a lot of green in the second quarter. The technology company continued its recent trend of reporting better-than- expected profits. Earnings were $0.06 better than estimates. Software, services, and hardware revenue each grew by double digits, leading IBM to raise its earnings guidance for the year. Tom Smith covers Big Blue, IBM as an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor`s, and joins us tonight from New York.</p><p>Tom, strong quarter, any concerns for IBM?</p><p>THOMAS SMITH, ANALYST, STANDARD &amp; POOR`S: Well, I think it was a pretty bright quarter all around. And despite some weakness in Japan as a regional territory, Japan was weak in the aftermath of the earthquake.</p><p>HUDSON: Now we saw some of the double-digit revenue increases across the board, the backlog of service contracts is up as well. Big growth in software systems and services, which is the big money-maker. The outlook looks pretty bright, so what should shareholders be paying attention to closely.</p><p>SMITH: Well, the outlook is pretty bright. Going back to your prior question, you could tone down your enthusiasm a little bit because some of the top line reporting of revenues based on currency tailwind, nevertheless, 5 percent same currency base as revenue growth for the company overall is pretty good.</p><p>So it is looking ahead I think we have to see whether the strength in hardware can continue because they had new fresh batch of machines last September. And those are now about a year dated. And they will pull -- they pulled a lot of orders for three quarters now and that will continue, and software and services get added on to that. Can that continue for another year or so? That is one question in mind.</p><p>HUDSON: At least initially it seems like the shareholders were pretty encouraged that it can. The share price looks to pop to possibly a new high after hours, certainly it did. If that continues through tomorrow it will be close to $180 per share. What is your outlook for the stock?</p><p>SMITH: That`s right. Well, our outlook has been a strong buy going into the report, and remains a strong buy afterwards. And I was able to raise my earnings estimate and also push my 12-month target price from $196 to $205. So I`m even more optimistic, and yet the share price is improving on this. You hope that it can carry through.</p><p>One knock on IBM, sometimes it`s so big it can`t increase revenues. But they had a pretty good quarter on revenues.</p><p>HUDSON: It`s a big revenue already and seeing it grow by double digits across some of the business units. What does this mean, though? Extrapolate IBM`s performance for Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ). What does it mean for HP?</p><p>SMITH: Well, I think for HP and maybe for Dell (NASDAQ: DELL) too, a big data center conglomerate, if you will, is that there is interest in enterprises and governments and non-profits. Governments were a little bit weaker as a buying source. But as opposed to discretionary consumer hardware, the enterprise business for data centers is still pretty strong.</p><p>So that caters to quite a bit of what HP does and a lot of what Dell (NASDAQ: DELL) does. Those two, of course, are exposed to PCs, which are much more -- which have a business component and a discretionary component. That discretionary component makes those two look a little slower in that sense in terms of revenue or more volatile in their results.</p><p>HUDSON: OK. And we`ll.</p><p>SMITH: You know, part of IBM`s.</p><p>HUDSON: Well, we`ll see those in the weeks ahead, sorry for cutting you off here, time is short. A quick look at IBM after the close, there.</p><p>SMITH: Thank you.</p><p>HUDSON: Tom, we appreciate it. Tom Smith, he`s with Standard &amp; Poor`s.</p><p>Well, ahead of those IBM -- news, stocks were weak to the government debt worries continuing, in Europe and the United States. So let`s go ahead and roll out with tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>It was an 11-point drop for the S&amp;P 500, and takes the index down to the lowest level we`ve seen in a month. So let`s go ahead and take a look at the last 90 sessions. Here we are. We`re going to zoom in now with the March low remaining intact.</p><p>Here it is, on the far side of the screen. The index, though, was unable to crest above the highs that we saw during the April months, during the bounce-back that we had back in June. And we`re -- here we are at the lowest part in the past month. One area to watch clearly is the lows that we had back in June.</p><p>Technology, meantime, compare it to the past 90 sessions of the NASDAQ 100 Exchange-Traded Fund, it was down 0.5 percent today, but, look, it`s not nearly as low compared to a month ago, where it was. The tech sector has held up better in the past recent weeks compared to the broad market, thanks to this broad move higher late last month. It was the best sector today in the weak market.</p><p>The market focus clearly on IBM tomorrow after the earnings, but also on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which reports earnings after the close tomorrow. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) among the strongest technology stocks, a bit of a technology burst ourselves here on screen. This does take Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares up to a new 52-week high. It`s a 2.4 percent increase. Volume was stronger with the action pulling Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to its highest price it has ever seen.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) reportedly is close to a new deal to sell its iPhone in China. We`ll have more on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and its growth prospects on tomorrow night`s program.</p><p>How about B. of A., meantime? Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) jumping to a new high, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) stock continues sinking down to new two- year lows. B. of A. shares down another 2.8 percent, the biggest loser among the Dow Industrial Components, and the financial sector clearly weighing on the market today.</p><p>Not just big banks, it was insurance stocks as well facing some of the worst selling that we saw in the broad market. Late Friday, S&amp;P warned the credit ratings of insurers holding U.S. government debt would be in jeopardy if there is no debt deal in Washington.</p><p>Genworth falling more than 7.5 percent, a new 52-week low tonight. We`ve got Allstate (NYSE: ALL) shedding 5 percent, its lowest price since last August, and Hartford falling almost 4 percent, that is its lowest price of this year.</p><p>Between the potential push higher on mortgage rates, if there is no debt deal and the struggling job market, a look at the homebuilder confidence here, continuing to see some weakness here, off by another 1.5 percent. The Homebuilder Exchange-Traded Fund falling and now threatening some of the lows just from last month.</p><p>Also coming back to earth significantly, Delta Air Lines stock. Look at this continued push lower here, off another 4 percent. Earnings are expected tomorrow. And the stock has been trending lower really since late last year thanks to the soft patch of economic news and oil prices remaining over $90 per barrel.</p><p>Some analysts worry with no debt deal, airlines could see higher interest costs for their borrowing. Clearly some selling continuing ahead of its earnings call.</p><p>Chinese solar panel maker LDK, meantime, has faded to its lowest stock price in a year, off another 3 percent today. It is the latest Chinese firm to face questions about governance. In a report from Fitch Ratings, raised issue with the concentrated stock ownership structure as well as wild swings in profit margins, leading to the selling pressure we saw today.</p><p>Finally, it`s not often that celebrity gossip finds its way into the stock market, but retailer Kohl`s (NYSE: KSS) has plans to launch a clothing line by Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. The company says it will continue to do that. It will start in September, despite the two announcing their divorce late last week. The stock price coming off its most recent high, off about 1 percent.</p><p>And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is in for another week of scrutiny as that phone-hacking scandal escalates. Late today, Standard &amp; Poor`s ratings service put the media giant on credit watch with \"negative implications,\" saying there are increased risks related to the broadening legal issues at News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS).</p><p>Now the action comes a day before CEO Rupert Murdoch and his son, James, testify before the British Parliament tomorrow morning. But our guest tonight says News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). stock is still his top pick. Joining us now, Jason Bazinet. He is media analyst at Citigroup (NYSE: C).</p><p>Hi, Jason, nice to you have with us.</p><p>JASON BAZINET, MEDIA ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thank you so much.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s start right off with that stock. It has been down sharply since this scandal broke. And you said in a Citi report that News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is, quote, \"too compelling to ignore.\" Tell us why you are so bullish on the stock?</p><p>BAZINET: Well, there are a couple of reasons the stock is down so much. One is several weeks ago people expected News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). to consolidate all of BSkyB, and now that is not happening. That is disappointing to investors.</p><p>And second you have got this broadening scandal. But when we look at the numbers News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is trading about 10 times forward earnings. And importantly, they have about $12 billion of cash on the balance sheet. If you make that adjustment and remove the cash from their market capitalization, it`s trading closer to 6.5 times earnings. That`s too compelling to ignore.</p><p>GHARIB: What about some of the other issues that are on the worry list for investors? And we listed some of them on the screen here. Let`s take a look. One of the worries is, what if News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is forced to sell its British newspaper holdings? What if U.K. regulators force the company to sell its stakes that it already owns in BSkyB satellite? News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). could also lose its TV licenses if U.S. regulators say that News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is no longer fit to own American television properties.</p><p>There is a question about leadership change at the top. If Rupert Murdoch steps down or is kicked out as CEO. And what -- you know, will any of the senior execs be indicted or go to jail? So what impact do these issues have? What are the financial implications?</p><p>BAZINET: Well, if I can remember that list, let me try and go through them. The disposition of the newspaper assets in the U.K. is really inconsequential. News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). does 4.5 million nominally of operating income a year. Those assets do about 70 million. So we`re talking about less than 2 percent of the operating income. And to the Street they`re a distraction. So if those end up getting sold, it doesn`t really matter.</p><p>The second risk you mentioned, I believe, was the potential disposition of the 39 percent stake they have in BSkyB.</p><p>GHARIB: BSkyB, right.</p><p>BAZINET: Yes. You know, the Street likes that asset, but at the end of the day if they end up selling that asset, something is going to have to happen to that 12 billion of cash that was sitting on the balance sheet that was going to be used to buy in the rest of BSkyB. So not only will News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). holders get cash for the sale of the 39 percent stake, but that other 12 billion will come back to equity holders. And that is why I focused on that, you know, mid single-digit P/E ex the cash.</p><p>The TV station sale, I think, was the third risk you mentioned. You know, the Street likes the TV station business. They have got retransmission fees coming. The reality of, I think, this risk is actually quite low. There was a case that took place in the 1960s. RKO got into some trouble with the government. They didn`t end up disposing of all of their assets, even though the FCC told them to, until 1990. I mean, it really was decades in the making.</p><p>So I don`t think that is a real near-term risk. But, again, even if it is, you are going to see more cash come into News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). The cash balance will rise by another $5 billion or so. So I don`t think it is a major risk.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. So a lot of good money aspects to it. But what about if Rupert Murdoch steps down as CEO, is that a positive or a negative for the company?</p><p>BAZINET: Well, John Malone, who is another CEO of another media company, was once asked about Rupert Murdoch`s mortality and succession planning. And he somewhat famously quipped: \"half of News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). shareholders are afraid Rupert Murdoch will live and the other half are afraid he will die.\"</p><p>What he meant by that was people think Mr. Murdoch is an intelligent man, but there have been times in the past when he has, at least in the eyes of shareholders, misallocated capital. So changing the guard, again, I think is sort of a mixed bag. It doesn`t necessarily mean it`s negative for News.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Very interesting information. We`ll see what happens tomorrow at those hearings in the U.K. Parliament. Thank you so much, Jason.</p><p>BAZINET: Very good. Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: And we`ve been speaking with Jason Bazinet, he`s media analyst at Citigroup (NYSE: C).</p><p>HUDSON: Here is what we are watching for tomorrow. We`ve got another check on the housing sector due in, the June numbers on housing starts and building permits. Plenty of earnings as well, a couple from all-American brands Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and Harley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG).</p><p>And a couple of big tech giants reporting too. We`ll see how the iPad is adding to Apple`s bottom line and whether Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO)! is gaining ground in the world of Internet search advertising.</p><p>GHARIB: Borders bookstore plans to write its last chapter this week after a weekend deadline passed without a bidder to keep it in business. Late today, Borders said it will ask a judge to approve its liquidation on Thursday. It will begin on Friday and wrap up by September.</p><p>Borders employs nearly 11,000 people. The company blames its demise on changes in the book industry and the popularity of the e-reader.</p><p>HUDSON: Speaking about downsizing your car for something with better gas mileage, you may save a little money by waiting a little longer. According to Kelley Blue Book, the average price of a new compact car cost a record $20,500 last month, but it is expected to fall to about $19,300 by the end of the year. They see a similar trend with used cars too, dropping from over $11,000 down to under $10,000.</p><p>The debate over the debt ceiling can also be seen as the latest blame game. There is a lot of finger-pointing going, but still no deal. Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden.</p><p>JARED BERNSTEIN, SENIOR FELLOW, CENTER ON BUDGET AND POLICY PRIORITIES : The last time I offered a commentary here, I began by observing that the current debate over economic policy is generating a lot more heat than light.</p><p>Since then, it has gotten much hotter and a lot darker. If Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling by August 2nd, just a few days from now, we could end up taking an economic hit as devastating as it is avoidable. That`s right, this wound will be self-inflicted. How did it come to this? The answer is politics, and it`s an ugly, destabilizing politics of a type we haven`t seen in this country for many years.</p><p>Ask yourself, are House Republicans refusing to countenance any budget deal that includes tax revenues from closing a break for buyers of private jets because they think it`s bad economics? Or is it because almost every one of them signed the Grover Norquist pledge that they would never raise taxes under any circumstances?</p><p>In a sense, it`s a trivial example. Closing that loophole would have virtually no effect at all on our long-term budget deficit. But in another sense, it`s the crux of the matter. Fierce partisanship is one thing, and it`s clearly part of the American political landscape.</p><p>We have profound differences and a political system that allows those differences to be both heard and embodied in our policies. But at the end of the day, our history shows that partisans compromise in the interest of preserving the common good. Those who refuse to do so have no place in this debate.</p><p>They are not legislators, working with their opponents to hammer out the best deal for both their constituents and the nation. They`re pledge- takers who are threatening to abandon the common good for narrow self- interest. And that must not stand.</p><p>I`m Jared Bernstein.</p><p>HUDSON: Obviously there`s a lot here to be said and Jared won`t have the last word on the debt debate. In the coming days and weeks, we`ll continue to bring you thoughts and views from all sides.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, hold on to your cell phones if you plan to visit Miami, New York, or Los Angeles. According to a recent study by mobile security company Lookout, those are the three top cities for cell phone loss or theft. The remainder of the list spans coast to coast. It includes Phoenix, Sacramento, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, and Tampa.</p><p>Basically everywhere, Tom. And pools, taxis, and airplanes are the top three worst places to lose your cell phone. And that`s why I always have mine right next to me so I don`t lose it, can`t live without it.</p><p>HUDSON: Top of my list, toddlers, a tough place to lose a cell phone as well, toddlers.</p><p>GHARIB: That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, July 18th. I`m Susie Gharib. Have a great evening, everyone.</p><p>You too, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: You, as well, Susie.</p><p>I`m Tom Hudson. Good night, thanks for joining us this evening. We`ll see you right back here tomorrow.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.<br/>\u00a0<br/>PAUL KANGAS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: In computers, two plus four equals one. The number two and number four computer makers, Compaq (CPQ)and Hewlett Packard (HP), are merging to become the world's number one PC seller. Good evening, I'm Paul Kangas in Miami.<br/>\u00a0<br/>SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: I'm Susie Gharib, in New York City. I talked with the CEOs of both firms to get their take on the deal. My interview with Carly Fiorina and Michael Capellas coming up.</p><p>And good economic news gave Wall Street a big boost, but the rally fizzled. By the closing bell, the Dow gained 47 points; and the NASDAQ lost 34.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Good evening, everyone. A mega merger in the computer industry: Hewlett Packard is buying Compaq Computer for $25 billion, creating the world's biggest maker of personal computers. The reaction on Wall Street was skeptical. Both stocks fell sharply on the news. We have two reports this evening, a look at details of the deal, and the regulatory issues. We begin with Scott Gurvey on Wall Street.<br/> \u00a0<br/>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The companies say this is a great deal, but Wall Street is not convinced. Hewlett-Packard plus Compaq, using year 2000 figures, would mean $91.2 billion in sales, $4.3 billion in net income and 159,800 employees. It would be the number one worldwide maker of personal computers, and it would come within a hairs- breadth of IBM (IBM) in revenue. So why did HP shares fall a whopping 19 percent in today's trading, while Compaq shares lost 10 percent on the news?<br/> \u00a0<br/>SHEBLY SEYRAFI, ENTERPRISE ANALYST, A.G. EDWARDS: When you have companies like Compaq and Hewlett, which have problems already in each company, just because you get them together doesn't mean you're going to a solve a lot of these problems.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GURVEY: The problems include a historic sales slump. Wall Street is asking if it makes sense to create a company number one in sales for a \"comoditized\" product?<br/>\u00a0<br/>CARLY FIORINA, CEO, HEWLETT-PACKARD: I think this deal perhaps makes particularly sense - particularly good sense in tough times for technology, because what those tough times are illustrating clearly is that there is an opportunity to get more cost effective and efficient.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GURVEY: Getting cost effective will mean a 10 percent cut in jobs, and even then analysts wonder if a combined Hewlett Packard can match the industry's low cost producer.<br/>\u00a0<br/>STEVEN FORTUNA, PC ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: There's going to be distraction issues around this acquisition and integration effort that could benefit Dell in the short medium term, because they're going to be keeping to their knitting whereas these guys are more about integrating their very complex business areas.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GURVEY: Integrating two giants into a colossus is always difficult. Compaq's CEO Says it can be done.<br/>\u00a0<br/>MICHAEL CAPELLAS, CEO, COMPAQ: The economics are clear, the strategic fit is clear, will the chemistry and the culture work? And when you could actually watch it is when you can sort of say, \"yes, this is actually going to work.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>GURVEY: Analysts say more deals in the sector are likely, although they will be due more to necessity than to opportunity.<br/>\u00a0<br/>MEAN GRAHAM-HACKETT, COMPUTER ANALYST, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S: I think that it's a deal that needed to be done to take out excess capacity in the PC and server industry. But I don't think the combined entity is a much stronger player than they would have been on their own six months ago.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GURVEY: The companies hope to close the deal in the first half of next year. Scott Gurvey, \"NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT,\" New York.<br/>\u00a0<br/>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This is Darren Gersh in Washington. Weeks ago, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq set up a special committee to study the anti- trust issues raised by this high-tech marriage. And after careful review, HP CEO Carly Fiorina says she's confident there will be no surprises like the European Commission's decision to block the GE (GE)-Honeywell (HON) merger. To begin with, this is a different deal in a very different industry.<br/>\u00a0<br/>CARLY FIORINI, CEO, HEWLETT PACKARD: This is an industry with millions of customers, not a couple. It is an industry with very low barriers to entry, particularly the PC and low end of the server business. It's an industry with intense competition.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GERSH: If approved, HP's deal to buy Compaq will create the industry's leading consumer brand, with a 19 percent share of worldwide computer sales-Dell (DELL) is second with 14 percent, IBM Next at 7 percent. For servers the combined HP would command would command an even larger sharet, 31 percent, versus 25 percent for IBM and 15 percent for Sun Microsystems (SUNW). Numbers like that will surely raise red flags with antitrust regulators in the US And Europe, but former Justice Department official, Will Tom, does not think his former colleagues will be mesmerized by market share. Even in the server market, Tom says there is fierce competition.<br/>\u00a0<br/>WILL TOM, ANTITRUST ATTORNEY, MORGAN, LEWIS &amp; BOCKIUS: The operating systems on which they run are out there and so there aren't a lot of barriers that would keep either existing competitors from expanding, or new competitors from penetrating that space.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GERSH: Compaq and Hewlett Packard dominate PC sales at retail stores, but the companies argue competition from the Internet will keep prices down. Rapidly changing technology may also reassure regulators that competition will not be harmed.<br/>\u00a0<br/>CHRISTOPHER KELLY, ANTITRUST LAWYER, KAYE SCHOLER LLP: It is very, very difficult to know what the industry is going to be like, let alone who is going to be in it two years from now.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GERSH: But antitrust experts say the technology involved in this merger is complex, and may extend the time it takes regulators to review the deal. Darren Gersh, \"NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT,\" Washington.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: Stocks on Wall Street opened modestly lower due to some carryover selling from last week's 4.5 percent drop in the Dow and 5.8 percent tumble in the NASDAQ index. At the outset of trading, the Dow fell 50 points and the NASDAQ 15 points before the market steadied and then firmed up as that massive Hewlett/Packard-Compaq Computer combination seemed to stir some bullish enthusiasm. By 10:00 AM, The Dow posted a 15-point gain and NASDAQ cut its loss to four points. Then came the release of the National Purchasing Management's August manufacturing Activity Index which showed marked improvement in production and new orders, suggesting a number of industries are starting to recover. Judging by the spirited stock rally which followed, that was the news Wall Street wanted to hear. By 12:30 PM, The Industrial average was sporting a 212 point, or 2.1 percent, gain at the 10,160 level and the NASDAQ index was up 24 points or 1.3 percent. The rally topped out in the afternoon partly due to a less than impressive advance decline ratio and trading. Hardly helping were sizeable losses in both Hewlett Packard and Compaq stocks. The Dow industrial average saw its closing gain slashed to only 47.74 putting it a 9997.49. The NASDAQ index closed with a loss of 34.65 or 1.9 percent. Now stands at 1770.78.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Big board - well, here we go to the Dow Transports Index up 22.24.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The Utility Index up 1.73, but not as good as they were during the day.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The Closing Tick just barely bullish at +177.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Standard &amp; Poor's 500 down .64.<br/>\u00a0<br/>And the S&amp;P 100 up .64..<br/>\u00a0<br/>The MidCap 400 down 1.52.<br/>\u00a0<br/>And a loss of 1.20 in the CRB Bridge Futures Price Index a gain of nearly 13/4 in the New York Stock Exchange<br/>\u00a0<br/>Composite Index<br/>\u00a0<br/>Value Line down 1.28.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The Russell2000 Small Cap off 160.<br/>\u00a0<br/>And the Wilshire 5000 lost just over 9 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Bond prices posted sharp losses today mostly because that unexpectedly strong Purchasing Manager's report brightened hopes for a comeback in the economy while dimming the prospects for more interest rate cuts. Also this market was very vulnerable to profit taking after last week's strong advance which sent some yields to the lowest levels in about two years.<br/>\u00a0<br/>At the close tax free and corporate issues were down 3/4 to one full point.<br/>\u00a0<br/>And most Treasuries were down even more than that, not the 5-year notes but down 20/32 nevertheless.<br/>\u00a0<br/>A one point loss in the 10-year notes<br/>\u00a0<br/>And the Bellwether 30-year bond down 1 22/32.<br/>\u00a0<br/>And finally the Lehman Brothers Long-Term Treasury Bond Index down 27 1/10 point. Big loss there.<br/>\u00a0<br/>I'll be back shortly to show you where the action was on Wall Street today. Susie.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Thanks, Paul.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Back now to our top story, that $25 billion merger between Hewlett- Packard and Compaq. Earlier today, I talked to the CEOs of both companies. I began by asking Carly Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard why she did the deal.<br/>\u00a0<br/>CARLY FIORINA, CEO, HEWLETT-PACKARD: We're doing this deal because the technology landscape is changing fundamentally and has been for a couple of years now. Customers are demanding different things of their I.T. partners, and I mean consumers as well as businesses. And if you look at the power of these two companies together-and we've looked at it very carefully-it's clear that we can deliver a much improved value proposition to customers and we're creating, we think, a game changing move here.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Mr. Capellas, what is Compaq getting out of the deal? It's obviously not a merger of equals. The new company is going to be called Hewlett-Packard and you're going to be the number two person in charge.<br/>\u00a0<br/>MICHAEL CAPELLAS, CEO, COMPAQ: If you look at the combination of first the products and the markets we serve, there is an unbelievable national synergy. We have high end computation. We have great Web servers. There's a great storage play that comes together. There is a UNIX play. There's software that brings it together. The products are complementary.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In terms of number two, I'm absolutely comfortable with making this contribution. I am absolutely comfortable with the relationship. I absolutely intend to stay on and do what I can and-<br/>\u00a0<br/>FIORINA: And I'm delighted to have him as a partner, absolutely delighted.<br/>\u00a0<br/>CAPELLAS: This is a-yes, this is honestly not an issue. As long as we serve employees and serve customers, I'm in good shape.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Is it fair to say that Compaq couldn't make it alone?<br/>\u00a0<br/>CAPELLAS: I would argue that we had put an awful lot of the tough work behind us. We've gone through a very fast and effective cost reduction program. We worked very quickly to get our distribution model in good shape. And so, and, in fact, what you're seeing is because we're both making progress towards where we want to go, that made this possible to do. So I don't think we would be here at all if we weren't actually sort of headed down a common path.<br/>\u00a0<br/>FIORINA: I also think, Susie, if I may, each of these companies individually were strong companies.<br/>\u00a0<br/>CAPELLAS: Absolutely.<br/>\u00a0<br/>FIORINA: Good balance sheets, lots of scope and scale, wonderful employees. This is about a game changer.<br/>\u00a0<br/>CAPELLAS: Absolutely.<br/>\u00a0<br/>FIORINA: We are changing the game and we are playing to win, and that's why we've done this.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Well, execution. One of the big questions is how are you going to put together two massive companies, two companies that are facing strategic and tactical challenges and in an economic climate that's also very challenging? And yet you're so confident.<br/>\u00a0<br/>FIORINA: Well, I think we are confident we can do this and we are also sober about what it takes to do it. And by the way, I think the fact that we're sober makes us confident. There's no question there's a lot of work to do here. But the first thing you've got to know is we have planned it out pretty carefully. In fact, we had done detailed business plans and detailed integration plans before we ever called the first banker. And the reason we did that is because we wanted to be sure are we aligned in terms of the value drivers of this combination? We've thought about it, we've planned it, we have the key people in place, we have the key decisions already made. And so we think we are in a position when we get regulatory approval to execute with that discipline and speed and decisiveness. And we recognize we're going to have to prove that to people.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Mr. Capellas, you know how hard it is to put together two big tech companies. I mean some people would say that the Compaq/Digital Equipment merger was not all that successful. What are you confident about this deal?<br/>\u00a0<br/>CAPELLAS: What you have to look at is when you see the compelling opportunities and the vision to really become a value leading company in the industry, you have a compelling vision to get there. This is not about what the two are doing individually. It's about collectively the growth opportunities you have. And as you look forward to the industry, this industry will grow. Growth will come back and when it does, this is a powerful, compelling vision. The second one is, I think you've got some lessons learned and I think you have to apply those lessons learned, which is be decisive, stay absolutely consistent to your road map and move forward.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Wall Street is saying that this deal is fraught with risk. What do you think is the biggest risk, Ms. Fiorina?<br/>\u00a0<br/>FIORINA: Well, I think clearly execution is a risk. Now, we think we have mitigated that risk by planning for it carefully and, indeed, I think Michael deservedly gets credit for having completed the acquisition of Digital in an effective way. And so we are learning the lessons Michael learned and applying them.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: The Wall Street reaction has been very skeptical, both of your stocks suffering on the news. What is Wall Street missing here?<br/>\u00a0<br/>CAPELLAS: Well, I think the first place is this is a really big deal and it has, you know, huge, huge implications for the industry. And so I think, as Carly absolutely said, is in a tough market people are going to take a little time to look at the news, to digest it and to understand it overall.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Investors are already looking at Hewlett Packard itself with some creditability issues. How are you going to sell this deal to shareholders?<br/>\u00a0<br/>FIORINA: Well, we're going to sell it by being clear around why we did it, clear around what the value is both in terms of the bottom line and the top line, and clear, as well, in terms of the execution and then we're going to go do it.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Thank you both very much. Good luck to you.<br/>\u00a0<br/>FIORINA: Thanks.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Miss Fiorina, Michael Capellas, thank you very much.<br/>\u00a0<br/>CAPELLAS: Thank you so much.<br/>\u00a0<br/>FIORINA: Thanks.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: What a rally-and then what a sell-off. It was bad in both directions, depending on how you stand in the market. But the Dow up only 47 3/4 points after being up well over 200. The advance/decline ratio none too impressive, about 8 to 7 in favor of advancers. 153 new yearly highs, though. Only 76 new lows.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Compaq (CPQ) topped the active list on 57.2 million shares. It traded as low as $10.75 and finally closed at $11.08. That stock swap with Hewlett- Packard (HWP) is worth about $12 as of today and that's, of course, after Hewlett's stock dropped $4.34.<br/> \u00a0<br/>Then Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), the big point gainer in the Dow, up $3.44, the company claiming its new Cortistent reduces to zero the chances of arteries reclogging. That's known as restenosis.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GE (GE) down $0.15.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Providian Financial (PVN) had a bad day, down $8.70. The company sees third quarter earnings coming in at $0.82 to $0.84, the Street expecting $0.89. The company also says 2002 earnings will be lower than expected. Banc of America and First Boston among<br/>\u00a0<br/>just a few brokerages to downgrade the stock.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Lucent (LU) down $0.30.<br/>\u00a0<br/>AOL Time Warner (AOL) moved up $0.15.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Nokia (NOK) a $0.74 loss.<br/>\u00a0<br/>And then the NASDAQ Cubes (QQ) down $1.16.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Citigroup, tenth in volume, was up $0.41.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Royal Ahold (AHO), this is the huge Dutch grocery chain owner, down $1.59 on news the company is going to buy Alient Exchange.

Susie?<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Thanks, Paul.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Faster is better for Motorola (MOT). The communications equipment maker has developed a semiconductor that runs 35 times faster than today's models. The new technology combines silicon for durability with crystals for high speed. But getting it to the market won't be speedy. Motorola says don't expect to see products with the new chip for at least two years.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: Tomorrow, a look at the future of radio. Here's a hint, think digital.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Sales continue to downshift at the nation's big three auto makers. General Motors (GM) posted a drop in sales of just over 7 1/2 percent. Its biggest loss came in sales of passenger cars. They were down 20 percent. But GM Is sticking with third quarter production estimates of more than a million vehicles. Ford (F) sales dropped a less than expected 8 1/2 percent. Analysts were looking for sales to fall as much as 20 percent. Ford, like G.M., saw its greatest weakness in car sales, down 16 percent. But truck sales were almost break even with its F150 pickup truck posting its best monthly sales ever.<br/>\u00a0<br/>And sales at Daimler Chrysler (DAJ) fell 24 percent last month, much worse than expectations of a decline of 15 to 20 percent. But last year's August sales numbers were the company's best ever, and they were helped by huge incentives on discontinued models.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: Employees of Boeing (BA) are unpacking boxes and finding the supply rooms today at their new corporate headquarters in Chicago. The airplane maker opened for business this morning. The official ceremonies will come tomorrow. Boeing moved to Chicago after 85 years in Seattle, making the switch to a downtown skyscraper in what the company says was record time.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: In the current market, just finding a mutual fund with a positive return is a triumph. So would you believe that tonight we'll be talking about a fund that has a strong double digit return for the year to date? That fund is Boston Partners Small Cap Value Fund II, and while it's been down in recent weeks, it's still up almost 40 percent since January and up 54 percent over the last full year. Since its inception three years ago, the portfolio manager of Boston Partners Small Cap Value Fund II has been David Dabora, and he joins us now from San Francisco. David, welcome to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.<br/>\u00a0<br/>DAVID DABORA, BOSTON PARTNERS SMALL CAP VALUE FUND II: Thank you, Paul.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: First, how have you managed to run up a record like that in a market like this?<br/>\u00a0<br/>DABORA: Well, we've had good stock selection, which has been a direct result of our value oriented investment philosophy and process at Boston Partners.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: What are some of criteria that you use?<br/>\u00a0<br/>DABORA: We're looking for undervalued stock, stocks selling at a discount to their intrinsic value, companies with sound business fundamentals and a catalyst to unlock that value that we see in those stocks.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: Are you still finding some bargains among the small cap sector?<br/>\u00a0<br/>DABORA: Yes, we are. We, a couple of the larger holdings in the portfolio, Navigate Consulting , a consulting company based out of Chicago, business is getting better, sales at 11 times earnings, very attractive.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: Give us some of the trading symbols there of these stocks you like, and the largest holdings.<br/>\u00a0<br/>DABORA: Yes, Navigate Consulting ticker is (NCI). We also like Apria Health Care Group. It's in the home service, the home health care service area. The ticker is (AHG). And we like a small retailer, Pier One Imports, ticker (PIR).<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: Very good. You know, you have now almost a quarter of a billion dollars in assets in the fund. And I believe the fund is still open to new investors. But do you have any plans to close it any time soon?<br/>\u00a0<br/>DABORA: The fund is still open. We would anticipate closing it about year end at approximately $500 million under management.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: Finally, David, what about the tech stocks? I mean we saw a nice rally today which faded badly. Are there are still some bargains there? Are you considering them?<br/>\u00a0<br/>DABORA: Yes. We've had some exposure in the tech area. About 10 percent of the portfolio is in the tech area. A name that we own in the portfolio is Network Associates (NETA) and we plan on finding further bargains as the market avails itself.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: OK. Give us a few more that you like in the tech area. There are so many that have been hit hard. We've got about 20 seconds left.<br/>\u00a0<br/>DABORA: Yes. PC-Tel, a soft modem manufacturer, ticker (PCTI), we like. American Management Systems, an I.T. company, ticker (AMSY). We like that one, as well.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: All right, David, thanks very much for being with us.<br/>\u00a0<br/>DABORA: Thank you.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: And continued good luck.<br/>\u00a0<br/>DABORA: Thank you.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: My guest David Dabora of Boston Partners Small Cap Value Fund II.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GHARIB: And recapping today's market action, the Dow gains 47 points, the NASDAQ loses 34.<br/>\u00a0<br/>And please be sure to join us at our World Wide Web site, nbr.com. And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, September 4. I'm Susie Gharib. Good night, everyone. And good night to you, Paul.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KANGAS: Good night, Susie. I'm Paul Kangas wishing all of you the best of good buys.<br/>\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBR-R090401cb118</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">nitbus2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:43X4-28X0-008R-X312-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142705</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4074\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Nightly Business Report</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Community Television Foundation\u00a0 of South Florida, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>September 4, 2001 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>\u00a0INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0MERRILL LYNCH &amp;

We'll hear from one analyst who says now is the time to invest certain financial firms, and from another who says stay away. It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, July 18th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, everyone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're less than a week away from <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>deadline for raising the government's debt ceiling. And, Tom, today the president said he and Republican lawmakers were, quote, \"making progress\" after a series of weekend meetings.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes, Susie, with the clock clearly continues to tick, and here are the latest developments tonight as we know them. The leader of the U.S. Senate says that chamber will meet every day until Congress sends the president legislation making sure Uncle Sam does not default on its obligations.</p><p>The U.S. House, meantime, is set to pass a budget \"cut, cap, and balance\" bill tomorrow. That includes a proposed budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but credit rating agency Moody's (NYSE: MCO) says the U.S. would be better off if the debt ceiling was eliminated entirely.</p><p>GHARIB: Now the debt showdown wasn't the only financial topic in the nation's capital today. The president nominated <person><nameText>Richard Cordray </nameText></person>to be the nation's top consumer loan advocate.</p><p>Darren Gersh has details.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The president vowed to fight back against what he called an army of lobbyists trying to weaken the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The agency was created to fight lending abuses that the president says were a leading cause of the financial crisis.</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are not just going to shrug our shoulders and hope it doesn't happen again. We're not going to go back to the status quo, where consumers couldn't count on getting protections that they deserve. We're not going to go back to a time when our whole economy was vulnerable to a massive financial crisis.</p><p>GERSH: To make sure that doesn't happen, the president nominated <person><nameText>Richard Cordray </nameText></person>to be the CFPB's first director. As Ohio<person><nameText>attorney general, Cordray </nameText></person>aggressively attacked fraudulent foreclosures.</p><p>Ernie Patrikis, an expert in banking regulation, says Cordray is a tough adversary.</p><p>ERNIE PATRIKIS, PARTNER, WHITE &amp; CASE: He is not going to be a very easy fellow for some companies to get along with. He has a strong track record of going after people and he has done it in mortgage servicing. He did it against the rating agencies. So if he can ultimately control the agency, he'll really move it.</p><p>GERSH: That's if he gets confirmed by the Senate, and that will be a tough battle. Republicans are demanding more oversight of the CFPB's proposed $550 million budget and a new leadership structure, replacing a single director with a five-member board.</p><p>That's also the position of many banks, says the Financial Services Roundtable's Scott Talbott.</p><p>SCOTT TALBOTT, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES ROUNDTABLE: We are for creating a five-person panel. It doesn't dilute the total power of the CFPB, it simply spreads it out. So that if an idea is a good one, then let's have a panel agree to it. That provides the checks and the balances necessary.</p><p>GERSH: One thing seems clear, without a strong leader in place, the CFPB is off to an uncertain start.</p><p>PATRIKIS: They will be doing a lot of thinking, a lot of preparatory work for what they want to do, organizing, drafting, but nothing will be effective.</p><p>GERSH: Consumer groups endorsed Cordray, but they were clearly disappointed the president sidestepped selecting Elizabeth Warren. The CFPB was her idea, and <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>put her in charge of setting up the office, but she was considered too confrontational to have any chance of winning support from Senate Republicans.</p><p>Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: If <person><nameText>Richard Cordray </nameText></person>is confirmed, part of his job will be checking the books of big banks. And we're going to get a better idea of how those books are doing in coming days when many report quarterly earnings. By the end of this week, 40 percent of financial firms in the S&amp;P 500 will have reported their latest numbers.</p><p>As a group, the results are expected to be downright awful. Erika Miller reports.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Banks are the heartbeat of the economy, so their health is often used as a barometer of the recovery, and the stock market.</p><p>Unfortunately for investors, bank analyst Jim Sinegal sees plenty of uncertainties ahead.</p><p>JIM SINEGAL, BANK ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: In addition to macroeconomic uncertainties, you know, with unemployment high, GDP growth slow, you know, will the banks be able to add new loans? That's number one. Number two is the regulatory uncertainty. We are still not sure exactly where capital levels are going to fall out, and how that's going to affect profitability.</p><p>MILLER: As for profitability, diversified financials are expected to be the worst performer this earnings season, down 94 percent. This is the group that includes Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Citi, and JPMorgan.</p><p>But there's a catch. Take out Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), and earnings for the group are expected to rise 23 percent, better than the 8 percent gain for the overall market. Against that backdrop, analyst Jim Sinegal says now is a good time to buy select financial stocks: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB).</p><p>SINEGAL: We think if you stick to high quality names at current prices, current earnings, and with most of their capital problems behind them, you know, we think they are one of the best sectors in terms of investment opportunities.</p><p>MILLER: But Burt White of LPL Financial warns it's too risky to buy any bank stocks now.</p><p>BURT WHITE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, LPL FINANCIAL: We think that there are way too many questions and just not enough answers, between housing and foreclosures and the euro crisis and regulatory reform. Plus, just some of the simple negatives like a flat yield curve and zero interest rates, so they can't earn money on money market reserves.</p><p>MILLER: Those concerns have weighed on stocks in the sector. The BKX Index of bank stocks has fallen nearly 20 percent from its high back in February. And if you are thinking of buying financial stocks for their dividends, think again. In their heyday in 2007, the group yielded 3.3 percent. Now they pay out just 1.8 percent, the lowest of any industry group in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead tonight, the Murdoch mess. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is under scrutiny for questionable journalism on both sides of the Atlantic, but we'll talk with an analyst who still likes the stock.</p><p>GHARIB: Government debt worries put investors in a selling mood today. At the close, the Dow lost 94 points, the NASDAQ fell nearly 25, the S&amp;P 500 off almost 11. Now as for volume, 871 million shares were traded here at the Big Board and just shy of 1.8 billion at the NASDAQ.</p><p>Meanwhile, all that glitters is gold. The yellow metal closed above $1,600 for the first time ever. Gold for August delivery settled at $1,602 an ounce, up $12. That's a record in dollar terms, but below the peak reached in the 1980s, after accounting for inflation.</p><p>Big layoffs announced late today at Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO). It will lay off 6,500 workers, or about 9 percent of its full-time workforce. Analysts predicted thousands of job cuts after Cisco announced plans to reorganize back in May. The company had been losing ground in the network equipment business. Cisco says the move will cut annual expenses by about $1 billion.</p><p>HUDSON: Big Blue saw a lot of green in the second quarter. The technology company continued its recent trend of reporting better-than- expected profits. Earnings were $0.06 better than estimates. Software, services, and hardware revenue each grew by double digits, leading IBM to raise its earnings guidance for the year. Tom Smith covers Big Blue, IBM as an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, and joins us tonight from New York.</p><p>Tom, strong quarter, any concerns for IBM?</p><p>THOMAS SMITH, ANALYST, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S: Well, I think it was a pretty bright quarter all around. And despite some weakness in Japan as a regional territory, Japan was weak in the aftermath of the earthquake.</p><p>HUDSON: Now we saw some of the double-digit revenue increases across the board, the backlog of service contracts is up as well. Big growth in software systems and services, which is the big money-maker. The outlook looks pretty bright, so what should shareholders be paying attention to closely.</p><p>SMITH: Well, the outlook is pretty bright. Going back to your prior question, you could tone down your enthusiasm a little bit because some of the top line reporting of revenues based on currency tailwind, nevertheless, 5 percent same currency base as revenue growth for the company overall is pretty good.</p><p>So it is looking ahead I think we have to see whether the strength in hardware can continue because they had new fresh batch of machines last September. And those are now about a year dated. And they will pull -- they pulled a lot of orders for three quarters now and that will continue, and software and services get added on to that. Can that continue for another year or so? That is one question in mind.</p><p>HUDSON: At least initially it seems like the shareholders were pretty encouraged that it can. The share price looks to pop to possibly a new high after hours, certainly it did. If that continues through tomorrow it will be close to $180 per share. What is your outlook for the stock?</p><p>SMITH: That's right. Well, our outlook has been a strong buy going into the report, and remains a strong buy afterwards. And I was able to raise my earnings estimate and also push my 12-month target price from $196 to $205. So I'm even more optimistic, and yet the share price is improving on this. You hope that it can carry through.</p><p>One knock on IBM, sometimes it's so big it can't increase revenues. But they had a pretty good quarter on revenues.</p><p>HUDSON: It's a big revenue already and seeing it grow by double digits across some of the business units. What does this mean, though? Extrapolate IBM's performance for Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ). What does it mean for HP?</p><p>SMITH: Well, I think for HP and maybe for Dell (NASDAQ: DELL) too, a big data center conglomerate, if you will, is that there is interest in enterprises and governments and non-profits. Governments were a little bit weaker as a buying source. But as opposed to discretionary consumer hardware, the enterprise business for data centers is still pretty strong.</p><p>So that caters to quite a bit of what HP does and a lot of what Dell (NASDAQ: DELL) does. Those two, of course, are exposed to PCs, which are much more -- which have a business component and a discretionary component. That discretionary component makes those two look a little slower in that sense in terms of revenue or more volatile in their results.</p><p>HUDSON: OK. And we'll.</p><p>SMITH: You know, part of IBM's.</p><p>HUDSON: Well, we'll see those in the weeks ahead, sorry for cutting you off here, time is short. A quick look at IBM after the close, there.</p><p>SMITH: Thank you.</p><p>HUDSON: Tom, we appreciate it. Tom Smith, he's with Standard &amp; Poor's.</p><p>Well, ahead of those IBM -- news, stocks were weak to the government debt worries continuing, in Europe and the United States. So let's go ahead and roll out with tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>It was an 11-point drop for the S&amp;P 500, and takes the index down to the lowest level we've seen in a month. So let's go ahead and take a look at the last 90 sessions. Here we are. We're going to zoom in now with the March low remaining intact.</p><p>Here it is, on the far side of the screen. The index, though, was unable to crest above the highs that we saw during the April months, during the bounce-back that we had back in June. And we're -- here we are at the lowest part in the past month. One area to watch clearly is the lows that we had back in June.</p><p>Technology, meantime, compare it to the past 90 sessions of the NASDAQ 100 Exchange-Traded Fund, it was down 0.5 percent today, but, look, it's not nearly as low compared to a month ago, where it was. The tech sector has held up better in the past recent weeks compared to the broad market, thanks to this broad move higher late last month. It was the best sector today in the weak market.</p><p>The market focus clearly on IBM tomorrow after the earnings, but also on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which reports earnings after the close tomorrow. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) among the strongest technology stocks, a bit of a technology burst ourselves here on screen. This does take Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares up to a new 52-week high. It's a 2.4 percent increase. Volume was stronger with the action pulling Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to its highest price it has ever seen.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) reportedly is close to a new deal to sell its iPhone in China. We'll have more on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and its growth prospects on tomorrow night's program.</p><p>How about B. of A., meantime? Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) jumping to a new high, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) stock continues sinking down to new two- year lows. B. of A. shares down another 2.8 percent, the biggest loser among the Dow Industrial Components, and the financial sector clearly weighing on the market today.</p><p>Not just big banks, it was insurance stocks as well facing some of the worst selling that we saw in the broad market. Late Friday, S&amp;P warned the credit ratings of insurers holding U.S. government debt would be in jeopardy if there is no debt deal in Washington.</p><p>Genworth falling more than 7.5 percent, a new 52-week low tonight. We've got Allstate (NYSE: ALL) shedding 5 percent, its lowest price since last August, and Hartford falling almost 4 percent, that is its lowest price of this year.</p><p>Between the potential push higher on mortgage rates, if there is no debt deal and the struggling job market, a look at the homebuilder confidence here, continuing to see some weakness here, off by another 1.5 percent. The Homebuilder Exchange-Traded Fund falling and now threatening some of the lows just from last month.</p><p>Also coming back to earth significantly, Delta Air Lines stock. Look at this continued push lower here, off another 4 percent. Earnings are expected tomorrow. And the stock has been trending lower really since late last year thanks to the soft patch of economic news and oil prices remaining over $90 per barrel.</p><p>Some analysts worry with no debt deal, airlines could see higher interest costs for their borrowing. Clearly some selling continuing ahead of its earnings call.</p><p>Chinese solar panel maker LDK, meantime, has faded to its lowest stock price in a year, off another 3 percent today. It is the latest Chinese firm to face questions about governance. In a report from Fitch Ratings, raised issue with the concentrated stock ownership structure as well as wild swings in profit margins, leading to the selling pressure we saw today.</p><p>Finally, it's not often that celebrity gossip finds its way into the stock market, but retailer Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) has plans to launch a clothing line by Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. The company says it will continue to do that. It will start in September, despite the two announcing their divorce late last week. The stock price coming off its most recent high, off about 1 percent.</p><p>And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is in for another week of scrutiny as that phone-hacking scandal escalates. Late today, Standard &amp; Poor's ratings service put the media giant on credit watch with \"negative implications,\" saying there are increased risks related to the broadening legal issues at News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS).</p><p>Now the action comes a day before CEO Rupert Murdoch and his son, James, testify before the British Parliament tomorrow morning. But our guest tonight says News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). stock is still his top pick. Joining us now, Jason Bazinet. He is media analyst at Citigroup (NYSE: C).</p><p>Hi, Jason, nice to you have with us.</p><p>JASON BAZINET, MEDIA ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thank you so much.</p><p>GHARIB: Let's start right off with that stock. It has been down sharply since this scandal broke. And you said in a Citi report that News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is, quote, \"too compelling to ignore.\" Tell us why you are so bullish on the stock?</p><p>BAZINET: Well, there are a couple of reasons the stock is down so much. One is several weeks ago people expected News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). to consolidate all of BSkyB, and now that is not happening. That is disappointing to investors.</p><p>And second you have got this broadening scandal. But when we look at the numbers News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is trading about 10 times forward earnings. And importantly, they have about $12 billion of cash on the balance sheet. If you make that adjustment and remove the cash from their market capitalization, it's trading closer to 6.5 times earnings. That's too compelling to ignore.</p><p>GHARIB: What about some of the other issues that are on the worry list for investors? And we listed some of them on the screen here. Let's take a look. One of the worries is, what if News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is forced to sell its British newspaper holdings? What if U.K. regulators force the company to sell its stakes that it already owns in BSkyB satellite? News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). could also lose its TV licenses if U.S. regulators say that News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is no longer fit to own American television properties.</p><p>There is a question about leadership change at the top. If Rupert Murdoch steps down or is kicked out as CEO. And what -- you know, will any of the senior execs be indicted or go to jail? So what impact do these issues have? What are the financial implications?</p><p>BAZINET: Well, if I can remember that list, let me try and go through them. The disposition of the newspaper assets in the U.K. is really inconsequential. News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). does 4.5 million nominally of operating income a year. Those assets do about 70 million. So we're talking about less than 2 percent of the operating income. And to the Street they're a distraction. So if those end up getting sold, it doesn't really matter.</p><p>The second risk you mentioned, I believe, was the potential disposition of the 39 percent stake they have in BSkyB.</p><p>GHARIB: BSkyB, right.</p><p>BAZINET: Yes. You know, the Street likes that asset, but at the end of the day if they end up selling that asset, something is going to have to happen to that 12 billion of cash that was sitting on the balance sheet that was going to be used to buy in the rest of BSkyB. So not only will News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). holders get cash for the sale of the 39 percent stake, but that other 12 billion will come back to equity holders. And that is why I focused on that, you know, mid single-digit P/E ex the cash.</p><p>The TV station sale, I think, was the third risk you mentioned. You know, the Street likes the TV station business. They have got retransmission fees coming. The reality of, I think, this risk is actually quite low. There was a case that took place in the 1960s. RKO got into some trouble with the government. They didn't end up disposing of all of their assets, even though the FCC told them to, until 1990. I mean, it really was decades in the making.</p><p>So I don't think that is a real near-term risk. But, again, even if it is, you are going to see more cash come into News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). The cash balance will rise by another $5 billion or so. So I don't think it is a major risk.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. So a lot of good money aspects to it. But what about if Rupert Murdoch steps down as CEO, is that a positive or a negative for the company?</p><p>BAZINET: Well, John Malone, who is another CEO of another media company, was once asked about Rupert Murdoch's mortality and succession planning. And he somewhat famously quipped: \"half of News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). shareholders are afraid Rupert Murdoch will live and the other half are afraid he will die.\"</p><p>What he meant by that was people think Mr. Murdoch is an intelligent man, but there have been times in the past when he has, at least in the eyes of shareholders, misallocated capital. So changing the guard, again, I think is sort of a mixed bag. It doesn't necessarily mean it's negative for News.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Very interesting information. We'll see what happens tomorrow at those hearings in the U.K. Parliament. Thank you so much, Jason.</p><p>BAZINET: Very good. Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: And we've been speaking with Jason Bazinet, he's media analyst at Citigroup (NYSE: C).</p><p>HUDSON: Here is what we are watching for tomorrow. We've got another check on the housing sector due in, the June numbers on housing starts and building permits. Plenty of earnings as well, a couple from all-American brands Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and Harley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG).</p><p>And a couple of big tech giants reporting too. We'll see how the iPad is adding to Apple's bottom line and whether Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO)! is gaining ground in the world of Internet search advertising.</p><p>GHARIB: Borders bookstore plans to write its last chapter this week after a weekend deadline passed without a bidder to keep it in business. Late today, Borders said it will ask a judge to approve its liquidation on Thursday. It will begin on Friday and wrap up by September.</p><p>Borders employs nearly 11,000 people. The company blames its demise on changes in the book industry and the popularity of the e-reader.</p><p>HUDSON: Speaking about downsizing your car for something with better gas mileage, you may save a little money by waiting a little longer. According to Kelley Blue Book, the average price of a new compact car cost a record $20,500 last month, but it is expected to fall to about $19,300 by the end of the year. They see a similar trend with used cars too, dropping from over $11,000 down to under $10,000.</p><p>The debate over the debt ceiling can also be seen as the latest blame game. There is a lot of finger-pointing going, but still no deal. Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden.</p><p>JARED BERNSTEIN, SENIOR FELLOW, CENTER ON BUDGET AND POLICY PRIORITIES : The last time I offered a commentary here, I began by observing that the current debate over economic policy is generating a lot more heat than light.</p><p>Since then, it has gotten much hotter and a lot darker. If Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling by August 2nd, just a few days from now, we could end up taking an economic hit as devastating as it is avoidable. That's right, this wound will be self-inflicted. How did it come to this? The answer is politics, and it's an ugly, destabilizing politics of a type we haven't seen in this country for many years.</p><p>Ask yourself, are House Republicans refusing to countenance any budget deal that includes tax revenues from closing a break for buyers of private jets because they think it's bad economics? Or is it because almost every one of them signed the Grover Norquist pledge that they would never raise taxes under any circumstances?</p><p>In a sense, it's a trivial example. Closing that loophole would have virtually no effect at all on our long-term budget deficit. But in another sense, it's the crux of the matter. Fierce partisanship is one thing, and it's clearly part of the American political landscape.</p><p>We have profound differences and a political system that allows those differences to be both heard and embodied in our policies. But at the end of the day, our history shows that partisans compromise in the interest of preserving the common good. Those who refuse to do so have no place in this debate.</p><p>They are not legislators, working with their opponents to hammer out the best deal for both their constituents and the nation. They're pledge- takers who are threatening to abandon the common good for narrow self- interest. And that must not stand.</p><p>I'm Jared Bernstein.</p><p>HUDSON: Obviously there's a lot here to be said and Jared won't have the last word on the debt debate. In the coming days and weeks, we'll continue to bring you thoughts and views from all sides.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, hold on to your cell phones if you plan to visit Miami, New York, or Los Angeles. According to a recent study by mobile security company Lookout, those are the three top cities for cell phone loss or theft. The remainder of the list spans coast to coast. It includes Phoenix, Sacramento, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, and Tampa.</p><p>Basically everywhere, Tom. And pools, taxis, and airplanes are the top three worst places to lose your cell phone. And that's why I always have mine right next to me so I don't lose it, can't live without it.</p><p>HUDSON: Top of my list, toddlers, a tough place to lose a cell phone as well, toddlers.</p><p>GHARIB: That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, July 18th. I'm Susie Gharib. Have a great evening, everyone.</p><p>You too, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: You, as well, Susie.</p><p>I'm Tom Hudson. Good night, thanks for joining us this evening. We'll see you right back here tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

We'll hear from one analyst who says now is the  time to invest certain financial firms, and from another who says stay  away.  It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, July 18th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, everyone.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're less than a week away from President Obama's deadline for  raising the government's debt ceiling.  And, Tom, today the president said  he and Republican lawmakers were, quote, \"making progress\" after a series  of weekend meetings.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Yes, Susie, with the clock clearly continues to tick, and  here are the latest developments tonight as we know them.  The leader of  the U.S. Senate says that chamber will meet every day until Congress sends  the president legislation making sure Uncle Sam does not default on its  obligations.  </p><p>The U.S. House, meantime, is set to pass a budget \"cut, cap, and  balance\" bill tomorrow.  That includes a proposed budget amendment to the  U.S. Constitution, but credit rating agency Moody's (NYSE: MCO) says the  U.S. would be better off if the debt ceiling was eliminated entirely.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Now the debt showdown wasn't the only financial topic in the  nation's capital today.  The president nominated Richard Cordray to be the  nation's top consumer loan advocate.  </p><p>Darren Gersh has details.  </p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The president  vowed to fight back against what he called an army of lobbyists trying to  weaken the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The agency was  created to fight lending abuses that the president says were a leading  cause of the financial crisis.  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are not just going  to shrug our shoulders and hope it doesn't happen again.  We're not going  to go back to the status quo, where consumers couldn't count on getting  protections that they deserve.  We're not going to go back to a time when  our whole economy was vulnerable to a massive financial crisis.  </p><p>GERSH:  To make sure that doesn't happen, the president nominated  Richard Cordray to be the CFPB's first director.  As Ohio attorney general,  Cordray aggressively attacked fraudulent foreclosures.  </p><p>Ernie Patrikis, an expert in banking regulation, says Cordray is a  tough adversary.  </p><p>ERNIE PATRIKIS, PARTNER, WHITE &amp; CASE:  He is not going to be a very  easy fellow for some companies to get along with.  He has a strong track  record of going after people and he has done it in mortgage servicing.  He  did it against the rating agencies.  So if he can ultimately control the  agency, he'll really move it.  </p><p>GERSH:  That's if he gets confirmed by the Senate, and that will be a  tough battle.  Republicans are demanding more oversight of the CFPB's  proposed $550 million budget and a new leadership structure, replacing a  single director with a five-member board.  </p><p>That's also the position of many banks, says the Financial Services  Roundtable's Scott Talbott.  </p><p>SCOTT TALBOTT, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES ROUNDTABLE:   We are for creating a five-person panel.  It doesn't dilute the total power  of the CFPB, it simply spreads it out.  So that if an idea is a good one,  then let's have a panel agree to it.  That provides the checks and the  balances necessary.  </p><p>GERSH:  One thing seems clear, without a strong leader in place, the  CFPB is off to an uncertain start.  </p><p>PATRIKIS:  They will be doing a lot of thinking, a lot of preparatory  work for what they want to do, organizing, drafting, but nothing will be  effective.  </p><p>GERSH:  Consumer groups endorsed Cordray, but they were clearly  disappointed the president sidestepped selecting Elizabeth Warren.  The  CFPB was her idea, and President Obama put her in charge of setting up the  office, but she was considered too confrontational to have any chance of  winning support from Senate Republicans.  </p><p>Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.  </p><p>HUDSON:  If Richard Cordray is confirmed, part of his job will be  checking the books of big banks.  And we're going to get a better idea of  how those books are doing in coming days when many report quarterly  earnings.  By the end of this week, 40 percent of financial firms in the  S&amp;P 500 will have reported their latest numbers.  </p><p>As a group, the results are expected to be downright awful.  Erika  Miller reports.  </p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Banks are the  heartbeat of the economy, so their health is often used as a barometer of  the recovery, and the stock market.  </p><p>Unfortunately for investors, bank analyst Jim Sinegal sees plenty of  uncertainties ahead.  </p><p>JIM SINEGAL, BANK ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR:  In addition to macroeconomic  uncertainties, you know, with unemployment high, GDP growth slow, you know,  will the banks be able to add new loans?  That's number one.  Number two is  the regulatory uncertainty.  We are still not sure exactly where capital  levels are going to fall out, and how that's going to affect profitability.  </p><p>MILLER:  As for profitability, diversified financials are expected to  be the worst performer this earnings season, down 94 percent.  This is the  group that includes Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Citi, and JPMorgan.  </p><p>But there's a catch.  Take out Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), and  earnings for the group are expected to rise 23 percent, better than the 8  percent gain for the overall market.  Against that backdrop, analyst Jim  Sinegal says now is a good time to buy select financial stocks: JPMorgan,  Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB).  </p><p>SINEGAL:  We think if you stick to high quality names at current  prices, current earnings, and with most of their capital problems behind  them, you know, we think they are one of the best sectors in terms of  investment opportunities.  </p><p>MILLER:  But Burt White of LPL Financial warns it's too risky to buy  any bank stocks now.  </p><p>BURT WHITE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, LPL FINANCIAL:  We think that  there are way too many questions and just not enough answers, between  housing and foreclosures and the euro crisis and regulatory reform.  Plus,  just some of the simple negatives like a flat yield curve and zero interest  rates, so they can't earn money on money market reserves.  </p><p>MILLER:  Those concerns have weighed on stocks in the sector.  The BKX  Index of bank stocks has fallen nearly 20 percent from its high back in  February.  And if you are thinking of buying financial stocks for their  dividends, think again.  In their heyday in 2007, the group yielded 3.3  percent.  Now they pay out just 1.8 percent, the lowest of any industry  group in the S&amp;P 500.  </p><p>Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Still ahead tonight, the Murdoch mess.  Rupert Murdoch's News  Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is under scrutiny for questionable journalism on both  sides of the Atlantic, but we'll talk with an analyst who still likes the  stock.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Government debt worries put investors in a selling mood  today.  At the close, the Dow lost 94 points, the NASDAQ fell nearly 25,  the S&amp;P 500 off almost 11.  Now as for volume, 871 million shares were  traded here at the Big Board and just shy of 1.8 billion at the NASDAQ.  </p><p>Meanwhile, all that glitters is gold.  The yellow metal closed above  $1,600 for the first time ever.  Gold for August delivery settled at $1,602  an ounce, up $12.  That's a record in dollar terms, but below the peak  reached in the 1980s, after accounting for inflation.  </p><p>Big layoffs announced late today at Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO).  It  will lay off 6,500 workers, or about 9 percent of its full-time workforce.   Analysts predicted thousands of job cuts after Cisco announced plans to  reorganize back in May.  The company had been losing ground in the network  equipment business.  Cisco says the move will cut annual expenses by about  $1 billion.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Big Blue saw a lot of green in the second quarter.  The  technology company continued its recent trend of reporting better-than- expected profits.  Earnings were $0.06 better than estimates.  Software,  services, and hardware revenue each grew by double digits, leading IBM to  raise its earnings guidance for the year.  Tom Smith covers Big Blue, IBM  as an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, and joins us tonight from New York.  </p><p>Tom, strong quarter, any concerns for IBM?  </p><p>THOMAS SMITH, ANALYST, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S:  Well, I think it was a  pretty bright quarter all around.  And despite some weakness in Japan as a  regional territory, Japan was weak in the aftermath of the earthquake.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Now we saw some of the double-digit revenue increases across  the board, the backlog of service contracts is up as well.  Big growth in  software systems and services, which is the big money-maker.  The outlook  looks pretty bright, so what should shareholders be paying attention to  closely.  </p><p>SMITH:  Well, the outlook is pretty bright.  Going back to your prior  question, you could tone down your enthusiasm a little bit because some of  the top line reporting of revenues based on currency tailwind,  nevertheless, 5 percent same currency base as revenue growth for the  company overall is pretty good.  </p><p>So it is looking ahead I think we have to see whether the strength in  hardware can continue because they had new fresh batch of machines last  September.  And those are now about a year dated.  And they will pull --  they pulled a lot of orders for three quarters now and that will continue,  and software and services get added on to that.  Can that continue for  another year or so?  That is one question in mind.  </p><p>HUDSON:  At least initially it seems like the shareholders were pretty  encouraged that it can.  The share price looks to pop to possibly a new  high after hours, certainly it did.  If that continues through tomorrow it  will be close to $180 per share.  What is your outlook for the stock?</p><p>SMITH:  That's right.  Well, our outlook has been a strong buy going  into the report, and remains a strong buy afterwards.  And I was able to  raise my earnings estimate and also push my 12-month target price from $196  to $205.  So I'm even more optimistic, and yet the share price is improving  on this.  You hope that it can carry through.  </p><p>One knock on IBM, sometimes it's so big it can't increase revenues.   But they had a pretty good quarter on revenues.  </p><p>HUDSON:  It's a big revenue already and seeing it grow by double  digits across some of the business units.  What does this mean, though?   Extrapolate IBM's performance for Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ).  What does  it mean for HP?  </p><p>SMITH:  Well, I think for HP and maybe for Dell (NASDAQ: DELL) too, a  big data center conglomerate, if you will, is that there is interest in  enterprises and governments and non-profits.  Governments were a little bit  weaker as a buying source.  But as opposed to discretionary consumer  hardware, the enterprise business for data centers is still pretty strong.  </p><p>So that caters to quite a bit of what HP does and a lot of what Dell  (NASDAQ: DELL) does.  Those two, of course, are exposed to PCs, which are  much more -- which have a business component and a discretionary component.   That discretionary component makes those two look a little slower in that  sense in terms of revenue or more volatile in their results.  </p><p>HUDSON:  OK.  And we'll.</p><p>SMITH:  You know, part of IBM's.</p><p>HUDSON:  Well, we'll see those in the weeks ahead, sorry for cutting  you off here, time is short.  A quick look at IBM after the close, there.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you.</p><p>HUDSON:  Tom, we appreciate it.  Tom Smith, he's with Standard &amp;  Poor's.  </p><p>Well, ahead of those IBM -- news, stocks were weak to the government  debt worries continuing, in Europe and the United States.  So let's go  ahead and roll out with tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>It was an 11-point drop for the S&amp;P 500, and takes the index down to  the lowest level we've seen in a month.  So let's go ahead and take a look  at the last 90 sessions.  Here we are.  We're going to zoom in now with the  March low remaining intact.</p><p>Here it is, on the far side of the screen.  The index, though, was  unable to crest above the highs that we saw during the April months, during  the bounce-back that we had back in June.  And we're -- here we are at the  lowest part in the past month.  One area to watch clearly is the lows that  we had back in June.  </p><p>Technology, meantime, compare it to the past 90 sessions of the NASDAQ  100 Exchange-Traded Fund, it was down 0.5 percent today, but, look, it's  not nearly as low compared to a month ago, where it was.  The tech sector  has held up better in the past recent weeks compared to the broad market,  thanks to this broad move higher late last month.  It was the best sector  today in the weak market.  </p><p>The market focus clearly on IBM tomorrow after the earnings, but also  on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which reports earnings after the close tomorrow.   Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) among the strongest technology stocks, a bit of a  technology burst ourselves here on screen.  This does take Apple (NASDAQ:  AAPL) shares up to a new 52-week high.  It's a 2.4 percent increase.   Volume was stronger with the action pulling Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to its  highest price it has ever seen.  </p><p>Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) reportedly is close to a new deal to sell its  iPhone in China.  We'll have more on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and its growth  prospects on tomorrow night's program.  </p><p>How about B. of A., meantime?  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) jumping to a new  high, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) stock continues sinking down to new two- year lows.  B. of A. shares down another 2.8 percent, the biggest loser  among the Dow Industrial Components, and the financial sector clearly  weighing on the market today.  </p><p>Not just big banks, it was insurance stocks as well facing some of the  worst selling that we saw in the broad market.  Late Friday, S&amp;P warned the  credit ratings of insurers holding U.S. government debt would be in  jeopardy if there is no debt deal in Washington.  </p><p>Genworth falling more than 7.5 percent, a new 52-week low tonight.   We've got Allstate (NYSE: ALL) shedding 5 percent, its lowest price since  last August, and Hartford falling almost 4 percent, that is its lowest  price of this year.  </p><p>Between the potential push higher on mortgage rates, if there is no  debt deal and the struggling job market, a look at the homebuilder  confidence here, continuing to see some weakness here, off by another 1.5  percent.  The Homebuilder Exchange-Traded Fund falling and now threatening  some of the lows just from last month.  </p><p>Also coming back to earth significantly, Delta Air Lines stock.  Look  at this continued push lower here, off another 4 percent.  Earnings are  expected tomorrow.  And the stock has been trending lower really since late  last year thanks to the soft patch of economic news and oil prices  remaining over $90 per barrel.  </p><p>Some analysts worry with no debt deal, airlines could see higher  interest costs for their borrowing.  Clearly some selling continuing ahead  of its earnings call.  </p><p>Chinese solar panel maker LDK, meantime, has faded to its lowest stock  price in a year, off another 3 percent today.  It is the latest Chinese  firm to face questions about governance.  In a report from Fitch Ratings,  raised issue with the concentrated stock ownership structure as well as  wild swings in profit margins, leading to the selling pressure we saw  today.  </p><p>Finally, it's not often that celebrity gossip finds its way into the  stock market, but retailer Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) has plans to launch a  clothing line by Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony.  The company says it will  continue to do that.  It will start in September, despite the two  announcing their divorce late last week.  The stock price coming off its  most recent high, off about 1 percent.  </p><p>And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>GHARIB:  News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is in for another week of scrutiny  as that phone-hacking scandal escalates.  Late today, Standard &amp; Poor's  ratings service put the media giant on credit watch with \"negative  implications,\" saying there are increased risks related to the broadening  legal issues at News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS).  </p><p>Now the action comes a day before CEO Rupert Murdoch and his son,  James, testify before the British Parliament tomorrow morning.  But our  guest tonight says News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). stock is still his top pick.   Joining us now, Jason Bazinet.  He is media analyst at Citigroup (NYSE: C).  </p><p>Hi, Jason, nice to you have with us.  </p><p>JASON BAZINET, MEDIA ANALYST, CITIGROUP:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Let's start right off with that stock.  It has been down  sharply since this scandal broke.  And you said in a Citi report that News  Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is, quote, \"too compelling to ignore.\"  Tell us why you  are so bullish on the stock?  </p><p>BAZINET:  Well, there are a couple of reasons the stock is down so  much.  One is several weeks ago people expected News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). to  consolidate all of BSkyB, and now that is not happening.  That is  disappointing to investors.  </p><p>And second you have got this broadening scandal.  But when we look at  the numbers News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is trading about 10 times forward  earnings.  And importantly, they have about $12 billion of cash on the  balance sheet.  If you make that adjustment and remove the cash from their  market capitalization, it's trading closer to 6.5 times earnings.  That's  too compelling to ignore.  </p><p>GHARIB:  What about some of the other issues that are on the worry  list for investors?  And we listed some of them on the screen here.  Let's  take a look.  One of the worries is, what if News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is  forced to sell its British newspaper holdings?  What if U.K. regulators  force the company to sell its stakes that it already owns in BSkyB  satellite?  News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). could also lose its TV licenses if  U.S. regulators say that News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). is no longer fit to own  American television properties.  </p><p>There is a question about leadership change at the top.  If Rupert  Murdoch steps down or is kicked out as CEO.  And what -- you know, will any  of the senior execs be indicted or go to jail?  So what impact do these  issues have?  What are the financial implications?  </p><p>BAZINET:  Well, if I can remember that list, let me try and go through  them.  The disposition of the newspaper assets in the U.K. is really  inconsequential.  News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). does 4.5 million nominally of  operating income a year.  Those assets do about 70 million.  So we're  talking about less than 2 percent of the operating income.  And to the  Street they're a distraction.  So if those end up getting sold, it doesn't  really matter.  </p><p>The second risk you mentioned, I believe, was the potential  disposition of the 39 percent stake they have in BSkyB.  </p><p>GHARIB:  BSkyB, right.</p><p>BAZINET:  Yes.  You know, the Street likes that asset, but at the end  of the day if they end up selling that asset, something is going to have to  happen to that 12 billion of cash that was sitting on the balance sheet  that was going to be used to buy in the rest of BSkyB.  So not only will  News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). holders get cash for the sale of the 39 percent  stake, but that other 12 billion will come back to equity holders.  And  that is why I focused on that, you know, mid single-digit P/E ex the cash.  </p><p>The TV station sale, I think, was the third risk you mentioned.  You  know, the Street likes the TV station business.  They have got  retransmission fees coming.  The reality of, I think, this risk is actually  quite low.  There was a case that took place in the 1960s.  RKO got into  some trouble with the government.  They didn't end up disposing of all of  their assets, even though the FCC told them to, until 1990.  I mean, it  really was decades in the making.  </p><p>So I don't think that is a real near-term risk.  But, again, even if  it is, you are going to see more cash come into News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS).   The cash balance will rise by another $5 billion or so.  So I don't think  it is a major risk.  </p><p>GHARIB:  All right.  So a lot of good money aspects to it.  But what  about if Rupert Murdoch steps down as CEO, is that a positive or a negative  for the company?</p><p>BAZINET:  Well, John Malone, who is another CEO of another media  company, was once asked about Rupert Murdoch's mortality and succession  planning.  And he somewhat famously quipped: \"half of News Corp (NASDAQ:  NWS). shareholders are afraid Rupert Murdoch will live and the other half  are afraid he will die.\"  </p><p>What he meant by that was people think Mr. Murdoch is an intelligent  man, but there have been times in the past when he has, at least in the  eyes of shareholders, misallocated capital.  So changing the guard, again,  I think is sort of a mixed bag.  It doesn't necessarily mean it's negative  for News.  </p><p>GHARIB:  All right.  Very interesting information.  We'll see what  happens tomorrow at those hearings in the U.K. Parliament.  Thank you so  much, Jason.  </p><p>BAZINET:  Very good.  Thank you.  </p><p>GHARIB:  And we've been speaking with Jason Bazinet, he's media  analyst at Citigroup (NYSE: C).  </p><p>HUDSON:  Here is what we are watching for tomorrow.  We've got another  check on the housing sector due in, the June numbers on housing starts and  building permits.  Plenty of earnings as well, a couple from all-American  brands Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and Harley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG).  </p><p>And a couple of big tech giants reporting too.  We'll see how the iPad  is adding to Apple's bottom line and whether Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO)! is  gaining ground in the world of Internet search advertising.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Borders bookstore plans to write its last chapter this week  after a weekend deadline passed without a bidder to keep it in business.   Late today, Borders said it will ask a judge to approve its liquidation on  Thursday.  It will begin on Friday and wrap up by September.  </p><p>Borders employs nearly 11,000 people.  The company blames its demise  on changes in the book industry and the popularity of the e-reader.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Speaking about downsizing your car for something with better  gas mileage, you may save a little money by waiting a little longer.   According to Kelley Blue Book, the average price of a new compact car cost  a record $20,500 last month, but it is expected to fall to about $19,300 by  the end of the year.  They see a similar trend with used cars too, dropping  from over $11,000 down to under $10,000.  </p><p>The debate over the debt ceiling can also be seen as the latest blame  game.  There is a lot of finger-pointing going, but still no deal.  Jared  Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  and former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden.  </p><p>JARED BERNSTEIN, SENIOR FELLOW, CENTER ON BUDGET AND POLICY PRIORITIES  :  The last time I offered a commentary here, I began by observing that the  current debate over economic policy is generating a lot more heat than  light.  </p><p>Since then, it has gotten much hotter and a lot darker.  If Congress  fails to raise the debt ceiling by August 2nd, just a few days from now, we  could end up taking an economic hit as devastating as it is avoidable.   That's right, this wound will be self-inflicted.  How did it come to this?   The answer is politics, and it's an ugly, destabilizing politics of a type  we haven't seen in this country for many years.  </p><p>Ask yourself, are House Republicans refusing to countenance any budget  deal that includes tax revenues from closing a break for buyers of private  jets because they think it's bad economics?  Or is it because almost every  one of them signed the Grover Norquist pledge that they would never raise  taxes under any circumstances?  </p><p>In a sense, it's a trivial example.  Closing that loophole would have  virtually no effect at all on our long-term budget deficit.  But in another  sense, it's the crux of the matter.  Fierce partisanship is one thing, and  it's clearly part of the American political landscape.  </p><p>We have profound differences and a political system that allows those  differences to be both heard and embodied in our policies.  But at the end  of the day, our history shows that partisans compromise in the interest of  preserving the common good.  Those who refuse to do so have no place in  this debate.  </p><p>They are not legislators, working with their opponents to hammer out  the best deal for both their constituents and the nation.  They're pledge- takers who are threatening to abandon the common good for narrow self-  interest.  And that must not stand.  </p><p>I'm Jared Bernstein.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Obviously there's a lot here to be said and Jared won't have  the last word on the debt debate.  In the coming days and weeks, we'll  continue to bring you thoughts and views from all sides.  </p><p>GHARIB:  And finally tonight, hold on to your cell phones if you plan  to visit Miami, New York, or Los Angeles.  According to a recent study by  mobile security company Lookout, those are the three top cities for cell  phone loss or theft.  The remainder of the list spans coast to coast.  It  includes Phoenix, Sacramento, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, and  Tampa.  </p><p>Basically everywhere, Tom.  And pools, taxis, and airplanes are the  top three worst places to lose your cell phone.  And that's why I always  have mine right next to me so I don't lose it, can't live without it.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Top of my list, toddlers, a tough place to lose a cell phone  as well, toddlers.  </p><p>GHARIB:  That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, July 18th.  I'm  Susie Gharib.  Have a great evening, everyone.  </p><p>You too, Tom.  </p><p>HUDSON:  You, as well, Susie.  </p><p>I'm Tom Hudson.  Good night, thanks for joining us this evening.   We'll see you right back here tomorrow. </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

The blue chips rack up a triple digit gain, powered higher by the nation`s factories kicking into higher gear. You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, January 4.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening everyone. Wall Street kicked off 2010 with a rally. The Dow surged over 155 points, the NASDAQ rose 39 and the S&amp;P 500 jumped nearly 18.</p><p>HUDSON: Susie, it was a heck of a run the first trading day, good economic news triggered the buying. Investors encouraged by an upbeat report from the Institute of Supply Management showing those factory orders ramping up, jobs ramping up and prices finally starting to head up as well.</p><p>GHARIB: And comforting comments from Fed chief Bernanke yesterday also helped, implying there`s no hurry to raise interest rates, at least for now. UBS strategist Mike Ryan expects stocks to continue to move higher from here.</p><p>MIKE RYAN, STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: The market I think is moving in anticipation of several events. They`re moving in anticipation of what they believe will be a moderate but sustainable economic recovery. They`re moving in anticipation of an earnings recovery that should have earnings returning towards trend -- not immediately, but slowly returning towards trend and also an environment that remains fairly benign from an inflation standpoint.</p><p>GHARIB: The head of the New York Stock Exchange told me he`s also optimistic about the stock market in 2010. I talked to <person><nameText>Duncan Niederauer </nameText></person>right after the opening bell rang here at the big board and I asked him for his market forecast.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, </nameText></person>CEO, NYSE EURONEXT: I think we`re in such a better place than we were a year ago that it`s hard not to be optimistic. So I`m very constructive about where the market should go from here. We look at our IPO pipeline, it`s pretty solid. I think you`ve got corporate earnings continuing to grow and I think you`ve got a lot of the uncertainty that was really prevailing at this time last year, is out of the way. So I`m pretty optimistic for `010.</p><p>GHARIB: But Duncan I have been talking to a lot of market strategists and even traders right here on the floor. And they`re talking about a correction for 2010.</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I happen to not agree. It`s easy to predict the correction because we`re up, the Dow`s up 60 percent since March, S&amp;P is up more than that, NASDAQ is up 80 percent since March. The indices are all up a lot so I think it`s right to expect a correction. The market feels fairly valued to me. It doesn`t feel overvalued. I think people are going to be much more focused on the economy because I think corporate earnings are going to deliver the goods this year.</p><p>GHARIB: I`m sure you get asked this a lot by individual investors. Is it safe for me to put my money in the stock market? Everybody is still afraid about putting their money in stocks these days. What is going to take to restore investor confidence?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I think it`s about how they feel as a consumer first. So I`m going to be watching the consumer confidence metrics and how the economic recovery is going in `010. Because I think that is what people are now going to focus their attention on. So I think people are going to have to feel more comfortable that their job is more stable, the roof over their head is stable, they can take care of their family and then I think it is a necessary -- that is a necessary step to take before we are going to have people feel better and come back to the equity markets on the retail side.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s talk a little bit about financial regulatory reform. The American public is looking to Congress to pass new rules that hopefully will prevent the financial system from breaking down in the future. What do you like the most? What don`t you like?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I think a lot of what you are going to see from the SEC is directionally correct. It is going to be a lot around market structure. I don`t know if it is necessarily going to be in the category of preventing a crisis. I think the best thing that has been talked about is on the OTC derivative space, more central clearing, more transparency. The thing I`m most worried about on the regulatory side is this talk of a transaction tax which I think would have very, very negative implications for volumes and for the cost of trading for retail investors.</p><p>GHARIB: And this transaction tax would be on trades of stocks and options and futures. Is that a tax really just going to be passed on to investors?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: That`s my view. I`m actually writing a piece right now that I`m going to be distributing in the next couple of weeks. And among the points I make is one of the points you just made Susie, which is it`s absolutely a pass-through tax. This idea, the way it`s been packaged, to sell it to Main Street that it is a tax on Wall Street. It is not a tax on Wall Street. It is a tax on Main Street. It will flow down to the retail investor. It will flow down to the mutual fund holder. It is not going to be paid for by Wall Street.</p><p>GHARIB: Duncan, how do you rate President Obama`s performance in terms of his position on things like banks, financial reform, executive compensation?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I would sum it up this way. We`ve been very pleased with the words that he and the Treasury secretary have spoken. We have given them kudos for the measures they appear to be ready to take. I think now in `010 the proof is in the pudding. Are they actually going to carry out what they say they are going to do and follow through?</p><p>GHARIB: What do you think the president needs to do in 2010 that will restore confidence in American businesses and the markets?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: What the president needs to do is what he started to do a few weeks ago which is call the banks in together and say crisis averted. You guys are well on the road to recovery. Your profitability shows that. Please start lending to small and medium-sized institutions and from our vantage point, the credit market is still predominantly closed to small and medium-sized enterprises and we think it`s critical that he apply pressure in the right places to get that credit flowing freely again.</p><p>GHARIB: You mentioned earlier about IPOs. There is a lot of buzz about a flurry of IPOs and the NYSE and the NASDAQ are lobbying hard to get those listings. How much of it will come your way?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: We operate in a very competitive environment for the listings. We win more than our fair share. We have and I`m very confident will continue to do so. The pipeline we`ve got coming in the next few months dramatically tilted our way. So we`re pretty excited about it.</p><p>GHARIB: This first trading week of the year, we`re talking to the leaders of the nation`s big exchanges. On Wednesday Craig Donohue, CEO of the CME Group in Chicago and then on Thursday, Robert Greifeld, CEO of the NASDAQ OMX. Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Susie, some of the other big stories tonight. Putting away the hammers and the nails at building sites in November. We`ve seen a drop-off in both home building and commercial projects leading to a 0.6 percent drop in construction spending. This is the seventh straight month on the downside.</p><p>Swiss drug maker Novartis is eyeing complete control of eye care company Alcon. Today, Novartis announcing plans to take over Alcon, paying Nestle nearly $39 billion for the 77 percent stake in Alcon that Nestle owns.</p><p>Some good and some bad in what Bank of America`s new CEO Brian Moynihan sees for the future. Forecasters at the bank predict the U.S. economy will grow more than 3 percent this year. But that slow pace also means the unemployment rate will stay high.</p><p>And watch out, above! How about this, the world`s tallest skyscraper now open in Dubai. At 2,717 feet, the Burj Khalifa is named for the leader of the neighboring Abu Dhabi which just pitched in $10 billion to bail Dubai out of its financial crisis.</p><p>GHARIB: An evolution of thinking for the Fed chairman. That`s how political economist Tom Gallagher today characterized this weekend`s remarks we told you about from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Bernanke said low interest rates were not to blame for the housing crisis; a lack of regulation was. Stephanie Dhue spoke with Gallagher about the message the Fed chairman delivered.</p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Bernanke said that sometimes the Fed should use interest rate policy to address bubbles. Do you see the Fed making a move to address emerging markets or commodities?</p><p>TOM GALLAGHER, POLITICAL ECONOMIST, ISI: That is a change on Bernanke`s part. He was very much a part of the Greenspan-led consensus on how monetary policy wants to approach bubbles, which is to say that monetary policy shouldn`t adjust for bubbles at all until it was time to pick up the pieces. Now I think the central banking community is moving toward a view that the central bank should be worried about the development of asset bubbles, primarily know that regulation is the preferred approach. But there are some circumstances in which monetary policy can play a role. So that does reflect a bit of an evolution, his thinking along with the rest of the central banking community during the course of this bubble, this boom-bust cycle. So I think that has been a shift on his part.</p><p>DHUE: Bernanke says that low interest rates weren`t the reason for the housing bubble. Do you see that as a defense of the Greenspan Fed or a defense of the current Fed?</p><p>GALLAGHER: Given that he was there during most of that time period, it was really a defense of the Fed and his own role in it, I think. And I think that he`s on pretty good grounds in arguing that the monetary policy was not being reason for the housing bubble. He defended the Fed`s record by pointing to a defensible calculation on where the Fed funds rate should be. It wasn`t very far from that and he was responding to a lot of criticism that the Fed had unusually low interest rates for a long period of time and that`s what Fed the housing bubble. Instead he presented some calculations that suggested that it was the development of alternative mortgages that produced very low initial monthly payments and that that system is what lead to the housing bubble as both the borrower and lender believed that home prices would continue to rise and they would never have to pay the higher mortgage payments that would be due later on.</p><p>DHUE: Now Bernanke`s faced a lot of criticism as he has gone before the Senate to keep his job. Do you think he`ll be an effective advocate for reform?</p><p>GALLAGHER: Well, I don`t think the views of the Fed chairman are an especially important part of the outcome of this debate. There is a lot of interest groups that are affected by this and they are fighting very hard on this. And I think it`s hard for any Fed chairman to really have a material impact on the outcome of that debate.</p><p>DHUE: And bottom line for investors looking at Bernanke talking about asset bubbles and interest rates, any change here?</p><p>GALLAGHER: No, I thought especially if you take Bernanke`s and Cohen`s speeches together, there wasn`t a lot of guidance on where interest rates are headed in the near-term. But I think that you have to assume, you have to read those speeches as suggesting that not anything is -- that nothing is going to happen any time soon.</p><p>DHUE: And not any time soon, not first quarter, not second quarter.</p><p>GALLAGHER: I think that the Fed is likely to raise interest rates in the third quarter. And I think given how far away that is, that`s still six months away at the earliest, it`s hard to be very specific on that. I think that probably the important action for the financial markets, even more than the rate hike will be when they change the language, the guidance they are giving the markets on interest rates. Right now they are promising to keep interest rates more or less at zero for an extended period of time. When that extended period phrase gets dropped, it is probably when markets start to react and risk assets will probably perform more poorly. When that happens and I suspect that is a second quarter event, and again, so not anything any time soon.</p><p>DHUE: Tom Gallagher, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Thank you.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead on the program, can Google do for mobile phones what it`s done for web searches and advertising? The tech titan gets ready to lift the curtain on its own smart phone.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom as you heard me complain, it`s so very cold here in New York so I`m not surprised that that`s the theme that you`re going to be looking at in your market focus tonight.</p><p>HUDSON: Absolutely. That cold snap that`s really gripping much of the country Susie pushing around energy, even orange juice prices. Plus we`re going to talk about betting on China and some new highs today for the first of the year for some big tech names in our market focus.</p><p>But that Arctic cold air gripping much of the country is sending energy prices up to prices not seen since October. Energy also getting a boost certainly from today`s better than expected manufacturing numbers we told you about earlier.</p><p>So let`s take a look at some of the numbers. Crude oil jumping to over $80 a barrel. In addition to the cold weather, a weaker dollar may have helped out, also a break out over $83 for oil would take it to post- recession highs. Nat gas also catching fire with this cold snap and with the freezing temps reaching down into Florida, even orange juice futures jumping, but ended with only about half of the gains seen earlier in the day. Watch those OJ prices by the way, as futures have doubled in the past year.</p><p>Speaking of the surprise rise in manufacturing activity fueling some hope maybe that the job picture finally may be seeing some improvement. The December jobs reports are due out on Friday of course and the job gains are expected to be seen again in temporary workers, as has been the case over the past four months. Now the temp hiring stocks are already moving, maybe in anticipation.</p><p>Stocks like Manpower (MAN), Robert Half International, Kelly Services (KELVA) seeing a nice bid today. Spherion (SPN) also moving higher by better than 8 1/2 percent. All these stocks hitting multi-week highs ahead of those Friday`s jobs data.</p><p>Early on here already just one day in 2010 looking a lot like 2009, with last year`s leaders helping push the market indices higher. Information technology the single best performing sector throughout all of 2009 and the big guys continue to hit some prices not seen in really about a couple of years. Take a look at some of these longer term charts, two years long here on Cisco (CSCO) breaking out to the upside on this first trading day of the year, running after $25 a share, a price not seen since the summer of 2008. Volume also stronger than normal on today`s move higher.</p><p>How about Microsoft (MSFT), another two-year chart here, continues to find buyers over $30 a share. Today`s buying takes Microsoft to a level shareholders haven`t enjoyed in two years. The rally in these stocks is helpful for many growth mutual fund investors as these stocks tend to be very popular with those kinds of mutual funds.</p><p>Intel (INTC) also getting in the act, jumping to its highest price since October. Brokerage firm Baird upgrading it, calling Intel a quote value and defensive idea and continuing to echo the idea that businesses will be buying new computers in 2010.</p><p>The action in these three stocks comes really just a few days before the beginning of the big consumer electronics show, which spotlights tech trends in the making.</p><p>Speaking of which, watch Apple (AAPL) stock as the \"Wall Street Journal\" tonight quoting sources saying the company will unveil a long- awaited tablet computer at that convention. It could measure 10 to 11 inches and ship out in March around $1,000. Apple stock over $214 a share, $214, is at all-time highs.</p><p>With the market breaking out to these post-recession highs, some market leading sectors have seen mixed performance.</p><p>Thanks to that Intel (INTC) move, semiconductor exchange traded fund leading the way for technology above the range in December.</p><p>The economically sensitive transportation ETF however remains below new highs perhaps kept in check a little bit by oil.</p><p>Financial stocks also turning up but remain well below their October highs.</p><p>Betting on gaming in the new year, how about this, a couple of gambling stocks see big buying volume today. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) jumping more than 9 percent on twice average daily volume. UBS thinking the stock should see $20 a share in the next year. It also raised its rating on Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and that stock responded, up on bigger than usual volume. The price target here $76.</p><p>The analyst likes both casinos based not on what happens in Las Vegas but what could happen in Macau, China. While Vegas revenues are predicted to be flat, UBS thinks gaming in Macau is tracking better than expected.</p><p>And that`s our market focus tonight.</p><p>GHARIB: Could Google have iPhone envy? That`s a question the tech blogs are asking tonight as we wait for an announcement tomorrow from the Internet giant. Google is expected to unwrap its own entry into the smart phone market. But as usual, exactly what the company is up to is less than clear. Scott Gurvey reports.</p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Google phone is one of the worst kept secrets in an industry that doesn`t keep secrets very well. Since the web site Engadget got its hands on what Google is calling the Nexus one, editor-in-chief Joshua Topolsky says the response has been extraordinary.</p><p>JOSHUA TOPOLSKY, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, ENGADGET.COM (BY TELEPHONE): The reaction about this phone has been kind of insane. It`s been phenomenal. And since we put up our hands-on post, there`s been an enormous amount of traffic with people coming to the site to see those pictures and to hear what we had to say about the phone.</p><p>GURVEY: The big question Google will face at tomorrow`s unveiling is, why? Google`s Android operating system already appears on scores of phones including the Motorola Droid recently introduced by Verizon Wireless. The Nexus phone does not appear to make any major improvements on the Droid. And Gene Munster, technology analyst at Piper Jaffray, says Google`s unknown motives are alarming the industry.</p><p>GENE MUNSTER, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: If they put out a phone that shows all the good things that Android can do I think their partners well be happy to see that. If they come out and actually try to grab market share and aggressively price this, I think it`s going to create quite a high level of friction between all the players in the market.</p><p>GURVEY: Rumors about Google`s marketing plans have industry blogs on fire. Price points range from $500 to free. T-Mobile may offer the phone packaged with a two-year contract for $200. Sales of conventional mobile phones have been dropping since the economy tanked. But Apple`s iPhone has remained a strong seller throughout the downturn. And Michael Gikas of \"Consumer Reports,\" says interest in smart phones is jumping as the economy recovers.</p><p>MICHAEL GIKAS, SENIOR EDITOR, CONSUMER REPORTS: Sales of smart phones keep going up and the number one reason is people want these extra features. And they`re going to pay more for them too. Not just for the phones but they`re going to be paying higher monthly premiums for data plans and text messaging and all sorts of other things.</p><p>GURVEY: The Google phone is said to run only on GSM networks. GSM is frequently found in countries overseas but in the United States, this means the Nexus one will only run on the T-Mobile system. Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Here`s what we`re watching for tomorrow. We`ll get a look at the health of the housing sector when the National Association of Realtors release the pending home sales for November. Factory orders for November will be released as well. Also we`ll see how U.S. auto makers fared in December and hear from some car dealers for their take on what will drive the auto industry this year.</p><p>While we won`t know about General Motors` U.S. sales until tomorrow, its sales in China are revving up. The auto maker says last year it sold a record 1.8 vehicles there. That`s up 67 percent. The top selling brands in China were Buick and Chevrolet. And helping things: a government program to defray the cost of buying fuel efficient cars and trucks. Some of those programs are now being phased out, but GM thinks its sales in China are still on track to keep growing down the road.</p><p>HUDSON: Until we make a profit, I won`t take a paycheck. Now, that`s what the new head of Continental Airlines told employees today, Jeff Smisek took the top job Friday after Larry Kellner left to join a private equity firm. Smisek says the tone for business is set at the top, so if everyone wants better pay and benefits, the business needs to make money. That`s not happening now. Continental Air is deep in the red. The carrier lost $367 million in the first nine months of last year.</p><p>GHARIB: Tonight`s commentator thinks we`ll see a better economic reality in 2010. He`s Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody`seconomy.com.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`SECONOMY.COM: For the first time in a very long time, I`m able to say that I`m optimistic about the economy`s prospects. 2010 won`t be a great year. That would be inappropriate given that unemployment will likely remain in the double- digits through much of the year, but it will feel pretty good after what we have been through. Job growth is set to resume in the next few months and will be strong enough to meaningfully bring down unemployment by year`s end. This optimism is based on the belief that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates anytime soon and that the Obama administration and Congress will provide more temporary help to unemployed workers and hard- pressed state and local governments.</p><p>A stronger global economy and softer U.S. dollar will also fuel a revival in export growth. Selling what we produce to the rest of the world will be the principal source of long term growth and this growth driver will kick in this year. While the economy will make its way back this year, it won`t come roaring back. Businesses are no longer panicked, but they remain cautious and will be slow to hire and to invest. A lack of credit is weighing heavily on those small businesses so vital to the job machine. The ongoing foreclosure crisis also threatens to push house prices even lower. The wrongs that led to the financial crisis and great recession are being slowly righted. With a bit more help from policy makers, the current recovery will evolve into a self sustaining economic expansion in 2010. This is Mark Zandi.</p><p>HUDSON: So it`s a new year and as you can seen in this broadcast, we have some new features here at NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, so let me show you around our new home base. It`s called a virtual set and chances are you`ve seen them before. This one was created by our graphic artists and is controlled by a system of computers. If you were here in the studio with me, you`d see I`m actually standing on a big green backdrop. The set and other elements are added in our control room. Now moving to this type of electronic set up lets us give you critical analysis of news stories, stock market information and data, in new ways. It helps us make information visual, more interesting and easy to see at a glance. And it also helps you connect with our content in a clear and concise way. So while there may be fewer stock quotes, there will be more analysis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Beautiful.</p><p>HUDSON: Hope you find it beautiful as well and Susie clearly the presentation has changed, some faces have changed but some things will never change here at NBR.</p><p>GHARIB: You look really good against that green background, yeah, you are right. The good stuff and the important stuff is still here, same mission that we have had for the past 30 years. We want to educate and empower you, our viewers, so that you can make better financial decisions. So keep watching.</p><p>HUDSON: And it`s great to start out on a day with the Dow hitting new 15 month highs, how about that.</p><p>GHARIB: We`ll call it the Tom Hudson effect.</p><p>HUDSON: Yeah, right, OK, you`ll be about the only one that calls it that, maybe you and my mom.</p><p>That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday, January 4. I`m Tom Hudson. Good night to everybody and good night to you too Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: And good night to you Tom. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night, everyone and we hope to see all of you again tomorrow night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

The blue chips rack up a triple digit gain, powered higher by the nation`s factories kicking into higher gear. You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, January 4.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening everyone. Wall Street kicked off 2010 with a rally. The Dow surged over 155 points, the NASDAQ rose 39 and the S&amp;P 500 jumped nearly 18.</p><p>HUDSON: Susie, it was a heck of a run the first trading day, good economic news triggered the buying. Investors encouraged by an upbeat report from the Institute of Supply Management showing those factory orders ramping up, jobs ramping up and prices finally starting to head up as well.</p><p>GHARIB: And comforting comments from Fed chief Bernanke yesterday also helped, implying there`s no hurry to raise interest rates, at least for now. UBS strategist Mike Ryan expects stocks to continue to move higher from here.</p><p>MIKE RYAN, STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: The market I think is moving in anticipation of several events. They`re moving in anticipation of what they believe will be a moderate but sustainable economic recovery. They`re moving in anticipation of an earnings recovery that should have earnings returning towards trend -- not immediately, but slowly returning towards trend and also an environment that remains fairly benign from an inflation standpoint.</p><p>GHARIB: The head of the New York Stock Exchange told me he`s also optimistic about the stock market in 2010. I talked to <person><nameText>Duncan Niederauer </nameText></person>right after the opening bell rang here at the big board and I asked him for his market forecast.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, </nameText></person>CEO, NYSE EURONEXT: I think we`re in such a better place than we were a year ago that it`s hard not to be optimistic. So I`m very constructive about where the market should go from here. We look at our IPO pipeline, it`s pretty solid. I think you`ve got corporate earnings continuing to grow and I think you`ve got a lot of the uncertainty that was really prevailing at this time last year, is out of the way. So I`m pretty optimistic for `010.</p><p>GHARIB: But Duncan I have been talking to a lot of market strategists and even traders right here on the floor. And they`re talking about a correction for 2010.</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I happen to not agree. It`s easy to predict the correction because we`re up, the Dow`s up 60 percent since March, S&amp;P is up more than that, NASDAQ is up 80 percent since March. The indices are all up a lot so I think it`s right to expect a correction. The market feels fairly valued to me. It doesn`t feel overvalued. I think people are going to be much more focused on the economy because I think corporate earnings are going to deliver the goods this year.</p><p>GHARIB: I`m sure you get asked this a lot by individual investors. Is it safe for me to put my money in the stock market? Everybody is still afraid about putting their money in stocks these days. What is going to take to restore investor confidence?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I think it`s about how they feel as a consumer first. So I`m going to be watching the consumer confidence metrics and how the economic recovery is going in `010. Because I think that is what people are now going to focus their attention on. So I think people are going to have to feel more comfortable that their job is more stable, the roof over their head is stable, they can take care of their family and then I think it is a necessary -- that is a necessary step to take before we are going to have people feel better and come back to the equity markets on the retail side.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s talk a little bit about financial regulatory reform. The American public is looking to Congress to pass new rules that hopefully will prevent the financial system from breaking down in the future. What do you like the most? What don`t you like?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I think a lot of what you are going to see from the SEC is directionally correct. It is going to be a lot around market structure. I don`t know if it is necessarily going to be in the category of preventing a crisis. I think the best thing that has been talked about is on the OTC derivative space, more central clearing, more transparency. The thing I`m most worried about on the regulatory side is this talk of a transaction tax which I think would have very, very negative implications for volumes and for the cost of trading for retail investors.</p><p>GHARIB: And this transaction tax would be on trades of stocks and options and futures. Is that a tax really just going to be passed on to investors?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: That`s my view. I`m actually writing a piece right now that I`m going to be distributing in the next couple of weeks. And among the points I make is one of the points you just made Susie, which is it`s absolutely a pass-through tax. This idea, the way it`s been packaged, to sell it to Main Street that it is a tax on Wall Street. It is not a tax on Wall Street. It is a tax on Main Street. It will flow down to the retail investor. It will flow down to the mutual fund holder. It is not going to be paid for by Wall Street.</p><p>GHARIB: Duncan, how do you rate President Obama`s performance in terms of his position on things like banks, financial reform, executive compensation?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I would sum it up this way. We`ve been very pleased with the words that he and the Treasury secretary have spoken. We have given them kudos for the measures they appear to be ready to take. I think now in `010 the proof is in the pudding. Are they actually going to carry out what they say they are going to do and follow through?</p><p>GHARIB: What do you think the president needs to do in 2010 that will restore confidence in American businesses and the markets?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: What the president needs to do is what he started to do a few weeks ago which is call the banks in together and say crisis averted. You guys are well on the road to recovery. Your profitability shows that. Please start lending to small and medium-sized institutions and from our vantage point, the credit market is still predominantly closed to small and medium-sized enterprises and we think it`s critical that he apply pressure in the right places to get that credit flowing freely again.</p><p>GHARIB: You mentioned earlier about IPOs. There is a lot of buzz about a flurry of IPOs and the NYSE and the NASDAQ are lobbying hard to get those listings. How much of it will come your way?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: We operate in a very competitive environment for the listings. We win more than our fair share. We have and I`m very confident will continue to do so. The pipeline we`ve got coming in the next few months dramatically tilted our way. So we`re pretty excited about it.</p><p>GHARIB: This first trading week of the year, we`re talking to the leaders of the nation`s big exchanges. On Wednesday Craig Donohue, CEO of the CME Group in Chicago and then on Thursday, Robert Greifeld, CEO of the NASDAQ OMX. Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Susie, some of the other big stories tonight. Putting away the hammers and the nails at building sites in November. We`ve seen a drop-off in both home building and commercial projects leading to a 0.6 percent drop in construction spending. This is the seventh straight month on the downside.</p><p>Swiss drug maker Novartis is eyeing complete control of eye care company Alcon. Today, Novartis announcing plans to take over Alcon, paying Nestle nearly $39 billion for the 77 percent stake in Alcon that Nestle owns.</p><p>Some good and some bad in what Bank of America`s new CEO Brian Moynihan sees for the future. Forecasters at the bank predict the U.S. economy will grow more than 3 percent this year. But that slow pace also means the unemployment rate will stay high.</p><p>And watch out, above! How about this, the world`s tallest skyscraper now open in Dubai. At 2,717 feet, the Burj Khalifa is named for the leader of the neighboring Abu Dhabi which just pitched in $10 billion to bail Dubai out of its financial crisis.</p><p>GHARIB: An evolution of thinking for the Fed chairman. That`s how political economist Tom Gallagher today characterized this weekend`s remarks we told you about from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Bernanke said low interest rates were not to blame for the housing crisis; a lack of regulation was. Stephanie Dhue spoke with Gallagher about the message the Fed chairman delivered.</p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Bernanke said that sometimes the Fed should use interest rate policy to address bubbles. Do you see the Fed making a move to address emerging markets or commodities?</p><p>TOM GALLAGHER, POLITICAL ECONOMIST, ISI: That is a change on Bernanke`s part. He was very much a part of the Greenspan-led consensus on how monetary policy wants to approach bubbles, which is to say that monetary policy shouldn`t adjust for bubbles at all until it was time to pick up the pieces. Now I think the central banking community is moving toward a view that the central bank should be worried about the development of asset bubbles, primarily know that regulation is the preferred approach. But there are some circumstances in which monetary policy can play a role. So that does reflect a bit of an evolution, his thinking along with the rest of the central banking community during the course of this bubble, this boom-bust cycle. So I think that has been a shift on his part.</p><p>DHUE: Bernanke says that low interest rates weren`t the reason for the housing bubble. Do you see that as a defense of the Greenspan Fed or a defense of the current Fed?</p><p>GALLAGHER: Given that he was there during most of that time period, it was really a defense of the Fed and his own role in it, I think. And I think that he`s on pretty good grounds in arguing that the monetary policy was not being reason for the housing bubble. He defended the Fed`s record by pointing to a defensible calculation on where the Fed funds rate should be. It wasn`t very far from that and he was responding to a lot of criticism that the Fed had unusually low interest rates for a long period of time and that`s what Fed the housing bubble. Instead he presented some calculations that suggested that it was the development of alternative mortgages that produced very low initial monthly payments and that that system is what lead to the housing bubble as both the borrower and lender believed that home prices would continue to rise and they would never have to pay the higher mortgage payments that would be due later on.</p><p>DHUE: Now Bernanke`s faced a lot of criticism as he has gone before the Senate to keep his job. Do you think he`ll be an effective advocate for reform?</p><p>GALLAGHER: Well, I don`t think the views of the Fed chairman are an especially important part of the outcome of this debate. There is a lot of interest groups that are affected by this and they are fighting very hard on this. And I think it`s hard for any Fed chairman to really have a material impact on the outcome of that debate.</p><p>DHUE: And bottom line for investors looking at Bernanke talking about asset bubbles and interest rates, any change here?</p><p>GALLAGHER: No, I thought especially if you take Bernanke`s and Cohen`s speeches together, there wasn`t a lot of guidance on where interest rates are headed in the near-term. But I think that you have to assume, you have to read those speeches as suggesting that not anything is -- that nothing is going to happen any time soon.</p><p>DHUE: And not any time soon, not first quarter, not second quarter.</p><p>GALLAGHER: I think that the Fed is likely to raise interest rates in the third quarter. And I think given how far away that is, that`s still six months away at the earliest, it`s hard to be very specific on that. I think that probably the important action for the financial markets, even more than the rate hike will be when they change the language, the guidance they are giving the markets on interest rates. Right now they are promising to keep interest rates more or less at zero for an extended period of time. When that extended period phrase gets dropped, it is probably when markets start to react and risk assets will probably perform more poorly. When that happens and I suspect that is a second quarter event, and again, so not anything any time soon.</p><p>DHUE: Tom Gallagher, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Thank you.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead on the program, can Google do for mobile phones what it`s done for web searches and advertising? The tech titan gets ready to lift the curtain on its own smart phone.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom as you heard me complain, it`s so very cold here in New York so I`m not surprised that that`s the theme that you`re going to be looking at in your market focus tonight.</p><p>HUDSON: Absolutely. That cold snap that`s really gripping much of the country Susie pushing around energy, even orange juice prices. Plus we`re going to talk about betting on China and some new highs today for the first of the year for some big tech names in our market focus.</p><p>But that Arctic cold air gripping much of the country is sending energy prices up to prices not seen since October. Energy also getting a boost certainly from today`s better than expected manufacturing numbers we told you about earlier.</p><p>So let`s take a look at some of the numbers. Crude oil jumping to over $80 a barrel. In addition to the cold weather, a weaker dollar may have helped out, also a break out over $83 for oil would take it to post- recession highs. Nat gas also catching fire with this cold snap and with the freezing temps reaching down into Florida, even orange juice futures jumping, but ended with only about half of the gains seen earlier in the day. Watch those OJ prices by the way, as futures have doubled in the past year.</p><p>Speaking of the surprise rise in manufacturing activity fueling some hope maybe that the job picture finally may be seeing some improvement. The December jobs reports are due out on Friday of course and the job gains are expected to be seen again in temporary workers, as has been the case over the past four months. Now the temp hiring stocks are already moving, maybe in anticipation.</p><p>Stocks like Manpower (MAN), Robert Half International, Kelly Services (KELVA) seeing a nice bid today. Spherion (SPN) also moving higher by better than 8 1/2 percent. All these stocks hitting multi-week highs ahead of those Friday`s jobs data.</p><p>Early on here already just one day in 2010 looking a lot like 2009, with last year`s leaders helping push the market indices higher. Information technology the single best performing sector throughout all of 2009 and the big guys continue to hit some prices not seen in really about a couple of years. Take a look at some of these longer term charts, two years long here on Cisco (CSCO) breaking out to the upside on this first trading day of the year, running after $25 a share, a price not seen since the summer of 2008. Volume also stronger than normal on today`s move higher.</p><p>How about Microsoft (MSFT), another two-year chart here, continues to find buyers over $30 a share. Today`s buying takes Microsoft to a level shareholders haven`t enjoyed in two years. The rally in these stocks is helpful for many growth mutual fund investors as these stocks tend to be very popular with those kinds of mutual funds.</p><p>Intel (INTC) also getting in the act, jumping to its highest price since October. Brokerage firm Baird upgrading it, calling Intel a quote value and defensive idea and continuing to echo the idea that businesses will be buying new computers in 2010.</p><p>The action in these three stocks comes really just a few days before the beginning of the big consumer electronics show, which spotlights tech trends in the making.</p><p>Speaking of which, watch Apple (AAPL) stock as the \"Wall Street Journal\" tonight quoting sources saying the company will unveil a long- awaited tablet computer at that convention. It could measure 10 to 11 inches and ship out in March around $1,000. Apple stock over $214 a share, $214, is at all-time highs.</p><p>With the market breaking out to these post-recession highs, some market leading sectors have seen mixed performance.</p><p>Thanks to that Intel (INTC) move, semiconductor exchange traded fund leading the way for technology above the range in December.</p><p>The economically sensitive transportation ETF however remains below new highs perhaps kept in check a little bit by oil.</p><p>Financial stocks also turning up but remain well below their October highs.</p><p>Betting on gaming in the new year, how about this, a couple of gambling stocks see big buying volume today. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) jumping more than 9 percent on twice average daily volume. UBS thinking the stock should see $20 a share in the next year. It also raised its rating on Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and that stock responded, up on bigger than usual volume. The price target here $76.</p><p>The analyst likes both casinos based not on what happens in Las Vegas but what could happen in Macau, China. While Vegas revenues are predicted to be flat, UBS thinks gaming in Macau is tracking better than expected.</p><p>And that`s our market focus tonight.</p><p>GHARIB: Could Google have iPhone envy? That`s a question the tech blogs are asking tonight as we wait for an announcement tomorrow from the Internet giant. Google is expected to unwrap its own entry into the smart phone market. But as usual, exactly what the company is up to is less than clear. Scott Gurvey reports.</p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Google phone is one of the worst kept secrets in an industry that doesn`t keep secrets very well. Since the web site Engadget got its hands on what Google is calling the Nexus one, editor-in-chief Joshua Topolsky says the response has been extraordinary.</p><p>JOSHUA TOPOLSKY, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, ENGADGET.COM (BY TELEPHONE): The reaction about this phone has been kind of insane. It`s been phenomenal. And since we put up our hands-on post, there`s been an enormous amount of traffic with people coming to the site to see those pictures and to hear what we had to say about the phone.</p><p>GURVEY: The big question Google will face at tomorrow`s unveiling is, why? Google`s Android operating system already appears on scores of phones including the Motorola Droid recently introduced by Verizon Wireless. The Nexus phone does not appear to make any major improvements on the Droid. And Gene Munster, technology analyst at Piper Jaffray, says Google`s unknown motives are alarming the industry.</p><p>GENE MUNSTER, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: If they put out a phone that shows all the good things that Android can do I think their partners well be happy to see that. If they come out and actually try to grab market share and aggressively price this, I think it`s going to create quite a high level of friction between all the players in the market.</p><p>GURVEY: Rumors about Google`s marketing plans have industry blogs on fire. Price points range from $500 to free. T-Mobile may offer the phone packaged with a two-year contract for $200. Sales of conventional mobile phones have been dropping since the economy tanked. But Apple`s iPhone has remained a strong seller throughout the downturn. And Michael Gikas of \"Consumer Reports,\" says interest in smart phones is jumping as the economy recovers.</p><p>MICHAEL GIKAS, SENIOR EDITOR, CONSUMER REPORTS: Sales of smart phones keep going up and the number one reason is people want these extra features. And they`re going to pay more for them too. Not just for the phones but they`re going to be paying higher monthly premiums for data plans and text messaging and all sorts of other things.</p><p>GURVEY: The Google phone is said to run only on GSM networks. GSM is frequently found in countries overseas but in the United States, this means the Nexus one will only run on the T-Mobile system. Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Here`s what we`re watching for tomorrow. We`ll get a look at the health of the housing sector when the National Association of Realtors release the pending home sales for November. Factory orders for November will be released as well. Also we`ll see how U.S. auto makers fared in December and hear from some car dealers for their take on what will drive the auto industry this year.</p><p>While we won`t know about General Motors` U.S. sales until tomorrow, its sales in China are revving up. The auto maker says last year it sold a record 1.8 vehicles there. That`s up 67 percent. The top selling brands in China were Buick and Chevrolet. And helping things: a government program to defray the cost of buying fuel efficient cars and trucks. Some of those programs are now being phased out, but GM thinks its sales in China are still on track to keep growing down the road.</p><p>HUDSON: Until we make a profit, I won`t take a paycheck. Now, that`s what the new head of Continental Airlines told employees today, Jeff Smisek took the top job Friday after Larry Kellner left to join a private equity firm. Smisek says the tone for business is set at the top, so if everyone wants better pay and benefits, the business needs to make money. That`s not happening now. Continental Air is deep in the red. The carrier lost $367 million in the first nine months of last year.</p><p>GHARIB: Tonight`s commentator thinks we`ll see a better economic reality in 2010. He`s Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody`seconomy.com.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`SECONOMY.COM: For the first time in a very long time, I`m able to say that I`m optimistic about the economy`s prospects. 2010 won`t be a great year. That would be inappropriate given that unemployment will likely remain in the double- digits through much of the year, but it will feel pretty good after what we have been through. Job growth is set to resume in the next few months and will be strong enough to meaningfully bring down unemployment by year`s end. This optimism is based on the belief that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates anytime soon and that the Obama administration and Congress will provide more temporary help to unemployed workers and hard- pressed state and local governments.</p><p>A stronger global economy and softer U.S. dollar will also fuel a revival in export growth. Selling what we produce to the rest of the world will be the principal source of long term growth and this growth driver will kick in this year. While the economy will make its way back this year, it won`t come roaring back. Businesses are no longer panicked, but they remain cautious and will be slow to hire and to invest. A lack of credit is weighing heavily on those small businesses so vital to the job machine. The ongoing foreclosure crisis also threatens to push house prices even lower. The wrongs that led to the financial crisis and great recession are being slowly righted. With a bit more help from policy makers, the current recovery will evolve into a self sustaining economic expansion in 2010. This is Mark Zandi.</p><p>HUDSON: So it`s a new year and as you can seen in this broadcast, we have some new features here at NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, so let me show you around our new home base. It`s called a virtual set and chances are you`ve seen them before. This one was created by our graphic artists and is controlled by a system of computers. If you were here in the studio with me, you`d see I`m actually standing on a big green backdrop. The set and other elements are added in our control room. Now moving to this type of electronic set up lets us give you critical analysis of news stories, stock market information and data, in new ways. It helps us make information visual, more interesting and easy to see at a glance. And it also helps you connect with our content in a clear and concise way. So while there may be fewer stock quotes, there will be more analysis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Beautiful.</p><p>HUDSON: Hope you find it beautiful as well and Susie clearly the presentation has changed, some faces have changed but some things will never change here at NBR.</p><p>GHARIB: You look really good against that green background, yeah, you are right. The good stuff and the important stuff is still here, same mission that we have had for the past 30 years. We want to educate and empower you, our viewers, so that you can make better financial decisions. So keep watching.</p><p>HUDSON: And it`s great to start out on a day with the Dow hitting new 15 month highs, how about that.</p><p>GHARIB: We`ll call it the Tom Hudson effect.</p><p>HUDSON: Yeah, right, OK, you`ll be about the only one that calls it that, maybe you and my mom.</p><p>That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday, January 4. I`m Tom Hudson. Good night to everybody and good night to you too Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: And good night to you Tom. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night, everyone and we hope to see all of you again tomorrow night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

The blue chips rack up a triple digit gain, powered higher by the nation`s factories kicking into higher gear. You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, January 4.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening everyone. Wall Street kicked off 2010 with a rally. The Dow surged over 155 points, the NASDAQ rose 39 and the S&amp;P 500 jumped nearly 18.</p><p>HUDSON: Susie, it was a heck of a run the first trading day, good economic news triggered the buying. Investors encouraged by an upbeat report from the Institute of Supply Management showing those factory orders ramping up, jobs ramping up and prices finally starting to head up as well.</p><p>GHARIB: And comforting comments from Fed chief Bernanke yesterday also helped, implying there`s no hurry to raise interest rates, at least for now. UBS strategist Mike Ryan expects stocks to continue to move higher from here.</p><p>MIKE RYAN, STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: The market I think is moving in anticipation of several events. They`re moving in anticipation of what they believe will be a moderate but sustainable economic recovery. They`re moving in anticipation of an earnings recovery that should have earnings returning towards trend -- not immediately, but slowly returning towards trend and also an environment that remains fairly benign from an inflation standpoint.</p><p>GHARIB: The head of the New York Stock Exchange told me he`s also optimistic about the stock market in 2010. I talked to <person><nameText>Duncan Niederauer </nameText></person>right after the opening bell rang here at the big board and I asked him for his market forecast.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, </nameText></person>CEO, NYSE EURONEXT: I think we`re in such a better place than we were a year ago that it`s hard not to be optimistic. So I`m very constructive about where the market should go from here. We look at our IPO pipeline, it`s pretty solid. I think you`ve got corporate earnings continuing to grow and I think you`ve got a lot of the uncertainty that was really prevailing at this time last year, is out of the way. So I`m pretty optimistic for `010.</p><p>GHARIB: But Duncan I have been talking to a lot of market strategists and even traders right here on the floor. And they`re talking about a correction for 2010.</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I happen to not agree. It`s easy to predict the correction because we`re up, the Dow`s up 60 percent since March, S&amp;P is up more than that, NASDAQ is up 80 percent since March. The indices are all up a lot so I think it`s right to expect a correction. The market feels fairly valued to me. It doesn`t feel overvalued. I think people are going to be much more focused on the economy because I think corporate earnings are going to deliver the goods this year.</p><p>GHARIB: I`m sure you get asked this a lot by individual investors. Is it safe for me to put my money in the stock market? Everybody is still afraid about putting their money in stocks these days. What is going to take to restore investor confidence?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I think it`s about how they feel as a consumer first. So I`m going to be watching the consumer confidence metrics and how the economic recovery is going in `010. Because I think that is what people are now going to focus their attention on. So I think people are going to have to feel more comfortable that their job is more stable, the roof over their head is stable, they can take care of their family and then I think it is a necessary -- that is a necessary step to take before we are going to have people feel better and come back to the equity markets on the retail side.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s talk a little bit about financial regulatory reform. The American public is looking to Congress to pass new rules that hopefully will prevent the financial system from breaking down in the future. What do you like the most? What don`t you like?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I think a lot of what you are going to see from the SEC is directionally correct. It is going to be a lot around market structure. I don`t know if it is necessarily going to be in the category of preventing a crisis. I think the best thing that has been talked about is on the OTC derivative space, more central clearing, more transparency. The thing I`m most worried about on the regulatory side is this talk of a transaction tax which I think would have very, very negative implications for volumes and for the cost of trading for retail investors.</p><p>GHARIB: And this transaction tax would be on trades of stocks and options and futures. Is that a tax really just going to be passed on to investors?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: That`s my view. I`m actually writing a piece right now that I`m going to be distributing in the next couple of weeks. And among the points I make is one of the points you just made Susie, which is it`s absolutely a pass-through tax. This idea, the way it`s been packaged, to sell it to Main Street that it is a tax on Wall Street. It is not a tax on Wall Street. It is a tax on Main Street. It will flow down to the retail investor. It will flow down to the mutual fund holder. It is not going to be paid for by Wall Street.</p><p>GHARIB: Duncan, how do you rate President Obama`s performance in terms of his position on things like banks, financial reform, executive compensation?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I would sum it up this way. We`ve been very pleased with the words that he and the Treasury secretary have spoken. We have given them kudos for the measures they appear to be ready to take. I think now in `010 the proof is in the pudding. Are they actually going to carry out what they say they are going to do and follow through?</p><p>GHARIB: What do you think the president needs to do in 2010 that will restore confidence in American businesses and the markets?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: What the president needs to do is what he started to do a few weeks ago which is call the banks in together and say crisis averted. You guys are well on the road to recovery. Your profitability shows that. Please start lending to small and medium-sized institutions and from our vantage point, the credit market is still predominantly closed to small and medium-sized enterprises and we think it`s critical that he apply pressure in the right places to get that credit flowing freely again.</p><p>GHARIB: You mentioned earlier about IPOs. There is a lot of buzz about a flurry of IPOs and the NYSE and the NASDAQ are lobbying hard to get those listings. How much of it will come your way?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: We operate in a very competitive environment for the listings. We win more than our fair share. We have and I`m very confident will continue to do so. The pipeline we`ve got coming in the next few months dramatically tilted our way. So we`re pretty excited about it.</p><p>GHARIB: This first trading week of the year, we`re talking to the leaders of the nation`s big exchanges. On Wednesday Craig Donohue, CEO of the CME Group in Chicago and then on Thursday, Robert Greifeld, CEO of the NASDAQ OMX. Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Susie, some of the other big stories tonight. Putting away the hammers and the nails at building sites in November. We`ve seen a drop-off in both home building and commercial projects leading to a 0.6 percent drop in construction spending. This is the seventh straight month on the downside.</p><p>Swiss drug maker Novartis is eyeing complete control of eye care company Alcon. Today, Novartis announcing plans to take over Alcon, paying Nestle nearly $39 billion for the 77 percent stake in Alcon that Nestle owns.</p><p>Some good and some bad in what Bank of America`s new CEO Brian Moynihan sees for the future. Forecasters at the bank predict the U.S. economy will grow more than 3 percent this year. But that slow pace also means the unemployment rate will stay high.</p><p>And watch out, above! How about this, the world`s tallest skyscraper now open in Dubai. At 2,717 feet, the Burj Khalifa is named for the leader of the neighboring Abu Dhabi which just pitched in $10 billion to bail Dubai out of its financial crisis.</p><p>GHARIB: An evolution of thinking for the Fed chairman. That`s how political economist Tom Gallagher today characterized this weekend`s remarks we told you about from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Bernanke said low interest rates were not to blame for the housing crisis; a lack of regulation was. Stephanie Dhue spoke with Gallagher about the message the Fed chairman delivered.</p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Bernanke said that sometimes the Fed should use interest rate policy to address bubbles. Do you see the Fed making a move to address emerging markets or commodities?</p><p>TOM GALLAGHER, POLITICAL ECONOMIST, ISI: That is a change on Bernanke`s part. He was very much a part of the Greenspan-led consensus on how monetary policy wants to approach bubbles, which is to say that monetary policy shouldn`t adjust for bubbles at all until it was time to pick up the pieces. Now I think the central banking community is moving toward a view that the central bank should be worried about the development of asset bubbles, primarily know that regulation is the preferred approach. But there are some circumstances in which monetary policy can play a role. So that does reflect a bit of an evolution, his thinking along with the rest of the central banking community during the course of this bubble, this boom-bust cycle. So I think that has been a shift on his part.</p><p>DHUE: Bernanke says that low interest rates weren`t the reason for the housing bubble. Do you see that as a defense of the Greenspan Fed or a defense of the current Fed?</p><p>GALLAGHER: Given that he was there during most of that time period, it was really a defense of the Fed and his own role in it, I think. And I think that he`s on pretty good grounds in arguing that the monetary policy was not being reason for the housing bubble. He defended the Fed`s record by pointing to a defensible calculation on where the Fed funds rate should be. It wasn`t very far from that and he was responding to a lot of criticism that the Fed had unusually low interest rates for a long period of time and that`s what Fed the housing bubble. Instead he presented some calculations that suggested that it was the development of alternative mortgages that produced very low initial monthly payments and that that system is what lead to the housing bubble as both the borrower and lender believed that home prices would continue to rise and they would never have to pay the higher mortgage payments that would be due later on.</p><p>DHUE: Now Bernanke`s faced a lot of criticism as he has gone before the Senate to keep his job. Do you think he`ll be an effective advocate for reform?</p><p>GALLAGHER: Well, I don`t think the views of the Fed chairman are an especially important part of the outcome of this debate. There is a lot of interest groups that are affected by this and they are fighting very hard on this. And I think it`s hard for any Fed chairman to really have a material impact on the outcome of that debate.</p><p>DHUE: And bottom line for investors looking at Bernanke talking about asset bubbles and interest rates, any change here?</p><p>GALLAGHER: No, I thought especially if you take Bernanke`s and Cohen`s speeches together, there wasn`t a lot of guidance on where interest rates are headed in the near-term. But I think that you have to assume, you have to read those speeches as suggesting that not anything is -- that nothing is going to happen any time soon.</p><p>DHUE: And not any time soon, not first quarter, not second quarter.</p><p>GALLAGHER: I think that the Fed is likely to raise interest rates in the third quarter. And I think given how far away that is, that`s still six months away at the earliest, it`s hard to be very specific on that. I think that probably the important action for the financial markets, even more than the rate hike will be when they change the language, the guidance they are giving the markets on interest rates. Right now they are promising to keep interest rates more or less at zero for an extended period of time. When that extended period phrase gets dropped, it is probably when markets start to react and risk assets will probably perform more poorly. When that happens and I suspect that is a second quarter event, and again, so not anything any time soon.</p><p>DHUE: Tom Gallagher, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Thank you.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead on the program, can Google do for mobile phones what it`s done for web searches and advertising? The tech titan gets ready to lift the curtain on its own smart phone.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom as you heard me complain, it`s so very cold here in New York so I`m not surprised that that`s the theme that you`re going to be looking at in your market focus tonight.</p><p>HUDSON: Absolutely. That cold snap that`s really gripping much of the country Susie pushing around energy, even orange juice prices. Plus we`re going to talk about betting on China and some new highs today for the first of the year for some big tech names in our market focus.</p><p>But that Arctic cold air gripping much of the country is sending energy prices up to prices not seen since October. Energy also getting a boost certainly from today`s better than expected manufacturing numbers we told you about earlier.</p><p>So let`s take a look at some of the numbers. Crude oil jumping to over $80 a barrel. In addition to the cold weather, a weaker dollar may have helped out, also a break out over $83 for oil would take it to post- recession highs. Nat gas also catching fire with this cold snap and with the freezing temps reaching down into Florida, even orange juice futures jumping, but ended with only about half of the gains seen earlier in the day. Watch those OJ prices by the way, as futures have doubled in the past year.</p><p>Speaking of the surprise rise in manufacturing activity fueling some hope maybe that the job picture finally may be seeing some improvement. The December jobs reports are due out on Friday of course and the job gains are expected to be seen again in temporary workers, as has been the case over the past four months. Now the temp hiring stocks are already moving, maybe in anticipation.</p><p>Stocks like Manpower (MAN), Robert Half International, Kelly Services (KELVA) seeing a nice bid today. Spherion (SPN) also moving higher by better than 8 1/2 percent. All these stocks hitting multi-week highs ahead of those Friday`s jobs data.</p><p>Early on here already just one day in 2010 looking a lot like 2009, with last year`s leaders helping push the market indices higher. Information technology the single best performing sector throughout all of 2009 and the big guys continue to hit some prices not seen in really about a couple of years. Take a look at some of these longer term charts, two years long here on Cisco (CSCO) breaking out to the upside on this first trading day of the year, running after $25 a share, a price not seen since the summer of 2008. Volume also stronger than normal on today`s move higher.</p><p>How about Microsoft (MSFT), another two-year chart here, continues to find buyers over $30 a share. Today`s buying takes Microsoft to a level shareholders haven`t enjoyed in two years. The rally in these stocks is helpful for many growth mutual fund investors as these stocks tend to be very popular with those kinds of mutual funds.</p><p>Intel (INTC) also getting in the act, jumping to its highest price since October. Brokerage firm Baird upgrading it, calling Intel a quote value and defensive idea and continuing to echo the idea that businesses will be buying new computers in 2010.</p><p>The action in these three stocks comes really just a few days before the beginning of the big consumer electronics show, which spotlights tech trends in the making.</p><p>Speaking of which, watch Apple (AAPL) stock as the \"Wall Street Journal\" tonight quoting sources saying the company will unveil a long- awaited tablet computer at that convention. It could measure 10 to 11 inches and ship out in March around $1,000. Apple stock over $214 a share, $214, is at all-time highs.</p><p>With the market breaking out to these post-recession highs, some market leading sectors have seen mixed performance.</p><p>Thanks to that Intel (INTC) move, semiconductor exchange traded fund leading the way for technology above the range in December.</p><p>The economically sensitive transportation ETF however remains below new highs perhaps kept in check a little bit by oil.</p><p>Financial stocks also turning up but remain well below their October highs.</p><p>Betting on gaming in the new year, how about this, a couple of gambling stocks see big buying volume today. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) jumping more than 9 percent on twice average daily volume. UBS thinking the stock should see $20 a share in the next year. It also raised its rating on Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and that stock responded, up on bigger than usual volume. The price target here $76.</p><p>The analyst likes both casinos based not on what happens in Las Vegas but what could happen in Macau, China. While Vegas revenues are predicted to be flat, UBS thinks gaming in Macau is tracking better than expected.</p><p>And that`s our market focus tonight.</p><p>GHARIB: Could Google have iPhone envy? That`s a question the tech blogs are asking tonight as we wait for an announcement tomorrow from the Internet giant. Google is expected to unwrap its own entry into the smart phone market. But as usual, exactly what the company is up to is less than clear. Scott Gurvey reports.</p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Google phone is one of the worst kept secrets in an industry that doesn`t keep secrets very well. Since the web site Engadget got its hands on what Google is calling the Nexus one, editor-in-chief Joshua Topolsky says the response has been extraordinary.</p><p>JOSHUA TOPOLSKY, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, ENGADGET.COM (BY TELEPHONE): The reaction about this phone has been kind of insane. It`s been phenomenal. And since we put up our hands-on post, there`s been an enormous amount of traffic with people coming to the site to see those pictures and to hear what we had to say about the phone.</p><p>GURVEY: The big question Google will face at tomorrow`s unveiling is, why? Google`s Android operating system already appears on scores of phones including the Motorola Droid recently introduced by Verizon Wireless. The Nexus phone does not appear to make any major improvements on the Droid. And Gene Munster, technology analyst at Piper Jaffray, says Google`s unknown motives are alarming the industry.</p><p>GENE MUNSTER, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: If they put out a phone that shows all the good things that Android can do I think their partners well be happy to see that. If they come out and actually try to grab market share and aggressively price this, I think it`s going to create quite a high level of friction between all the players in the market.</p><p>GURVEY: Rumors about Google`s marketing plans have industry blogs on fire. Price points range from $500 to free. T-Mobile may offer the phone packaged with a two-year contract for $200. Sales of conventional mobile phones have been dropping since the economy tanked. But Apple`s iPhone has remained a strong seller throughout the downturn. And Michael Gikas of \"Consumer Reports,\" says interest in smart phones is jumping as the economy recovers.</p><p>MICHAEL GIKAS, SENIOR EDITOR, CONSUMER REPORTS: Sales of smart phones keep going up and the number one reason is people want these extra features. And they`re going to pay more for them too. Not just for the phones but they`re going to be paying higher monthly premiums for data plans and text messaging and all sorts of other things.</p><p>GURVEY: The Google phone is said to run only on GSM networks. GSM is frequently found in countries overseas but in the United States, this means the Nexus one will only run on the T-Mobile system. Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Here`s what we`re watching for tomorrow. We`ll get a look at the health of the housing sector when the National Association of Realtors release the pending home sales for November. Factory orders for November will be released as well. Also we`ll see how U.S. auto makers fared in December and hear from some car dealers for their take on what will drive the auto industry this year.</p><p>While we won`t know about General Motors` U.S. sales until tomorrow, its sales in China are revving up. The auto maker says last year it sold a record 1.8 vehicles there. That`s up 67 percent. The top selling brands in China were Buick and Chevrolet. And helping things: a government program to defray the cost of buying fuel efficient cars and trucks. Some of those programs are now being phased out, but GM thinks its sales in China are still on track to keep growing down the road.</p><p>HUDSON: Until we make a profit, I won`t take a paycheck. Now, that`s what the new head of Continental Airlines told employees today, Jeff Smisek took the top job Friday after Larry Kellner left to join a private equity firm. Smisek says the tone for business is set at the top, so if everyone wants better pay and benefits, the business needs to make money. That`s not happening now. Continental Air is deep in the red. The carrier lost $367 million in the first nine months of last year.</p><p>GHARIB: Tonight`s commentator thinks we`ll see a better economic reality in 2010. He`s Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody`seconomy.com.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`SECONOMY.COM: For the first time in a very long time, I`m able to say that I`m optimistic about the economy`s prospects. 2010 won`t be a great year. That would be inappropriate given that unemployment will likely remain in the double- digits through much of the year, but it will feel pretty good after what we have been through. Job growth is set to resume in the next few months and will be strong enough to meaningfully bring down unemployment by year`s end. This optimism is based on the belief that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates anytime soon and that the Obama administration and Congress will provide more temporary help to unemployed workers and hard- pressed state and local governments.</p><p>A stronger global economy and softer U.S. dollar will also fuel a revival in export growth. Selling what we produce to the rest of the world will be the principal source of long term growth and this growth driver will kick in this year. While the economy will make its way back this year, it won`t come roaring back. Businesses are no longer panicked, but they remain cautious and will be slow to hire and to invest. A lack of credit is weighing heavily on those small businesses so vital to the job machine. The ongoing foreclosure crisis also threatens to push house prices even lower. The wrongs that led to the financial crisis and great recession are being slowly righted. With a bit more help from policy makers, the current recovery will evolve into a self sustaining economic expansion in 2010. This is Mark Zandi.</p><p>HUDSON: So it`s a new year and as you can seen in this broadcast, we have some new features here at NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, so let me show you around our new home base. It`s called a virtual set and chances are you`ve seen them before. This one was created by our graphic artists and is controlled by a system of computers. If you were here in the studio with me, you`d see I`m actually standing on a big green backdrop. The set and other elements are added in our control room. Now moving to this type of electronic set up lets us give you critical analysis of news stories, stock market information and data, in new ways. It helps us make information visual, more interesting and easy to see at a glance. And it also helps you connect with our content in a clear and concise way. So while there may be fewer stock quotes, there will be more analysis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Beautiful.</p><p>HUDSON: Hope you find it beautiful as well and Susie clearly the presentation has changed, some faces have changed but some things will never change here at NBR.</p><p>GHARIB: You look really good against that green background, yeah, you are right. The good stuff and the important stuff is still here, same mission that we have had for the past 30 years. We want to educate and empower you, our viewers, so that you can make better financial decisions. So keep watching.</p><p>HUDSON: And it`s great to start out on a day with the Dow hitting new 15 month highs, how about that.</p><p>GHARIB: We`ll call it the Tom Hudson effect.</p><p>HUDSON: Yeah, right, OK, you`ll be about the only one that calls it that, maybe you and my mom.</p><p>That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday, January 4. I`m Tom Hudson. Good night to everybody and good night to you too Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: And good night to you Tom. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night, everyone and we hope to see all of you again tomorrow night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

The blue chips  rack up a triple digit gain, powered higher by the nation`s factories  kicking into higher gear.  You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for  Monday, January 4.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB:  Good evening everyone.  Wall Street kicked off 2010 with a  rally.  The Dow surged over 155 points, the NASDAQ rose 39 and the S&amp;P 500  jumped nearly 18. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Susie, it was a heck of a run the first trading day, good  economic news triggered the buying.  Investors encouraged by an upbeat  report from the Institute of Supply Management showing those factory orders  ramping up, jobs ramping up and prices finally starting to head up as well. </p><p>  GHARIB:  And comforting comments from Fed chief Bernanke yesterday  also helped, implying there`s no hurry to raise interest rates, at least  for now.  UBS strategist Mike Ryan expects stocks to continue to move  higher from here. </p><p>  MIKE RYAN, STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  The market I think is  moving in anticipation of several events.  They`re moving in anticipation  of what they believe will be a moderate but sustainable economic recovery.   They`re moving in anticipation of an earnings recovery that should have  earnings returning towards trend -- not immediately, but slowly returning  towards trend and also an environment that remains fairly benign from an  inflation standpoint. </p><p>  GHARIB:  The head of the New York Stock Exchange told me he`s also  optimistic about the stock market in 2010.  I talked to Duncan Niederauer  right after the opening bell rang here at the big board and I asked him for  his market forecast. </p><p>  DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, CEO, NYSE EURONEXT:  I think we`re in such a better  place than we were a year ago that it`s hard not to be optimistic.  So I`m  very constructive about where the market should go from here.  We look at  our IPO pipeline, it`s pretty solid.  I think you`ve got corporate earnings  continuing to grow and I think you`ve got a lot of the uncertainty that was  really prevailing at this time last year, is out of the way. So I`m pretty  optimistic for `010. </p><p>  GHARIB:  But Duncan I have been talking to a lot of market strategists  and even traders right here on the floor.  And they`re talking about a  correction for 2010. </p><p>  NIEDERAUER:  I happen to not agree.  It`s easy to predict the  correction because we`re up, the Dow`s up 60 percent since March, S&amp;P is up  more than that, NASDAQ is up 80 percent since March.  The indices are all  up a lot so I think it`s right to expect a correction.  The market feels  fairly valued to me.  It doesn`t feel overvalued.  I think people are going  to be much more focused on the economy because I think corporate earnings  are going to deliver the goods this year. </p><p>  GHARIB:  I`m sure you get asked this a lot by individual investors.   Is it safe for me to put my money in the stock market?  Everybody is still  afraid about putting their money in stocks these days.  What is going to  take to restore investor confidence? </p><p>  NIEDERAUER:  I think it`s about how they feel as a consumer first.  So  I`m going to be watching the consumer confidence metrics and how the  economic recovery is going in `010. Because I think that is what people are  now going to focus their attention on.  So I think people are going to have  to feel more comfortable that their job is more stable, the roof over their  head is stable, they can take care of their family and then I think it is a  necessary -- that is a necessary step to take before we are going to have  people feel better and come back to the equity markets on the retail side. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Let`s talk a little bit about financial regulatory reform.   The American public is looking to Congress to pass new rules that hopefully  will prevent the financial system from breaking down in the future.  What  do you like the most? What don`t you like? </p><p>  NIEDERAUER:  I think a lot of what you are going to see from the SEC  is directionally correct.  It is going to be a lot around market structure.   I don`t know if it is necessarily going to be in the category of preventing  a crisis.  I think the best thing that has been talked about is on the OTC  derivative space, more central clearing, more transparency. The thing I`m  most worried about on the regulatory side is this talk of a transaction tax  which I think would have very, very negative implications for volumes and  for the cost of trading for retail investors. </p><p>  GHARIB:  And this transaction tax would be on trades of stocks and  options and futures.  Is that a tax really just going to be passed on to  investors? </p><p>  NIEDERAUER:  That`s my view.  I`m actually writing a piece right now  that I`m going to be distributing in the next couple of weeks.  And among  the points I make is one of the points you just made Susie, which is it`s  absolutely a pass-through tax.  This idea, the way it`s been packaged, to  sell it to Main Street that it is a tax on Wall Street.  It is not a tax on  Wall Street.  It is a tax on Main Street.  It will flow down to the retail  investor.  It will flow down to the mutual fund holder.  It is not going to  be paid for by Wall Street. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Duncan, how do you rate President Obama`s performance in  terms of his position on things like banks, financial reform, executive  compensation? </p><p>  NIEDERAUER:  I would sum it up this way. We`ve been very pleased with  the words that he and the Treasury secretary have spoken.  We have given  them kudos for the measures they appear to be ready to take.  I think now  in `010 the proof is in the pudding.  Are they actually going to carry out  what they say they are going to do and follow through? </p><p>  GHARIB:  What do you think the president needs to do in 2010 that will  restore confidence in American businesses and the markets? </p><p>  NIEDERAUER:  What the president needs to do is what he started to do a  few weeks ago which is call the banks in together and say crisis averted.   You guys are well on the road to recovery.  Your profitability shows that.   Please start lending to small and medium-sized institutions and from our  vantage point, the credit market is still predominantly closed to small and  medium-sized enterprises and we think it`s critical that he apply pressure  in the right places to get that credit flowing freely again. </p><p>  GHARIB:  You mentioned earlier about IPOs.  There is a lot of buzz  about a flurry of IPOs and the NYSE and the NASDAQ are lobbying hard to get  those listings.  How much of it will come your way? </p><p>  NIEDERAUER:  We operate in a very competitive environment for the  listings.  We win more than our fair share.  We have and I`m very confident  will continue to do so.  The pipeline we`ve got coming in the next few  months dramatically tilted our way.  So we`re pretty excited about it.</p><p>  GHARIB:  This first trading week of the year, we`re talking to the  leaders of the nation`s big exchanges.  On Wednesday Craig Donohue, CEO of  the CME Group in Chicago and then on Thursday, Robert Greifeld, CEO of the  NASDAQ OMX.  Tom. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Susie, some of the other big stories tonight.   Putting away  the hammers and the nails at building sites in November.  We`ve seen a  drop-off in both home building and commercial projects leading to a 0.6  percent drop in construction spending.  This is the seventh straight month  on the downside. </p><p>       Swiss drug maker Novartis is eyeing complete control of eye care  company Alcon.  Today, Novartis announcing plans to take over Alcon, paying  Nestle nearly $39 billion for the 77 percent stake in Alcon that Nestle  owns. </p><p>       Some good and some bad in what Bank of America`s new CEO Brian  Moynihan sees for the future.  Forecasters at the bank predict the U.S.  economy will grow more than 3 percent this year. But that slow pace also  means the unemployment rate will stay high. </p><p>       And watch out, above! How about this, the world`s tallest skyscraper  now open in Dubai. At 2,717 feet, the Burj Khalifa is named for the leader  of the neighboring Abu Dhabi which just pitched in $10 billion to bail  Dubai out of its financial crisis. </p><p>       GHARIB:  An evolution of thinking for the Fed chairman. That`s how  political economist Tom Gallagher today characterized this weekend`s  remarks we told you about from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.  Bernanke said  low interest rates were not to blame for the housing crisis; a lack of  regulation was.  Stephanie Dhue spoke with Gallagher about the message the  Fed chairman delivered. </p><p>  STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Bernanke said  that sometimes the Fed should use interest rate policy to address bubbles.   Do you see the Fed making a move to address emerging markets or  commodities? </p><p>  TOM GALLAGHER, POLITICAL ECONOMIST, ISI:  That is a change on  Bernanke`s part.  He was very much a part of the Greenspan-led consensus on  how monetary policy wants to approach bubbles, which is to say that  monetary policy shouldn`t adjust for bubbles at all until it was time to  pick up the pieces.  Now I think the central banking community is moving  toward a view that the central bank should be worried about the development  of asset bubbles, primarily know that regulation is the preferred approach.  But there are some circumstances in which monetary policy can play a role.   So that does reflect a bit of an evolution, his thinking along with the  rest of the central banking community during the course of this bubble,  this boom-bust cycle. So I think that has been a shift on his part. </p><p>  DHUE:  Bernanke says that low interest rates weren`t the reason for  the housing bubble.  Do you see that as a defense of the Greenspan Fed or a  defense of the current Fed? </p><p>  GALLAGHER:  Given that he was there during most of that time period,  it was really a defense of the Fed and his own role in it, I think.  And I  think that he`s on pretty good grounds in arguing that the monetary policy  was not being reason for the housing bubble.  He defended the Fed`s record  by pointing to a defensible calculation on where the Fed funds rate should  be.  It wasn`t very far from that and he was responding to a lot of  criticism that the Fed had unusually low interest rates for a long period  of time and that`s what Fed the housing bubble.  Instead he presented some  calculations that suggested that it was the development of alternative  mortgages that produced very low initial monthly payments and that that  system is what lead to the housing bubble as both the borrower and lender  believed that home prices would continue to rise and they would never have  to pay the higher mortgage payments that would be due later on. </p><p>  DHUE:  Now Bernanke`s faced a lot of criticism as he has gone before  the Senate to keep his job.  Do you think he`ll be an effective advocate  for reform? </p><p>  GALLAGHER:  Well, I don`t think the views of the Fed chairman are an  especially important part of the outcome of this debate.  There is a lot of  interest groups that are affected by this  and they are fighting very hard  on this.  And I think it`s hard for any Fed chairman to really have a  material impact on the outcome of that debate. </p><p>  DHUE:  And bottom line for investors looking at Bernanke talking about  asset bubbles and interest rates, any change here? </p><p>  GALLAGHER:  No, I thought especially if you take Bernanke`s and  Cohen`s speeches together, there wasn`t a lot of guidance on where interest  rates are headed in the near-term.  But I think that you have to assume,  you have to read those speeches as suggesting that not anything is -- that  nothing is going to happen any time soon. </p><p>  DHUE:  And not any time soon, not first quarter, not second quarter. </p><p>  GALLAGHER:  I think that the Fed is likely to raise interest rates in  the third quarter.  And I think given how far away that is, that`s still  six months away at the earliest, it`s hard to be very specific on that.  I  think that probably the important action for the financial markets, even  more than the rate hike will be when they change the language, the guidance  they are giving the markets on interest rates.  Right now they are  promising to keep interest rates more or less at zero for an extended  period of time.  When that extended period phrase gets dropped, it is  probably when markets start to react and risk assets will probably perform  more poorly.  When that happens and I suspect that is a second quarter  event, and again, so not anything any time soon. </p><p>  DHUE:  Tom Gallagher, thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>  GALLAGHER:  Thank you.</p><p>  HUDSON:  Still ahead on the program, can Google do for mobile phones  what it`s done for web searches and advertising? The tech titan gets ready  to lift the curtain on its own smart phone. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Tom as you heard me complain, it`s so very cold here in New  York so I`m not surprised that that`s the theme that you`re going to be   looking at in your market focus tonight. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Absolutely.  That cold snap that`s really gripping much of  the country Susie pushing around energy, even orange juice prices.  Plus  we`re going to talk about betting on China and some new highs today for the  first of the year for some big tech names in our market focus. </p><p>       But that Arctic cold air gripping much of the country is sending  energy prices up to prices not seen since October.   Energy also getting a  boost certainly from today`s better than expected manufacturing numbers we  told you about earlier.</p><p>  So let`s take a look at some of the numbers. Crude oil jumping to over  $80 a barrel.  In addition to the cold weather, a weaker dollar may have  helped out, also a break out over $83 for oil would take it to post- recession highs.  Nat gas also catching fire with this cold snap and with  the freezing temps reaching down into Florida, even orange juice futures  jumping, but ended with only about half of the gains seen earlier in the  day.  Watch those OJ prices by the way, as futures have doubled in the past  year.</p><p>  Speaking of the surprise rise in manufacturing activity fueling some  hope maybe that the job picture finally may be seeing some improvement.   The December jobs reports are due out on Friday of course and the job gains  are expected to be seen again in temporary workers, as has been the case  over the past four months.  Now the temp hiring stocks are already moving,  maybe in anticipation.</p><p>  Stocks like Manpower (MAN), Robert Half International, Kelly Services  (KELVA) seeing a nice bid today. Spherion (SPN) also moving higher by  better than 8 1/2 percent.  All these stocks hitting multi-week highs ahead  of those Friday`s jobs data.</p><p>  Early on here already just one day in 2010 looking a lot like 2009,  with last year`s leaders helping push the market indices higher.   Information technology the single best performing sector throughout all of  2009 and the big guys continue to hit some prices not seen in really about  a couple of years. Take a look at some of these longer term charts, two  years long here on Cisco (CSCO) breaking out to the upside on this first  trading day of the year, running after $25 a share, a price not seen since  the summer of 2008.  Volume also  stronger than normal on today`s move  higher.</p><p>  How about Microsoft (MSFT), another two-year chart here, continues to  find buyers over $30 a share.   Today`s buying takes Microsoft to a level  shareholders haven`t enjoyed in two years. The rally in these stocks is  helpful for many growth mutual fund investors as these stocks tend to be  very popular with those kinds of mutual funds.</p><p>  Intel (INTC) also getting in the act, jumping to its highest price  since October.  Brokerage firm Baird upgrading it, calling Intel a quote  value and defensive idea and continuing to echo the idea that businesses  will be buying new computers in 2010.</p><p>  The action in these three stocks comes really just a few days before  the beginning of the big consumer electronics show, which spotlights tech  trends in the making.</p><p>  Speaking of which, watch Apple (AAPL) stock as the \"Wall Street  Journal\" tonight quoting sources saying the company will unveil a long- awaited tablet computer at that convention.  It could measure 10 to 11  inches and ship out in March around $1,000.  Apple stock over $214 a share,  $214, is at all-time highs.</p><p>  With the market breaking out to these post-recession highs, some  market leading sectors have seen mixed performance.</p><p>  Thanks to that Intel (INTC) move, semiconductor exchange traded fund  leading the way for technology above the range in December.</p><p>  The economically sensitive transportation ETF however remains below  new highs perhaps kept in check a little bit by oil.</p><p>  Financial stocks also turning up but remain well below their October  highs.</p><p>  Betting on gaming in the new year, how about this, a couple of  gambling stocks see big buying volume today.  Las Vegas Sands (LVS) jumping  more than 9 percent on twice average daily volume.  UBS thinking the stock  should see $20 a share in the next year.  It also raised its rating on Wynn  Resorts (WYNN) and that stock responded, up on bigger than usual volume.    The price target here $76.</p><p>  The analyst likes both casinos based not on what happens in Las Vegas  but what could happen in Macau, China.   While Vegas revenues are predicted  to be flat, UBS thinks gaming in Macau is tracking better than expected.</p><p>  And that`s our market focus tonight.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Could Google have iPhone envy?  That`s a question the tech  blogs are asking tonight as we wait for an announcement tomorrow from the  Internet giant.  Google is expected to unwrap its own entry into the smart  phone market.  But as usual, exactly what the company is up to is less than  clear.  Scott Gurvey reports. </p><p>  SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Google phone  is one of the worst kept secrets in an industry that doesn`t keep secrets  very well.  Since the web site Engadget got its hands on what Google is  calling the Nexus one, editor-in-chief Joshua Topolsky says the response  has been extraordinary. </p><p>  JOSHUA TOPOLSKY, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, ENGADGET.COM (BY TELEPHONE): The  reaction about this phone has been kind of insane.  It`s been phenomenal.  And since we put up our hands-on post, there`s been an enormous amount of  traffic with people coming to the site to see those pictures and to hear  what we had to say about the phone. </p><p>  GURVEY: The big question Google will face at tomorrow`s unveiling is,  why?  Google`s Android operating system already appears on scores of phones  including the Motorola Droid recently introduced by Verizon Wireless.  The  Nexus phone does not appear to make any major improvements on the Droid.   And Gene Munster, technology analyst at Piper Jaffray, says Google`s  unknown motives are alarming the industry. </p><p>   GENE MUNSTER, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY:  If they put out a  phone that shows all the good things that Android can do I think their  partners well be happy to see that.  If they come out and actually try to  grab market share and aggressively price this, I think it`s going to create  quite a high level of friction between all the players in the market. </p><p>  GURVEY:  Rumors about Google`s marketing plans have industry blogs on  fire.  Price points range from $500 to free.  T-Mobile may offer the phone  packaged with a two-year contract for $200.  Sales of conventional mobile  phones have been dropping since the economy tanked.  But Apple`s iPhone has  remained a strong seller throughout the downturn.  And Michael Gikas of  \"Consumer Reports,\" says interest in smart phones is jumping as the economy  recovers. </p><p>   MICHAEL GIKAS, SENIOR EDITOR, CONSUMER REPORTS:  Sales of smart phones  keep going up and the number one reason is people want these extra  features.  And they`re going to pay more for them too. Not just for the  phones but they`re going to be paying higher monthly premiums for data  plans and text messaging and all sorts of other things. </p><p>  GURVEY:  The Google phone is said to run only on GSM networks. GSM is  frequently found in countries overseas but in the United States, this means  the Nexus one will only run on the T-Mobile system.  Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Here`s what we`re watching for tomorrow.  We`ll get a look at  the health of the housing sector when the National Association of Realtors  release the pending home sales for November.  Factory orders for November  will be released as well.  Also we`ll see how U.S. auto makers fared in  December and hear from some car dealers for their take on what will drive  the auto industry this year. </p><p>  While we won`t know about General Motors` U.S. sales until tomorrow,  its sales in China are revving up. The auto maker says last year it sold a  record 1.8 vehicles there.  That`s up 67 percent.  The top selling brands  in China were Buick and Chevrolet.  And helping things: a government  program to defray the cost of buying fuel efficient cars and trucks.  Some  of those programs are now being phased out, but GM thinks its sales in  China are still on track to keep growing down the road. </p><p>  HUDSON: Until we make a profit, I won`t take a paycheck.  Now, that`s  what the new head of Continental Airlines told employees today,  Jeff  Smisek took the top job Friday after Larry Kellner left to join a private  equity firm.  Smisek says the tone for business is set at the top, so if  everyone wants better pay and benefits, the business needs to make money.   That`s not happening now.  Continental Air is deep in the red.  The carrier  lost $367 million in the first nine months of last year. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Tonight`s commentator thinks we`ll see a better economic  reality in 2010.  He`s Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody`seconomy.com. </p><p>  MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`SECONOMY.COM:  For the first time  in a very long time, I`m able to say that I`m optimistic about the  economy`s prospects.  2010 won`t be a great year.  That would be  inappropriate given that unemployment will likely remain in the double- digits through much of the year, but it will feel pretty good after what we  have been through.  Job growth is set to resume in the next few months and  will be strong enough to meaningfully bring down unemployment by year`s  end.  This optimism is based on the belief that the Federal Reserve will  not raise interest rates anytime soon and that the Obama administration and  Congress will provide more temporary help to unemployed workers and hard- pressed state and local governments. </p><p>        A stronger global economy and softer U.S. dollar will also fuel a  revival in export growth.  Selling what we produce to the rest of the world  will be the principal source of long term growth and this growth driver  will kick in this year.  While the economy will make its way back this  year, it won`t come roaring back.  Businesses are no longer panicked, but  they remain cautious and will be slow to hire and to invest. A lack of  credit is weighing heavily on those small businesses so vital to the job  machine.  The ongoing foreclosure crisis also threatens to push house  prices even lower. The wrongs that led to the financial crisis and great  recession are being slowly righted.  With a bit more help from policy  makers, the current recovery will evolve into a self sustaining economic  expansion in 2010.  This is Mark Zandi. </p><p>  HUDSON:  So it`s a new year and as you can seen in this broadcast, we  have some new features here at NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, so let me show you  around our new home base. It`s called a virtual set and chances are you`ve  seen them before.  This one was created by our graphic artists and is  controlled by a system of computers.  If you were here in the studio with  me, you`d see I`m actually standing on a big green backdrop.  The set and  other elements are added in our control room.  Now moving to this type of  electronic set up lets us give you critical analysis of news stories, stock  market information and data, in new ways. It helps us make information  visual, more interesting and easy to see at a glance.  And it also helps  you connect with our content in a clear and concise way.  So while there  may be fewer stock quotes, there will be more analysis. </p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Beautiful.</p><p>  HUDSON: Hope you find it beautiful as well and Susie clearly the  presentation has changed, some faces have changed but some things will  never change here at NBR. </p><p>  GHARIB: You look really good against that green background, yeah, you  are right.  The good stuff and the important stuff is still here, same  mission that we have had for the past 30 years. We want to educate and  empower you, our viewers, so that you can make better financial decisions.  So keep watching. </p><p>  HUDSON:  And it`s great to start out on a day with the Dow hitting new  15 month highs, how about that. </p><p>  GHARIB:  We`ll call it the Tom Hudson effect. </p><p>  HUDSON: Yeah, right, OK, you`ll be about the only one that calls it  that, maybe you and my mom. </p><p>  That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday, January 4.  I`m Tom  Hudson. Good night to everybody and good night to you too Susie. </p><p>  GHARIB: And good night to you Tom.  I`m Susie Gharib.  Good night,  everyone and we hope to see all of you again tomorrow night.   </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

You`re  watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, October 22. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB:  Good evening, everyone.  The clock is ticking for the mid- term elections. Americans on Main Street are eager for their voices to be  heard.  And you know Tom, investors on Wall Street are waiting for a post- election market rally and history shows they might just get one. </p><p>  HUDSON:  It certainly does Susie, mid-term elections classic for case  studies on the stock market. In the third year of a first-term presidency,  which would be next year, stocks have rallied every time since 1939. The  \"Stock Traders Almanac,\" which tracks these things says in years where  there`s a Democrat in the White House, stocks have rallied more than 21  percent. </p><p>  GHARIB: This time Tom, the run up might have come early.  S&amp;P  strategist Alec Young notes the Dow has surged more than a thousand points  since September. </p><p>  YOUNG:  There is building anticipation that the Republicans will take  the House. So certainly I think that`s probably factored into the market  and viewed as a positive given tremendous tax and regulatory uncertainty  that is currently hanging over a sluggish domestic recovery. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Now two of the most closely watched Senate races in the  country are in Illinois and Florida.  Both are races without any  incumbents. And with both states struggling with double-digit unemployment,  those races are all about the economy.  As we continue our coverage, \"Mid- Term 2010-- It`s the Economy,\" we bring you two reports tonight. We begin  with Diane Eastabrook in Illinois, where the focus is on regaining  thousands of lost manufacturing jobs. </p><p>  DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Shuttered  factories have become part of the landscape in rust belt states like  Illinois. In the last two years, the recession has claimed more than  100,000 manufacturing jobs here. Job search boot camps are attracting twice  as many displaced workers as they did a year ago. Some like Craig Radcliffe  want more help from Washington. </p><p>  CRAIG RADCLIFFE, DISPLACED WORKER:  I would think that maybe at this  time that you would want to open up to more ideas and not really worry  about how many people think you should do this or that. </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  In Illinois, jobs and the economy are central issues in  the campaign for the U.S. Senate where Republican Congressman Mark Kirk is  running against Democratic state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias. Some Illinois  manufacturers call this election the most important one in decades. </p><p>   BERT MILLER, PRESIDENT, PHOENIX CLOSURES:  The policies that we`ve  seen implemented in Washington in the last two years are killing American  business. </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  Bert Miller is the president of Phoenix Closures -- a  120-year-old firm that makes plastic container caps. Miller wants less  government regulation and tax cuts extended for everyone, including the  wealthy, something Kirk favors, but Giannoulias opposes. </p><p>  MILLER:  If you start raising those taxes, you are going to find that  there is less money to invest in capital equipment and things like that. </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  While the economy and jobs loom large in Illinois this  election year, so too does scandal. Both candidates for the U.S. Senate are  battling controversy that political scientists say could overshadow other  issues.  For Giannoulias it`s the failure of his family`s Chicago bank  which allegedly made loans to the mob a decade ago. For Kirk, it`s the  embellishment of his naval record. Northwestern University political  science Professor Victoria Defrancesco Soto thinks these issues could  influence voters more than the economy. </p><p>   VICTORIA DEFRANCESCO SOTO, PROFESSOR, NORTHWESTERN UNIV.:  The economy  has been going downhill in Illinois for a long time. We`re the rust belt,  so people were consciously aware of what was going on unlike a Nevada. So,  they`re in the midst of an economic downturn, but they don`t want to add  insult to injury by having somebody who is a liar or who has links to the  mob. </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  Despite their reasons, Soto thinks the way Illinoisans  cast their votes in this election could send a strong message to the  president.  Since it`s his old Senate seat, the outcome could be viewed as  a referendum on his policies.  Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT,  Naperville, Illinois. </p><p>  JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This is Jeff  Yastine. Foreclosure signs and political signs. The two go together in  Florida, where housing defaults are the fifth highest in the nation. That,  combined with a 12 percent unemployment rate and an economy just limping  along is driving the sentiment of voters like Tracy Flett. He owns a south- Florida based roofing company which has had its share of layoffs. He`s also  one of the thousands of people who went to the polls for early voting this  week. </p><p>  TRACY FLETT, EARLY VOTER: I`m looking for someone who cares about  balance, someone who cares about the middle class; I`m looking for someone  who`s looks at the right things for big corporations, but also the right  things for the small business owner. And I`m looking for people who care. </p><p>  YASTINE:  The right things for business are key factors in the three- way race for Florida`s open Senate seat.  Republican Marco Rubio has been  hammering away with a low-tax message that`s made him the front-runner.  Republican-governor turned-independent Charlie Crist and Congressman  Kendrick Meek running a distant second and third.  Rubio has benefited from  major support and endorsements from national business groups, like the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business.   The Senate race hasn`t seen any endorsements from the Florida Chamber of  Commerce. But its president and CEO Mark Wilson  says the group`s members,  more than anything, are looking for policy predictability in Washington. </p><p>   MARK WILSON, FLORIDA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE:  The private sector, when  they know that we`re not going to change our taxes around, when they`re not  going to force benefits on small businesses that they can`t afford, when  they feel that it`s safe to invest again and they feel that they can invest  in employees and in technology and productivity improvement, then we`re  going to see job growth in this state and in this country, that we`ve not  seen in over a decade. </p><p>  YASTINE: Professor Charles Zelden of Nova Southeastern University,  says in a state like Florida ardent pro-business messages, like low taxes,  are an especially winning formula. But it come with a catch. </p><p>   CHARLES ZELDEN, PROF., LEGAL STUDIES, NOVA SOUTHEASTERN UNIV.:  The  problem is what do you do to compensate for less income coming in? What do  you cut? The problem is we don`t want services to be cut. We want a  stimulus that keeps our teachers working, that keeps our cops working,  keeps our firefighters working. But we also don`t want to pay more taxes.  You can`t do both. </p><p>  YASTINE:  As this trio of Senate candidates hits the homestretch,  Florida residents will soon make their priorities known.  Jeff Yastine,  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Miami. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Here are the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel.  It was a  mixed end to the week on Wall Street. The Dow Industrials fell 14 points,  the NASDAQ added 19, the S&amp;P 500 up nearly three. Trading volume fell on  both the big board and the NASDAQ to the lowest levels of the week. </p><p>       U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is urging limits on trade  imbalances for the world`s biggest economies.  Speaking at a gathering of  G-20 finance ministers and central bankers in South Korea, Geithner said he  thinks G-20 nations need to keep their current account balance below 4  percent of gross domestic product. After weeks of protests and strikes, the  French senate has approved a measure hiking that nation`s retirement age  from 60 to 62. Final approval of the change is expected Monday. France`s  unions say the protests will continue, despite today`s vote. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Still ahead on the program, sailing the seas of a weak U.S.  economy. We bring you illustrator David Gillette`s latest Inkonomics. </p><p>  GHARIB: Big tech companies are sitting on billions of dollars of cash,  including Intel. Earlier this week, the chip giant announced plans to spend  $6 billion on research and development. It`s also forking over more than $7  billion to acquire Internet security firmMcAfee.  Stacy Smith is the chief  financial officer at Intel.  He tells NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT using cash  wisely is good for Intel investors. </p><p>  STACY SMITH, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, INTEL:  I think companies have a  moral obligation to do the right things for their constituencies and for us  our constituencies are our owners, so we`re always looking at how do we  create shareholder value. Our employees and then where we have operations  we want to do the right things for the countries and the environment and  that constituency as well. </p><p>  GHARIB:  On Monday, you can see our entire interview with Smith as he  explains how Intel makes decisions about its $20 billion pile of cash. </p><p>  Tom, it was a mixed day for the markets but for the week they were up.  That makes three in a row.  Some nervousness as you mentioned earlier about  that G-20 meeting of finance ministers this coming up weekend. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Yes, nervousness about that communique that will come out  before the market opens on Monday clearly, but the focus still remains on  earnings throughout this week and likely for the next couple of weeks.  Let`s get you updated here Susie in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"  And the  reason why the focus remains on earnings, this was just the first of three  peak weeks for earnings and those earnings helped the major indices clock  another week of gains as Susie mentioned. And here are those gains  beginning with the Dow Industrials (DJI) adding 0.6 of a percent thanks to  gains on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. The NASDAQ (IXIC) meantime gained  0.4 of a percent, gained four out of the past five sessions as you can see.   The S&amp;P 500 (GSPC) 0.6 of a percent higher tonight compared to one week  ago. </p><p>       It was a mixed market overall today. Technology and energy shares  really led the gainers. The Dow was hurt by a couple of those earnings  reports. Verizon (VZ) one of them.  Here are the results.  They were better  than estimates, but down from a year ago as you can see. Even though  Verizon predicted its earnings for the rest of the year will be at the high  end of its guidance, shares sold off.  Let`s take a look at the stock here,  falling more than 1 percent. It was the second biggest percent drop for the  Dow Industrial components. It`s now at a one-month low. One concern for  Verizon:  far fewer new wireless subscribers last quarter than rival AT&amp;T.  The other big Dow loser American Express (AXP), dropping 3 percent.  Earnings last night were better than expected but loan volume remains low  and that`s fueling worries about future revenue growth. </p><p>       Now oil service stocks really helped energy put in the best sector  gains today. Among the leaders here, Schlumberger (SLB). Earnings easily  beating estimates after excluding the impact of the acquisition of Smith  International. Revenue jumped despite that deep water moratorium that was  in place during most of the third quarter. The stock was able to add more  than 5 percent on pretty heavy volume. This is its highest price that  Schlumberger has seen since early May. Earnings were also in play in  technology, helping the top three sector gainers and all three of these are  software makers.  Take a look.  Compuware (CPWR) was up more than 12  percent on some strong earnings.  This is a two-year high for shares  tonight. CA (CA) jumped 5 percent to its highest price since May. Strong  earnings, especially the performance in North America helped last quarter.  And Citrix Systems (CTXS) bounced 4 percent. It had a stronger than  expected outlook after decent results. </p><p>       Investors clearly had an appetite for restaurant stocks, pizza, yeah  one of them, also Mexican and cheesecake, how about that?  We`ll begin with  BJ`s (BJRI).  It runs pizza and brewery restaurants. Strong results and  positive analyst comments fueled a 17 percent run in shares today. Chipotle  Mexican Grill (CMG) boosted its same store sales outlook after strong  earnings. Shares added 15 percent. Both BJ`s and Chipotle are at all-time  highs tonight. Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) also getting an analyst upgrade  after some strong results. Shares jumping 8 percent. </p><p>       Busy week for IPOs, five of them hitting the Street, including two  more Chinese-based firms. Take a look at all five here.  Tal Education  (XRS) started at $10 this week. It provides tutoring services in China.  Shares continued jumping throughout the week. ShangPharma (SHP) does  research for drug makers. It began trading at $15, closed below that price  tonight. Three others -- Vera Bradley`s (VRA) IPO $16 per share, nice big  run there. It makes designer handbags. Debit card company NetSpend (NTSP)  had investors spending. It started at $11, closing tonight over $13. And  Brio (BBRG) is the first American restaurant to go public since 2006. It  started at $14 per share and clearly is higher tonight. And that is  tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>  GHARIB: As we`ve been reporting, corporate America is feeling better  about earnings. Investors have been rewarded with a market rally. But there  seems to be a disconnect with what most Americans are experiencing: lost  jobs, lost value in their homes and on and on. With that in mind, we bring  you another installment of \"Inkonomics with David Gillette.\" David`s an  Emmy-winning illustrator and essayist at Twin Cities public television.  Tonight, he ponders the question: has our economic ship sailed? </p><p>  DAVID GILLETTE:  If you`re on a mission to understand the economy,  there`s no better place to start than your own back yard. For this  cartoonist, we`re talking (INAUDIBLE) Minnesota, a small community just  west of Minneapolis and resting on the shores of Lake Minnetonka, a 14,528  acre fresh water playground which incidentally empties itself into  Minnehaha Creek, flows through the city of Minnetonka and then drops over  Minnehaha Falls. Basically it`s a land where everything starts with minne,  the Dakota word for water. And when people in this part of the world want  to flex their financial muscles, they spent a lot of money on the minne.  It`s an economy measured in boats. But here`s the surprising part. No  matter what you may have heard over the last few years about the sour  economy, there are still plenty of boats on Lake Minnetonka. </p><p>        On the surface this makes no sense. If you turn on any electronic  device, including practically the toaster, you`re told we`re either in the  middle of, emerging from or returning to a recession. For most people this  implies a lack of jobs, a lack of money and you would think a lack of time  for practicing the principle of displacement. But there they are -- boats.  And according to the people who take them to market, the bigger they are,  the faster they sell. That`s why out of all the story lines we`re knitting  around the contemporary American economy, wasteful government spending, in- exceptional education, foreign competition, I`m hanging my life jacket on  the resurgence of financial stratification. </p><p>        You see, according to the unique glacial pock marks I call home,  this country isn`t suffering from an overall shortage of wealth. It`s just  that the money we do have is disproportionately concentrated in a handful  of 40-foot weekend cruisers and that`s actually where I`m going to stop.  You see I`m not stupid. I don`t fully understand the economic forces that  allow the rich to get richer while the not rich get not richer. But I do  understand human nature. And if I go on national television and make it  sound like the entire economic collapse rests on the shoulders of the  people who buy boats, my chances of spending a day on the lake are going to  end up in the drink. </p><p>  GHARIB:  So Tom, do you think Ben Bernanke knows about the Minnetonka  indicator? Maybe we should tell him about the water effect on the economy.</p><p>       HUDSON: I tell you, as long as those boats are seaworthy, it maybe a  lot easier to refloat them, certainly, that`s definitely the truth. Let`s  get you updated on what we`re watching for next week. We`ve got a lot on  the calendar.  Our Friday \"Market Monitor\" James Paulsen.  He`s chief  strategist at Wells Capital Management. We`re also due to get an update on  housing from the September reports on both new and existing home sales as  well as the first report on the third quarter GDP out next Friday.  Monday  our shoptalk series look at Ikea and how its eco-friendly policies are  giving it a competitive advantage. </p><p>  GHARIB: The U.S. Postal Service still wants you to pay more for  stamps.  It plans to appeal a regulator`s decision that denied permission  to raise rates to $0.46 a stamp. The Postal Service says the increase is  needed because of losses caused by a drop in mail volume. It blames it on  the weak economy and a shift to email and online bill paying. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Federal regulators are now getting involved in the fee  dispute between Cablevision and News Corp. The Federal Communications  Commission today sent letters to the heads of both companies. They`ve asked  to describe how they`re negotiating in good faith. About three million  Cablevision subscribers in New York City and Philadelphia have been cut off  from Fox programming. The blackout will enter its second week tomorrow if a  deal is not reached. </p><p>  With the Federal Reserve poised to try to get more money into the  economy, tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" thinks that means inflation.  Mark  Skousen is editor of the market letter \"Forecasts and Strategies.\"  He  joins us tonight from the NASDAQ.   Mark, nice to see you again, welcome  back. </p><p>  MARK SKOUSEN, EDITOR, \"FORECASTS &amp; STRATEGIES\":  Tom, good to be with  you. </p><p>  HUDSON:  So how much inflation and when do you think we`ll actually  see it? </p><p>  SKOUSEN:  I think we`re going to see inflation down the road.  But we  have a triple play right now or hat trick, whatever you want to call it,  for investors and I`m very bullish. Because what we have is low interest  rates, we have low price inflation and we have easy money by the Fed. And  the Fed has deliberately decided to increase inflation to 2 to 3 percent,  inflation targeting, that`s what Ben Bernanke cut his teeth on and he`s  really trying to impose it. </p><p>  HUDSON:  But we haven`t seen any of that inflation really.  Instead  we`ve seen disinflation. Still positive numbers, but very, very small. </p><p>  SKOUSEN:  Yes and that`s because the economy is so sluggish,  particularly in the United States, unemployment really high.  So they`re  buying time and that`s great for us as investors because prices for  investors are low and it`s an opportunity to be buying and taking advantage  of this very unique scenario, because inflation will be coming back. Gold  is a great indicator of future inflation and look what that`s doing. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Yes, over $1300 an ounce. So what markets do you like if the  Fed is successful and is able to reignite inflation in the months or years  ahead? </p><p>  SKOUSEN:  As we can see, this has been very bearish for the dollar,  but it`s very bullish for stocks, bonds and commodities.  So I`m fully  invested in all three of those areas. </p><p>  HUDSON:  So you still like fixed income, even though interest rates  are so low. </p><p>  SKOUSEN:  Well, fixed income, no, not Treasury bills that only pay 2  or 3 percent. What I`m talking about is high dividend paying stocks, the  kind that I`ve been recommending to your viewers. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Sure, even though you do like dividends, your first new pick  here, you`re clearly not afraid of volatility.  This is a new stock pick,  Rare Element Resources. We`re going to take a look at a chart here.  This  owns Rare Earth Element mine in Wyoming, REE the ticker symbol. Is Rare  Earth Elements as you know Mark a source of some building tensions between  the U.S. and China?  Are you willing to play that geo-political risk? </p><p>  SKOUSEN:  This is a major geo-political risk and I will warn your  viewers and they can see from the chart this stock has already doubled,  tripled, quadrupled in value and so it is a risky speculation.  But this  problem is not going away.  China is trying to corner the rare earth  market, which is this group of 12 to 17 elements that nobody has ever heard  of before that is critical in military applications and in hybrid cars, in  cell phones, in computers and you name it and they control 97 percent of  this market. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Mark, let me ask you, what kind of price target do you have?   What kind of holding period for a volatile stock like that? </p><p>  SKOUSEN:  Well a lot of people think, it`s a micro cap right now, a  lot of people think this is a billion dollar company, so it could possibly  triple in value, but it is extremely volatile and investors need to know  that. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Ninety seconds, I want to get to everything here. A new pick  SeaDrill. This is a deep water energy driller, close to a new high. Why  choose this deep water driller? </p><p>  SKOUSEN:  Well, because they were hurt by the BP scandal and they are  still recovering from it.  They have a very nice dividend yield of almost 9  percent. And they`re aggressively expanding. I think it`s a very good play  on the expanding energy area. </p><p>  HUDSON:  OK.  April 23rd you were last with us. You had three picks  back then, two of them, the Ishares exchange-traded fund following Hong  Kong, that stock up 17 percent. American Capital, a private equity firm, up  by better than almost 6 percent.  These are stock returns only.  Do you  still like these two? </p><p>  SKOUSEN:  Yes, I like Hong Kong because it`s only selling at 15 times  earnings, 3 percent dividend. It is the center of growth in Asia. I like  American Capital because there`s insider buying recently and it`s still  selling below book. That`s a great story. </p><p>  HUDSON:  You also like EPD, this is a natural gas play, Enterprise  Products, 15 1/2 percent on its stock price, plus a nice dividend on top of  that.  Do you still like it? </p><p>  SKOUSEN:  Yes, but I think Dan Duncan, the late, great Dan Duncan died  recently. He bought a bunch of stock before hand.  It a great rising  dividend story, but I`m going to sell that and put that money in Sea Drill. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Take you profits. Any disclosures tonight? </p><p>  SKOUSEN:  Just these are some of the stocks we`re recommending in our  services, but I don`t own any myself. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Our \"Market Monitor \"this evening, Mark Skousen.  He`s editor  of the market letter \"Forecasts and Strategies.\"</p><p>  SKOUSEN:  Thank you. </p><p>  GHARIB: And Tom, before we say good night, looking ahead to next week  we`ve got a lot to cover, more earnings, more election coverage, more about  the markets and of course we`re going to be talking about upcoming  decisions being made in Washington at the Fed. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Absolutely, the looming Federal Reserve meeting, which is a  week from Wednesday, the day after Election Day. It`s going to be a busy  couple weeks here. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT on this Friday evening.  Thanks for joining us. It is October 22. I`m Tom Hudson.  Have a great  weekend and you too, Susie. </p><p>  GHARIB: Tom, hope you have a great weekend as well. I`m Susie Gharib.   Thanks for watching everyone and we hope to see all of you again on Monday  night.   </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, October 22.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening, everyone. The clock is ticking for the mid- term elections. Americans on Main Street are eager for their voices to be heard. And you know Tom, investors on Wall Street are waiting for a post- election market rally and history shows they might just get one.</p><p>HUDSON: It certainly does Susie, mid-term elections classic for case studies on the stock market. In the third year of a first-term presidency, which would be next year, stocks have rallied every time since 1939. The \"Stock Traders Almanac,\" which tracks these things says in years where there`s a Democrat in the White House, stocks have rallied more than 21 percent.</p><p>GHARIB: This time Tom, the run up might have come early. S&amp;P strategist Alec Young notes the Dow has surged more than a thousand points since September.</p><p>YOUNG: There is building anticipation that the Republicans will take the House. So certainly I think that`s probably factored into the market and viewed as a positive given tremendous tax and regulatory uncertainty that is currently hanging over a sluggish domestic recovery.</p><p>GHARIB: Now two of the most closely watched Senate races in the country are in Illinois and Florida. Both are races without any incumbents. And with both states struggling with double-digit unemployment, those races are all about the economy. As we continue our coverage, \"Mid- Term 2010-- It`s the Economy,\" we bring you two reports tonight. We begin with Diane Eastabrook in Illinois, where the focus is on regaining thousands of lost manufacturing jobs.</p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Shuttered factories have become part of the landscape in rust belt states like Illinois. In the last two years, the recession has claimed more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs here. Job search boot camps are attracting twice as many displaced workers as they did a year ago. Some like Craig Radcliffe want more help from Washington.</p><p>CRAIG RADCLIFFE, DISPLACED WORKER: I would think that maybe at this time that you would want to open up to more ideas and not really worry about how many people think you should do this or that.</p><p>EASTABROOK: In Illinois, jobs and the economy are central issues in the campaign for the U.S. Senate where Republican Congressman Mark Kirk is running against Democratic state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias. Some Illinois manufacturers call this election the most important one in decades.</p><p>BERT MILLER, PRESIDENT, PHOENIX CLOSURES: The policies that we`ve seen implemented in Washington in the last two years are killing American business.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Bert Miller is the president of Phoenix Closures -- a 120-year-old firm that makes plastic container caps. Miller wants less government regulation and tax cuts extended for everyone, including the wealthy, something Kirk favors, but Giannoulias opposes.</p><p>MILLER: If you start raising those taxes, you are going to find that there is less money to invest in capital equipment and things like that.</p><p>EASTABROOK: While the economy and jobs loom large in Illinois this election year, so too does scandal. Both candidates for the U.S. Senate are battling controversy that political scientists say could overshadow other issues. For Giannoulias it`s the failure of his family`s Chicago bank which allegedly made loans to the mob a decade ago. For Kirk, it`s the embellishment of his naval record. Northwestern University political science Professor Victoria Defrancesco Soto thinks these issues could influence voters more than the economy.</p><p>VICTORIA DEFRANCESCO SOTO, PROFESSOR, NORTHWESTERN UNIV.: The economy has been going downhill in Illinois for a long time. We`re the rust belt, so people were consciously aware of what was going on unlike a Nevada. So, they`re in the midst of an economic downturn, but they don`t want to add insult to injury by having somebody who is a liar or who has links to the mob.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Despite their reasons, Soto thinks the way Illinoisans cast their votes in this election could send a strong message to the president. Since it`s his old Senate seat, the outcome could be viewed as a referendum on his policies. Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Naperville, Illinois.</p><p>JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This is Jeff Yastine. Foreclosure signs and political signs. The two go together in Florida, where housing defaults are the fifth highest in the nation. That, combined with a 12 percent unemployment rate and an economy just limping along is driving the sentiment of voters like Tracy Flett. He owns a south- Florida based roofing company which has had its share of layoffs. He`s also one of the thousands of people who went to the polls for early voting this week.</p><p>TRACY FLETT, EARLY VOTER: I`m looking for someone who cares about balance, someone who cares about the middle class; I`m looking for someone who`s looks at the right things for big corporations, but also the right things for the small business owner. And I`m looking for people who care.</p><p>YASTINE: The right things for business are key factors in the three- way race for Florida`s open Senate seat. Republican Marco Rubio has been hammering away with a low-tax message that`s made him the front-runner. Republican-governor turned-independent Charlie Crist and Congressman Kendrick Meek running a distant second and third. Rubio has benefited from major support and endorsements from national business groups, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business. The Senate race hasn`t seen any endorsements from the Florida Chamber of Commerce. But its president and CEO Mark Wilson says the group`s members, more than anything, are looking for policy predictability in Washington.</p><p>MARK WILSON, FLORIDA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: The private sector, when they know that we`re not going to change our taxes around, when they`re not going to force benefits on small businesses that they can`t afford, when they feel that it`s safe to invest again and they feel that they can invest in employees and in technology and productivity improvement, then we`re going to see job growth in this state and in this country, that we`ve not seen in over a decade.</p><p>YASTINE: Professor Charles Zelden of Nova Southeastern University, says in a state like Florida ardent pro-business messages, like low taxes, are an especially winning formula. But it come with a catch.</p><p>CHARLES ZELDEN, PROF., LEGAL STUDIES, NOVA SOUTHEASTERN UNIV.: The problem is what do you do to compensate for less income coming in? What do you cut? The problem is we don`t want services to be cut. We want a stimulus that keeps our teachers working, that keeps our cops working, keeps our firefighters working. But we also don`t want to pay more taxes. You can`t do both.</p><p>YASTINE: As this trio of Senate candidates hits the homestretch, Florida residents will soon make their priorities known. Jeff Yastine, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Miami.</p><p>HUDSON: Here are the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. It was a mixed end to the week on Wall Street. The Dow Industrials fell 14 points, the NASDAQ added 19, the S&amp;P 500 up nearly three. Trading volume fell on both the big board and the NASDAQ to the lowest levels of the week.</p><p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is urging limits on trade imbalances for the world`s biggest economies. Speaking at a gathering of G-20 finance ministers and central bankers in South Korea, Geithner said he thinks G-20 nations need to keep their current account balance below 4 percent of gross domestic product. After weeks of protests and strikes, the French senate has approved a measure hiking that nation`s retirement age from 60 to 62. Final approval of the change is expected Monday. France`s unions say the protests will continue, despite today`s vote.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead on the program, sailing the seas of a weak U.S. economy. We bring you illustrator David Gillette`s latest Inkonomics.</p><p>GHARIB: Big tech companies are sitting on billions of dollars of cash, including Intel. Earlier this week, the chip giant announced plans to spend $6 billion on research and development. It`s also forking over more than $7 billion to acquire Internet security firmMcAfee. Stacy Smith is the chief financial officer at Intel. He tells NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT using cash wisely is good for Intel investors.</p><p>STACY SMITH, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, INTEL: I think companies have a moral obligation to do the right things for their constituencies and for us our constituencies are our owners, so we`re always looking at how do we create shareholder value. Our employees and then where we have operations we want to do the right things for the countries and the environment and that constituency as well.</p><p>GHARIB: On Monday, you can see our entire interview with Smith as he explains how Intel makes decisions about its $20 billion pile of cash.</p><p>Tom, it was a mixed day for the markets but for the week they were up. That makes three in a row. Some nervousness as you mentioned earlier about that G-20 meeting of finance ministers this coming up weekend.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes, nervousness about that communique that will come out before the market opens on Monday clearly, but the focus still remains on earnings throughout this week and likely for the next couple of weeks. Let`s get you updated here Susie in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" And the reason why the focus remains on earnings, this was just the first of three peak weeks for earnings and those earnings helped the major indices clock another week of gains as Susie mentioned. And here are those gains beginning with the Dow Industrials (DJI) adding 0.6 of a percent thanks to gains on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. The NASDAQ (IXIC) meantime gained 0.4 of a percent, gained four out of the past five sessions as you can see. The S&amp;P 500 (GSPC) 0.6 of a percent higher tonight compared to one week ago.</p><p>It was a mixed market overall today. Technology and energy shares really led the gainers. The Dow was hurt by a couple of those earnings reports. Verizon (VZ) one of them. Here are the results. They were better than estimates, but down from a year ago as you can see. Even though Verizon predicted its earnings for the rest of the year will be at the high end of its guidance, shares sold off. Let`s take a look at the stock here, falling more than 1 percent. It was the second biggest percent drop for the Dow Industrial components. It`s now at a one-month low. One concern for Verizon: far fewer new wireless subscribers last quarter than rival AT&amp;T. The other big Dow loser American Express (AXP), dropping 3 percent. Earnings last night were better than expected but loan volume remains low and that`s fueling worries about future revenue growth.</p><p>Now oil service stocks really helped energy put in the best sector gains today. Among the leaders here, Schlumberger (SLB). Earnings easily beating estimates after excluding the impact of the acquisition of Smith International. Revenue jumped despite that deep water moratorium that was in place during most of the third quarter. The stock was able to add more than 5 percent on pretty heavy volume. This is its highest price that Schlumberger has seen since early May. Earnings were also in play in technology, helping the top three sector gainers and all three of these are software makers. Take a look. Compuware (CPWR) was up more than 12 percent on some strong earnings. This is a two-year high for shares tonight. CA (CA) jumped 5 percent to its highest price since May. Strong earnings, especially the performance in North America helped last quarter. And Citrix Systems (CTXS) bounced 4 percent. It had a stronger than expected outlook after decent results.</p><p>Investors clearly had an appetite for restaurant stocks, pizza, yeah one of them, also Mexican and cheesecake, how about that? We`ll begin with BJ`s (BJRI). It runs pizza and brewery restaurants. Strong results and positive analyst comments fueled a 17 percent run in shares today. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) boosted its same store sales outlook after strong earnings. Shares added 15 percent. Both BJ`s and Chipotle are at all-time highs tonight. Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) also getting an analyst upgrade after some strong results. Shares jumping 8 percent.</p><p>Busy week for IPOs, five of them hitting the Street, including two more Chinese-based firms. Take a look at all five here. Tal Education (XRS) started at $10 this week. It provides tutoring services in China. Shares continued jumping throughout the week. ShangPharma (SHP) does research for drug makers. It began trading at $15, closed below that price tonight. Three others -- Vera Bradley`s (VRA) IPO $16 per share, nice big run there. It makes designer handbags. Debit card company NetSpend (NTSP) had investors spending. It started at $11, closing tonight over $13. And Brio (BBRG) is the first American restaurant to go public since 2006. It started at $14 per share and clearly is higher tonight. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: As we`ve been reporting, corporate America is feeling better about earnings. Investors have been rewarded with a market rally. But there seems to be a disconnect with what most Americans are experiencing: lost jobs, lost value in their homes and on and on. With that in mind, we bring you another installment of \"Inkonomics with David Gillette.\" David`s an Emmy-winning illustrator and essayist at Twin Cities public television. Tonight, he ponders the question: has our economic ship sailed?</p><p>DAVID GILLETTE: If you`re on a mission to understand the economy, there`s no better place to start than your own back yard. For this cartoonist, we`re talking (INAUDIBLE) Minnesota, a small community just west of Minneapolis and resting on the shores of Lake Minnetonka, a 14,528 acre fresh water playground which incidentally empties itself into Minnehaha Creek, flows through the city of Minnetonka and then drops over Minnehaha Falls. Basically it`s a land where everything starts with minne, the Dakota word for water. And when people in this part of the world want to flex their financial muscles, they spent a lot of money on the minne. It`s an economy measured in boats. But here`s the surprising part. No matter what you may have heard over the last few years about the sour economy, there are still plenty of boats on Lake Minnetonka.</p><p>On the surface this makes no sense. If you turn on any electronic device, including practically the toaster, you`re told we`re either in the middle of, emerging from or returning to a recession. For most people this implies a lack of jobs, a lack of money and you would think a lack of time for practicing the principle of displacement. But there they are -- boats. And according to the people who take them to market, the bigger they are, the faster they sell. That`s why out of all the story lines we`re knitting around the contemporary American economy, wasteful government spending, in- exceptional education, foreign competition, I`m hanging my life jacket on the resurgence of financial stratification.</p><p>You see, according to the unique glacial pock marks I call home, this country isn`t suffering from an overall shortage of wealth. It`s just that the money we do have is disproportionately concentrated in a handful of 40-foot weekend cruisers and that`s actually where I`m going to stop. You see I`m not stupid. I don`t fully understand the economic forces that allow the rich to get richer while the not rich get not richer. But I do understand human nature. And if I go on national television and make it sound like the entire economic collapse rests on the shoulders of the people who buy boats, my chances of spending a day on the lake are going to end up in the drink.</p><p>GHARIB: So Tom, do you think Ben Bernanke knows about the Minnetonka indicator? Maybe we should tell him about the water effect on the economy.</p><p>HUDSON: I tell you, as long as those boats are seaworthy, it maybe a lot easier to refloat them, certainly, that`s definitely the truth. Let`s get you updated on what we`re watching for next week. We`ve got a lot on the calendar. Our Friday \"Market Monitor\" James Paulsen. He`s chief strategist at Wells Capital Management. We`re also due to get an update on housing from the September reports on both new and existing home sales as well as the first report on the third quarter GDP out next Friday. Monday our shoptalk series look at Ikea and how its eco-friendly policies are giving it a competitive advantage.</p><p>GHARIB: The U.S. Postal Service still wants you to pay more for stamps. It plans to appeal a regulator`s decision that denied permission to raise rates to $0.46 a stamp. The Postal Service says the increase is needed because of losses caused by a drop in mail volume. It blames it on the weak economy and a shift to email and online bill paying.</p><p>HUDSON: Federal regulators are now getting involved in the fee dispute between Cablevision and News Corp. The Federal Communications Commission today sent letters to the heads of both companies. They`ve asked to describe how they`re negotiating in good faith. About three million Cablevision subscribers in New York City and Philadelphia have been cut off from Fox programming. The blackout will enter its second week tomorrow if a deal is not reached.</p><p>With the Federal Reserve poised to try to get more money into the economy, tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" thinks that means inflation. Mark Skousen is editor of the market letter \"Forecasts and Strategies.\" He joins us tonight from the NASDAQ. Mark, nice to see you again, welcome back.</p><p>MARK SKOUSEN, EDITOR, \"FORECASTS &amp; STRATEGIES\": Tom, good to be with you.</p><p>HUDSON: So how much inflation and when do you think we`ll actually see it?</p><p>SKOUSEN: I think we`re going to see inflation down the road. But we have a triple play right now or hat trick, whatever you want to call it, for investors and I`m very bullish. Because what we have is low interest rates, we have low price inflation and we have easy money by the Fed. And the Fed has deliberately decided to increase inflation to 2 to 3 percent, inflation targeting, that`s what Ben Bernanke cut his teeth on and he`s really trying to impose it.</p><p>HUDSON: But we haven`t seen any of that inflation really. Instead we`ve seen disinflation. Still positive numbers, but very, very small.</p><p>SKOUSEN: Yes and that`s because the economy is so sluggish, particularly in the United States, unemployment really high. So they`re buying time and that`s great for us as investors because prices for investors are low and it`s an opportunity to be buying and taking advantage of this very unique scenario, because inflation will be coming back. Gold is a great indicator of future inflation and look what that`s doing.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes, over $1300 an ounce. So what markets do you like if the Fed is successful and is able to reignite inflation in the months or years ahead?</p><p>SKOUSEN: As we can see, this has been very bearish for the dollar, but it`s very bullish for stocks, bonds and commodities. So I`m fully invested in all three of those areas.</p><p>HUDSON: So you still like fixed income, even though interest rates are so low.</p><p>SKOUSEN: Well, fixed income, no, not Treasury bills that only pay 2 or 3 percent. What I`m talking about is high dividend paying stocks, the kind that I`ve been recommending to your viewers.</p><p>HUDSON: Sure, even though you do like dividends, your first new pick here, you`re clearly not afraid of volatility. This is a new stock pick, Rare Element Resources. We`re going to take a look at a chart here. This owns Rare Earth Element mine in Wyoming, REE the ticker symbol. Is Rare Earth Elements as you know Mark a source of some building tensions between the U.S. and China? Are you willing to play that geo-political risk?</p><p>SKOUSEN: This is a major geo-political risk and I will warn your viewers and they can see from the chart this stock has already doubled, tripled, quadrupled in value and so it is a risky speculation. But this problem is not going away. China is trying to corner the rare earth market, which is this group of 12 to 17 elements that nobody has ever heard of before that is critical in military applications and in hybrid cars, in cell phones, in computers and you name it and they control 97 percent of this market.</p><p>HUDSON: Mark, let me ask you, what kind of price target do you have? What kind of holding period for a volatile stock like that?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Well a lot of people think, it`s a micro cap right now, a lot of people think this is a billion dollar company, so it could possibly triple in value, but it is extremely volatile and investors need to know that.</p><p>HUDSON: Ninety seconds, I want to get to everything here. A new pick SeaDrill. This is a deep water energy driller, close to a new high. Why choose this deep water driller?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Well, because they were hurt by the BP scandal and they are still recovering from it. They have a very nice dividend yield of almost 9 percent. And they`re aggressively expanding. I think it`s a very good play on the expanding energy area.</p><p>HUDSON: OK. April 23rd you were last with us. You had three picks back then, two of them, the Ishares exchange-traded fund following Hong Kong, that stock up 17 percent. American Capital, a private equity firm, up by better than almost 6 percent. These are stock returns only. Do you still like these two?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Yes, I like Hong Kong because it`s only selling at 15 times earnings, 3 percent dividend. It is the center of growth in Asia. I like American Capital because there`s insider buying recently and it`s still selling below book. That`s a great story.</p><p>HUDSON: You also like EPD, this is a natural gas play, Enterprise Products, 15 1/2 percent on its stock price, plus a nice dividend on top of that. Do you still like it?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Yes, but I think Dan Duncan, the late, great Dan Duncan died recently. He bought a bunch of stock before hand. It a great rising dividend story, but I`m going to sell that and put that money in Sea Drill.</p><p>HUDSON: Take you profits. Any disclosures tonight?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Just these are some of the stocks we`re recommending in our services, but I don`t own any myself.</p><p>HUDSON: Our \"Market Monitor \"this evening, Mark Skousen. He`s editor of the market letter \"Forecasts and Strategies.\"</p><p>SKOUSEN: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: And Tom, before we say good night, looking ahead to next week we`ve got a lot to cover, more earnings, more election coverage, more about the markets and of course we`re going to be talking about upcoming decisions being made in Washington at the Fed.</p><p>HUDSON: Absolutely, the looming Federal Reserve meeting, which is a week from Wednesday, the day after Election Day. It`s going to be a busy couple weeks here. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT on this Friday evening. Thanks for joining us. It is October 22. I`m Tom Hudson. Have a great weekend and you too, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom, hope you have a great weekend as well. I`m Susie Gharib. Thanks for watching everyone and we hope to see all of you again on Monday night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

It`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, September 13.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: Good evening and thanks for joining us tonight. Nearly one in six Americans or 46 million people, live in poverty. Susie, that startling number comes from a U.S. census report released today. It`s 2.5 million more people than in 2009.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom, it`s the fourth straight increase and the largest number of people living in poverty since record-keeping began 52 years ago. The report is also a reminder that all the efforts to jumpstart the economy are not helping the nation`s poorest people. Today`s number represents just over 15 percent of the country. That`s a nearly 1 percent jump from the year 2009. The government defines the poverty line as income of $22,000 a year for a family of four and $11,000 for an individual.</p><p>HUDSON: When viewed all together, these numbers represent the severe and widespread financial strains in America today. Steven Ullman of the University of Miami`s school of business says the data has all kinds of ramifications for the economy.</p><p>STEVEN ULLMAN, PROFESSOR, UNIV. OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: It means that people are going to have growing history associated with making basic ends meet, being able to afford rent in terms of housing for their families, being ability to afford to put food on the table and of course access to health care becomes that much more problematic.</p><p>HUDSON: The same census report shows how problematic access to health care has become. Nearly 50 million Americans do not have medical insurance. That`s more than 16 percent of the population, statistically the same as the year before. Congress passed a health care overhaul last year to deal with rising numbers of uninsured, though many of those main provisions won`t take effect until 2014. The law also is the target of several constitutional court challenges.</p><p>GHARIB: A one-two punch on the deficit as the so-called super committee held its first public hearing in Washington. First, data out today shows the Federal budget deficit reached more than $1.2 trillion last month. That number adds pressure on Washington lawmakers to reach agreement to trim government spending. The second came from the head of the Congressional Budget Office. He warned the super-committee that the Federal deficit threatens to cripple the U.S. economy over the long term if it is not dealt with soon. Darren Gersh reports.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The lawmakers charged with coming up with $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction held a public hearing today on the history and drivers of the deficit. The star witness gently suggested that was not really the issue confronting the so- called super committee.</p><p>DOUGLAS ELMENDORF, CBO DIRECTOR: I think, really, the fundamental question for you is not how we got here, but where you want the country to go.</p><p>GERSH: Douglas Elmendorf, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the deficit problem really comes down to what role the Federal government should play in the economy.</p><p>ELMENDORF: And if you want a role that has benefit programs for older Americans like the ones we`ve had in the past and operates the rest of the government like the ones we`ve had in the past, then more tax revenue is needed than under current tax rates. And the other hand, if one wants those tax rates, then one has to make very significant changes in spending programs for older Americans or other aspects.</p><p>GERSH: Members of the committee largely seemed locked in the same debates they have been having for the last nine months. Republicans pushing to cut spending...</p><p>REP. JEB HENSARLING, CO-CHAIR, JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE ON DEFICIT REDUCTION: A path to credible deficit reduction is a jobs program and we should not be deterred in that mission.</p><p>GERSH: Democrats to preserve spending, blaming much of the current deficits on Bush- era tax cuts.</p><p>REP. XAVIER BECERRA, (D) CALIFORNIA: We need to ask ourselves, was it the senior citizen, the student or the Wall Street banker who received the benefit of the spending binge?</p><p>GERSH: The CBO director offered a compromise way forward. His agency says the best medicine for the economy is clear.</p><p>ELMENDORF: The combination of fiscal policies likely to be most effective would be policies that cut taxes or increase spending in the near term, but over the medium and longer term, move in the opposite direction and cut spending or raise taxes.</p><p>GERSH: But there were few signs today either side was willing to compromise to get there. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: Shares inched a bit higher as investors kept an eye on the latest developments regarding Europe`s debt worries today. German Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected the notion that a Greek bankruptcy would provide a quick solution to the Eurozone debt crisis. That possibility was raised just yesterday by her deputy. Here in the states, the Dow Industrials added nearly 45 points today, the NASDAQ rose 37 and the S&amp;P 500 gaining 10.5. Big board volume meantime continues to hold firmly above one billion shares. NASDAQ volume slipped just below two billion.</p><p>GHARIB: July 2012 is D-day for the nation`s biggest banks. That`s the deadline for giving regulators a plan on how they would break up and sell off their assets if they are in danger of failing. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or FDIC approved the rule today. Bankers are calling these plans living wills. Under the new law, the largest banks and financial firms, like Citigroup (NYSE: C), JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, would be required to outline liquidation plans so regulators could shut them down in an orderly way to avoid damage to the financial system.</p><p>So what kind of shape are the nation`s banks in? Our next guest is a long-time banker and CEO of Bank United, John Kanas. Hi John, nice to have you on the program again.</p><p>JOHN KANAS, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, BANKUNITED: Hi Susie. How are you?</p><p>GHARIB: Good, thank you. Let me start off with asking you, how would you describe the health of the banking system whether we`re talking about the super big banks or the smaller banks.</p><p>KANAS: Statistically Susie, the banks are in much better shape than they were four or five years ago. All of the metrics that are normally used to measure the safety of banks have improved. Capital is higher. Reserves against non-performing loans are much higher than they were back in 2007. So in terms of the sheer strength of capital, they`re stronger than they were. Unfortunately, the issue with banks today is the question of profitability since the flagging economy is having trouble getting out of its own way. Banks are having difficulty in expanding their balance sheets and finding opportunities to make loans. And so those who worry about such things worry that bank`s profitability will be under pressure in the near future.</p><p>GHARIB: And you`re expecting a wave of bank mergers and in fact your own bank recently bought a small New York bank. Do you think all of these consolidations are good or bad for the economy?</p><p>KANAS: It just depends. Some consolidation is essential as we go into the next decade. There are 7,000 banks in the United States and most pundits have thought that we`re probably over banked for some time especially given the relatively slack performance in the economy. Where I think consolidation will cause difficulties is in the small towns of America where there may be only one or two institutions, neither of whom may survive these next few years and it the put further pressure on small business people and even further as the economy tries to recover from these doldrums.</p><p>GHARIB: And we hear from so many banks, so many small and medium size businesses, that it`s very tough to get loans from their banks. What is the problem and what`s the solution? Why do we keep hearing this refrain?</p><p>KANAS: Those comments are sporadic and they`re geographic. If you happen to run a business in a town where two or three of the banks are in serious trouble and operating under agreements by the regulators that frankly don`t allow them to make loans then you could very well be suffering the consequences of that. To be frank, the large banks and most of the regional banks that is have healthy balance sheets are desperately trying to make loans in this environment, because whether we like it or not, banks can`t make money if they can`t make loans and certainly we`re not going to be able to make any money by investing in government securities that are yielding one or two or three percent. So we desperately need to make loans in this industry and are seeking opportunities to do so.</p><p>GHARIB: I want to ask you this, John, you`ve lived through so many recessions in your working career. Is the U.S. headed for another one? From what you`ve seen in the past, how bad -- what kind of shape is the economy in? How bad is it compared to what you lived through before?</p><p>KANAS: Some would argue that it`s never really fully recovered from the last recession, and frankly, I`m not sure whether being in a recession or being where we are today, which is in a position of almost no growth is much different. The classic definition of recession two calendar quarters of negative GDP may or may not be reached. But frankly, no one in my banking circles, and no one in business circles, at least in the southeast and the north east where I`m most familiar are looking forward to any significant growth in the next two quarters. So whether we return to recession or not, I think it`s going to feel like it.</p><p>GHARIB: We have to leave it there. John thank you so much for coming on the program. We really appreciate your time.</p><p>KANAS: Thank you Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: We`ve been speaking with John Kanas, who`s the CEO of Bank United.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead tonight, Target (NYSE: TGT) hits the bull`s eye with bargain shoppers. We`ll show you how its new designer collection is red hot on its first day.</p><p>James Murdoch is being recalled for another grilling before Britain`s parliament after former News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS). executives raised serious doubts about his role in that country`s tabloid phone hacking scandal. Two former executives have contradicted Murdoch`s testimony that he did not know the extent of the hacking. James, along with his father you see here, Rupert, appeared before parliament earlier this summer, apologizing for the scandal. So far, the date for James Murdoch`s appearance has not been finalized.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot of uncertainty still in the market and that`s why we didn`t see much movement today, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Not much at all here, really trying to digest all of the news out of Europe as well as trying to discern which direction the U.S. economy is headed here Susie. So let`s go with it with tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" While the major stocks averages moved up from the second session in a row, oil continues to really see this tug of war over lower demand possibly from the U.S. and Europe and a growing thirst from emerging economies. So let`s begin with crude oil jumping more than $2, closing above $90 a barrel here tonight. This is at the top of the range that we`ve seen since this sharp sell-off began back in July. Oil supplies did fall last week due to tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico and tonight we have rallied up to a five-week high.</p><p>Now while oil prices have risen lately, the transportation sector continues really around the low end of the range that we`ve seen it really over the past 12 months. This year we`re looking at is the exchange-traded fund for the Dow transport index. It did see a nice rally today of about 3.5 percent. Worries about economic growth though have pushed this fund down 20 percent from the high of over $100 per share back in July.</p><p>Airline stocks ready to take flight. Delta jumping more than 8 percent after reporting its third quarter performance is ahead of forecasts. Delta also will continue to cut the number of seats it makes available this year and early next year. United Continental meantime will modestly cut its U.S. seat capacity while increasing the international capacity. The airlines clearly hope to maintain airfares by not having empty seats. And U.S. Airways says both bookings and pricing remains strong. Shares of U.S. Airways shooting up more than 16 percent, heavy volume trade for LCC today.</p><p>Airline stocks not the only mode of transportation to see higher prices. How about railroad? Kansas City Southern (NYSE: SO) (NYSE: KSU) popping almost 6 percent, nice gain as Citigroup (NYSE: C) upgraded its rating to \"buy.\" RailAmerica (NYSE: RA) gained 5 percent. Its biggest shipping product is coal and while traffic has actually continued to drop, it`s the rate of the decline has slowed down. That helped out shares of RA today. Genesee and Wyoming meantime up 4 percent after announcing four and a half consecutive, month-over-month traffic increases, four and a half years of month-over-month traffic increases for GWR shares, up 4 percent.</p><p>Late today, we learned that General Electric (NYSE: GE) will pay back Warren Buffett next month. GE will begin buying back $3.3 billion of preferred stock from Buffett. Buffett`s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) made that investment bacl in the fall of 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. The pay-back from General Electric (NYSE: GE) comes with a 10 percent redemption premium for Buffett. Before the news, GE was the biggest gainer of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 2.7 percent. It was a nice move here today but look at this. It was just yesterday when it hit $15 per share and on this 12-month chart, yeah, that was a 52-week low for GE.</p><p>Big tech also helping the market move higher, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) up 2.4 percent. It has been trying to rally here over the past several sessions tonight at its highest price in a month. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) announced a partnership, positioning Google`s smart phone software, Android, to work closely with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) semiconductors further pushing Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) into the mobile space. Cisco meantime saw a nice rally today, up about 1.6 percent. The CEO John Chambers hit an optimistic tone during an analyst meeting, even as the company released a more conservative growth forecast. Instead of double- digit year-over-year revenue growth which had been the norm at Cisco. Instead the company is predicting revenues to be up 5 to 7 percent over the next three years. Muted growth, nonetheless we are seeing a rally today.</p><p>Finally, grain prices taking another tumble. Despite lower harvest estimates this week, both wheat and corn dropping at least 3 percent. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) is having difficulty living up to its name. The company said today its quarterly profit fell 30 percent because rival retailers and weak consumer spending, especially on TVs and smart phones. Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) earned $0.47 a share, falling short of analyst estimates. The retailer also lowered its full-year outlook.</p><p>It was a much different scene at Target (NYSE: TGT) stores across the country today. The retailer rolled out its highly anticipated designer line \"Missoni for Target (NYSE: TGT).\" To say the items were popular may be an understatement. Suzanne Pratt reports.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This was Target (NYSE: TGT) in Mount Vernon, New York at 7:45 this morning. Everyone there wanted one thing, a piece of sky-high fashion at low prices. Customers buzzed through the aisles making a beeline for anything with Missoni`s signature zigzag pattern.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, my God, it`s a fashion steal. Are you kidding me? Who wouldn`t want these at these prices?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A regular sweater costs around $1,000.</p><p>PRATT: There were coveted rain boots, pillows and other bedding, super cute kids` clothes, and yes, that`s right, even a Missoni neck roll. And I`m still trying to figure out exactly what this is. It`s 10:00 in the morning, just two hours after this Target (NYSE: TGT) opened and already most of the women`s Missoni collection is gone. Target (NYSE: TGT) managers say they will be replenishing, but they don`t know how much or when. Target (NYSE: TGT) team leader Kyle Wilhelmy says he wasn`t surprised by the Missoni madness.</p><p>KYLE WILHELMY, EXECUTIVE TEAM LEADER, TARGET: We`ve had a lot of designers do really well here in the past. So, we anticipated it. We staffed for it and we were ready for it.</p><p>PRATT: Those who chose to shop online were disappointed. The site crashed early this morning. Target (NYSE: TGT) blamed demand for Missoni. Many retail experts say Target (NYSE: TGT) does a great job creating a frenzy ahead of its designer launches. This pop-up Missoni store in Manhattan opened last week and was sold out in hours. Analyst Jharonne Martis is impressed by Target`s know-how.</p><p>JHARONNE MARTIS, RETAIL ANALYST, THOMSON REUTERS: We`ve already seen so many items fly of the shelf that it`s definitely going to help boost September same store sales for Target (NYSE: TGT). It`s a very smart strategy, a very smart partnership. And if Target (NYSE: TGT) continues to do so, they will continue to succeed in the coming years.</p><p>PRATT: And then there are customers who simply can`t resist the chance to own even a tidbit of the iconic Missoni design.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I`ve never done this before. In fact, I`ve never been at a store at 10 after 8:00 in the morning to shop.</p><p>PRATT: Guess what? She`s coming back tomorrow morning. And, you know, so am I. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Here`s what we`re watching for you for tomorrow. We`ll see the August reports on retail sales and the producer price index. MIT economist and Professor Simon Johnson joins us to discuss the impact of Europe`s debt crisis. And Hilary Kramer is our \"Street Critique\" guest. Email your questions to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:streetcritique@nbr.com\">streetcritique@nbr.com</email></p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) wants America to run on Windows. To spread the word, the software giant handed out 5,000 Samsung tablet computers today that run on Windows 8. That will give users a chance to experience Microsoft`s next software system that includes features tailored for touch screens and tablets. The company hopes to take a bite out of consumers switching to Apple`s iPad. Tablet makers are expected to start selling products with Windows 8 by the middle of next year.</p><p>HUDSON: H&amp;R Block (NYSE: HRB) will not offer refund anticipation loans during next year`s tax season. The company says its client base is growing and the appeal of those high-cost loans is shrinking. H&amp;R Block (NYSE: HRB) was unable to offer the loans this year after regulators directed its third- party lending bank to stop funding the project. Now the tax services giant will continue to let customers use their anticipated refunds though to pay for tax preparation.</p><p>GHARIB: Is the economy behaving like Tennessee Williams characters? Tonight`s commentator thinks so. Here`s Daniel Gross, columnist and economic editor at Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO)! Finance.</p><p>DANIEL GROSS, COLUMNIST &amp; ECONOMICS EDITOR, YAHOO! FINANCE: Time was, governments bailed out their own troubled companies and citizens came to the aid of their own floundering governments. But today, we`re in the Blanche Dubois economy: companies, countries and sectors imperiled by dint of their own poor life choices are relying on the kindness of strangers. Greece is waiting on future bailouts from its frenemies in northern Europe. Italy, unable or unwilling to take aggressive action to cuts its deficits, is now looking to the Chinese government to plow some of its vast foreign currency reserves into Italian bonds.</p><p>In the U.S., a broken-down Chrysler was acquired and recapitalized by Fiat, an Italian company. And if you`re an American stuck with an insanely expensive real estate white elephant, your only hope seems to be selling to a foreigner. A British heiress recently purchased Aaron Spelling`s $85 million Hollywood mansion, which had lingered on the market for ages. Money is indeed scurrying around the world. I`m Daniel Gross.</p><p>HUDSON: Finally tonight, if the Greek economic drama hasn`t been enough international intrigue, look no further than this year`s U.S. open tennis tournament. Serbian Novak Djokovic cranked his winning shot on match point, defeating the defending champion Rafael Nadal of Spain last night and bringing with it a double digit increase in television ratings. Tonight`s \"Beyond the Scoreboard\" looks at the business of tennis. Here`s Rick Horrow.</p><p>RICK HORROW: A slow job market and bad weather are not ideal conditions for an outdoor game that can take hours to finish. Those are the challenges for the tennis industry and it showcased an American event that wrapped up this week, the U.S. Open. According to the tennis industry association, rackets, tennis ball, even string shipments all fell during the first half of the year. Players may be spending less on tennis gear, but more people are spending time watching the sport. Television ratings for the U.S. Open were up from a year ago. I spoke with Ken Soloman, the chairman and CEO of the tennis championship.</p><p>KEN SOLOMAN, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, THE TENNIS CHANNEL: This is the one sport where women are as, if not more popular than the men both on court and in terms of their real playing. That doubles the potential scale of the enterprise going in.</p><p>HORROW: So talk about the business model generally. You are somewhat independent and you have to compete with the big boys everybody day. How does that work?</p><p>SOLOMAN: The season of tennis is a lot like a movie slate in that we`ve got four (INAUDIBLE) blockbusters every year called the grand slam. Those are like multi-hundred million dollar sequels. Everybody know what they are. They come back every single year. Those are our tent poles.</p><p>HORROW: So you`ve got the content model all taken care of. But the revenue model, the distribution model. Was it harder than you thought when you started?</p><p>SOLOMAN: Our distributors are also our competitors. Many are the very same people who control the pipes, like a Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) (NYSE: CCS) like a Cablevision, also have their own networks. It`s a natural outcropping of business to say well look, if I`ve got golf channel, and a piece of the major league baseball network and NHL network and NBA network, those are going to get preferential treatment if I have a choice and I`m Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) (NYSE: CCS). And that`s why golf channel is in 23 million homes and Versus (ph) is in 23 Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) (NYSE: CCS) homes. Virtually every one of their household subscriber homes preferring (ph) with no additional charge and tennis channel is only in about 2.7 to three million homes with a $5.99 or $6.99 surcharge. That wouldn`t be happening if we were owned by them.</p><p>HORROW: You do have some synergies. Here at this tournament, ESPN, CBS (NYSE: CBS), NBC for the French. How do you make that work?</p><p>SOLOMAN: We became evangelists for the notion that integrated networks, an integrated web of networks was superior to what had previously been the model which was exclusivity. Platforms would buy rights and then say whatever I don`t put out, I don`t want anybody to have. We went to the French tennis federation and said look, ESPN is doing a great job. They`ve got about 50 hours. Looks like NBC has about 12 to 15. You`re doing 400 and they`re all good. Every one of those minutes on the red clay is great and you`re not seeing the Serena match or the Roger match or the Ken (INAUDIBLE) match or the (INAUDIBLE) match because you had to show something else. Let us do that.</p><p>And that was our first grand slam and we went back to ESPN and to CBS (NYSE: CBS) and NBC and said let us shoulder the burden of it. Let us find a way to share costs on the back end for the stuff that people don`t see and let`s promote the whole thing together. Our presentation is much more like an Olympics presentation. That`s two weeks of content morning noon and night just like here the U.S. Open. And their ratings go up, because we`re promoting to them, and our only quid pro quo was look, when you go off and you go to ESPN into Nascar or bull riding or women`s basketball, please make sure that you toss that to us so that you don`t make the tennis fan unhappy.</p><p>HUDSON: Tennis channel CEO Ken Soloman with Rick Horrow. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Tuesday evening, September 13. Thanks for joining us. Have a great night Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Same to you, Tom. I`m Susie Gharib. Have a great evening everyone and we hope to see all of you again tomorrow night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

The blue chips  rack up a triple digit gain, powered higher by the nation`s factories  kicking into higher gear.  You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for  Monday, January 4.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB:  Good evening everyone.  Wall Street kicked off 2010 with a  rally.  The Dow surged over 155 points, the NASDAQ rose 39 and the S&amp;P 500  jumped nearly 18. </p><p>HUDSON:  Susie, it was a heck of a run the first trading day, good  economic news triggered the buying.  Investors encouraged by an upbeat  report from the Institute of Supply Management showing those factory orders  ramping up, jobs ramping up and prices finally starting to head up as well. </p><p>GHARIB:  And comforting comments from Fed chief Bernanke yesterday  also helped, implying there`s no hurry to raise interest rates, at least  for now.  UBS strategist Mike Ryan expects stocks to continue to move  higher from here. </p><p>MIKE RYAN, STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  The market I think is  moving in anticipation of several events.  They`re moving in anticipation  of what they believe will be a moderate but sustainable economic recovery.   They`re moving in anticipation of an earnings recovery that should have  earnings returning towards trend -- not immediately, but slowly returning  towards trend and also an environment that remains fairly benign from an  inflation standpoint. </p><p>GHARIB:  The head of the New York Stock Exchange told me he`s also  optimistic about the stock market in 2010.  I talked to Duncan Niederauer  right after the opening bell rang here at the big board and I asked him for  his market forecast. </p><p>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, CEO, NYSE EURONEXT:  I think we`re in such a better  place than we were a year ago that it`s hard not to be optimistic.  So I`m  very constructive about where the market should go from here.  We look at  our IPO pipeline, it`s pretty solid.  I think you`ve got corporate earnings  continuing to grow and I think you`ve got a lot of the uncertainty that was  really prevailing at this time last year, is out of the way. So I`m pretty  optimistic for `010. </p><p>GHARIB:  But Duncan I have been talking to a lot of market strategists  and even traders right here on the floor.  And they`re talking about a  correction for 2010. </p><p>NIEDERAUER:  I happen to not agree.  It`s easy to predict the  correction because we`re up, the Dow`s up 60 percent since March, S&amp;P is up  more than that, NASDAQ is up 80 percent since March.  The indices are all  up a lot so I think it`s right to expect a correction.  The market feels  fairly valued to me.  It doesn`t feel overvalued.  I think people are going  to be much more focused on the economy because I think corporate earnings  are going to deliver the goods this year. </p><p>GHARIB:  I`m sure you get asked this a lot by individual investors.   Is it safe for me to put my money in the stock market?  Everybody is still  afraid about putting their money in stocks these days.  What is going to  take to restore investor confidence? </p><p>NIEDERAUER:  I think it`s about how they feel as a consumer first.  So  I`m going to be watching the consumer confidence metrics and how the  economic recovery is going in `010. Because I think that is what people are  now going to focus their attention on.  So I think people are going to have  to feel more comfortable that their job is more stable, the roof over their  head is stable, they can take care of their family and then I think it is a  necessary -- that is a necessary step to take before we are going to have  people feel better and come back to the equity markets on the retail side. </p><p>GHARIB:  Let`s talk a little bit about financial regulatory reform.   The American public is looking to Congress to pass new rules that hopefully  will prevent the financial system from breaking down in the future.  What  do you like the most? What don`t you like? </p><p>NIEDERAUER:  I think a lot of what you are going to see from the SEC  is directionally correct.  It is going to be a lot around market structure.   I don`t know if it is necessarily going to be in the category of preventing  a crisis.  I think the best thing that has been talked about is on the OTC  derivative space, more central clearing, more transparency. The thing I`m  most worried about on the regulatory side is this talk of a transaction tax  which I think would have very, very negative implications for volumes and  for the cost of trading for retail investors. </p><p>GHARIB:  And this transaction tax would be on trades of stocks and  options and futures.  Is that a tax really just going to be passed on to  investors? </p><p>NIEDERAUER:  That`s my view.  I`m actually writing a piece right now  that I`m going to be distributing in the next couple of weeks.  And among  the points I make is one of the points you just made Susie, which is it`s  absolutely a pass-through tax.  This idea, the way it`s been packaged, to  sell it to Main Street that it is a tax on Wall Street.  It is not a tax on  Wall Street.  It is a tax on Main Street.  It will flow down to the retail  investor.  It will flow down to the mutual fund holder.  It is not going to  be paid for by Wall Street. </p><p>GHARIB:  Duncan, how do you rate President Obama`s performance in  terms of his position on things like banks, financial reform, executive  compensation? </p><p>NIEDERAUER:  I would sum it up this way. We`ve been very pleased with  the words that he and the Treasury secretary have spoken.  We have given  them kudos for the measures they appear to be ready to take.  I think now  in `010 the proof is in the pudding.  Are they actually going to carry out  what they say they are going to do and follow through? </p><p>GHARIB:  What do you think the president needs to do in 2010 that will  restore confidence in American businesses and the markets? </p><p>NIEDERAUER:  What the president needs to do is what he started to do a  few weeks ago which is call the banks in together and say crisis averted.   You guys are well on the road to recovery.  Your profitability shows that.   Please start lending to small and medium-sized institutions and from our  vantage point, the credit market is still predominantly closed to small and  medium-sized enterprises and we think it`s critical that he apply pressure  in the right places to get that credit flowing freely again. </p><p>GHARIB:  You mentioned earlier about IPOs.  There is a lot of buzz  about a flurry of IPOs and the NYSE and the NASDAQ are lobbying hard to get  those listings.  How much of it will come your way? </p><p>NIEDERAUER:  We operate in a very competitive environment for the  listings.  We win more than our fair share.  We have and I`m very confident  will continue to do so.  The pipeline we`ve got coming in the next few  months dramatically tilted our way.  So we`re pretty excited about it.</p><p>GHARIB:  This first trading week of the year, we`re talking to the  leaders of the nation`s big exchanges.  On Wednesday Craig Donohue, CEO of  the CME Group in Chicago and then on Thursday, Robert Greifeld, CEO of the  NASDAQ OMX.  Tom. </p><p>HUDSON:  Susie, some of the other big stories tonight.   Putting away  the hammers and the nails at building sites in November.  We`ve seen a  drop-off in both home building and commercial projects leading to a 0.6  percent drop in construction spending.  This is the seventh straight month  on the downside. </p><p>Swiss drug maker Novartis is eyeing complete control of eye care  company Alcon.  Today, Novartis announcing plans to take over Alcon, paying  Nestle nearly $39 billion for the 77 percent stake in Alcon that Nestle  owns. </p><p>Some good and some bad in what Bank of America`s new CEO Brian  Moynihan sees for the future.  Forecasters at the bank predict the U.S.  economy will grow more than 3 percent this year. But that slow pace also  means the unemployment rate will stay high. </p><p>And watch out, above! How about this, the world`s tallest skyscraper  now open in Dubai. At 2,717 feet, the Burj Khalifa is named for the leader  of the neighboring Abu Dhabi which just pitched in $10 billion to bail  Dubai out of its financial crisis. </p><p>GHARIB:  An evolution of thinking for the Fed chairman. That`s how  political economist Tom Gallagher today characterized this weekend`s  remarks we told you about from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.  Bernanke said  low interest rates were not to blame for the housing crisis; a lack of  regulation was.  Stephanie Dhue spoke with Gallagher about the message the  Fed chairman delivered. </p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Bernanke said  that sometimes the Fed should use interest rate policy to address bubbles.   Do you see the Fed making a move to address emerging markets or  commodities? </p><p>TOM GALLAGHER, POLITICAL ECONOMIST, ISI:  That is a change on  Bernanke`s part.  He was very much a part of the Greenspan-led consensus on  how monetary policy wants to approach bubbles, which is to say that  monetary policy shouldn`t adjust for bubbles at all until it was time to  pick up the pieces.  Now I think the central banking community is moving  toward a view that the central bank should be worried about the development  of asset bubbles, primarily know that regulation is the preferred approach.  But there are some circumstances in which monetary policy can play a role.   So that does reflect a bit of an evolution, his thinking along with the  rest of the central banking community during the course of this bubble,  this boom-bust cycle. So I think that has been a shift on his part. </p><p>DHUE:  Bernanke says that low interest rates weren`t the reason for  the housing bubble.  Do you see that as a defense of the Greenspan Fed or a  defense of the current Fed? </p><p>GALLAGHER:  Given that he was there during most of that time period,  it was really a defense of the Fed and his own role in it, I think.  And I  think that he`s on pretty good grounds in arguing that the monetary policy  was not being reason for the housing bubble.  He defended the Fed`s record  by pointing to a defensible calculation on where the Fed funds rate should  be.  It wasn`t very far from that and he was responding to a lot of  criticism that the Fed had unusually low interest rates for a long period  of time and that`s what Fed the housing bubble.  Instead he presented some  calculations that suggested that it was the development of alternative  mortgages that produced very low initial monthly payments and that that  system is what lead to the housing bubble as both the borrower and lender  believed that home prices would continue to rise and they would never have  to pay the higher mortgage payments that would be due later on. </p><p>DHUE:  Now Bernanke`s faced a lot of criticism as he has gone before  the Senate to keep his job.  Do you think he`ll be an effective advocate  for reform? </p><p>GALLAGHER:  Well, I don`t think the views of the Fed chairman are an  especially important part of the outcome of this debate.  There is a lot of  interest groups that are affected by this  and they are fighting very hard  on this.  And I think it`s hard for any Fed chairman to really have a  material impact on the outcome of that debate. </p><p>DHUE:  And bottom line for investors looking at Bernanke talking about  asset bubbles and interest rates, any change here? </p><p>GALLAGHER:  No, I thought especially if you take Bernanke`s and  Cohen`s speeches together, there wasn`t a lot of guidance on where interest  rates are headed in the near-term.  But I think that you have to assume,  you have to read those speeches as suggesting that not anything is -- that  nothing is going to happen any time soon. </p><p>DHUE:  And not any time soon, not first quarter, not second quarter. </p><p>GALLAGHER:  I think that the Fed is likely to raise interest rates in  the third quarter.  And I think given how far away that is, that`s still  six months away at the earliest, it`s hard to be very specific on that.  I  think that probably the important action for the financial markets, even  more than the rate hike will be when they change the language, the guidance  they are giving the markets on interest rates.  Right now they are  promising to keep interest rates more or less at zero for an extended  period of time.  When that extended period phrase gets dropped, it is  probably when markets start to react and risk assets will probably perform  more poorly.  When that happens and I suspect that is a second quarter  event, and again, so not anything any time soon. </p><p>DHUE:  Tom Gallagher, thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>GALLAGHER:  Thank you.</p><p>HUDSON:  Still ahead on the program, can Google do for mobile phones  what it`s done for web searches and advertising? The tech titan gets ready  to lift the curtain on its own smart phone. </p><p>GHARIB:  Tom as you heard me complain, it`s so very cold here in New  York so I`m not surprised that that`s the theme that you`re going to be   looking at in your market focus tonight. </p><p>HUDSON:  Absolutely.  That cold snap that`s really gripping much of  the country Susie pushing around energy, even orange juice prices.  Plus  we`re going to talk about betting on China and some new highs today for the  first of the year for some big tech names in our market focus. </p><p>But that Arctic cold air gripping much of the country is sending  energy prices up to prices not seen since October.   Energy also getting a  boost certainly from today`s better than expected manufacturing numbers we  told you about earlier.</p><p>So let`s take a look at some of the numbers. Crude oil jumping to over  $80 a barrel.  In addition to the cold weather, a weaker dollar may have  helped out, also a break out over $83 for oil would take it to post- recession highs.  Nat gas also catching fire with this cold snap and with  the freezing temps reaching down into Florida, even orange juice futures  jumping, but ended with only about half of the gains seen earlier in the  day.  Watch those OJ prices by the way, as futures have doubled in the past  year.</p><p>Speaking of the surprise rise in manufacturing activity fueling some  hope maybe that the job picture finally may be seeing some improvement.   The December jobs reports are due out on Friday of course and the job gains  are expected to be seen again in temporary workers, as has been the case  over the past four months.  Now the temp hiring stocks are already moving,  maybe in anticipation.</p><p>Stocks like Manpower (MAN), Robert Half International, Kelly Services  (KELVA) seeing a nice bid today. Spherion (SPN) also moving higher by  better than 8 1/2 percent.  All these stocks hitting multi-week highs ahead  of those Friday`s jobs data.</p><p>Early on here already just one day in 2010 looking a lot like 2009,  with last year`s leaders helping push the market indices higher.   Information technology the single best performing sector throughout all of  2009 and the big guys continue to hit some prices not seen in really about  a couple of years. Take a look at some of these longer term charts, two  years long here on Cisco (CSCO) breaking out to the upside on this first  trading day of the year, running after $25 a share, a price not seen since  the summer of 2008.  Volume also  stronger than normal on today`s move  higher.</p><p>How about Microsoft (MSFT), another two-year chart here, continues to  find buyers over $30 a share.   Today`s buying takes Microsoft to a level  shareholders haven`t enjoyed in two years. The rally in these stocks is  helpful for many growth mutual fund investors as these stocks tend to be  very popular with those kinds of mutual funds.</p><p>Intel (INTC) also getting in the act, jumping to its highest price  since October.  Brokerage firm Baird upgrading it, calling Intel a quote  value and defensive idea and continuing to echo the idea that businesses  will be buying new computers in 2010.</p><p>The action in these three stocks comes really just a few days before  the beginning of the big consumer electronics show, which spotlights tech  trends in the making.</p><p>Speaking of which, watch Apple (AAPL) stock as the \"Wall Street  Journal\" tonight quoting sources saying the company will unveil a long- awaited tablet computer at that convention.  It could measure 10 to 11  inches and ship out in March around $1,000.  Apple stock over $214 a share,  $214, is at all-time highs.</p><p>With the market breaking out to these post-recession highs, some  market leading sectors have seen mixed performance.</p><p>Thanks to that Intel (INTC) move, semiconductor exchange traded fund  leading the way for technology above the range in December.</p><p>The economically sensitive transportation ETF however remains below  new highs perhaps kept in check a little bit by oil.</p><p>Financial stocks also turning up but remain well below their October  highs.</p><p>Betting on gaming in the new year, how about this, a couple of  gambling stocks see big buying volume today.  Las Vegas Sands (LVS) jumping  more than 9 percent on twice average daily volume.  UBS thinking the stock  should see $20 a share in the next year.  It also raised its rating on Wynn  Resorts (WYNN) and that stock responded, up on bigger than usual volume.    The price target here $76.</p><p>The analyst likes both casinos based not on what happens in Las Vegas  but what could happen in Macau, China.   While Vegas revenues are predicted  to be flat, UBS thinks gaming in Macau is tracking better than expected.</p><p>And that`s our market focus tonight.</p><p>GHARIB:  Could Google have iPhone envy?  That`s a question the tech  blogs are asking tonight as we wait for an announcement tomorrow from the  Internet giant.  Google is expected to unwrap its own entry into the smart  phone market.  But as usual, exactly what the company is up to is less than  clear.  Scott Gurvey reports. </p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Google phone  is one of the worst kept secrets in an industry that doesn`t keep secrets  very well.  Since the web site Engadget got its hands on what Google is  calling the Nexus one, editor-in-chief Joshua Topolsky says the response  has been extraordinary. </p><p>JOSHUA TOPOLSKY, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, ENGADGET.COM (BY TELEPHONE): The  reaction about this phone has been kind of insane.  It`s been phenomenal.  And since we put up our hands-on post, there`s been an enormous amount of  traffic with people coming to the site to see those pictures and to hear  what we had to say about the phone. </p><p>GURVEY: The big question Google will face at tomorrow`s unveiling is,  why?  Google`s Android operating system already appears on scores of phones  including the Motorola Droid recently introduced by Verizon Wireless.  The  Nexus phone does not appear to make any major improvements on the Droid.   And Gene Munster, technology analyst at Piper Jaffray, says Google`s  unknown motives are alarming the industry. </p><p>GENE MUNSTER, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY:  If they put out a  phone that shows all the good things that Android can do I think their  partners well be happy to see that.  If they come out and actually try to  grab market share and aggressively price this, I think it`s going to create  quite a high level of friction between all the players in the market. </p><p>GURVEY:  Rumors about Google`s marketing plans have industry blogs on  fire.  Price points range from $500 to free.  T-Mobile may offer the phone  packaged with a two-year contract for $200.  Sales of conventional mobile  phones have been dropping since the economy tanked.  But Apple`s iPhone has  remained a strong seller throughout the downturn.  And Michael Gikas of  \"Consumer Reports,\" says interest in smart phones is jumping as the economy  recovers. </p><p>MICHAEL GIKAS, SENIOR EDITOR, CONSUMER REPORTS:  Sales of smart phones  keep going up and the number one reason is people want these extra  features.  And they`re going to pay more for them too. Not just for the  phones but they`re going to be paying higher monthly premiums for data  plans and text messaging and all sorts of other things. </p><p>GURVEY:  The Google phone is said to run only on GSM networks. GSM is  frequently found in countries overseas but in the United States, this means  the Nexus one will only run on the T-Mobile system.  Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>GHARIB:  Here`s what we`re watching for tomorrow.  We`ll get a look at  the health of the housing sector when the National Association of Realtors  release the pending home sales for November.  Factory orders for November  will be released as well.  Also we`ll see how U.S. auto makers fared in  December and hear from some car dealers for their take on what will drive  the auto industry this year. </p><p>While we won`t know about General Motors` U.S. sales until tomorrow,  its sales in China are revving up. The auto maker says last year it sold a  record 1.8 vehicles there.  That`s up 67 percent.  The top selling brands  in China were Buick and Chevrolet.  And helping things: a government  program to defray the cost of buying fuel efficient cars and trucks.  Some  of those programs are now being phased out, but GM thinks its sales in  China are still on track to keep growing down the road. </p><p>HUDSON: Until we make a profit, I won`t take a paycheck.  Now, that`s  what the new head of Continental Airlines told employees today,  Jeff  Smisek took the top job Friday after Larry Kellner left to join a private  equity firm.  Smisek says the tone for business is set at the top, so if  everyone wants better pay and benefits, the business needs to make money.   That`s not happening now.  Continental Air is deep in the red.  The carrier  lost $367 million in the first nine months of last year. </p><p>GHARIB:  Tonight`s commentator thinks we`ll see a better economic  reality in 2010.  He`s Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody`seconomy.com. </p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`SECONOMY.COM:  For the first time  in a very long time, I`m able to say that I`m optimistic about the  economy`s prospects.  2010 won`t be a great year.  That would be  inappropriate given that unemployment will likely remain in the double- digits through much of the year, but it will feel pretty good after what we  have been through.  Job growth is set to resume in the next few months and  will be strong enough to meaningfully bring down unemployment by year`s  end.  This optimism is based on the belief that the Federal Reserve will  not raise interest rates anytime soon and that the Obama administration and  Congress will provide more temporary help to unemployed workers and hard- pressed state and local governments. </p><p>A stronger global economy and softer U.S. dollar will also fuel a  revival in export growth.  Selling what we produce to the rest of the world  will be the principal source of long term growth and this growth driver  will kick in this year.  While the economy will make its way back this  year, it won`t come roaring back.  Businesses are no longer panicked, but  they remain cautious and will be slow to hire and to invest. A lack of  credit is weighing heavily on those small businesses so vital to the job  machine.  The ongoing foreclosure crisis also threatens to push house  prices even lower. The wrongs that led to the financial crisis and great  recession are being slowly righted.  With a bit more help from policy  makers, the current recovery will evolve into a self sustaining economic  expansion in 2010.  This is Mark Zandi. </p><p>HUDSON:  So it`s a new year and as you can seen in this broadcast, we  have some new features here at NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, so let me show you  around our new home base. It`s called a virtual set and chances are you`ve  seen them before.  This one was created by our graphic artists and is  controlled by a system of computers.  If you were here in the studio with  me, you`d see I`m actually standing on a big green backdrop.  The set and  other elements are added in our control room.  Now moving to this type of  electronic set up lets us give you critical analysis of news stories, stock  market information and data, in new ways. It helps us make information  visual, more interesting and easy to see at a glance.  And it also helps  you connect with our content in a clear and concise way.  So while there  may be fewer stock quotes, there will be more analysis. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Beautiful.</p><p>HUDSON: Hope you find it beautiful as well and Susie clearly the  presentation has changed, some faces have changed but some things will  never change here at NBR. </p><p>GHARIB: You look really good against that green background, yeah, you  are right.  The good stuff and the important stuff is still here, same  mission that we have had for the past 30 years. We want to educate and  empower you, our viewers, so that you can make better financial decisions.  So keep watching. </p><p>HUDSON:  And it`s great to start out on a day with the Dow hitting new  15 month highs, how about that. </p><p>GHARIB:  We`ll call it the Tom Hudson effect. </p><p>HUDSON: Yeah, right, OK, you`ll be about the only one that calls it  that, maybe you and my mom. </p><p>That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday, January 4.  I`m Tom  Hudson. Good night to everybody and good night to you too Susie. </p><p>GHARIB: And good night to you Tom.  I`m Susie Gharib.  Good night,  everyone and we hope to see all of you again tomorrow night.   </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, October 22.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening, everyone. The clock is ticking for the mid- term elections. Americans on Main Street are eager for their voices to be heard. And you know Tom, investors on Wall Street are waiting for a post- election market rally and history shows they might just get one.</p><p>HUDSON: It certainly does Susie, mid-term elections classic for case studies on the stock market. In the third year of a first-term presidency, which would be next year, stocks have rallied every time since 1939. The \"Stock Traders Almanac,\" which tracks these things says in years where there`s a Democrat in the White House, stocks have rallied more than 21 percent.</p><p>GHARIB: This time Tom, the run up might have come early. S&amp;P strategist Alec Young notes the Dow has surged more than a thousand points since September.</p><p>YOUNG: There is building anticipation that the Republicans will take the House. So certainly I think that`s probably factored into the market and viewed as a positive given tremendous tax and regulatory uncertainty that is currently hanging over a sluggish domestic recovery.</p><p>GHARIB: Now two of the most closely watched Senate races in the country are in Illinois and Florida. Both are races without any incumbents. And with both states struggling with double-digit unemployment, those races are all about the economy. As we continue our coverage, \"Mid- Term 2010-- It`s the Economy,\" we bring you two reports tonight. We begin with Diane Eastabrook in Illinois, where the focus is on regaining thousands of lost manufacturing jobs.</p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Shuttered factories have become part of the landscape in rust belt states like Illinois. In the last two years, the recession has claimed more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs here. Job search boot camps are attracting twice as many displaced workers as they did a year ago. Some like Craig Radcliffe want more help from Washington.</p><p>CRAIG RADCLIFFE, DISPLACED WORKER: I would think that maybe at this time that you would want to open up to more ideas and not really worry about how many people think you should do this or that.</p><p>EASTABROOK: In Illinois, jobs and the economy are central issues in the campaign for the U.S. Senate where Republican Congressman Mark Kirk is running against Democratic state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias. Some Illinois manufacturers call this election the most important one in decades.</p><p>BERT MILLER, PRESIDENT, PHOENIX CLOSURES: The policies that we`ve seen implemented in Washington in the last two years are killing American business.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Bert Miller is the president of Phoenix Closures -- a 120-year-old firm that makes plastic container caps. Miller wants less government regulation and tax cuts extended for everyone, including the wealthy, something Kirk favors, but Giannoulias opposes.</p><p>MILLER: If you start raising those taxes, you are going to find that there is less money to invest in capital equipment and things like that.</p><p>EASTABROOK: While the economy and jobs loom large in Illinois this election year, so too does scandal. Both candidates for the U.S. Senate are battling controversy that political scientists say could overshadow other issues. For Giannoulias it`s the failure of his family`s Chicago bank which allegedly made loans to the mob a decade ago. For Kirk, it`s the embellishment of his naval record. Northwestern University political science Professor Victoria Defrancesco Soto thinks these issues could influence voters more than the economy.</p><p>VICTORIA DEFRANCESCO SOTO, PROFESSOR, NORTHWESTERN UNIV.: The economy has been going downhill in Illinois for a long time. We`re the rust belt, so people were consciously aware of what was going on unlike a Nevada. So, they`re in the midst of an economic downturn, but they don`t want to add insult to injury by having somebody who is a liar or who has links to the mob.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Despite their reasons, Soto thinks the way Illinoisans cast their votes in this election could send a strong message to the president. Since it`s his old Senate seat, the outcome could be viewed as a referendum on his policies. Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Naperville, Illinois.</p><p>JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This is Jeff Yastine. Foreclosure signs and political signs. The two go together in Florida, where housing defaults are the fifth highest in the nation. That, combined with a 12 percent unemployment rate and an economy just limping along is driving the sentiment of voters like Tracy Flett. He owns a south- Florida based roofing company which has had its share of layoffs. He`s also one of the thousands of people who went to the polls for early voting this week.</p><p>TRACY FLETT, EARLY VOTER: I`m looking for someone who cares about balance, someone who cares about the middle class; I`m looking for someone who`s looks at the right things for big corporations, but also the right things for the small business owner. And I`m looking for people who care.</p><p>YASTINE: The right things for business are key factors in the three- way race for Florida`s open Senate seat. Republican Marco Rubio has been hammering away with a low-tax message that`s made him the front-runner. Republican-governor turned-independent Charlie Crist and Congressman Kendrick Meek running a distant second and third. Rubio has benefited from major support and endorsements from national business groups, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business. The Senate race hasn`t seen any endorsements from the Florida Chamber of Commerce. But its president and CEO Mark Wilson says the group`s members, more than anything, are looking for policy predictability in Washington.</p><p>MARK WILSON, FLORIDA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: The private sector, when they know that we`re not going to change our taxes around, when they`re not going to force benefits on small businesses that they can`t afford, when they feel that it`s safe to invest again and they feel that they can invest in employees and in technology and productivity improvement, then we`re going to see job growth in this state and in this country, that we`ve not seen in over a decade.</p><p>YASTINE: Professor Charles Zelden of Nova Southeastern University, says in a state like Florida ardent pro-business messages, like low taxes, are an especially winning formula. But it come with a catch.</p><p>CHARLES ZELDEN, PROF., LEGAL STUDIES, NOVA SOUTHEASTERN UNIV.: The problem is what do you do to compensate for less income coming in? What do you cut? The problem is we don`t want services to be cut. We want a stimulus that keeps our teachers working, that keeps our cops working, keeps our firefighters working. But we also don`t want to pay more taxes. You can`t do both.</p><p>YASTINE: As this trio of Senate candidates hits the homestretch, Florida residents will soon make their priorities known. Jeff Yastine, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Miami.</p><p>HUDSON: Here are the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. It was a mixed end to the week on Wall Street. The Dow Industrials fell 14 points, the NASDAQ added 19, the S&amp;P 500 up nearly three. Trading volume fell on both the big board and the NASDAQ to the lowest levels of the week.</p><p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is urging limits on trade imbalances for the world`s biggest economies. Speaking at a gathering of G-20 finance ministers and central bankers in South Korea, Geithner said he thinks G-20 nations need to keep their current account balance below 4 percent of gross domestic product. After weeks of protests and strikes, the French senate has approved a measure hiking that nation`s retirement age from 60 to 62. Final approval of the change is expected Monday. France`s unions say the protests will continue, despite today`s vote.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead on the program, sailing the seas of a weak U.S. economy. We bring you illustrator David Gillette`s latest Inkonomics.</p><p>GHARIB: Big tech companies are sitting on billions of dollars of cash, including Intel. Earlier this week, the chip giant announced plans to spend $6 billion on research and development. It`s also forking over more than $7 billion to acquire Internet security firmMcAfee. Stacy Smith is the chief financial officer at Intel. He tells NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT using cash wisely is good for Intel investors.</p><p>STACY SMITH, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, INTEL: I think companies have a moral obligation to do the right things for their constituencies and for us our constituencies are our owners, so we`re always looking at how do we create shareholder value. Our employees and then where we have operations we want to do the right things for the countries and the environment and that constituency as well.</p><p>GHARIB: On Monday, you can see our entire interview with Smith as he explains how Intel makes decisions about its $20 billion pile of cash.</p><p>Tom, it was a mixed day for the markets but for the week they were up. That makes three in a row. Some nervousness as you mentioned earlier about that G-20 meeting of finance ministers this coming up weekend.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes, nervousness about that communique that will come out before the market opens on Monday clearly, but the focus still remains on earnings throughout this week and likely for the next couple of weeks. Let`s get you updated here Susie in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" And the reason why the focus remains on earnings, this was just the first of three peak weeks for earnings and those earnings helped the major indices clock another week of gains as Susie mentioned. And here are those gains beginning with the Dow Industrials (DJI) adding 0.6 of a percent thanks to gains on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. The NASDAQ (IXIC) meantime gained 0.4 of a percent, gained four out of the past five sessions as you can see. The S&amp;P 500 (GSPC) 0.6 of a percent higher tonight compared to one week ago.</p><p>It was a mixed market overall today. Technology and energy shares really led the gainers. The Dow was hurt by a couple of those earnings reports. Verizon (VZ) one of them. Here are the results. They were better than estimates, but down from a year ago as you can see. Even though Verizon predicted its earnings for the rest of the year will be at the high end of its guidance, shares sold off. Let`s take a look at the stock here, falling more than 1 percent. It was the second biggest percent drop for the Dow Industrial components. It`s now at a one-month low. One concern for Verizon: far fewer new wireless subscribers last quarter than rival AT&amp;T. The other big Dow loser American Express (AXP), dropping 3 percent. Earnings last night were better than expected but loan volume remains low and that`s fueling worries about future revenue growth.</p><p>Now oil service stocks really helped energy put in the best sector gains today. Among the leaders here, Schlumberger (SLB). Earnings easily beating estimates after excluding the impact of the acquisition of Smith International. Revenue jumped despite that deep water moratorium that was in place during most of the third quarter. The stock was able to add more than 5 percent on pretty heavy volume. This is its highest price that Schlumberger has seen since early May. Earnings were also in play in technology, helping the top three sector gainers and all three of these are software makers. Take a look. Compuware (CPWR) was up more than 12 percent on some strong earnings. This is a two-year high for shares tonight. CA (CA) jumped 5 percent to its highest price since May. Strong earnings, especially the performance in North America helped last quarter. And Citrix Systems (CTXS) bounced 4 percent. It had a stronger than expected outlook after decent results.</p><p>Investors clearly had an appetite for restaurant stocks, pizza, yeah one of them, also Mexican and cheesecake, how about that? We`ll begin with BJ`s (BJRI). It runs pizza and brewery restaurants. Strong results and positive analyst comments fueled a 17 percent run in shares today. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) boosted its same store sales outlook after strong earnings. Shares added 15 percent. Both BJ`s and Chipotle are at all-time highs tonight. Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) also getting an analyst upgrade after some strong results. Shares jumping 8 percent.</p><p>Busy week for IPOs, five of them hitting the Street, including two more Chinese-based firms. Take a look at all five here. Tal Education (XRS) started at $10 this week. It provides tutoring services in China. Shares continued jumping throughout the week. ShangPharma (SHP) does research for drug makers. It began trading at $15, closed below that price tonight. Three others -- Vera Bradley`s (VRA) IPO $16 per share, nice big run there. It makes designer handbags. Debit card company NetSpend (NTSP) had investors spending. It started at $11, closing tonight over $13. And Brio (BBRG) is the first American restaurant to go public since 2006. It started at $14 per share and clearly is higher tonight. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: As we`ve been reporting, corporate America is feeling better about earnings. Investors have been rewarded with a market rally. But there seems to be a disconnect with what most Americans are experiencing: lost jobs, lost value in their homes and on and on. With that in mind, we bring you another installment of \"Inkonomics with David Gillette.\" David`s an Emmy-winning illustrator and essayist at Twin Cities public television. Tonight, he ponders the question: has our economic ship sailed?</p><p>DAVID GILLETTE: If you`re on a mission to understand the economy, there`s no better place to start than your own back yard. For this cartoonist, we`re talking (INAUDIBLE) Minnesota, a small community just west of Minneapolis and resting on the shores of Lake Minnetonka, a 14,528 acre fresh water playground which incidentally empties itself into Minnehaha Creek, flows through the city of Minnetonka and then drops over Minnehaha Falls. Basically it`s a land where everything starts with minne, the Dakota word for water. And when people in this part of the world want to flex their financial muscles, they spent a lot of money on the minne. It`s an economy measured in boats. But here`s the surprising part. No matter what you may have heard over the last few years about the sour economy, there are still plenty of boats on Lake Minnetonka.</p><p>On the surface this makes no sense. If you turn on any electronic device, including practically the toaster, you`re told we`re either in the middle of, emerging from or returning to a recession. For most people this implies a lack of jobs, a lack of money and you would think a lack of time for practicing the principle of displacement. But there they are -- boats. And according to the people who take them to market, the bigger they are, the faster they sell. That`s why out of all the story lines we`re knitting around the contemporary American economy, wasteful government spending, in- exceptional education, foreign competition, I`m hanging my life jacket on the resurgence of financial stratification.</p><p>You see, according to the unique glacial pock marks I call home, this country isn`t suffering from an overall shortage of wealth. It`s just that the money we do have is disproportionately concentrated in a handful of 40-foot weekend cruisers and that`s actually where I`m going to stop. You see I`m not stupid. I don`t fully understand the economic forces that allow the rich to get richer while the not rich get not richer. But I do understand human nature. And if I go on national television and make it sound like the entire economic collapse rests on the shoulders of the people who buy boats, my chances of spending a day on the lake are going to end up in the drink.</p><p>GHARIB: So Tom, do you think Ben Bernanke knows about the Minnetonka indicator? Maybe we should tell him about the water effect on the economy.</p><p>HUDSON: I tell you, as long as those boats are seaworthy, it maybe a lot easier to refloat them, certainly, that`s definitely the truth. Let`s get you updated on what we`re watching for next week. We`ve got a lot on the calendar. Our Friday \"Market Monitor\" James Paulsen. He`s chief strategist at Wells Capital Management. We`re also due to get an update on housing from the September reports on both new and existing home sales as well as the first report on the third quarter GDP out next Friday. Monday our shoptalk series look at Ikea and how its eco-friendly policies are giving it a competitive advantage.</p><p>GHARIB: The U.S. Postal Service still wants you to pay more for stamps. It plans to appeal a regulator`s decision that denied permission to raise rates to $0.46 a stamp. The Postal Service says the increase is needed because of losses caused by a drop in mail volume. It blames it on the weak economy and a shift to email and online bill paying.</p><p>HUDSON: Federal regulators are now getting involved in the fee dispute between Cablevision and News Corp. The Federal Communications Commission today sent letters to the heads of both companies. They`ve asked to describe how they`re negotiating in good faith. About three million Cablevision subscribers in New York City and Philadelphia have been cut off from Fox programming. The blackout will enter its second week tomorrow if a deal is not reached.</p><p>With the Federal Reserve poised to try to get more money into the economy, tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" thinks that means inflation. Mark Skousen is editor of the market letter \"Forecasts and Strategies.\" He joins us tonight from the NASDAQ. Mark, nice to see you again, welcome back.</p><p>MARK SKOUSEN, EDITOR, \"FORECASTS &amp; STRATEGIES\": Tom, good to be with you.</p><p>HUDSON: So how much inflation and when do you think we`ll actually see it?</p><p>SKOUSEN: I think we`re going to see inflation down the road. But we have a triple play right now or hat trick, whatever you want to call it, for investors and I`m very bullish. Because what we have is low interest rates, we have low price inflation and we have easy money by the Fed. And the Fed has deliberately decided to increase inflation to 2 to 3 percent, inflation targeting, that`s what Ben Bernanke cut his teeth on and he`s really trying to impose it.</p><p>HUDSON: But we haven`t seen any of that inflation really. Instead we`ve seen disinflation. Still positive numbers, but very, very small.</p><p>SKOUSEN: Yes and that`s because the economy is so sluggish, particularly in the United States, unemployment really high. So they`re buying time and that`s great for us as investors because prices for investors are low and it`s an opportunity to be buying and taking advantage of this very unique scenario, because inflation will be coming back. Gold is a great indicator of future inflation and look what that`s doing.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes, over $1300 an ounce. So what markets do you like if the Fed is successful and is able to reignite inflation in the months or years ahead?</p><p>SKOUSEN: As we can see, this has been very bearish for the dollar, but it`s very bullish for stocks, bonds and commodities. So I`m fully invested in all three of those areas.</p><p>HUDSON: So you still like fixed income, even though interest rates are so low.</p><p>SKOUSEN: Well, fixed income, no, not Treasury bills that only pay 2 or 3 percent. What I`m talking about is high dividend paying stocks, the kind that I`ve been recommending to your viewers.</p><p>HUDSON: Sure, even though you do like dividends, your first new pick here, you`re clearly not afraid of volatility. This is a new stock pick, Rare Element Resources. We`re going to take a look at a chart here. This owns Rare Earth Element mine in Wyoming, REE the ticker symbol. Is Rare Earth Elements as you know Mark a source of some building tensions between the U.S. and China? Are you willing to play that geo-political risk?</p><p>SKOUSEN: This is a major geo-political risk and I will warn your viewers and they can see from the chart this stock has already doubled, tripled, quadrupled in value and so it is a risky speculation. But this problem is not going away. China is trying to corner the rare earth market, which is this group of 12 to 17 elements that nobody has ever heard of before that is critical in military applications and in hybrid cars, in cell phones, in computers and you name it and they control 97 percent of this market.</p><p>HUDSON: Mark, let me ask you, what kind of price target do you have? What kind of holding period for a volatile stock like that?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Well a lot of people think, it`s a micro cap right now, a lot of people think this is a billion dollar company, so it could possibly triple in value, but it is extremely volatile and investors need to know that.</p><p>HUDSON: Ninety seconds, I want to get to everything here. A new pick SeaDrill. This is a deep water energy driller, close to a new high. Why choose this deep water driller?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Well, because they were hurt by the BP scandal and they are still recovering from it. They have a very nice dividend yield of almost 9 percent. And they`re aggressively expanding. I think it`s a very good play on the expanding energy area.</p><p>HUDSON: OK. April 23rd you were last with us. You had three picks back then, two of them, the Ishares exchange-traded fund following Hong Kong, that stock up 17 percent. American Capital, a private equity firm, up by better than almost 6 percent. These are stock returns only. Do you still like these two?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Yes, I like Hong Kong because it`s only selling at 15 times earnings, 3 percent dividend. It is the center of growth in Asia. I like American Capital because there`s insider buying recently and it`s still selling below book. That`s a great story.</p><p>HUDSON: You also like EPD, this is a natural gas play, Enterprise Products, 15 1/2 percent on its stock price, plus a nice dividend on top of that. Do you still like it?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Yes, but I think Dan Duncan, the late, great Dan Duncan died recently. He bought a bunch of stock before hand. It a great rising dividend story, but I`m going to sell that and put that money in Sea Drill.</p><p>HUDSON: Take you profits. Any disclosures tonight?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Just these are some of the stocks we`re recommending in our services, but I don`t own any myself.</p><p>HUDSON: Our \"Market Monitor \"this evening, Mark Skousen. He`s editor of the market letter \"Forecasts and Strategies.\"</p><p>SKOUSEN: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: And Tom, before we say good night, looking ahead to next week we`ve got a lot to cover, more earnings, more election coverage, more about the markets and of course we`re going to be talking about upcoming decisions being made in Washington at the Fed.</p><p>HUDSON: Absolutely, the looming Federal Reserve meeting, which is a week from Wednesday, the day after Election Day. It`s going to be a busy couple weeks here. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT on this Friday evening. Thanks for joining us. It is October 22. I`m Tom Hudson. Have a great weekend and you too, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom, hope you have a great weekend as well. I`m Susie Gharib. Thanks for watching everyone and we hope to see all of you again on Monday night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, October 22.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening, everyone. The clock is ticking for the mid- term elections. Americans on Main Street are eager for their voices to be heard. And you know Tom, investors on Wall Street are waiting for a post- election market rally and history shows they might just get one.</p><p>HUDSON: It certainly does Susie, mid-term elections classic for case studies on the stock market. In the third year of a first-term presidency, which would be next year, stocks have rallied every time since 1939. The \"Stock Traders Almanac,\" which tracks these things says in years where there`s a Democrat in the White House, stocks have rallied more than 21 percent.</p><p>GHARIB: This time Tom, the run up might have come early. S&amp;P strategist Alec Young notes the Dow has surged more than a thousand points since September.</p><p>YOUNG: There is building anticipation that the Republicans will take the House. So certainly I think that`s probably factored into the market and viewed as a positive given tremendous tax and regulatory uncertainty that is currently hanging over a sluggish domestic recovery.</p><p>GHARIB: Now two of the most closely watched Senate races in the country are in Illinois and Florida. Both are races without any incumbents. And with both states struggling with double-digit unemployment, those races are all about the economy. As we continue our coverage, \"Mid- Term 2010-- It`s the Economy,\" we bring you two reports tonight. We begin with Diane Eastabrook in Illinois, where the focus is on regaining thousands of lost manufacturing jobs.</p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Shuttered factories have become part of the landscape in rust belt states like Illinois. In the last two years, the recession has claimed more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs here. Job search boot camps are attracting twice as many displaced workers as they did a year ago. Some like Craig Radcliffe want more help from Washington.</p><p>CRAIG RADCLIFFE, DISPLACED WORKER: I would think that maybe at this time that you would want to open up to more ideas and not really worry about how many people think you should do this or that.</p><p>EASTABROOK: In Illinois, jobs and the economy are central issues in the campaign for the U.S. Senate where Republican Congressman Mark Kirk is running against Democratic state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias. Some Illinois manufacturers call this election the most important one in decades.</p><p>BERT MILLER, PRESIDENT, PHOENIX CLOSURES: The policies that we`ve seen implemented in Washington in the last two years are killing American business.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Bert Miller is the president of Phoenix Closures -- a 120-year-old firm that makes plastic container caps. Miller wants less government regulation and tax cuts extended for everyone, including the wealthy, something Kirk favors, but Giannoulias opposes.</p><p>MILLER: If you start raising those taxes, you are going to find that there is less money to invest in capital equipment and things like that.</p><p>EASTABROOK: While the economy and jobs loom large in Illinois this election year, so too does scandal. Both candidates for the U.S. Senate are battling controversy that political scientists say could overshadow other issues. For Giannoulias it`s the failure of his family`s Chicago bank which allegedly made loans to the mob a decade ago. For Kirk, it`s the embellishment of his naval record. Northwestern University political science Professor Victoria Defrancesco Soto thinks these issues could influence voters more than the economy.</p><p>VICTORIA DEFRANCESCO SOTO, PROFESSOR, NORTHWESTERN UNIV.: The economy has been going downhill in Illinois for a long time. We`re the rust belt, so people were consciously aware of what was going on unlike a Nevada. So, they`re in the midst of an economic downturn, but they don`t want to add insult to injury by having somebody who is a liar or who has links to the mob.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Despite their reasons, Soto thinks the way Illinoisans cast their votes in this election could send a strong message to the president. Since it`s his old Senate seat, the outcome could be viewed as a referendum on his policies. Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Naperville, Illinois.</p><p>JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This is Jeff Yastine. Foreclosure signs and political signs. The two go together in Florida, where housing defaults are the fifth highest in the nation. That, combined with a 12 percent unemployment rate and an economy just limping along is driving the sentiment of voters like Tracy Flett. He owns a south- Florida based roofing company which has had its share of layoffs. He`s also one of the thousands of people who went to the polls for early voting this week.</p><p>TRACY FLETT, EARLY VOTER: I`m looking for someone who cares about balance, someone who cares about the middle class; I`m looking for someone who`s looks at the right things for big corporations, but also the right things for the small business owner. And I`m looking for people who care.</p><p>YASTINE: The right things for business are key factors in the three- way race for Florida`s open Senate seat. Republican Marco Rubio has been hammering away with a low-tax message that`s made him the front-runner. Republican-governor turned-independent Charlie Crist and Congressman Kendrick Meek running a distant second and third. Rubio has benefited from major support and endorsements from national business groups, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business. The Senate race hasn`t seen any endorsements from the Florida Chamber of Commerce. But its president and CEO Mark Wilson says the group`s members, more than anything, are looking for policy predictability in Washington.</p><p>MARK WILSON, FLORIDA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: The private sector, when they know that we`re not going to change our taxes around, when they`re not going to force benefits on small businesses that they can`t afford, when they feel that it`s safe to invest again and they feel that they can invest in employees and in technology and productivity improvement, then we`re going to see job growth in this state and in this country, that we`ve not seen in over a decade.</p><p>YASTINE: Professor Charles Zelden of Nova Southeastern University, says in a state like Florida ardent pro-business messages, like low taxes, are an especially winning formula. But it come with a catch.</p><p>CHARLES ZELDEN, PROF., LEGAL STUDIES, NOVA SOUTHEASTERN UNIV.: The problem is what do you do to compensate for less income coming in? What do you cut? The problem is we don`t want services to be cut. We want a stimulus that keeps our teachers working, that keeps our cops working, keeps our firefighters working. But we also don`t want to pay more taxes. You can`t do both.</p><p>YASTINE: As this trio of Senate candidates hits the homestretch, Florida residents will soon make their priorities known. Jeff Yastine, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Miami.</p><p>HUDSON: Here are the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. It was a mixed end to the week on Wall Street. The Dow Industrials fell 14 points, the NASDAQ added 19, the S&amp;P 500 up nearly three. Trading volume fell on both the big board and the NASDAQ to the lowest levels of the week.</p><p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is urging limits on trade imbalances for the world`s biggest economies. Speaking at a gathering of G-20 finance ministers and central bankers in South Korea, Geithner said he thinks G-20 nations need to keep their current account balance below 4 percent of gross domestic product. After weeks of protests and strikes, the French senate has approved a measure hiking that nation`s retirement age from 60 to 62. Final approval of the change is expected Monday. France`s unions say the protests will continue, despite today`s vote.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead on the program, sailing the seas of a weak U.S. economy. We bring you illustrator David Gillette`s latest Inkonomics.</p><p>GHARIB: Big tech companies are sitting on billions of dollars of cash, including Intel. Earlier this week, the chip giant announced plans to spend $6 billion on research and development. It`s also forking over more than $7 billion to acquire Internet security firmMcAfee. Stacy Smith is the chief financial officer at Intel. He tells NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT using cash wisely is good for Intel investors.</p><p>STACY SMITH, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, INTEL: I think companies have a moral obligation to do the right things for their constituencies and for us our constituencies are our owners, so we`re always looking at how do we create shareholder value. Our employees and then where we have operations we want to do the right things for the countries and the environment and that constituency as well.</p><p>GHARIB: On Monday, you can see our entire interview with Smith as he explains how Intel makes decisions about its $20 billion pile of cash.</p><p>Tom, it was a mixed day for the markets but for the week they were up. That makes three in a row. Some nervousness as you mentioned earlier about that G-20 meeting of finance ministers this coming up weekend.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes, nervousness about that communique that will come out before the market opens on Monday clearly, but the focus still remains on earnings throughout this week and likely for the next couple of weeks. Let`s get you updated here Susie in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" And the reason why the focus remains on earnings, this was just the first of three peak weeks for earnings and those earnings helped the major indices clock another week of gains as Susie mentioned. And here are those gains beginning with the Dow Industrials (DJI) adding 0.6 of a percent thanks to gains on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. The NASDAQ (IXIC) meantime gained 0.4 of a percent, gained four out of the past five sessions as you can see. The S&amp;P 500 (GSPC) 0.6 of a percent higher tonight compared to one week ago.</p><p>It was a mixed market overall today. Technology and energy shares really led the gainers. The Dow was hurt by a couple of those earnings reports. Verizon (VZ) one of them. Here are the results. They were better than estimates, but down from a year ago as you can see. Even though Verizon predicted its earnings for the rest of the year will be at the high end of its guidance, shares sold off. Let`s take a look at the stock here, falling more than 1 percent. It was the second biggest percent drop for the Dow Industrial components. It`s now at a one-month low. One concern for Verizon: far fewer new wireless subscribers last quarter than rival AT&amp;T. The other big Dow loser American Express (AXP), dropping 3 percent. Earnings last night were better than expected but loan volume remains low and that`s fueling worries about future revenue growth.</p><p>Now oil service stocks really helped energy put in the best sector gains today. Among the leaders here, Schlumberger (SLB). Earnings easily beating estimates after excluding the impact of the acquisition of Smith International. Revenue jumped despite that deep water moratorium that was in place during most of the third quarter. The stock was able to add more than 5 percent on pretty heavy volume. This is its highest price that Schlumberger has seen since early May. Earnings were also in play in technology, helping the top three sector gainers and all three of these are software makers. Take a look. Compuware (CPWR) was up more than 12 percent on some strong earnings. This is a two-year high for shares tonight. CA (CA) jumped 5 percent to its highest price since May. Strong earnings, especially the performance in North America helped last quarter. And Citrix Systems (CTXS) bounced 4 percent. It had a stronger than expected outlook after decent results.</p><p>Investors clearly had an appetite for restaurant stocks, pizza, yeah one of them, also Mexican and cheesecake, how about that? We`ll begin with BJ`s (BJRI). It runs pizza and brewery restaurants. Strong results and positive analyst comments fueled a 17 percent run in shares today. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) boosted its same store sales outlook after strong earnings. Shares added 15 percent. Both BJ`s and Chipotle are at all-time highs tonight. Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) also getting an analyst upgrade after some strong results. Shares jumping 8 percent.</p><p>Busy week for IPOs, five of them hitting the Street, including two more Chinese-based firms. Take a look at all five here. Tal Education (XRS) started at $10 this week. It provides tutoring services in China. Shares continued jumping throughout the week. ShangPharma (SHP) does research for drug makers. It began trading at $15, closed below that price tonight. Three others -- Vera Bradley`s (VRA) IPO $16 per share, nice big run there. It makes designer handbags. Debit card company NetSpend (NTSP) had investors spending. It started at $11, closing tonight over $13. And Brio (BBRG) is the first American restaurant to go public since 2006. It started at $14 per share and clearly is higher tonight. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: As we`ve been reporting, corporate America is feeling better about earnings. Investors have been rewarded with a market rally. But there seems to be a disconnect with what most Americans are experiencing: lost jobs, lost value in their homes and on and on. With that in mind, we bring you another installment of \"Inkonomics with David Gillette.\" David`s an Emmy-winning illustrator and essayist at Twin Cities public television. Tonight, he ponders the question: has our economic ship sailed?</p><p>DAVID GILLETTE: If you`re on a mission to understand the economy, there`s no better place to start than your own back yard. For this cartoonist, we`re talking (INAUDIBLE) Minnesota, a small community just west of Minneapolis and resting on the shores of Lake Minnetonka, a 14,528 acre fresh water playground which incidentally empties itself into Minnehaha Creek, flows through the city of Minnetonka and then drops over Minnehaha Falls. Basically it`s a land where everything starts with minne, the Dakota word for water. And when people in this part of the world want to flex their financial muscles, they spent a lot of money on the minne. It`s an economy measured in boats. But here`s the surprising part. No matter what you may have heard over the last few years about the sour economy, there are still plenty of boats on Lake Minnetonka.</p><p>On the surface this makes no sense. If you turn on any electronic device, including practically the toaster, you`re told we`re either in the middle of, emerging from or returning to a recession. For most people this implies a lack of jobs, a lack of money and you would think a lack of time for practicing the principle of displacement. But there they are -- boats. And according to the people who take them to market, the bigger they are, the faster they sell. That`s why out of all the story lines we`re knitting around the contemporary American economy, wasteful government spending, in- exceptional education, foreign competition, I`m hanging my life jacket on the resurgence of financial stratification.</p><p>You see, according to the unique glacial pock marks I call home, this country isn`t suffering from an overall shortage of wealth. It`s just that the money we do have is disproportionately concentrated in a handful of 40-foot weekend cruisers and that`s actually where I`m going to stop. You see I`m not stupid. I don`t fully understand the economic forces that allow the rich to get richer while the not rich get not richer. But I do understand human nature. And if I go on national television and make it sound like the entire economic collapse rests on the shoulders of the people who buy boats, my chances of spending a day on the lake are going to end up in the drink.</p><p>GHARIB: So Tom, do you think Ben Bernanke knows about the Minnetonka indicator? Maybe we should tell him about the water effect on the economy.</p><p>HUDSON: I tell you, as long as those boats are seaworthy, it maybe a lot easier to refloat them, certainly, that`s definitely the truth. Let`s get you updated on what we`re watching for next week. We`ve got a lot on the calendar. Our Friday \"Market Monitor\" James Paulsen. He`s chief strategist at Wells Capital Management. We`re also due to get an update on housing from the September reports on both new and existing home sales as well as the first report on the third quarter GDP out next Friday. Monday our shoptalk series look at Ikea and how its eco-friendly policies are giving it a competitive advantage.</p><p>GHARIB: The U.S. Postal Service still wants you to pay more for stamps. It plans to appeal a regulator`s decision that denied permission to raise rates to $0.46 a stamp. The Postal Service says the increase is needed because of losses caused by a drop in mail volume. It blames it on the weak economy and a shift to email and online bill paying.</p><p>HUDSON: Federal regulators are now getting involved in the fee dispute between Cablevision and News Corp. The Federal Communications Commission today sent letters to the heads of both companies. They`ve asked to describe how they`re negotiating in good faith. About three million Cablevision subscribers in New York City and Philadelphia have been cut off from Fox programming. The blackout will enter its second week tomorrow if a deal is not reached.</p><p>With the Federal Reserve poised to try to get more money into the economy, tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" thinks that means inflation. Mark Skousen is editor of the market letter \"Forecasts and Strategies.\" He joins us tonight from the NASDAQ. Mark, nice to see you again, welcome back.</p><p>MARK SKOUSEN, EDITOR, \"FORECASTS &amp; STRATEGIES\": Tom, good to be with you.</p><p>HUDSON: So how much inflation and when do you think we`ll actually see it?</p><p>SKOUSEN: I think we`re going to see inflation down the road. But we have a triple play right now or hat trick, whatever you want to call it, for investors and I`m very bullish. Because what we have is low interest rates, we have low price inflation and we have easy money by the Fed. And the Fed has deliberately decided to increase inflation to 2 to 3 percent, inflation targeting, that`s what Ben Bernanke cut his teeth on and he`s really trying to impose it.</p><p>HUDSON: But we haven`t seen any of that inflation really. Instead we`ve seen disinflation. Still positive numbers, but very, very small.</p><p>SKOUSEN: Yes and that`s because the economy is so sluggish, particularly in the United States, unemployment really high. So they`re buying time and that`s great for us as investors because prices for investors are low and it`s an opportunity to be buying and taking advantage of this very unique scenario, because inflation will be coming back. Gold is a great indicator of future inflation and look what that`s doing.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes, over $1300 an ounce. So what markets do you like if the Fed is successful and is able to reignite inflation in the months or years ahead?</p><p>SKOUSEN: As we can see, this has been very bearish for the dollar, but it`s very bullish for stocks, bonds and commodities. So I`m fully invested in all three of those areas.</p><p>HUDSON: So you still like fixed income, even though interest rates are so low.</p><p>SKOUSEN: Well, fixed income, no, not Treasury bills that only pay 2 or 3 percent. What I`m talking about is high dividend paying stocks, the kind that I`ve been recommending to your viewers.</p><p>HUDSON: Sure, even though you do like dividends, your first new pick here, you`re clearly not afraid of volatility. This is a new stock pick, Rare Element Resources. We`re going to take a look at a chart here. This owns Rare Earth Element mine in Wyoming, REE the ticker symbol. Is Rare Earth Elements as you know Mark a source of some building tensions between the U.S. and China? Are you willing to play that geo-political risk?</p><p>SKOUSEN: This is a major geo-political risk and I will warn your viewers and they can see from the chart this stock has already doubled, tripled, quadrupled in value and so it is a risky speculation. But this problem is not going away. China is trying to corner the rare earth market, which is this group of 12 to 17 elements that nobody has ever heard of before that is critical in military applications and in hybrid cars, in cell phones, in computers and you name it and they control 97 percent of this market.</p><p>HUDSON: Mark, let me ask you, what kind of price target do you have? What kind of holding period for a volatile stock like that?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Well a lot of people think, it`s a micro cap right now, a lot of people think this is a billion dollar company, so it could possibly triple in value, but it is extremely volatile and investors need to know that.</p><p>HUDSON: Ninety seconds, I want to get to everything here. A new pick SeaDrill. This is a deep water energy driller, close to a new high. Why choose this deep water driller?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Well, because they were hurt by the BP scandal and they are still recovering from it. They have a very nice dividend yield of almost 9 percent. And they`re aggressively expanding. I think it`s a very good play on the expanding energy area.</p><p>HUDSON: OK. April 23rd you were last with us. You had three picks back then, two of them, the Ishares exchange-traded fund following Hong Kong, that stock up 17 percent. American Capital, a private equity firm, up by better than almost 6 percent. These are stock returns only. Do you still like these two?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Yes, I like Hong Kong because it`s only selling at 15 times earnings, 3 percent dividend. It is the center of growth in Asia. I like American Capital because there`s insider buying recently and it`s still selling below book. That`s a great story.</p><p>HUDSON: You also like EPD, this is a natural gas play, Enterprise Products, 15 1/2 percent on its stock price, plus a nice dividend on top of that. Do you still like it?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Yes, but I think Dan Duncan, the late, great Dan Duncan died recently. He bought a bunch of stock before hand. It a great rising dividend story, but I`m going to sell that and put that money in Sea Drill.</p><p>HUDSON: Take you profits. Any disclosures tonight?</p><p>SKOUSEN: Just these are some of the stocks we`re recommending in our services, but I don`t own any myself.</p><p>HUDSON: Our \"Market Monitor \"this evening, Mark Skousen. He`s editor of the market letter \"Forecasts and Strategies.\"</p><p>SKOUSEN: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: And Tom, before we say good night, looking ahead to next week we`ve got a lot to cover, more earnings, more election coverage, more about the markets and of course we`re going to be talking about upcoming decisions being made in Washington at the Fed.</p><p>HUDSON: Absolutely, the looming Federal Reserve meeting, which is a week from Wednesday, the day after Election Day. It`s going to be a busy couple weeks here. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT on this Friday evening. Thanks for joining us. It is October 22. I`m Tom Hudson. Have a great weekend and you too, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom, hope you have a great weekend as well. I`m Susie Gharib. Thanks for watching everyone and we hope to see all of you again on Monday night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

This is  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, December 3.</p><p>GHARIB: Good evening everyone.   Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson  today took aim at an avalanche of home foreclosures expected over the next  year.  Speaking at a housing conference in Washington, Paulson pressed the  mortgage lending industry to come up with a process to help struggling  borrowers stay in their homes.  As Stephanie Dhue reports, the Treasury  secretary thinks regulators and lenders can agree on a plan this week.  </p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Losing  patience with rising foreclosures, Treasury Secretary Paulson is urging  lenders to set standards to quickly reprocess troubled loans.  But he  acknowledged the current industry effort, called Hope Now, isn`t a complete  solution.  </p><p>HENRY PAULSON, TREASURY SECRETARY:  Nothing is worse than doing  nothing.  The Hope Now effort to streamline refinancings and modifications  is a positive step, but it is not a silver bullet.  </p><p>DHUE: The modification plan focuses on borrowers who have been making  payments, but who will no longer be able to afford their mortgages once the  interest rates reset.  But analysts say mortgage workouts will only have a  modest impact on rising foreclosures and falling home prices.  </p><p>FREDERICK CANNON, MANAGING DIR., KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS: It`s a  pretty narrow segment of people who can really be helped by these loan  modifications and the issues that we face in housing today in terms of the  impact of lower home prices and the impact on mortgages and mortgage  lending generally are going to be with us for quite some time.  </p><p>DHUE: Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozillo says his firm will modify 75,000  sub-prime loans by the end of the year.  That`s about 10 percent of the  sub-prime loans on its books. He wants the government to do more to jump  start the market for mortgage-backed securities.  </p><p>ANGELO MOZILLO, CEO, COUNTRYWIDE:  Holders of those securities who got  screwed are going to say, I`m not going to do this again.  Something is  going to have to happen to give them confidence to go back and take in  mortgage-backed securities.  </p><p>DHUE: Mozillo called on regulators to let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  purchase more loans in greater amounts.  But homebuilder Robert Toll  suggests regulators need to reassert themselves in the mortgage market.  </p><p>ROBERT TOLL, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, TOLL BROTHERS:  If you`re going to have  the secondary market back mortgages, you`re going to have to make those  mortgages more sound.  You can`t wish for the market to reassert itself.  You can`t wish, respectfully, for the providers to worry about their  reputation.  </p><p>DHUE: Many economists now expect home prices to continue to decline  for the next year and until home prices reach a bottom, they say the market  for mortgage-backed securities will also struggle to find its footing.   Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.  </p><p>YASTINE: Stock investors struggled to find their footing today in this  first day of December trading.  Winter months are typically good ones on  Wall Street.  But as Suzanne Pratt reports, there are a number of reasons  why this December could mean rough going for the stock market.  </p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  After a fairly  naughty November, stock investors are hoping for a nice December.  But some  market pros are concerned that Santa will skip Wall Street this year.   Standard &amp; Poor`s market strategist Alec Young believes volatility will  replace the typical year end run-up in stock prices, known as the Santa  Claus rally. </p><p>ALEC YOUNG, MARKET STRATEGIST, STANDARD &amp; POOR`S: Santa Claus rally  kind of implies that the market makes steady gains throughout the month of  December.  We don`t really see that.  We continue to see some choppiness.   But considering how bad things were a few weeks ago, I think a lot of  investors would be happy with a market that trades sideways for a little  while.  </p><p>PRATT: Young believes investors will hold back because of worries  about the credit crunch and a recession in the U.S. economy.  </p><p>YOUNG: Anything that we get from the government in terms of economic  data that reinforces the idea that the economy is weakening would be bad  for stocks.   Any news on the retailing front that the consumer is ready to pack it in  after years of continuing to spend, that that`s finally over, that would be  bad news for stocks.  </p><p>PRATT: Others, however, believe a December rally is still a  possibility.  A look at past history certainly helps to make that case.   According to the \"Stock Traders Almanac,\" since 1950, December has been the  second best month of the year on Wall Street with the S&amp;P 500 gaining on  average 1.7 percent.  November has been the kindest month, returning  slightly more.  Russell Investment Group`s Stephen Wood says the December  11th Fed meeting, at which a cut in interest rates is widely expected,  could give stocks an added boost.  </p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENT GROUP:  Is it  going to be 25 basis points or 50 basis points? And equity markets are  going to like that.  So either way, equity markets are going to like it,  even though it`s inflationary.  So I think what you`re going to see is the  market`s moving now ahead of the Fed`s cut.  </p><p>PRATT: In the last four decades, there have only been a handful of  years without a Santa Claus rally.  But it is interesting to note when  Santa has failed to show up, his absence sometimes precedes a bear market.   Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.  </p><p>YASTINE: Traders may have to wait another day or two for Santa`s  arrival, because it sure wasn`t here today.  The Dow jumped about 30 points  through the morning session, reaching the 13,400 mark by midday.  But then  General Electric fell hard on an analyst downgrade.  Same for the NASDAQ,  where Research in Motion and some of the other big tech stocks dropped  sharply, Research in Motion on a downgrade.  The result: lower prices  across the board and the Dow settling out the day down 57.15 to 13,314.57  and the NASDAQ off 23.83 to 2637.13.  The S&amp;P 500 sliding 8.75 to 1472.42.   In the bond market, the 10-year note falling 27/32 to 103 9/32 and the  yield now down to 3.85 percent </p><p>GHARIB: November was a turkey of a month for General Motors, the  nation`s biggest auto maker, but its rivals managed to hold their own.   Sales at GM fell 11 percent last month to 261,000 vehicles.  That drop came  despite solid gains in two key new models -- the newly redesigned Chevy  Malibu and the Cadillac CTS.  Ford Motor notched a slight sales gain, up  0.4 percent to 182,000 cars and trucks.  Even rival Toyota had a difficult  November, as consumers struggled with rising fuel prices and sliding home  values.  Its sales rose only 0.3 percent.  Chrysler sales fell 2 percent to  161,000 cars and trucks.  As Diane Eastabrook reports, U.S. auto companies  and dealers are looking ahead to next year with uncertainty.  </p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Chevrolet  dealer Mark Scarpelli says he`s had a hard time keeping the new Chevy  Malibu in stock since it rolled into showrooms last month.  </p><p>MARK SCARPELLI, CHEVROLET DEALER:  It`s General Motors anticipation  that they are going to sell 200,000 of these in 2008.  At the rate in which  we are all selling them I think they have underestimated the demand.  I  think it`s going to be a wonderful seller for them.  </p><p>EASTABROOK:  If Scarpelli is right, the Malibu could be one of the few  bright spots for the U.S. auto industry next year.  Global Insight predicts  U.S. auto companies will sell about a half a million fewer vehicles next  year than this year.  Auto analyst George Magliano says rising mortgage  rates from sub-prime loans are primarily to blame.  </p><p>GEORGE MAGLIANO, AUTO ANALYST, GLOBAL INSIGHT:  You see more and  more problems emanating out of sub-prime and more and more problems that  number one are going to cause money to be taken out of the consumers`  pocket.  </p><p>EASTABROOK: Magliano says how auto companies respond to a more  challenging U.S. economy will determine how profitable they will be.   Incentives could be more prevalent.  General Motors for example recently  rolled out zero percent financing on remaining 2007 models and analysts  think it could be extended to poor performing 2008 models.  Magliano also  believes auto makers will tweak production plans more often next year based  on monthly sales numbers.  </p><p>MAGLIANO: You have to restrict the flow of cars and trucks going into  the dealerships in order to keep the pricing at a reasonable level and in  order to hope to sell what you`re producing.  </p><p>EASTABROOK:  While Scarpelli admits the auto industry faces some  potholes, he remains optimistic.  He thinks new union contracts and massive  restructurings will help the industry better navigate in a tougher economy.  </p><p>SCARPELLI:  I think they are poised pretty well to be able to be much  more adaptable than they had been three years ago.  </p><p>EASTABROOK: Industry watchers say the holiday shopping season could be  a good indicator as to how vehicle sales perform next year.  They think if  consumers opt to buy big ticket items this holiday shopping season, they  might opt to buy cars and light trucks next year.  Diane Eastabrook,  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p>GHARIB: AT&amp;T is hanging up its pay phone business.  The company  announced today that after 129 years, it`s getting out of the pay phone  business.  It`s a sign of the times as more people are using cell phones.   AT&amp;T said there were more than 2.5 million pay phones in the U.S. in 1998.   That number has fallen to a million phones this year while wireless users  have quadrupled in the past decade.  But Jeff, public telephones aren`t  completely disappearing. AT&amp;T is selling its pay phone operations to  independent contractors.  </p><p>YASTINE: Some of those new pay phones are offering users high-tech  features that allow them to surf the Internet and check email for about  $0.25 a minute.  </p><p>So now let`s take a look at some stocks in the news tonight.  </p><p>And General Electric (GE) topping our list tonight, dropping $1.36.  Citigroup lowering its profit forecast and price target for GE.  The  analyst sees pressure on GE`s consumer finance unit and a tougher  marketplace for sales at GE`s health care division. And earlier today, NBC  Universal said it would start buying two hour blocks of programming from  outside producers of prime time documentaries because the programming costs  a lot less than scripted programs or even network reality shows.</p><p>There`s Citigroup (C) giving back $0.24.</p><p>Invesco ADR (IVZ) rising $0.98, the company moving to simplify its  corporate structure. It will eliminate its dual listing on the London Stock  Exchange.</p><p>Countrywide Financial (CFC) also easing back $0.14.</p><p>And then Ford Motor Co (F) dropping $0.26 and as you heard, the auto  maker posting a modest November sales gain. Analysts were expecting a  decline.</p><p>Pfizer (PFE) off $0.21.</p><p>EMC Corp (EMC) dropping $0.23.</p><p>ExxonMobil (XOM) off $0.31.</p><p>Motorola (MOT) losing $0.54.</p><p>And then Bank of America (BAC) dropping $0.66.</p><p>General Motors (GM) falling $1.22. As mentioned a moment ago, a  disappointing 11 percent drop in auto sales. GM also not offering as many  sales incentives to prospective car buyers compared to Ford or Chrysler.</p><p>And while we`re on the subject of autos, Lehman Brothers will a  cautious note on auto parts suppliers with many anticipating large  production cutbacks at the auto makers next year.  American Axle &amp; Mfg  (AXL), Johnson Controls (JCI), Tenneco (TEN) all being cut back themselves  in terms of their stock prices.</p><p>IBM (IBM) gaining $0.65. The company boosting its stock buyback  program by up to $1 billion.</p><p>And the big loser of the day, Verifone Holdings (PAY) nose diving $2.   Accounting errors mean Verifone will have to postpone announcing its fourth  quarter and full year results.</p><p>Nokia (NOK) rising $0.93. The Finnish phone giant says it`s gaining  market share in India. That`s the second largest cell phone market globally  behind China.</p><p>And then Fannie Mae (FNM) down $2.17.  Goldman Sachs cutting its  earnings targets on a belief the write downs for the fourth quarter will be  equally as large as those in the third quarter. </p><p>MBIA (MBI) falling $2.63.  Analysts at Bank of America taking a knife  to earnings estimates there due to a drop in new production and earned  premiums.</p><p>On the NASDAQ, Apple (AAPL) dropping $3.36.  Klausner Technologies  filing $365 million patent infringement lawsuit against the iPhone maker.</p><p>Research in Motion (RIMM) sliding over $9.  Morgan Keegan downgrading  the shares of the Blackberry maker on valuation, thinking the stock`s  gotten a little ahead of itself.</p><p>Google (GOOG) off nearly $11.50.</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) down $0.68.</p><p>Baidu.com (BIDU), it never seems to go down.  It rose $3.29 today.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) falling $0.45.</p><p>Intel (INTC) though gaining $0.17.</p><p>Dell (DELL) off $0.60.</p><p>First Solar (FSLR) down nearly $8.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM) dropping $0.82.</p><p>Activision (ATVI) jumping nearly $3. How do you say guitar hero in  French?   The maker of the hugely popular Guitar Hero video game being  bought by France`s Vivendi for $27.50 a share, $1.7 billion.  The new  company combines Vivendi`s own video game unit and it`ll be called  Activision Blizzard.</p><p>UAP Holding Co (UAPH) soaring more than $8.  The seller of seeds,  fertilizer, farm chemicals, being bought by Agrium for $39 a share, about  $2.6 billion.</p><p>And Merrill Lynch boosting its price target on some several fertilizer  companies because of that hook up. Agrium (AGU), CF Industries (CF), Mosaic  Co (MOS) and Potash (POT) all sprouting nicely higher.</p><p>Another buyout deal, Cohesant Technologies (COHT) being bought by a  Minneapolis firm, Graco for $35 million or $9 a share in cash. Graco will  keep just one division, GlasCraft, and spin off all the rest of Cohesant`s  unit. That stock rising $3 or nearly $3 today.</p><p>Those are our stocks in the news tonight.  Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, Jeff, the U.S. economy is not the only one taking a hit  from sub-prime loan losses.  The mortgage woes are also hurting Japanese  banks and insurance companies.  While the problems in Japan aren`t on par  with the carnage seen in the U.S. and Europe, the situation is hardly  cheering.  As Lucy Craft reports, sub-prime fallout is just one of many  headwinds buffeting the world`s second biggest economy.  </p><p>LUCY CRAFT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The good news --  at least if the latest figures released by Japanese financial institutions  accurately reflect the extent of their losses -- is that Japan may have  escaped the worst of the sub-prime debacle.  The total damage so far comes  to $11 billion spread across 10 banking groups, says KBS Securities banking  expert Kristine Li.  </p><p>KRISTINE LI, BANKING ANALYST, KBS SECURITIES TOKYO:  I still think the  direct exposure of the Japanese banks is still quite small, (INAUDIBLE)  this $11 billion exposure.  It`s probably less than 1 percent of their  total loans and this is much smaller than their global competitors, like  U.S. banks, European banks, even Chinese banks.  </p><p>CRAFT: The bad news is that sub-prime exposure could be the least of  Japanese banks` problems nowadays.  Much of the reason Japanese financial  sector profits are stagnant right now, foreign experts charge, is self- inflicted damage -- Japanese policy makers shooting themselves in the foot.   Take a hastily enacted new law aimed at shielding consumers that has ended  up squashing investment.  Robert Feldman is an economist with Morgan  Stanley.  </p><p>ROBERT FELDMAN, SR ECONOMIST, MORGAN STANLEY JAPAN:   If you want to  say, buy a foreign investment fund here, there is a huge amount of red tape  that is wrapped around your application.  For that, you have to go through  the application every time. It`s a very long, complicated explanation  process.  And so the purchases of those instruments have fallen very  sharply.  Capital outflows have slowed and the yen is stronger.  </p><p>CRAFT: Another poorly executed new law, intended to make buildings  earthquake-safe, has sent construction into a tailspin.  KBS Securities`  Kristine Li says new housing starts have been slashed almost in half, year  on year.  </p><p>LI:  Mortgage growth had been strong until recently, but we had a new  construction code and new housing starts collapsed and this certainly hurt  mortgage growth.  We`re looking for some big decline in the second half.  </p><p>CRAFT: Japan`s policy missteps, compounded with the specter of a  slowing American market on which Japan so heavily depends for selling its  exports, could bring down the curtain at last on Japan`s record, six-year- long growth streak, says Jesper Koll, head of Tantallon Research Japan.  </p><p>JESPER KOLL, PRESIDENT, TANTALLON RESEARCH JAPAN:  Unfortunately the  risk of a recession in Japan is now very high.  We`ve got domestic demand  that is being derailed by some policy tightening by the politicians.  On  top of that, we now have the hit to exports that is coming from the  slowdown in the United States economy.  So unfortunately, zero growth in  2008 is a good working assumption for Japan.  </p><p>CRAFT: Foreign investors have been the biggest players in the Tokyo  stock market, but many are writing off Japan nowadays to focus on other  parts of Asia.  With an array of risks aside from the sub-prime crisis  hanging over the Japanese economy, the Tokyo stock market is bracing for a  bearish 2008.  Lucy Craft, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Tokyo.  </p><p>YASTINE: Tomorrow, from housing to hiring to corporate profits, we`ll  get the economic outlook from the Business Roundtable.  </p><p>GHARIB: Federal prosecutors may call Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren  Buffett as a witness in the criminal trial of former officers of  Berkshire`s general reinsurance unit.  Prosecutors filed court papers today  listing Buffett as a government witness, as jury selection got underway.   Four former General Re officers were indicted last year in an alleged  scheme to help American International Group inflate its books.  </p><p>YASTINE: Jeweler Tiffany and Company is taking a fourth quarter charge  of $20 million as part of a new deal with Swatch.  In an SEC filing,  Tiffany said the charge is tied to discontinuing some of its existing watch  collections.  Under the new partnership, Swatch will develop and distribute  Tiffany watches.  Swatch will own the new entity and Tiffany will share in  its profit.  </p><p>GHARIB: Tonight`s commentator says maybe a recession wouldn`t be so  bad.  He`s Bernard Baumohl, director of the Economic Outlook Group.  </p><p>BERNARD BAUMOHL, DIRECTOR, ECONOMIC OUTLOOK GROUP: Here`s a question  that may bring cries of heresy, is a recession bad for the economy? Many  forecasters see such a downturn in 2008.  But would a recession further  devastate an economy already reeling from a failing housing market and a  damaged financial sector? Or is it just the right medicine this economy  needs to cure its ills and hasten a healthy recovery? </p><p>I believe a recession may actually be beneficial this time and here`s  why.  Recessions are a natural and vital part of a business cycle.  After  all, consumers and business leaders sometimes make mistakes and  occasionally these mistakes are big enough to bring on a recession.  </p><p>One drag on the economy today is the housing sector, which is  suffering a slow bleed.  The drip-by-drip fall in home prices and tougher  refinancing rules only deepen the housing debacle.  A recession however  would permit interest rates to fall more aggressively and this can lure  homebuyers back much sooner.  Moreover, financial institutions burdened by  sub-prime assets may write them off more quickly under the cover of  recession and thus improve their balance sheets.  </p><p>Of course, recessions are not painless.  Some lenders and hedge funds  may go under.  But the economy now looks like a train wreck moving in slow  motion.  A recession could purge the country of its real estate excesses  and bad debt more rapidly and allow the economy to emerge from this mess  faster and much sounder.  I`m Bernard Baumohl.  </p><p>YASTINE: Recapping today`s market action, a weak start to the week on  Wall Street.  The Dow dropping 57 points. The NASDAQ lost 23.

The  world`s oldest surviving Rolls-Royce drove into the record books today  becoming the most expensive vintage car ever auctioned.  The price tag,  more than $7 million.  The 1904 two-seater was the fourth car ever produced  by Charles Royce -- excuse me, Charles Rolls and Frederick Royce.  The car  was expected to sell for about $2 million but interest from around the  world accelerated the price of the bids and the buyer is a British  collector.  And Susie, believe it or not, the car is still drivable and has  a top speed of 40 miles per hour.  </p><p>GHARIB: Forty miles, take me on a ride in that classy vehicle.  </p><p>YASTINE: You can`t have too many cars going that far these days.   That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, December 3.

We`ll tell you why its stock plunged almost 50 percent.</p><p>GHARIB: I`m Susie Gharib.</p><p>YASTINE: And I`m Jeff Yastine. Paul Kangas is off tonight. This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, December 3.</p><p>GHARIB: Good evening everyone. <person><nameText>Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson </nameText></person>today took aim at an avalanche of home foreclosures expected over the next year. Speaking at a housing conference in Washington, Paulson pressed the mortgage lending industry to come up with a process to help struggling borrowers stay in their homes. As Stephanie Dhue reports, the Treasury secretary thinks regulators and lenders can agree on a plan this week.</p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Losing patience with rising foreclosures, <person><nameText>Treasury Secretary Paulson </nameText></person>is urging lenders to set standards to quickly reprocess troubled loans. But he acknowledged the current industry effort, called Hope Now, isn`t a complete solution.</p><p><person><nameText>HENRY PAULSON, TREASURY </nameText></person>SECRETARY: Nothing is worse than doing nothing. The Hope Now effort to streamline refinancings and modifications is a positive step, but it is not a silver bullet.</p><p>DHUE: The modification plan focuses on borrowers who have been making payments, but who will no longer be able to afford their mortgages once the interest rates reset. But analysts say mortgage workouts will only have a modest impact on rising foreclosures and falling home prices.</p><p>FREDERICK CANNON, MANAGING DIR., KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS: It`s a pretty narrow segment of people who can really be helped by these loan modifications and the issues that we face in housing today in terms of the impact of lower home prices and the impact on mortgages and mortgage lending generally are going to be with us for quite some time.</p><p>DHUE: Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozillo says his firm will modify 75,000 sub-prime loans by the end of the year. That`s about 10 percent of the sub-prime loans on its books. He wants the government to do more to jump start the market for mortgage-backed securities.</p><p>ANGELO MOZILLO, CEO, COUNTRYWIDE: Holders of those securities who got screwed are going to say, I`m not going to do this again. Something is going to have to happen to give them confidence to go back and take in mortgage-backed securities.</p><p>DHUE: Mozillo called on regulators to let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase more loans in greater amounts. But homebuilder Robert Toll suggests regulators need to reassert themselves in the mortgage market.</p><p>ROBERT TOLL, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, TOLL BROTHERS: If you`re going to have the secondary market back mortgages, you`re going to have to make those mortgages more sound. You can`t wish for the market to reassert itself. You can`t wish, respectfully, for the providers to worry about their reputation.</p><p>DHUE: Many economists now expect home prices to continue to decline for the next year and until home prices reach a bottom, they say the market for mortgage-backed securities will also struggle to find its footing. Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>YASTINE: Stock investors struggled to find their footing today in this first day of December trading. Winter months are typically good ones on Wall Street. But as Suzanne Pratt reports, there are a number of reasons why this December could mean rough going for the stock market.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: After a fairly naughty November, stock investors are hoping for a nice December. But some market pros are concerned that Santa will skip Wall Street this year. Standard &amp; Poor`s market strategist Alec Young believes volatility will replace the typical year end run-up in stock prices, known as the Santa Claus rally. </p><p>ALEC YOUNG, MARKET STRATEGIST, STANDARD &amp; POOR`S: Santa Claus rally kind of implies that the market makes steady gains throughout the month of December. We don`t really see that. We continue to see some choppiness. But considering how bad things were a few weeks ago, I think a lot of investors would be happy with a market that trades sideways for a little while.</p><p>PRATT: Young believes investors will hold back because of worries about the credit crunch and a recession in the U.S. economy.</p><p>YOUNG: Anything that we get from the government in terms of economic data that reinforces the idea that the economy is weakening would be bad for stocks. Any news on the retailing front that the consumer is ready to pack it in after years of continuing to spend, that that`s finally over, that would be bad news for stocks.</p><p>PRATT: Others, however, believe a December rally is still a possibility. A look at past history certainly helps to make that case. According to the \"Stock Traders Almanac,\" since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year on Wall Street with the S&amp;P 500 gaining on average 1.7 percent. November has been the kindest month, returning slightly more. Russell Investment Group`s Stephen Wood says the December 11th Fed meeting, at which a cut in interest rates is widely expected, could give stocks an added boost.</p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENT GROUP: Is it going to be 25 basis points or 50 basis points? And equity markets are going to like that. So either way, equity markets are going to like it, even though it`s inflationary. So I think what you`re going to see is the market`s moving now ahead of the Fed`s cut.</p><p>PRATT: In the last four decades, there have only been a handful of years without a Santa Claus rally. But it is interesting to note when Santa has failed to show up, his absence sometimes precedes a bear market. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>YASTINE: Traders may have to wait another day or two for Santa`s arrival, because it sure wasn`t here today. The Dow jumped about 30 points through the morning session, reaching the 13,400 mark by midday. But then General Electric fell hard on an analyst downgrade. Same for the NASDAQ, where Research in Motion and some of the other big tech stocks dropped sharply, Research in Motion on a downgrade. The result: lower prices across the board and the Dow settling out the day down 57.15 to 13,314.57 and the NASDAQ off 23.83 to 2637.13. The S&amp;P 500 sliding 8.75 to 1472.42. In the bond market, the 10-year note falling 27/32 to 103 9/32 and the yield now down to 3.85 percent</p><p>GHARIB: November was a turkey of a month for General Motors, the nation`s biggest auto maker, but its rivals managed to hold their own. Sales at GM fell 11 percent last month to 261,000 vehicles. That drop came despite solid gains in two key new models -- the newly redesigned Chevy Malibu and the Cadillac CTS. Ford Motor notched a slight sales gain, up 0.4 percent to 182,000 cars and trucks. Even rival Toyota had a difficult November, as consumers struggled with rising fuel prices and sliding home values. Its sales rose only 0.3 percent. Chrysler sales fell 2 percent to 161,000 cars and trucks. As Diane Eastabrook reports, U.S. auto companies and dealers are looking ahead to next year with uncertainty.</p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Chevrolet dealer Mark Scarpelli says he`s had a hard time keeping the new Chevy Malibu in stock since it rolled into showrooms last month.</p><p>MARK SCARPELLI, CHEVROLET DEALER: It`s General Motors anticipation that they are going to sell 200,000 of these in 2008. At the rate in which we are all selling them I think they have underestimated the demand. I think it`s going to be a wonderful seller for them.</p><p>EASTABROOK: If Scarpelli is right, the Malibu could be one of the few bright spots for the U.S. auto industry next year. Global Insight predicts U.S. auto companies will sell about a half a million fewer vehicles next year than this year. Auto analyst George Magliano says rising mortgage rates from sub-prime loans are primarily to blame.</p><p>GEORGE MAGLIANO, AUTO ANALYST, GLOBAL INSIGHT: You see more and more problems emanating out of sub-prime and more and more problems that number one are going to cause money to be taken out of the consumers` pocket.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Magliano says how auto companies respond to a more challenging U.S. economy will determine how profitable they will be. Incentives could be more prevalent. General Motors for example recently rolled out zero percent financing on remaining 2007 models and analysts think it could be extended to poor performing 2008 models. Magliano also believes auto makers will tweak production plans more often next year based on monthly sales numbers.</p><p>MAGLIANO: You have to restrict the flow of cars and trucks going into the dealerships in order to keep the pricing at a reasonable level and in order to hope to sell what you`re producing.</p><p>EASTABROOK: While Scarpelli admits the auto industry faces some potholes, he remains optimistic. He thinks new union contracts and massive restructurings will help the industry better navigate in a tougher economy. </p><p>SCARPELLI: I think they are poised pretty well to be able to be much more adaptable than they had been three years ago.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Industry watchers say the holiday shopping season could be a good indicator as to how vehicle sales perform next year. They think if consumers opt to buy big ticket items this holiday shopping season, they might opt to buy cars and light trucks next year. Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>GHARIB: AT&amp;T is hanging up its pay phone business. The company announced today that after 129 years, it`s getting out of the pay phone business. It`s a sign of the times as more people are using cell phones. AT&amp;T said there were more than 2.5 million pay phones in the U.S. in 1998. That number has fallen to a million phones this year while wireless users have quadrupled in the past decade. But Jeff, public telephones aren`t completely disappearing. AT&amp;T is selling its pay phone operations to independent contractors.</p><p>YASTINE: Some of those new pay phones are offering users high-tech features that allow them to surf the Internet and check email for about $0.25 a minute.</p><p>So now let`s take a look at some stocks in the news tonight.</p><p>And General Electric (GE) topping our list tonight, dropping $1.36. Citigroup lowering its profit forecast and price target for GE. The analyst sees pressure on GE`s consumer finance unit and a tougher marketplace for sales at GE`s health care division. And earlier today, NBC Universal said it would start buying two hour blocks of programming from outside producers of prime time documentaries because the programming costs a lot less than scripted programs or even network reality shows.</p><p>There`s Citigroup (C) giving back $0.24.</p><p>Invesco ADR (IVZ) rising $0.98, the company moving to simplify its corporate structure. It will eliminate its dual listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p><p>Countrywide Financial (CFC) also easing back $0.14.</p><p>And then Ford Motor Co (F) dropping $0.26 and as you heard, the auto maker posting a modest November sales gain. Analysts were expecting a decline.</p><p>Pfizer (PFE) off $0.21.</p><p>EMC Corp (EMC) dropping $0.23.</p><p>ExxonMobil (XOM) off $0.31.</p><p>Motorola (MOT) losing $0.54.</p><p>And then Bank of America (BAC) dropping $0.66.</p><p>General Motors (GM) falling $1.22. As mentioned a moment ago, a disappointing 11 percent drop in auto sales. GM also not offering as many sales incentives to prospective car buyers compared to Ford or Chrysler.</p><p>And while we`re on the subject of autos, Lehman Brothers will a cautious note on auto parts suppliers with many anticipating large production cutbacks at the auto makers next year. American Axle &amp; Mfg (AXL), Johnson Controls (JCI), Tenneco (TEN) all being cut back themselves in terms of their stock prices.</p><p>IBM (IBM) gaining $0.65. The company boosting its stock buyback program by up to $1 billion.</p><p>And the big loser of the day, Verifone Holdings (PAY) nose diving $2. Accounting errors mean Verifone will have to postpone announcing its fourth quarter and full year results.</p><p>Nokia (NOK) rising $0.93. The Finnish phone giant says it`s gaining market share in India. That`s the second largest cell phone market globally behind China.</p><p>And then Fannie Mae (FNM) down $2.17. Goldman Sachs cutting its earnings targets on a belief the write downs for the fourth quarter will be equally as large as those in the third quarter.</p><p>MBIA (MBI) falling $2.63. Analysts at Bank of America taking a knife to earnings estimates there due to a drop in new production and earned premiums.</p><p>On the NASDAQ, Apple (AAPL) dropping $3.36. Klausner Technologies filing $365 million patent infringement lawsuit against the iPhone maker.</p><p>Research in Motion (RIMM) sliding over $9. Morgan Keegan downgrading the shares of the Blackberry maker on valuation, thinking the stock`s gotten a little ahead of itself.</p><p>Google (GOOG) off nearly $11.50.</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) down $0.68.</p><p>Baidu.com (BIDU), it never seems to go down. It rose $3.29 today.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) falling $0.45.</p><p>Intel (INTC) though gaining $0.17.</p><p>Dell (DELL) off $0.60.</p><p>First Solar (FSLR) down nearly $8.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM) dropping $0.82.</p><p>Activision (ATVI) jumping nearly $3. How do you say guitar hero in French? The maker of the hugely popular Guitar Hero video game being bought by France`s Vivendi for $27.50 a share, $1.7 billion. The new company combines Vivendi`s own video game unit and it`ll be called Activision Blizzard.</p><p>UAP Holding Co (UAPH) soaring more than $8. The seller of seeds, fertilizer, farm chemicals, being bought by Agrium for $39 a share, about $2.6 billion.</p><p>And Merrill Lynch boosting its price target on some several fertilizer companies because of that hook up. Agrium (AGU), CF Industries (CF), Mosaic Co (MOS) and Potash (POT) all sprouting nicely higher.</p><p>Another buyout deal, Cohesant Technologies (COHT) being bought by a Minneapolis firm, Graco for $35 million or $9 a share in cash. Graco will keep just one division, GlasCraft, and spin off all the rest of Cohesant`s unit. That stock rising $3 or nearly $3 today.</p><p>Those are our stocks in the news tonight. Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, Jeff, the U.S. economy is not the only one taking a hit from sub-prime loan losses. The mortgage woes are also hurting Japanese banks and insurance companies. While the problems in Japan aren`t on par with the carnage seen in the U.S. and Europe, the situation is hardly cheering. As Lucy Craft reports, sub-prime fallout is just one of many headwinds buffeting the world`s second biggest economy.</p><p>LUCY CRAFT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The good news -- at least if the latest figures released by Japanese financial institutions accurately reflect the extent of their losses -- is that Japan may have escaped the worst of the sub-prime debacle. The total damage so far comes to $11 billion spread across 10 banking groups, says KBS Securities banking expert Kristine Li.</p><p>KRISTINE LI, BANKING ANALYST, KBS SECURITIES TOKYO: I still think the direct exposure of the Japanese banks is still quite small, (INAUDIBLE) this $11 billion exposure. It`s probably less than 1 percent of their total loans and this is much smaller than their global competitors, like U.S. banks, European banks, even Chinese banks.</p><p>CRAFT: The bad news is that sub-prime exposure could be the least of Japanese banks` problems nowadays. Much of the reason Japanese financial sector profits are stagnant right now, foreign experts charge, is self- inflicted damage -- Japanese policy makers shooting themselves in the foot. Take a hastily enacted new law aimed at shielding consumers that has ended up squashing investment. Robert Feldman is an economist with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>ROBERT FELDMAN, SR ECONOMIST, MORGAN STANLEY JAPAN: If you want to say, buy a foreign investment fund here, there is a huge amount of red tape that is wrapped around your application. For that, you have to go through the application every time. It`s a very long, complicated explanation process. And so the purchases of those instruments have fallen very sharply. Capital outflows have slowed and the yen is stronger.</p><p>CRAFT: Another poorly executed new law, intended to make buildings earthquake-safe, has sent construction into a tailspin. KBS Securities` Kristine Li says new housing starts have been slashed almost in half, year on year.</p><p>LI: Mortgage growth had been strong until recently, but we had a new construction code and new housing starts collapsed and this certainly hurt mortgage growth. We`re looking for some big decline in the second half.</p><p>CRAFT: Japan`s policy missteps, compounded with the specter of a slowing American market on which Japan so heavily depends for selling its exports, could bring down the curtain at last on Japan`s record, six-year- long growth streak, says Jesper Koll, head of Tantallon Research Japan.</p><p>JESPER KOLL, PRESIDENT, TANTALLON RESEARCH JAPAN: Unfortunately the risk of a recession in Japan is now very high. We`ve got domestic demand that is being derailed by some policy tightening by the politicians. On top of that, we now have the hit to exports that is coming from the slowdown in the United States economy. So unfortunately, zero growth in 2008 is a good working assumption for Japan.</p><p>CRAFT: Foreign investors have been the biggest players in the Tokyo stock market, but many are writing off Japan nowadays to focus on other parts of Asia. With an array of risks aside from the sub-prime crisis hanging over the Japanese economy, the Tokyo stock market is bracing for a bearish 2008. Lucy Craft, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Tokyo.</p><p>YASTINE: Tomorrow, from housing to hiring to corporate profits, we`ll get the economic outlook from the Business Roundtable.</p><p>GHARIB: Federal prosecutors may call Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett as a witness in the criminal trial of former officers of Berkshire`s general reinsurance unit. Prosecutors filed court papers today listing Buffett as a government witness, as jury selection got underway. Four former General Re officers were indicted last year in an alleged scheme to help American International Group inflate its books.</p><p>YASTINE: Jeweler Tiffany and Company is taking a fourth quarter charge of $20 million as part of a new deal with Swatch. In an SEC filing, Tiffany said the charge is tied to discontinuing some of its existing watch collections. Under the new partnership, Swatch will develop and distribute Tiffany watches. Swatch will own the new entity and Tiffany will share in its profit.</p><p>GHARIB: Tonight`s commentator says maybe a recession wouldn`t be so bad. He`s Bernard Baumohl, director of the Economic Outlook Group.</p><p>BERNARD BAUMOHL, DIRECTOR, ECONOMIC OUTLOOK GROUP: Here`s a question that may bring cries of heresy, is a recession bad for the economy? Many forecasters see such a downturn in 2008. But would a recession further devastate an economy already reeling from a failing housing market and a damaged financial sector? Or is it just the right medicine this economy needs to cure its ills and hasten a healthy recovery?</p><p>I believe a recession may actually be beneficial this time and here`s why. Recessions are a natural and vital part of a business cycle. After all, consumers and business leaders sometimes make mistakes and occasionally these mistakes are big enough to bring on a recession.</p><p>One drag on the economy today is the housing sector, which is suffering a slow bleed. The drip-by-drip fall in home prices and tougher refinancing rules only deepen the housing debacle. A recession however would permit interest rates to fall more aggressively and this can lure homebuyers back much sooner. Moreover, financial institutions burdened by sub-prime assets may write them off more quickly under the cover of recession and thus improve their balance sheets.</p><p>Of course, recessions are not painless. Some lenders and hedge funds may go under. But the economy now looks like a train wreck moving in slow motion. A recession could purge the country of its real estate excesses and bad debt more rapidly and allow the economy to emerge from this mess faster and much sounder. I`m Bernard Baumohl.</p><p>YASTINE: Recapping today`s market action, a weak start to the week on Wall Street. The Dow dropping 57 points. The NASDAQ lost 23.

The world`s oldest surviving Rolls-Royce drove into the record books today becoming the most expensive vintage car ever auctioned. The price tag, more than $7 million. The 1904 two-seater was the fourth car ever produced by Charles Royce -- excuse me, Charles Rolls and Frederick Royce. The car was expected to sell for about $2 million but interest from around the world accelerated the price of the bids and the buyer is a British collector. And Susie, believe it or not, the car is still drivable and has a top speed of 40 miles per hour.</p><p>GHARIB: Forty miles, take me on a ride in that classy vehicle.</p><p>YASTINE: You can`t have too many cars going that far these days. That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, December 3. We want to remind you this is the time of year your public television station seeks your support.</p><p>GHARIB: Support that makes programs like NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT possible.</p><p>YASTINE: Thanks for joining us and again, don`t forget to support your public television station.

The push comes as interest rates on more than two million adjustable mortgages prepare to reset.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Many on Wall Street are wondering if the jolly man in the red suit will make an appearance on Wall Street this month.

We`ll tell you why its stock plunged almost 50 percent.</p><p>GHARIB: I`m Susie Gharib.</p><p>YASTINE: And I`m Jeff Yastine. Paul Kangas is off tonight. This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, December 3.</p><p>GHARIB: Good evening everyone. <person><nameText>Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson </nameText></person>today took aim at an avalanche of home foreclosures expected over the next year. Speaking at a housing conference in Washington, Paulson pressed the mortgage lending industry to come up with a process to help struggling borrowers stay in their homes. As Stephanie Dhue reports, the Treasury secretary thinks regulators and lenders can agree on a plan this week.</p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Losing patience with rising foreclosures, <person><nameText>Treasury Secretary Paulson </nameText></person>is urging lenders to set standards to quickly reprocess troubled loans. But he acknowledged the current industry effort, called Hope Now, isn`t a complete solution.</p><p><person><nameText>HENRY PAULSON, TREASURY </nameText></person>SECRETARY: Nothing is worse than doing nothing. The Hope Now effort to streamline refinancings and modifications is a positive step, but it is not a silver bullet.</p><p>DHUE: The modification plan focuses on borrowers who have been making payments, but who will no longer be able to afford their mortgages once the interest rates reset. But analysts say mortgage workouts will only have a modest impact on rising foreclosures and falling home prices.</p><p>FREDERICK CANNON, MANAGING DIR., KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS: It`s a pretty narrow segment of people who can really be helped by these loan modifications and the issues that we face in housing today in terms of the impact of lower home prices and the impact on mortgages and mortgage lending generally are going to be with us for quite some time.</p><p>DHUE: Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozillo says his firm will modify 75,000 sub-prime loans by the end of the year. That`s about 10 percent of the sub-prime loans on its books. He wants the government to do more to jump start the market for mortgage-backed securities.</p><p>ANGELO MOZILLO, CEO, COUNTRYWIDE: Holders of those securities who got screwed are going to say, I`m not going to do this again. Something is going to have to happen to give them confidence to go back and take in mortgage-backed securities.</p><p>DHUE: Mozillo called on regulators to let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase more loans in greater amounts. But homebuilder Robert Toll suggests regulators need to reassert themselves in the mortgage market.</p><p>ROBERT TOLL, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, TOLL BROTHERS: If you`re going to have the secondary market back mortgages, you`re going to have to make those mortgages more sound. You can`t wish for the market to reassert itself. You can`t wish, respectfully, for the providers to worry about their reputation.</p><p>DHUE: Many economists now expect home prices to continue to decline for the next year and until home prices reach a bottom, they say the market for mortgage-backed securities will also struggle to find its footing. Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>YASTINE: Stock investors struggled to find their footing today in this first day of December trading. Winter months are typically good ones on Wall Street. But as Suzanne Pratt reports, there are a number of reasons why this December could mean rough going for the stock market.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: After a fairly naughty November, stock investors are hoping for a nice December. But some market pros are concerned that Santa will skip Wall Street this year. Standard &amp; Poor`s market strategist Alec Young believes volatility will replace the typical year end run-up in stock prices, known as the Santa Claus rally.</p><p>ALEC YOUNG, MARKET STRATEGIST, STANDARD &amp; POOR`S: Santa Claus rally kind of implies that the market makes steady gains throughout the month of December. We don`t really see that. We continue to see some choppiness. But considering how bad things were a few weeks ago, I think a lot of investors would be happy with a market that trades sideways for a little while.</p><p>PRATT: Young believes investors will hold back because of worries about the credit crunch and a recession in the U.S. economy.</p><p>YOUNG: Anything that we get from the government in terms of economic data that reinforces the idea that the economy is weakening would be bad for stocks. Any news on the retailing front that the consumer is ready to pack it in after years of continuing to spend, that that`s finally over, that would be bad news for stocks.</p><p>PRATT: Others, however, believe a December rally is still a possibility. A look at past history certainly helps to make that case. According to the \"Stock Traders Almanac,\" since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year on Wall Street with the S&amp;P 500 gaining on average 1.7 percent. November has been the kindest month, returning slightly more. Russell Investment Group`s Stephen Wood says the December 11th Fed meeting, at which a cut in interest rates is widely expected, could give stocks an added boost.</p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENT GROUP: Is it going to be 25 basis points or 50 basis points? And equity markets are going to like that. So either way, equity markets are going to like it, even though it`s inflationary. So I think what you`re going to see is the market`s moving now ahead of the Fed`s cut.</p><p>PRATT: In the last four decades, there have only been a handful of years without a Santa Claus rally. But it is interesting to note when Santa has failed to show up, his absence sometimes precedes a bear market. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>YASTINE: Traders may have to wait another day or two for Santa`s arrival, because it sure wasn`t here today. The Dow jumped about 30 points through the morning session, reaching the 13,400 mark by midday. But then General Electric fell hard on an analyst downgrade. Same for the NASDAQ, where Research in Motion and some of the other big tech stocks dropped sharply, Research in Motion on a downgrade. The result: lower prices across the board and the Dow settling out the day down 57.15 to 13,314.57 and the NASDAQ off 23.83 to 2637.13. The S&amp;P 500 sliding 8.75 to 1472.42. In the bond market, the 10-year note falling 27/32 to 103 9/32 and the yield now down to 3.85 percent</p><p>GHARIB: November was a turkey of a month for General Motors, the nation`s biggest auto maker, but its rivals managed to hold their own. Sales at GM fell 11 percent last month to 261,000 vehicles. That drop came despite solid gains in two key new models -- the newly redesigned Chevy Malibu and the Cadillac CTS. Ford Motor notched a slight sales gain, up 0.4 percent to 182,000 cars and trucks. Even rival Toyota had a difficult November, as consumers struggled with rising fuel prices and sliding home values. Its sales rose only 0.3 percent. Chrysler sales fell 2 percent to 161,000 cars and trucks. As Diane Eastabrook reports, U.S. auto companies and dealers are looking ahead to next year with uncertainty.</p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Chevrolet dealer Mark Scarpelli says he`s had a hard time keeping the new Chevy Malibu in stock since it rolled into showrooms last month.</p><p>MARK SCARPELLI, CHEVROLET DEALER: It`s General Motors anticipation that they are going to sell 200,000 of these in 2008. At the rate in which we are all selling them I think they have underestimated the demand. I think it`s going to be a wonderful seller for them.</p><p>EASTABROOK: If Scarpelli is right, the Malibu could be one of the few bright spots for the U.S. auto industry next year. Global Insight predicts U.S. auto companies will sell about a half a million fewer vehicles next year than this year. Auto analyst George Magliano says rising mortgage rates from sub-prime loans are primarily to blame.</p><p>GEORGE MAGLIANO, AUTO ANALYST, GLOBAL INSIGHT: You see more and more problems emanating out of sub-prime and more and more problems that number one are going to cause money to be taken out of the consumers` pocket.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Magliano says how auto companies respond to a more challenging U.S. economy will determine how profitable they will be. Incentives could be more prevalent. General Motors for example recently rolled out zero percent financing on remaining 2007 models and analysts think it could be extended to poor performing 2008 models. Magliano also believes auto makers will tweak production plans more often next year based on monthly sales numbers.</p><p>MAGLIANO: You have to restrict the flow of cars and trucks going into the dealerships in order to keep the pricing at a reasonable level and in order to hope to sell what you`re producing.</p><p>EASTABROOK: While Scarpelli admits the auto industry faces some potholes, he remains optimistic. He thinks new union contracts and massive restructurings will help the industry better navigate in a tougher economy.</p><p>SCARPELLI: I think they are poised pretty well to be able to be much more adaptable than they had been three years ago.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Industry watchers say the holiday shopping season could be a good indicator as to how vehicle sales perform next year. They think if consumers opt to buy big ticket items this holiday shopping season, they might opt to buy cars and light trucks next year. Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>GHARIB: AT&amp;T is hanging up its pay phone business. The company announced today that after 129 years, it`s getting out of the pay phone business. It`s a sign of the times as more people are using cell phones. AT&amp;T said there were more than 2.5 million pay phones in the U.S. in 1998. That number has fallen to a million phones this year while wireless users have quadrupled in the past decade. But Jeff, public telephones aren`t completely disappearing. AT&amp;T is selling its pay phone operations to independent contractors.</p><p>YASTINE: Some of those new pay phones are offering users high-tech features that allow them to surf the Internet and check email for about $0.25 a minute.</p><p>So now let`s take a look at some stocks in the news tonight.</p><p>And General Electric (GE) topping our list tonight, dropping $1.36. Citigroup lowering its profit forecast and price target for GE. The analyst sees pressure on GE`s consumer finance unit and a tougher marketplace for sales at GE`s health care division. And earlier today, NBC Universal said it would start buying two hour blocks of programming from outside producers of prime time documentaries because the programming costs a lot less than scripted programs or even network reality shows.</p><p>There`s Citigroup (C) giving back $0.24.</p><p>Invesco ADR (IVZ) rising $0.98, the company moving to simplify its corporate structure. It will eliminate its dual listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p><p>Countrywide Financial (CFC) also easing back $0.14.</p><p>And then Ford Motor Co (F) dropping $0.26 and as you heard, the auto maker posting a modest November sales gain. Analysts were expecting a decline.</p><p>Pfizer (PFE) off $0.21.</p><p>EMC Corp (EMC) dropping $0.23.</p><p>ExxonMobil (XOM) off $0.31.</p><p>Motorola (MOT) losing $0.54.</p><p>And then Bank of America (BAC) dropping $0.66.</p><p>General Motors (GM) falling $1.22. As mentioned a moment ago, a disappointing 11 percent drop in auto sales. GM also not offering as many sales incentives to prospective car buyers compared to Ford or Chrysler.</p><p>And while we`re on the subject of autos, Lehman Brothers will a cautious note on auto parts suppliers with many anticipating large production cutbacks at the auto makers next year. American Axle &amp; Mfg (AXL), Johnson Controls (JCI), Tenneco (TEN) all being cut back themselves in terms of their stock prices.</p><p>IBM (IBM) gaining $0.65. The company boosting its stock buyback program by up to $1 billion.</p><p>And the big loser of the day, Verifone Holdings (PAY) nose diving $2. Accounting errors mean Verifone will have to postpone announcing its fourth quarter and full year results.</p><p>Nokia (NOK) rising $0.93. The Finnish phone giant says it`s gaining market share in India. That`s the second largest cell phone market globally behind China.</p><p>And then Fannie Mae (FNM) down $2.17. Goldman Sachs cutting its earnings targets on a belief the write downs for the fourth quarter will be equally as large as those in the third quarter.</p><p>MBIA (MBI) falling $2.63. Analysts at Bank of America taking a knife to earnings estimates there due to a drop in new production and earned premiums.</p><p>On the NASDAQ, Apple (AAPL) dropping $3.36. Klausner Technologies filing $365 million patent infringement lawsuit against the iPhone maker.</p><p>Research in Motion (RIMM) sliding over $9. Morgan Keegan downgrading the shares of the Blackberry maker on valuation, thinking the stock`s gotten a little ahead of itself.</p><p>Google (GOOG) off nearly $11.50.</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) down $0.68.</p><p>Baidu.com (BIDU), it never seems to go down. It rose $3.29 today.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) falling $0.45.</p><p>Intel (INTC) though gaining $0.17.</p><p>Dell (DELL) off $0.60.</p><p>First Solar (FSLR) down nearly $8.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM) dropping $0.82.</p><p>Activision (ATVI) jumping nearly $3. How do you say guitar hero in French? The maker of the hugely popular Guitar Hero video game being bought by France`s Vivendi for $27.50 a share, $1.7 billion. The new company combines Vivendi`s own video game unit and it`ll be called Activision Blizzard.</p><p>UAP Holding Co (UAPH) soaring more than $8. The seller of seeds, fertilizer, farm chemicals, being bought by Agrium for $39 a share, about $2.6 billion.</p><p>And Merrill Lynch boosting its price target on some several fertilizer companies because of that hook up. Agrium (AGU), CF Industries (CF), Mosaic Co (MOS) and Potash (POT) all sprouting nicely higher.</p><p>Another buyout deal, Cohesant Technologies (COHT) being bought by a Minneapolis firm, Graco for $35 million or $9 a share in cash. Graco will keep just one division, GlasCraft, and spin off all the rest of Cohesant`s unit. That stock rising $3 or nearly $3 today.</p><p>Those are our stocks in the news tonight. Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, Jeff, the U.S. economy is not the only one taking a hit from sub-prime loan losses. The mortgage woes are also hurting Japanese banks and insurance companies. While the problems in Japan aren`t on par with the carnage seen in the U.S. and Europe, the situation is hardly cheering. As Lucy Craft reports, sub-prime fallout is just one of many headwinds buffeting the world`s second biggest economy.</p><p>LUCY CRAFT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The good news -- at least if the latest figures released by Japanese financial institutions accurately reflect the extent of their losses -- is that Japan may have escaped the worst of the sub-prime debacle. The total damage so far comes to $11 billion spread across 10 banking groups, says KBS Securities banking expert Kristine Li.</p><p>KRISTINE LI, BANKING ANALYST, KBS SECURITIES TOKYO: I still think the direct exposure of the Japanese banks is still quite small, (INAUDIBLE) this $11 billion exposure. It`s probably less than 1 percent of their total loans and this is much smaller than their global competitors, like U.S. banks, European banks, even Chinese banks.</p><p>CRAFT: The bad news is that sub-prime exposure could be the least of Japanese banks` problems nowadays. Much of the reason Japanese financial sector profits are stagnant right now, foreign experts charge, is self- inflicted damage -- Japanese policy makers shooting themselves in the foot. Take a hastily enacted new law aimed at shielding consumers that has ended up squashing investment. Robert Feldman is an economist with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>ROBERT FELDMAN, SR ECONOMIST, MORGAN STANLEY JAPAN: If you want to say, buy a foreign investment fund here, there is a huge amount of red tape that is wrapped around your application. For that, you have to go through the application every time. It`s a very long, complicated explanation process. And so the purchases of those instruments have fallen very sharply. Capital outflows have slowed and the yen is stronger.</p><p>CRAFT: Another poorly executed new law, intended to make buildings earthquake-safe, has sent construction into a tailspin. KBS Securities` Kristine Li says new housing starts have been slashed almost in half, year on year.</p><p>LI: Mortgage growth had been strong until recently, but we had a new construction code and new housing starts collapsed and this certainly hurt mortgage growth. We`re looking for some big decline in the second half.</p><p>CRAFT: Japan`s policy missteps, compounded with the specter of a slowing American market on which Japan so heavily depends for selling its exports, could bring down the curtain at last on Japan`s record, six-year- long growth streak, says Jesper Koll, head of Tantallon Research Japan.</p><p>JESPER KOLL, PRESIDENT, TANTALLON RESEARCH JAPAN: Unfortunately the risk of a recession in Japan is now very high. We`ve got domestic demand that is being derailed by some policy tightening by the politicians. On top of that, we now have the hit to exports that is coming from the slowdown in the United States economy. So unfortunately, zero growth in 2008 is a good working assumption for Japan.</p><p>CRAFT: Foreign investors have been the biggest players in the Tokyo stock market, but many are writing off Japan nowadays to focus on other parts of Asia. With an array of risks aside from the sub-prime crisis hanging over the Japanese economy, the Tokyo stock market is bracing for a bearish 2008. Lucy Craft, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Tokyo.</p><p>YASTINE: Tomorrow, from housing to hiring to corporate profits, we`ll get the economic outlook from the Business Roundtable.</p><p>GHARIB: Federal prosecutors may call Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett as a witness in the criminal trial of former officers of Berkshire`s general reinsurance unit. Prosecutors filed court papers today listing Buffett as a government witness, as jury selection got underway. Four former General Re officers were indicted last year in an alleged scheme to help American International Group inflate its books.</p><p>YASTINE: Jeweler Tiffany and Company is taking a fourth quarter charge of $20 million as part of a new deal with Swatch. In an SEC filing, Tiffany said the charge is tied to discontinuing some of its existing watch collections. Under the new partnership, Swatch will develop and distribute Tiffany watches. Swatch will own the new entity and Tiffany will share in its profit.</p><p>GHARIB: Tonight`s commentator says maybe a recession wouldn`t be so bad. He`s Bernard Baumohl, director of the Economic Outlook Group.</p><p>BERNARD BAUMOHL, DIRECTOR, ECONOMIC OUTLOOK GROUP: Here`s a question that may bring cries of heresy, is a recession bad for the economy? Many forecasters see such a downturn in 2008. But would a recession further devastate an economy already reeling from a failing housing market and a damaged financial sector? Or is it just the right medicine this economy needs to cure its ills and hasten a healthy recovery?</p><p>I believe a recession may actually be beneficial this time and here`s why. Recessions are a natural and vital part of a business cycle. After all, consumers and business leaders sometimes make mistakes and occasionally these mistakes are big enough to bring on a recession.</p><p>One drag on the economy today is the housing sector, which is suffering a slow bleed. The drip-by-drip fall in home prices and tougher refinancing rules only deepen the housing debacle. A recession however would permit interest rates to fall more aggressively and this can lure homebuyers back much sooner. Moreover, financial institutions burdened by sub-prime assets may write them off more quickly under the cover of recession and thus improve their balance sheets.</p><p>Of course, recessions are not painless. Some lenders and hedge funds may go under. But the economy now looks like a train wreck moving in slow motion. A recession could purge the country of its real estate excesses and bad debt more rapidly and allow the economy to emerge from this mess faster and much sounder. I`m Bernard Baumohl.</p><p>YASTINE: Recapping today`s market action, a weak start to the week on Wall Street. The Dow dropping 57 points. The NASDAQ lost 23.

You can also e-mail us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:nbr@pbs.org\">nbr@pbs.org</email></p><p>And finally tonight, a car auction in a league of its own. The world`s oldest surviving Rolls-Royce drove into the record books today becoming the most expensive vintage car ever auctioned. The price tag, more than $7 million. The 1904 two-seater was the fourth car ever produced by Charles Royce -- excuse me, Charles Rolls and Frederick Royce. The car was expected to sell for about $2 million but interest from around the world accelerated the price of the bids and the buyer is a British collector. And Susie, believe it or not, the car is still drivable and has a top speed of 40 miles per hour.</p><p>GHARIB: Forty miles, take me on a ride in that classy vehicle.</p><p>YASTINE: You can`t have too many cars going that far these days. That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, December 3. We want to remind you this is the time of year your public television station seeks your support.</p><p>GHARIB: Support that makes programs like NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT possible.</p><p>YASTINE: Thanks for joining us and again, don`t forget to support your public television station.

Speaking at a housing conference in Washington, Paulson pressed the mortgage lending industry to come up with a process to help struggling borrowers stay in their homes. As Stephanie Dhue reports, the Treasury secretary thinks regulators and lenders can agree on a plan this week.</p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Losing patience with rising foreclosures, <person><nameText>Treasury Secretary Paulson </nameText></person>is urging lenders to set standards to quickly reprocess troubled loans. But he acknowledged the current industry effort, called Hope Now, isn`t a complete solution.</p><p><person><nameText>HENRY PAULSON, TREASURY </nameText></person>SECRETARY: Nothing is worse than doing nothing. The Hope Now effort to streamline refinancings and modifications is a positive step, but it is not a silver bullet.</p><p>DHUE: The modification plan focuses on borrowers who have been making payments, but who will no longer be able to afford their mortgages once the interest rates reset. But analysts say mortgage workouts will only have a modest impact on rising foreclosures and falling home prices.</p><p>FREDERICK CANNON, MANAGING DIR., KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS: It`s a pretty narrow segment of people who can really be helped by these loan modifications and the issues that we face in housing today in terms of the impact of lower home prices and the impact on mortgages and mortgage lending generally are going to be with us for quite some time.</p><p>DHUE: Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozillo says his firm will modify 75,000 sub-prime loans by the end of the year. That`s about 10 percent of the sub-prime loans on its books. He wants the government to do more to jump start the market for mortgage-backed securities.</p><p>ANGELO MOZILLO, CEO, COUNTRYWIDE: Holders of those securities who got screwed are going to say, I`m not going to do this again. Something is going to have to happen to give them confidence to go back and take in mortgage-backed securities.</p><p>DHUE: Mozillo called on regulators to let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase more loans in greater amounts. But homebuilder Robert Toll suggests regulators need to reassert themselves in the mortgage market.</p><p>ROBERT TOLL, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, TOLL BROTHERS: If you`re going to have the secondary market back mortgages, you`re going to have to make those mortgages more sound. You can`t wish for the market to reassert itself. You can`t wish, respectfully, for the providers to worry about their reputation.</p><p>DHUE: Many economists now expect home prices to continue to decline for the next year and until home prices reach a bottom, they say the market for mortgage-backed securities will also struggle to find its footing. Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>YASTINE: Stock investors struggled to find their footing today in this first day of December trading. Winter months are typically good ones on Wall Street. But as Suzanne Pratt reports, there are a number of reasons why this December could mean rough going for the stock market.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: After a fairly naughty November, stock investors are hoping for a nice December. But some market pros are concerned that Santa will skip Wall Street this year. Standard &amp; Poor`s market strategist Alec Young believes volatility will replace the typical year end run-up in stock prices, known as the Santa Claus rally. </p><p>ALEC YOUNG, MARKET STRATEGIST, STANDARD &amp; POOR`S: Santa Claus rally kind of implies that the market makes steady gains throughout the month of December. We don`t really see that. We continue to see some choppiness. But considering how bad things were a few weeks ago, I think a lot of investors would be happy with a market that trades sideways for a little while.</p><p>PRATT: Young believes investors will hold back because of worries about the credit crunch and a recession in the U.S. economy.</p><p>YOUNG: Anything that we get from the government in terms of economic data that reinforces the idea that the economy is weakening would be bad for stocks. Any news on the retailing front that the consumer is ready to pack it in after years of continuing to spend, that that`s finally over, that would be bad news for stocks.</p><p>PRATT: Others, however, believe a December rally is still a possibility. A look at past history certainly helps to make that case. According to the \"Stock Traders Almanac,\" since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year on Wall Street with the S&amp;P 500 gaining on average 1.7 percent. November has been the kindest month, returning slightly more. Russell Investment Group`s Stephen Wood says the December 11th Fed meeting, at which a cut in interest rates is widely expected, could give stocks an added boost.</p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENT GROUP: Is it going to be 25 basis points or 50 basis points? And equity markets are going to like that. So either way, equity markets are going to like it, even though it`s inflationary. So I think what you`re going to see is the market`s moving now ahead of the Fed`s cut.</p><p>PRATT: In the last four decades, there have only been a handful of years without a Santa Claus rally. But it is interesting to note when Santa has failed to show up, his absence sometimes precedes a bear market. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>YASTINE: Traders may have to wait another day or two for Santa`s arrival, because it sure wasn`t here today. The Dow jumped about 30 points through the morning session, reaching the 13,400 mark by midday. But then General Electric fell hard on an analyst downgrade. Same for the NASDAQ, where Research in Motion and some of the other big tech stocks dropped sharply, Research in Motion on a downgrade. The result: lower prices across the board and the Dow settling out the day down 57.15 to 13,314.57 and the NASDAQ off 23.83 to 2637.13. The S&amp;P 500 sliding 8.75 to 1472.42. In the bond market, the 10-year note falling 27/32 to 103 9/32 and the yield now down to 3.85 percent</p><p>GHARIB: November was a turkey of a month for General Motors, the nation`s biggest auto maker, but its rivals managed to hold their own. Sales at GM fell 11 percent last month to 261,000 vehicles. That drop came despite solid gains in two key new models -- the newly redesigned Chevy Malibu and the Cadillac CTS. Ford Motor notched a slight sales gain, up 0.4 percent to 182,000 cars and trucks. Even rival Toyota had a difficult November, as consumers struggled with rising fuel prices and sliding home values. Its sales rose only 0.3 percent. Chrysler sales fell 2 percent to 161,000 cars and trucks. As Diane Eastabrook reports, U.S. auto companies and dealers are looking ahead to next year with uncertainty.</p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Chevrolet dealer Mark Scarpelli says he`s had a hard time keeping the new Chevy Malibu in stock since it rolled into showrooms last month.</p><p>MARK SCARPELLI, CHEVROLET DEALER: It`s General Motors anticipation that they are going to sell 200,000 of these in 2008. At the rate in which we are all selling them I think they have underestimated the demand. I think it`s going to be a wonderful seller for them.</p><p>EASTABROOK: If Scarpelli is right, the Malibu could be one of the few bright spots for the U.S. auto industry next year. Global Insight predicts U.S. auto companies will sell about a half a million fewer vehicles next year than this year. Auto analyst George Magliano says rising mortgage rates from sub-prime loans are primarily to blame.</p><p>GEORGE MAGLIANO, AUTO ANALYST, GLOBAL INSIGHT: You see more and more problems emanating out of sub-prime and more and more problems that number one are going to cause money to be taken out of the consumers` pocket.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Magliano says how auto companies respond to a more challenging U.S. economy will determine how profitable they will be. Incentives could be more prevalent. General Motors for example recently rolled out zero percent financing on remaining 2007 models and analysts think it could be extended to poor performing 2008 models. Magliano also believes auto makers will tweak production plans more often next year based on monthly sales numbers.</p><p>MAGLIANO: You have to restrict the flow of cars and trucks going into the dealerships in order to keep the pricing at a reasonable level and in order to hope to sell what you`re producing.</p><p>EASTABROOK: While Scarpelli admits the auto industry faces some potholes, he remains optimistic. He thinks new union contracts and massive restructurings will help the industry better navigate in a tougher economy. </p><p>SCARPELLI: I think they are poised pretty well to be able to be much more adaptable than they had been three years ago.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Industry watchers say the holiday shopping season could be a good indicator as to how vehicle sales perform next year. They think if consumers opt to buy big ticket items this holiday shopping season, they might opt to buy cars and light trucks next year. Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>GHARIB: AT&amp;T is hanging up its pay phone business. The company announced today that after 129 years, it`s getting out of the pay phone business. It`s a sign of the times as more people are using cell phones. AT&amp;T said there were more than 2.5 million pay phones in the U.S. in 1998. That number has fallen to a million phones this year while wireless users have quadrupled in the past decade. But Jeff, public telephones aren`t completely disappearing. AT&amp;T is selling its pay phone operations to independent contractors.</p><p>YASTINE: Some of those new pay phones are offering users high-tech features that allow them to surf the Internet and check email for about $0.25 a minute.</p><p>So now let`s take a look at some stocks in the news tonight.</p><p>And General Electric (GE) topping our list tonight, dropping $1.36. Citigroup lowering its profit forecast and price target for GE. The analyst sees pressure on GE`s consumer finance unit and a tougher marketplace for sales at GE`s health care division. And earlier today, NBC Universal said it would start buying two hour blocks of programming from outside producers of prime time documentaries because the programming costs a lot less than scripted programs or even network reality shows.</p><p>There`s Citigroup (C) giving back $0.24.</p><p>Invesco ADR (IVZ) rising $0.98, the company moving to simplify its corporate structure. It will eliminate its dual listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p><p>Countrywide Financial (CFC) also easing back $0.14.</p><p>And then Ford Motor Co (F) dropping $0.26 and as you heard, the auto maker posting a modest November sales gain. Analysts were expecting a decline.</p><p>Pfizer (PFE) off $0.21.</p><p>EMC Corp (EMC) dropping $0.23.</p><p>ExxonMobil (XOM) off $0.31.</p><p>Motorola (MOT) losing $0.54.</p><p>And then Bank of America (BAC) dropping $0.66.</p><p>General Motors (GM) falling $1.22. As mentioned a moment ago, a disappointing 11 percent drop in auto sales. GM also not offering as many sales incentives to prospective car buyers compared to Ford or Chrysler.</p><p>And while we`re on the subject of autos, Lehman Brothers will a cautious note on auto parts suppliers with many anticipating large production cutbacks at the auto makers next year. American Axle &amp; Mfg (AXL), Johnson Controls (JCI), Tenneco (TEN) all being cut back themselves in terms of their stock prices.</p><p>IBM (IBM) gaining $0.65. The company boosting its stock buyback program by up to $1 billion.</p><p>And the big loser of the day, Verifone Holdings (PAY) nose diving $2. Accounting errors mean Verifone will have to postpone announcing its fourth quarter and full year results.</p><p>Nokia (NOK) rising $0.93. The Finnish phone giant says it`s gaining market share in India. That`s the second largest cell phone market globally behind China.</p><p>And then Fannie Mae (FNM) down $2.17. Goldman Sachs cutting its earnings targets on a belief the write downs for the fourth quarter will be equally as large as those in the third quarter.</p><p>MBIA (MBI) falling $2.63. Analysts at Bank of America taking a knife to earnings estimates there due to a drop in new production and earned premiums.</p><p>On the NASDAQ, Apple (AAPL) dropping $3.36. Klausner Technologies filing $365 million patent infringement lawsuit against the iPhone maker.</p><p>Research in Motion (RIMM) sliding over $9. Morgan Keegan downgrading the shares of the Blackberry maker on valuation, thinking the stock`s gotten a little ahead of itself.</p><p>Google (GOOG) off nearly $11.50.</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) down $0.68.</p><p>Baidu.com (BIDU), it never seems to go down. It rose $3.29 today.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) falling $0.45.</p><p>Intel (INTC) though gaining $0.17.</p><p>Dell (DELL) off $0.60.</p><p>First Solar (FSLR) down nearly $8.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM) dropping $0.82.</p><p>Activision (ATVI) jumping nearly $3. How do you say guitar hero in French? The maker of the hugely popular Guitar Hero video game being bought by France`s Vivendi for $27.50 a share, $1.7 billion. The new company combines Vivendi`s own video game unit and it`ll be called Activision Blizzard.</p><p>UAP Holding Co (UAPH) soaring more than $8. The seller of seeds, fertilizer, farm chemicals, being bought by Agrium for $39 a share, about $2.6 billion.</p><p>And Merrill Lynch boosting its price target on some several fertilizer companies because of that hook up. Agrium (AGU), CF Industries (CF), Mosaic Co (MOS) and Potash (POT) all sprouting nicely higher.</p><p>Another buyout deal, Cohesant Technologies (COHT) being bought by a Minneapolis firm, Graco for $35 million or $9 a share in cash. Graco will keep just one division, GlasCraft, and spin off all the rest of Cohesant`s unit. That stock rising $3 or nearly $3 today.</p><p>Those are our stocks in the news tonight. Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, Jeff, the U.S. economy is not the only one taking a hit from sub-prime loan losses. The mortgage woes are also hurting Japanese banks and insurance companies. While the problems in Japan aren`t on par with the carnage seen in the U.S. and Europe, the situation is hardly cheering. As Lucy Craft reports, sub-prime fallout is just one of many headwinds buffeting the world`s second biggest economy.</p><p>LUCY CRAFT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The good news -- at least if the latest figures released by Japanese financial institutions accurately reflect the extent of their losses -- is that Japan may have escaped the worst of the sub-prime debacle. The total damage so far comes to $11 billion spread across 10 banking groups, says KBS Securities banking expert Kristine Li.</p><p>KRISTINE LI, BANKING ANALYST, KBS SECURITIES TOKYO: I still think the direct exposure of the Japanese banks is still quite small, (INAUDIBLE) this $11 billion exposure. It`s probably less than 1 percent of their total loans and this is much smaller than their global competitors, like U.S. banks, European banks, even Chinese banks.</p><p>CRAFT: The bad news is that sub-prime exposure could be the least of Japanese banks` problems nowadays. Much of the reason Japanese financial sector profits are stagnant right now, foreign experts charge, is self- inflicted damage -- Japanese policy makers shooting themselves in the foot. Take a hastily enacted new law aimed at shielding consumers that has ended up squashing investment. Robert Feldman is an economist with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>ROBERT FELDMAN, SR ECONOMIST, MORGAN STANLEY JAPAN: If you want to say, buy a foreign investment fund here, there is a huge amount of red tape that is wrapped around your application. For that, you have to go through the application every time. It`s a very long, complicated explanation process. And so the purchases of those instruments have fallen very sharply. Capital outflows have slowed and the yen is stronger.</p><p>CRAFT: Another poorly executed new law, intended to make buildings earthquake-safe, has sent construction into a tailspin. KBS Securities` Kristine Li says new housing starts have been slashed almost in half, year on year.</p><p>LI: Mortgage growth had been strong until recently, but we had a new construction code and new housing starts collapsed and this certainly hurt mortgage growth. We`re looking for some big decline in the second half.</p><p>CRAFT: Japan`s policy missteps, compounded with the specter of a slowing American market on which Japan so heavily depends for selling its exports, could bring down the curtain at last on Japan`s record, six-year- long growth streak, says Jesper Koll, head of Tantallon Research Japan.</p><p>JESPER KOLL, PRESIDENT, TANTALLON RESEARCH JAPAN: Unfortunately the risk of a recession in Japan is now very high. We`ve got domestic demand that is being derailed by some policy tightening by the politicians. On top of that, we now have the hit to exports that is coming from the slowdown in the United States economy. So unfortunately, zero growth in 2008 is a good working assumption for Japan.</p><p>CRAFT: Foreign investors have been the biggest players in the Tokyo stock market, but many are writing off Japan nowadays to focus on other parts of Asia. With an array of risks aside from the sub-prime crisis hanging over the Japanese economy, the Tokyo stock market is bracing for a bearish 2008. Lucy Craft, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Tokyo.</p><p>YASTINE: Tomorrow, from housing to hiring to corporate profits, we`ll get the economic outlook from the Business Roundtable.</p><p>GHARIB: Federal prosecutors may call Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett as a witness in the criminal trial of former officers of Berkshire`s general reinsurance unit. Prosecutors filed court papers today listing Buffett as a government witness, as jury selection got underway. Four former General Re officers were indicted last year in an alleged scheme to help American International Group inflate its books.</p><p>YASTINE: Jeweler Tiffany and Company is taking a fourth quarter charge of $20 million as part of a new deal with Swatch. In an SEC filing, Tiffany said the charge is tied to discontinuing some of its existing watch collections. Under the new partnership, Swatch will develop and distribute Tiffany watches. Swatch will own the new entity and Tiffany will share in its profit.</p><p>GHARIB: Tonight`s commentator says maybe a recession wouldn`t be so bad. He`s Bernard Baumohl, director of the Economic Outlook Group.</p><p>BERNARD BAUMOHL, DIRECTOR, ECONOMIC OUTLOOK GROUP: Here`s a question that may bring cries of heresy, is a recession bad for the economy? Many forecasters see such a downturn in 2008. But would a recession further devastate an economy already reeling from a failing housing market and a damaged financial sector? Or is it just the right medicine this economy needs to cure its ills and hasten a healthy recovery?</p><p>I believe a recession may actually be beneficial this time and here`s why. Recessions are a natural and vital part of a business cycle. After all, consumers and business leaders sometimes make mistakes and occasionally these mistakes are big enough to bring on a recession.</p><p>One drag on the economy today is the housing sector, which is suffering a slow bleed. The drip-by-drip fall in home prices and tougher refinancing rules only deepen the housing debacle. A recession however would permit interest rates to fall more aggressively and this can lure homebuyers back much sooner. Moreover, financial institutions burdened by sub-prime assets may write them off more quickly under the cover of recession and thus improve their balance sheets.</p><p>Of course, recessions are not painless. Some lenders and hedge funds may go under. But the economy now looks like a train wreck moving in slow motion. A recession could purge the country of its real estate excesses and bad debt more rapidly and allow the economy to emerge from this mess faster and much sounder. I`m Bernard Baumohl.</p><p>YASTINE: Recapping today`s market action, a weak start to the week on Wall Street. The Dow dropping 57 points. The NASDAQ lost 23.

You can also e-mail us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:nbr@pbs.org\">nbr@pbs.org</email></p><p>And finally tonight, a car auction in a league of its own. The world`s oldest surviving Rolls-Royce drove into the record books today becoming the most expensive vintage car ever auctioned. The price tag, more than $7 million. The 1904 two-seater was the fourth car ever produced by Charles Royce -- excuse me, Charles Rolls and Frederick Royce. The car was expected to sell for about $2 million but interest from around the world accelerated the price of the bids and the buyer is a British collector. And Susie, believe it or not, the car is still drivable and has a top speed of 40 miles per hour.</p><p>GHARIB: Forty miles, take me on a ride in that classy vehicle.</p><p>YASTINE: You can`t have too many cars going that far these days. That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, December 3.

I`m Susie Gharib. Tom is off tonight. The nation`s mood improves. Consumer sentiment hits a three-month high and that`s despite rising gas prices. But tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" guest is predicting a major sell- off for stocks. He`s Frank Cochrane of Investment Timing Consultants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we head to Houston for an update on efforts to get oil production back on track in the Gulf of Mexico. That and more tonight on NBR.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Americans are feeling a little bit better about the U.S. economy. The latest survey of consumer sentiment improved unexpectedly in August. The overall sentiment index compiled by Thomson-Reuters and the University of Michigan ticked up to 73.6. This is its highest level since May. Consumer sentiment is almost 20 points higher than it was a year ago and economist Drew Matus says he knows what`s behind that optimism.</p><p>DREW MATUS, SR. U.S. ECONOMIST, UBS: I think the main reason consumers might be feeling more positive is the fact that initial claims have been going down so fewer and fewer consumers are filing for unemployment insurance. So they may still be having trouble finding work if they`re unemployed, but for people who have a job, they`re less worried that they`re going to lose it.</p><p>GHARIB: Another report today confirmed that optimism. The Conference Board`s leading economic indicators improved more than expected in July. It`s a key gauge of how the economy is expected to do for the next three to six months. All that led to modest gains on Wall Street. The Dow rose 25 points. The NASDAQ added 14 and the S&amp;P inched up two points. For the week, the major averages closed on the upside for the sixth week in a row. Today`s gains in stock prices came in spite of very low trading volume, both at the NASDAQ and here at the big board. Summer doldrums are a big factor of course. But the drop in trading volume goes way beyond seasonal factors. Suzanne Pratt has that story.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mid August on Wall Street and it`s really no surprise that trading volume at the New York Stock Exchange is so light. After all, it seems nearly everyone is on vacation. But, even after accounting for all the hedge fund guys and traders enjoying the Hamptons, volume is anemic. Sure, tourists are plentiful outside the exchange, but inside on the floor, it`s downright dull. No matter how you measure it, August volume is well below the buying and selling we`ve seen in previous Augusts. Wall Street veteran Teddy Weisberg says it`s nothing new.</p><p>TEDDY WEISBERG, TRADER, SEAPORT SECURITIES: It seems unusually light. But, I would remind the viewers that the volume really has been light almost since this rally began going back to February or March of 2009. There has been a lack of participation I think on the part of the public. We see in at Seaport on a daily basis.</p><p>PRATT: And, it`s no wonder the retail public is out of the stock market. From a Ponzi scheme masterminded by Bernie Madoff to Facebook`s failed public offering, average investors feel they can`t possibly win.</p><p>WEISBERG: I think folks are just nervous and scared. It`s not a matter of not wanting to spend the money or not having the money. I think they`ve just simply have adopted this bunker mentality.</p><p>PRATT: Still, even with all the investor anxiety, stocks have had a decent summer. Since its low in early June, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10 percent. So why give a hoot about low volume? Sure, with fewer customers, traders make less money. But, low volume can also mean more volatility, which can be dangerous.</p><p>WAYNE KAUFMAN, MKT. STRATEGIST, JOHN THOMAS FINANCIAL: What it does is it does create the possibility of exaggerated moves to the downside. The market can drop precipitously. The average retail guy doesn`t want to live through that anymore.</p><p>PRATT: The exact same thing can be said for spikes higher. Give the market some positive news and we could certainly see an exaggerated rally. Suzanne Pratt, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead on the program, from low trading volumes to political uncertainty, \"Market Monitor\" guest Frank Cochrane explains why he`s bearish on stocks now.</p><p>Oil prices hit a three-month high of $96 a barrel today and gas prices are up nearly $0.30 in the past month alone. Today a White House spokesperson confirmed that a release from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve is quote, an option that is on the table, adding that the Obama administration continues to monitor the global oil market and will share its findings with other world powers. But oil traders doubt the U.S. will release emergency reserves.</p><p>JOHN WOODS, PRES., JJ WOODS &amp; ASSOCIATES: It was almost like a carrot that the Obama administration was going to say, all right, we might do this. So, let`s say you get towards November and the race is tight, you release it. But I mean that`s not going to affect that market immediately. Really what we`re looking at is what`s happening between Iran and Israel. That`s our focal point right now.</p><p>GHARIB: With tensions escalating in the Middle East, there`s renewed emphasis on growing U.S. oil supplies. It`s been more than two years since an explosion on BP`s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig caused millions of barrels of crude to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Andrew Schneider of KUHF, Houston public radio, reports on the drilling industry`s efforts to get Gulf production back on track.</p><p>ANDREW SCHNEIDER, KUHF CORRESPONDENT: These drilling rigs behind me are undergoing repair, waiting for the orders that will send them back out into the Gulf of Mexico. Those orders are only now returning to the levels they saw before the Deepwater Horizon disaster.</p><p>The April 20th Macondo blowout back in 2010 triggered the biggest oil spill ever in U.S. waters. The Obama administration imposed a moratorium on deepwater drilling that lasted more than four months. Even after the moratorium ended, permits were hard to come by. That hurt drilling everywhere in the Gulf, shallow water as well as deep. Jim Noe is the senior vice president and general counsel for Hercules Offshore (NASDAQ:HERO).</p><p>JIM NOE, SR. VP &amp; GEN. COUNSEL, HERCULES OFFSHORE: What used to take about 50 days from the initial time you submitted an application is now well over 200 days to get permits back. So there`s still some challenges.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Those delays made many companies reluctant to move back into the Gulf. Michelle Foss is chief energy economist at the University of Texas Bureau of Economic Geology.</p><p>MICHELLE FOSS, CHIEF ENERGY ECON., BUREAU/ECONOMIC GEOLOGY, UNIV. OF TEXAS/AUSTIN: Time is money, so anything that happens that lengthens the amount of time that it takes to get projects done increases the cost and that cost gets translated directly into the market.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: But Ian McPherson of investment bank Simmons &amp; Company says, when it comes to attracting drilling, the Gulf still has a lot in its favor. He says within two to three years, more than 40 rigs will be operating in the Gulf, well above pre-Macondo levels.</p><p>IAN MCPHERSON, DIR. OF RESEARCH, SIMMONS &amp; COMPANY: When you compare it to Brazil or a lot of these African markets, which have great geology unto themselves, but they don`t necessarily have the infrastructure or the human capital access or frankly the fiscal or regulatory stability that the U.S. has. So, no, life is not as easy here as it used to be, but on a relative basis globally, it`s still an attractive place to business.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: One sign that oil companies are growing more optimistic about drilling in the central Gulf: a successful auction of oil and gas leases. In June, the Interior Department held its first lease sale since the Deepwater Horizon explosion. Bids totaled a much better than expected $1.7 billion. Andrew Schneider, NBR, Houston.</p><p>GHARIB: Nine out of every 10 new mortgages now come from Federal agencies or the Federally controlled mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. To make sure Fannie and Freddie can keep those loans flowing, the government is changing the terms of the deal it struck when it took control of the two mortgage giants. As Darren Gersh explains, the move is designed to reassure nervous markets.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Federal government has pumped in $190 billion to keep Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac afloat. But that money came with a price, a 10 percent dividend payment. The only problem is, Fannie and Freddie have been borrowing from the Treasury to pay the Treasury back.</p><p>KAREN PETROU, MNG. DIR., FEDERAL FINANCIAL ANALYTICS: Each year, they have to come up with $19 billion in dividends, which, when you`re not making much money, is hard to do. So they have been borrowing money to pay the dividends to borrow the money to pay the dividends.</p><p>GERSH: To end that spiral, instead of a dividend, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will now simply give the Treasury everything they earn. The move is timely, because at the end of the year, the mortgage giants` unlimited backstop from the Treasury will expire. Next year, they`ll have to make do with a credit line of $210 billion.</p><p>PETROU: They still have a $210 billion backstop. But they`re huge. Their total obligations are about $5.5 trillion. And in that scale, it`s not as much as it seems and it`s certainly a lot less than unlimited.</p><p>GERSH: The Treasury is also pushing the mortgage giants to get smaller, faster by winding down their massive investment portfolios by 15 percent a year. Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: The former head of failed brokerage firm PFG Best pleaded not guilty to lying to regulators. Russell Wasendorf, Sr. is</p><p>facing 31 fraud counts for allegedly cooking his firm`s books and defrauding investors for two decades. The plea today came despite the suicide note that Wasendorf left with a detailed confession when he attempted suicide on July 9. He`s scheduled for trial in late October. If convicted, he could spend up to 150 years in prison.</p><p>Liberty Media is getting serious about taking over Sirius XM radio. CEO John Malone is asking the Federal Communications Commission for approval to take over the satellite radio company by boosting its stake to more than 50 percent. Earlier this week, Liberty disclosed that it recently upped its stake in Sirius to 48 percent. If the regulator approves, Liberty could take over in less than 60 days and would have the power to replace management at Sirius.</p><p>On Wall Street today, a small but positive finish on this slow summer Friday. The Dow, the NASDAQ and S&amp;P all rose. And for people keeping score, the S&amp;P 500 just missed closing above its four-year high by a single point. Technology, industrials and retail -- three economically sensitive sectors --were winners in today`s session and for the week.</p><p>Let`s start with tech darling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which hit a fresh all-time high. Investors are getting more excited about the possibility of a new iPhone-5 and a new mini-iPad in September. Brokerage firm Jefferies hiked its price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock to $900. And today Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed above $648 a share.</p><p>More skepticism today about Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The stock lost another 4 percent, falling to $19. That`s half of the initial public offering price. Investors are still concerned about Facebook`s ability to boost revenue and make money from mobile customers. Today`s decline comes on top of heavy selling yesterday after the expiration of that so-called lock-up period that we told you about.</p><p>Another big tech decliner, Marvell Technology. The chip maker`s second quarter profits came in lower than expected. It also guided down estimates for the third quarter, blaming slower growth in its mobile phone chips business in China. The shares fell 14 percent to $10.54. The stock is down almost 40 percent in the last six months. Marvell wasn`t the only tech company feeling pain today. Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) also got slammed, down as much as 10 percent, but it recovered some ground closing at $4.75 a share. Evercore Partners (NYSE:EVR) cut its price target on the shares to $3.</p><p>Lots of big movers in the retail sector today. Women`s apparel retailer Ann Inc. beat Wall Street forecasts for the eighth quarter in a row, as sales soared at its Ann Taylor and Loft Stores. The company is also seeing more full-price purchases. Shares jumped 20 percent to just under $34. That`s the highest level in nearly five years, as the company nudged up its full year sales forecast.</p><p>Gap (NYSE:GPS) was also a winner, because it also raised its full year profit guidance. That good news came on top of a gain of nearly 30 percent in second quarter earnings, helped by good fashion picks and lean inventories. Investors are optimistic the retailer is on a comeback, after struggling for years to reclaim its fashion status. The shares closed up almost 5 percent.</p><p>A very different situation at Aeropostale (NYSE:ARO) which posted a 98 percent drop in second quarter earnings. It also issued a third quarter profit forecast that was below Wall Street expectations and that`s due to soft back-to-school sales. The stock fell 11 percent.</p><p>Now on to a pair of sporting good chains moving in opposite directions. Both reported better than expected second quarter earnings. Athletic footwear chain Footlocker (NYSE:FL) also reported higher sales, so its shares rose nearly 2 percent. Hibbett Sports (NASDAQ:HIBB) fell 4 percent as revenues missed Wall Street`s target.</p><p>But that decline was nothing compared to the huge drop in shares of oilfield services firm Ion Geophysical (NYSE:IO). The shares plunged 11 percent after a Federal jury ruled against in a patent suit. Ion has been ordered to pay nearly $106 million to a Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) subsidiary. That stock closed down $0.20.</p><p>And, finally, a story for all you peanut butter and jelly lovers. Shares of JM Smucker -- maker of its namesake jelly and Jiff peanut butter -- jumped 5 percent today to nearly $83 a share. The company reported better than expected earnings and forecast strong growth for the rest of the year, as price cuts helped to win back customers who traded down to cheaper brands.</p><p>Another strong day of gains for the most active ETFs, except for the Ishares emerging markets. And that`s tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>Despite the recent market gains, our \"Market Monitor\" tonight is calling for a major stock market correction. He`s Frank Cochrane, president of Investment Timing Consultants. Frank, why are you so bearish?</p><p>FRANK COCHRANE, PRES., INVESTMENT TIMING CONSULTANTS: Well first of all, the rally that we`ve seen over the last six weeks or so, the sirens (ph) of central banking with Bernanke and so on, have really done a marvelous job in giving a great levitation activist to this market which I think is totally unfounded. If you look at the employment picture which is 8.3 percent, participation rate at 63 percent, today, for example, the BLS announced that 44 states had higher unemployment than the previous month in June.</p><p>These are not things that are a good foundation for the economy to do well. Economic statistics are, you know, one month up, one month down, but overall the trend I think is lower and if you look at the amount of money that the government and the Fed has thrown at this economy over the past four years, growth is really, really pathetic. We are $16 trillion in debt, $800 billion thrown in by the government. It`s just -- that combined with the fact that the election`s coming up, I think it will be something that will cause people to sit on their hands, wait, and then if I look at the technicals of the market, they`re extremely weak as well. The participation, the advanced decline line, new highs, new lows, everything is contracting in this advance and, you know, the thing is, it`s not something where longer term, I think -- I really think we`ve hit an apex here and the market will hit a wall. If we haven`t already, we will certainly over the next week or two.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s talk a little bit about timing here. When do you think that this correction is going to happen and how serious? How deep is it going to be? How big a correction?</p><p>COCHRANE: I`m looking for something on the short term, as I mentioned, going into the election I think, maybe into the middle of November, so the next say, three months, starting at any time and I think anywhere from 15 to 20 percent is not out of the realm of possibilities.</p><p>GHARIB: That`s pretty big. That`s a pretty big correction.</p><p>COCHRANE: It will be huge. It will be fast. It will be furious and it will be scary, but we may hit a bottom some time and then grudgingly go up towards the end of the year into the spring. I think the next two, three, months could be very interesting for the bears.</p><p>GHARIB: This is going to be a very difficult time for investors if you are right and you`re saying that investors should get out of stocks, get out of equities and put their money into 10-year Treasuries and also two-year notes. Tell us why.</p><p>COCHRANE: Well, the -- you know, the 10 year, first of all, has gone from a low on the 22nd of July to, say, 138 up to 181 today. This is a gift. I would buy into -- buy into that. That, coincidentally happened with Mario Draghi`s comment, which respect, we`ll throw anything at this market. We`ll do whatever it takes to get things done at the ECB. So we saw lower rates then. I think that`s good. As far as the two year, I would be very, very liquid going into this -- into the next few months. Money markets, two-year notes, 10-year notes, that type of thing and make a shopping list when this decline occurs. Capital preservation I think will be key.</p><p>GHARIB: You`re also recommending an ETF, ticker symbol TEIX (ph). This is a way for investors to hedge against market volatility. Tell us why you like this ETF.</p><p>COCHRANE: The chart on that looks like Niagara Falls. In fact it almost looks like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). This is a very low-price ETF and I think if the volatility picks up and we hit new lows today over the course of the short duration that I`m talking about, there should be some good percentage gains in that ETF. This is a short-term trade. This is not something to fall in love with and I would certainly use some type of ...</p><p>GHARIB: It`s not a \"buy\" and \"hold.\"</p><p>COCHRANE: .10 or 50 percent. That`s correct. And I would definitely be out of it by some time early to mid-November at the latest.</p><p>GHARIB: Any disclosures, Frank? Do you own this ETF?</p><p>COCHRANE: That particular one, no, not at this time. From time to time we do trade in and out of that.</p><p>GHARIB: All right, thanks a lot. We really appreciate your insights. Our \"Market Monitor tonight,\" Frank Cochrane. He`s president of the Investment Timing Consultants.</p><p>While the clock is ticking for the fiscal cliff deadline, tonight`s commentator says lawmakers will soon have a bigger worry. He`s Russ Koesterich, Ishares investment strategist at Blackrock and author of \"The Ten Trillion Dollar Gamble.\"</p><p>RUSS KOESTERICH, GLOBAL CHIEF INVEST. STRATEGIST, BLACKROCK ISHARES: . have resigned themselves to another year or two of sluggish growth. There`s little to suggest that the market anticipates another one to two decades in the slow lane. Yet, this could be what the future holds. The problem is the Federal debt. If present conditions hold, publicly traded Federal debt will hit 90 percent of GDP by 2022 and exceed 109 percent, the previous all-time high, by 2026. History shows debt levels that high can reduce long-term economic growth rates by one third and the drag on growth can last two decades or more.</p><p>These realities will become clear during the next presidential term. If the next administration can`t start making a dent in the nation`s fiscal position, investors may need to reconsider the long-term argument for U.S. stocks or at least demand a bigger discount before committing new capital. From the fiscal cliff to the Federal government`s long-term solvency, the markets are unlikely to permit endless procrastination. Ultimately, if the U.S. continues to stumble along with an indecisive government, Europe may no longer be the biggest problem child in the global economy. I`m Russ Koesterich.</p><p>GHARIB: Coming up all next week on NBR, we take a closer look at the fiscal cliff: what it all means for the nation`s economy and you. We talk about fixing the debt with former Senator Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles. We check in with doctors who worry their life-saving research could be on the line if the sequester isn`t stopped. And then on Monday, we meet a small town defense contractor counting on lawmakers to keep its business strong.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally, we end with a few thoughts on the big win in little rewards. Here`s author and educator Lou Heckler.</p><p>LOU HECKLER: I hate to admit it, but I`m now at that awkward age. It`s the age where you read food before you eat food! Does it have enough of this? Does it have too much of that? I guess the days are gone when I could chase three pieces of pepperoni pizza with a bag of Krispy Kremes. As I think of the organizations I have worked for and the ones I now speak to, I do think there is a vitamin deficiency in many of our working people. I think they lack vitamin \"P\" -- the praise vitamin.</p><p>I was speaking at a conference and I posed this question: what`s the number one thing you hear when you`ve done a good job? I looked expectantly across the room of 300 people and nobody offered an answer. Finally, one woman up front said: that`s what we hear -- nothing! Though the room burst into nervous laughter, it wasn`t because anybody thought that was funny. Author Michael Leboeuf (ph) says it`s pretty simple: the things that get rewarded get repeated. We seem to know this with little children and then we seem to forget it when it comes to adults.</p><p>The best managers I`ve worked for have handled praise this way. It`s precise, it`s periodic and it`s personal. It recognizes a specific act. It isn`t given once and never again. It is directed specifically to one individual and helps that person see how their exact contribution is appreciated. Things feeling a little puny around your place of business?
