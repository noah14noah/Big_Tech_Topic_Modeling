Tech backlash: Even some capitalists fear that Silicon Valley today resembles a playground basketball game: The players are refereeing themselves.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bill Smead, a Seattle money manager, knows firsthand that things can get out of hand during neighborhood basketball games. And he thinks it's time to crack down on Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We're dealing with a game of far too much importance to have the rules officiated by the players,\" Smead, the CEO of Smead Capital Management, told CNN Business. </p><p>\"We are letting them call the fouls,\" Smead said, \"and in the process it's ruining the competitive landscape that is so necessary in this democratic capitalist system.\"</p><p>Although that kind of critique of Silicon Valley is hard to find on Wall Street, it's becoming commonplace on the political left. In fact, some Democrats are running on it. </p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiled a plan earlier this month to break up tech giants like Amazon, Google and Facebook that haul in $25 billion or more in revenue. The presidential candidate's plan would also aim to unwind landmark tech acquisitions, including Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, Google's takeover of DoubleClick and Facebook's savvy deals for Instagram and WhatsApp</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" Warren wrote in a Medium post. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\"</p><p>Those words were met with eyerolls from some on Wall Street. But not Smead, who explained his position in a letter to clients (after first warning them to grab a \"sturdy chair\" to sit down on). The money manager supports rewriting the antitrust laws and then either breaking up or regulating Big Tech companies. He broadly supports Warren's plan.</p><p>\"I love competition,\" Smead said. \"But there are some things that are more important than just competing. And that is the survival of this wonderful system that has succeeded so well.\"</p><p>Smead specifically called out Amazon, Google and Facebook as the prime suspects. He said the problem is that while supply and demand is normally balanced by price, far too often that doesn't happen in today's tech world.</p><p>\"They have taken price out of social media, search and delivery. How can supply and demand work when there is no price?\" Smead said. \"It's impossible.\"</p><p>Regulatory risk is rising</p><p>Of course, many would argue that the push to crack down on tech is an example of punishing success. Big doesn't have to be bad. And these tech giants were built on American ingenuity. </p><p>Nonetheless, Wall Street is starting to grow worried about a looming tech crackdown. Facebook, mired in countless scandals, has watched its stock decline 24% since peaking in July.</p><p>What happens next to Big Tech has broad implications. These companies have enormous sway over the stock market. Millions of Americans own them in their 401(k) plans and mutual funds. </p><p>Smead, recalling the bursting of the dot-com bubble, is warning his clients to cash in their tech winnings before the backlash arrives.</p><p>\"Parabolic manias go until they don't,\" Smead said. \"When the mania goes, they get crushed. They don't just go down.\"</p><p>2. Brexit next steps: The European Union has given the United Kingdom three weeks to solve a political riddle that has vexed politicians for nearly three years: Does Britain really want to leave the bloc? And if so, under what terms?</p><p>How parliament answers those questions this week could have major implications for financial markets and the UK economy. The potential outcomes remain the same: Leave the European Union with a deal that protects trade, crash out of the bloc or seek another delay to the process.</p><p>Brexit has already done major damage to the UK economy. The economy is now 2% smaller than it would have been if the United Kingdom had chosen to remain in the EU, according to the Bank of England. </p><p>3. Apple announcement: Apple has a press event scheduled for Monday. It's expected to focus on the launch of its rumored streaming service.</p><p>The company quietly launched new gadgets ahead of the event throughout last week. It debuted its next-generation wireless earbuds, as well as a refresh of its iMac line and new versions of the iPad Air and iPad mini.</p><p>Investors will watch the reveal closely. Apple's stock rose last week on positive analyst reports and in anticipation of the event.</p><p>4. Housing data: A trifecta of US real estate reports are expected Tuesday: US building permits, housing starts and S&amp;P/Case-Shiller US home prices. US consumer confidence comes out the same day.</p><p>On Friday, the National Association of Realtors reported that existing US home sales rebounded in February after slipping in January. This was read as an optimistic sign about the health of the US economy.</p><p>Analysts will observe whether the pattern holds this week. Some expect the housing market to get a boost from the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady.</p><p>5. Lyft goes public: Ride-hailing firm Lyft will make its long-anticipated debut on the Nasdaq this week. Lyft predicted investors would buy the stock for between $62 and $68 a share. The company expects to raise as much as $2.1 billion through the sale of stock.</p><p>6. Coming this week:</p><p>Monday --- Apple event</p><p>Tuesday --- US building permits; US housing starts; S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home prices; McCormick and Carnival earnings</p><p>Wednesday --- US balance of trade data; Lululemon earnings</p><p>Thursday --- UK consumer confidence; US final estimate Q4 GDP</p><p>Friday --- Huawei earnings; Carmax earnings</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Staff costs and headcount to remain controlled to deliver margin target.</p><p>9. Operational effectiveness and efficiency programs to deliver significantly.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>WILL MAIRS, ANALYST, NOMURA: Will Mairs, Nomura. Three questions. The first one is just on the restructuring charge and that follows on from quite a large one in 2014 of GBP128 million.</p><p>So I'm just wondering how recurring should we think that restructuring charge [had been]? Perhaps if you could give us more details on IT, if you think that's going to re-occur. And perhaps also on the severance, if Kantar-related severance will continue or actually if there'll be severance in difference areas of the business.</p><p>The second question is just regarding North America. You said that you're gaining quite significant share in that market. I'm just wondering what are you doing different in North America to gain that share and how sustainable that is.</p><p>And then the third question is just on general pricing in the market. So I guess you've got all of the media reviews that have taken place, which might put pressure on pricing in the market. But, on the flip side, you're reiterating 30 bps of margin growth. You're seeing Omnicom issue 30 bps as well and all the other agencies different levels of margin growth, which might indicate that pricing pressure isn't quite there. So I'm just wondering how you marry the two between those.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, WPP PLC: Just before Paul answers on restructuring, we have the option of taking exceptional gains and exceptional charges above the line, rather than below the line.</p><p>So it's a question of taking advantage, and I would say this quite forthrightly, of significant exceptional gains to do some of the things that, if we were private, and we've discussed this before, if we were private or private equity we would do -- I'll be blunt about it, we would probably be much more aggressive on restructuring than we can do, given the constraints of quarterly or half-yearly or annual reporting.</p><p>So I think you don't want to anticipate that it's constant or continuous. We're just taking advantage of the fact that we have exceptional gains to do it.</p><p>Do you want to comment on the restructuring costs?</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON, FINANCE DIRECTOR, WPP PLC: I think, if I was to characterize it, I would say that last year was still the continuation of trying to improve Western Continental Europe, this is 2014 I am talking about, really across the portfolio of our brands, quite frankly.</p><p>We have made huge strides in Western Continental Europe. Obviously, only the last two years have we seen any sort of revenue growth at all. And, really, ever since 2009 we have been working, I suppose, across the portfolio of countries, across the portfolio of brands.</p><p>I think we've seen the benefit of that. It's obviously hard to see in the reported numbers because of the currency impact, but that has generally happened and we're pleased with it.</p><p>I think the opportunity, or it's really an operational decision by Kantar to structurally make a change in the way they face clients, was decided upon and, actually, we think could be a model for how our other businesses could operate.</p><p>So, for the first time, we are actually delicately trying to combine the consumer insights business of Millward Brown, TNS, Added Value, Lightspeed and the operations center. It's taken us a long time to be comfortable to do this but we actually think it's the best thing for clients in all respects and we're doing it globally across 110 markets.</p><p>And I'd say it's probably the most focused, the most targeted structurally, with the key ambition of driving top-line growth.</p><p>So that is the characterism (sic) in terms of this year's initiatives.</p><p>They have another initiative in terms of the outsourcing of all their media print management business offshore, which is also part of the charge.</p><p>So two very specific projects. We actually got external help to help us, professional external help, for the first time. This is a major across the structure initiative, both client-facing personnel and, secondly, obviously, the follow-on of the back office HR, IT.</p><p>So that's my characterization.</p><p>Secondly, we continue with the GINA project, we call it the GINA project; the phase 1 of our IT infrastructure.</p><p>We have finished the transformation and transition costs. We now have 160,000 people on the same email system across the Group, all outsourced to third-party help desks. That's actually been a huge initiative. It's happened in the last 15 months and we are beginning to see the benefits of that going forward.</p><p>As Robin Dargue will tell you, we've now got the building blocks in place. We're now tackling and just have gone live with this application development and maintenance of all our back-office systems, and that's a two-year project. The cost will be in the GBP10 million to GBP15 million, nothing that material, to be quite frank with you, of the transition and setup costs.</p><p>And then the third stage, which we are not developing at this point, will be all the client-facing systems, of which there are very many still remaining in the operating businesses, to try and get some standardization. This is partly driven by the need for efficiency and also the need for better cyber security and defenses in an ever data-driven world.</p><p>So I think the two things have to happen.</p><p>So that's the characterization. The IT element going forward, I think, is going to be much less and we are going to see the benefits coming through in the P&amp;L. So that's an overall perspective.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: You've got a breakdown. We gave a fairly detailed slide on the restructuring costs. And you can see from that that some of it, a significant part of it, is related to data and Europe.</p><p>So just picking up, the project name is [One] Kantar and, in fact, what Kantar are doing, which is consolidating their operations on a country-by-country basis, is very similar to what we're doing Group-wise. They're doing it probably on a shorter timeframe but what we're doing Group-wise, or aiming to do Group-wise in the long term.</p><p>So what you will see, going back to that horizontality matrix, is increasingly, and I said that the client leaders increasingly that will not be a dotted line, that will be a solid line, or the regional country managers will be more solid, you're going to see more, I'll get myself in trouble for saying this but I'll say it, more power and influence being given to those in the matrix structure and the balance shifting much more to a country level, less to a regional level and much more to a client level. And that's exactly what Kantar are doing.</p><p>On the North America differentiation, I think, at the end of the day, Irwin Gotlieb and I, and one or two others, Andrew and others, sat down about three years ago and we laid out companies that we wished to invest in or acquire, with one exception, which was Datalogix, which Oracle bought for a sum that we had a nosebleed on. With that one exception we've done everything on that list.</p><p>And I think that, and we would say this, wouldn't I, but I do think that's given us a technological -- I think AppNexus and Xaxis gives us an edge. Google and Facebook are opaque. The margins at Google and Facebook are astronomic. The marginal margins are 100%. You don't know how the algorithms work, so there's a -- and that's why I think the third force, the AOL-Verizon/Microsoft, if that was to get together with Yahoo, that would certainly a third -- I would claim we were a third force, but that certainly would be a third force.</p><p>So technology. Data: comScore and Rentrak, and it certainly has touched a nerve. People are very concerned about the lack of measurement, the poor measurement of traditional, the under measurement of traditional and probably the over measurement of digital.</p><p>And Facebook, for example, puts great emphasis on outcomes and ROI. And the data has to be independent data that justifies the position. And so Facebook has a very close arrangement now with Nielsen currently on that.</p><p>And that's something that increasingly we are going to ensure that comScore has that similar relationship with Facebook to provide alternate data, because clients are investing now a lot of money.</p><p>And you know it publicly. And Keith Weed has talked about the three Vs: value, validation and viewability. And he's on the Facebook consumer council. So you've got somebody on your consumer council saying, we've got to have a better measurement.</p><p>So I think those -- and then content. I think Vice gives us an edge. I think Media Rights Capital, House of Cards coming out with its fourth series this week; Fullscreen, with its relationship with AT&amp;T and Otter Media, and you see AT&amp;T are now doing their, as I mentioned, their over-the- top; Verizon doing their over-the-top.</p><p>So there are some interesting things. Having knowledge in that area doesn't displace talent and pricing but it gives us an advantage.</p><p>On the margin thing, you said Omnicom's margins have been flat for the last five years. And it's about time that they indicated they're going to improve them. And, by the way, their revenues have been growing by 5% or 6%. We threw up the numbers. So why is there no margin improvement if your revenues are growing at that level? There's a lot of [flex]. And the margins are about, what, 300 basis points less.</p><p>IPG have come from a very low level; still at 11%. And Publicis have come back. Given the issues they've been dealing with, they've come back.</p><p>So I think we're very confident about our 30 basis points and being able to do that pre currency, because -- if it is a currency tailwind this year. This time last year we thought there was going to be currency tailwind and it turned after Q2 into a headwind. But, on the assumption it doesn't, that gives us increased confidence in being able to do that. So I think it's achievable.</p><p>And then the IT transformation program kicks in as well.</p><p>IAN WHITTAKER, ANALYST, LIBERUM: Ian Whittaker, Liberum. Three questions, please. First of all, just actually go back to comments that Paul made, just when he was talking about the constant currency. I think he mentioned that the two most international parts of your business are the advertising media side and then also the data side.</p><p>It would seem a little bit odd that, in terms of the branding, healthcare, communications and digitals, that that also wouldn't be so international as well. I'm just wondering if you can talk through perhaps why and whether that actually presents any opportunities for you in the future.</p><p>The second -- well, the other two questions on digital. Of -- you're seeing obviously a lot of concern about online ad fraud and what's going on in the quality of online data. Do you think that is leading to a concentration of online ad spending within fewer players, such as Facebook and Google?</p><p>And, if that's the case, what's the implications for your business moving forwards? Do you think that's a positive? Or do you think a potential negative is it could increase the power of those players?</p><p>And the third one, and it's actually related to Will's question, in terms of, again, your increase in North America. One of the points that you've repeatedly made is the quality of Xaxis, the information that you have, that essentially you're taking a different strategy from other groups.</p><p>Do you think that's actually played a part in your significant wins that you've won in North America? You seem to have hit the ball out of the park when it comes to wins -- (multiple speakers)</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Well, not quite. We'd like to have won P&amp;G in North America, and Coke in North America. That would have been hitting the ball out of the park. I think probably we got to third base. I don't think we hit it out of the park.</p><p>IAN WHITTAKER: It's not bad. It's not a bad position. But, in terms of that, do you think that essentially that clients have actually started to realize that and started to realize you do have a differentiated offering?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Okay. Do you want to --?</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: I probably slightly mis-characterized the international nature of our brands globally to try and assist in the technical description of the difference between reported sterling and constant currencies.</p><p>All our brands are, obviously, international. The balance is really, how much do they have of the European profit versus the American profit that reported back in 2015 and how it affected the overall margins? So Hill &amp; Knowlton is in 60, 70 markets.</p><p>So I think don't take any inference that the brands weren't global. It's just where their weighting of profits has arisen, how it affected the difference between the constant currency and reported margins. So that was what I was trying to explain.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: On the big two, our relationship with Google, I think, they may think differently, is really good. It's grown from, as I said, GBP2.9 billion to GBP4 billion. If you pro forma in Essence, GBP3.2 billion to GBP4 billion. What do I think it will hit this year? I think it will be over GBP5 billion this year. That's a fairly educated guess.</p><p>Why is that? Google search and video, YouTube video, continue to be two very powerful mediums, particularly in high-penetration TV markets. So if you're in Brazil or if you're in Italy or India or not so much China, although Google is in China through Android, often people forget that.</p><p>But even, what Adam said, the shift to digital in China presents us with tremendous opportunities, given the position that we have in the Chinese market.</p><p>And Google may be, to be blunt, because of some of the challenges that they have from regulation, particularly here in Europe -- Vestager has indicated that she will go further. There was an initially flurry a few weeks ago, go further. The taxation issues probably have made Google probably more responsive and more flexible.</p><p>And maybe even the success of Facebook in building their video business and their mobile business and quote-unquote, catching up with Google, probably makes Google a little bit more responsive.</p><p>Facebook, I think because they've been so successful, probably, to be blunt, probably a little bit more difficult to deal with. And I think that's not a view that we're alone in having but others would too, if you ask around. My view is that's going to change because I think they will see the benefit and the merit.</p><p>For example, on the data point if we had more access to Facebook data, then I think we will be able to justify investments in video and mobile to a greater degree.</p><p>So I don't see what you're saying as being a problem. Just think about the portfolio for a minute. If it's $80 billion and $4 billion is coming from Google and $1 billion is coming from Facebook, that's $5 billion.</p><p>But I think Brian Wieser takes out the data that I threw out and then tries to extrapolate that or compare that to the Google and Facebook advertising data. Dangerous thing to do because there's a thing called the long tail.</p><p>We are not heavily into the long tail. We're into the short tail, if you like. And what Google and Facebook have done have improved the primary demand for digital advertising for search and video by bringing in small and medium-sized companies that never advertised before.</p><p>On this Xaxis thing and strategy, it does have some impact. Brian Lesser has now moved up to running GroupM in North America.</p><p>That will inevitably position GroupM in North America as a very strong digital -- taking the guy who ran Xaxis and putting him in to run GroupM in North America and Brian Gleason takes over from Brian Lesser. It's all the Brians, with Brian O'Kelley at AppNexus to add to the confusion: B3. And Brian Gleason works on [Xaxis].</p><p>So that will make us, I think, even stronger. But I don't want to diminish the importance of talent or pricing.</p><p>I think one of the problems, having gone through the media tsunami, I remember one of our clients saying, when I said, what's your biggest problem? He said, the irrational competitor, the one that's doing the worst, making it -- and there's still a lot of irrationality going on.</p><p>For example, we won a piece of business, a media piece of business, in North America a few weeks ago and we will only take clients if we can get credit insurance. We wouldn't get credit insurance on this company. And we asked for financial details and the client would not give us the financial details, so we declined to take the business. One of our competitors took it in an instant.</p><p>There are some irrational things being done, which you can't -- it's a bit linked to the question about margins and maybe there's some relief. You just cannot plan for the irrationality of it.</p><p>So I would say technology, data and content are giving us an advantage.</p><p>One other little point. Sometimes clients find what we're talking about too complicated and there's too much change involved and they won't make the change because everything seems to be going okay, or everything is okay and they don't want to disturb the change. So sometimes we see that.</p><p>IAN WHITTAKER: Could I just ask a quick follow up, just on the ANA investigation? When's your view on when that should report?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Well, we've told the ANA that if any client has an issue they wish to discuss they can have a direct conversation with us. Most of our clients have audit rights. There are no rebates in the US, so we don't think it's an issue.</p><p>The ANA have actually requested a meeting with the six agency holding company heads, which I've said I'm happy to go to as long as the other five go as well.</p><p>Just as an aside, last year I suggested to the World Federation of Advertisers that we have a meeting, which we had here in London. The six were invited and only two turned up. I was one of them. So I'm quite happy to go to a meeting as long as everybody else is happy to come to too.</p><p>ADAM SMITH, FUTURES DIRECTOR, GROUPM, WPP PLC: May I respond to one of Ian's questions? This question about Google and Facebook, GroupM Italy made a wise remark, which was when it comes to defending yourself against fraud and viewability problems, the biggest difference is in media planning, which means the choice of your media partners. And Google and Facebook score strongly there.</p><p>DoubleClick is often cited as one of our main technical defenses against ad fraud, along with Integral Ad Science and DoubleVerify. Facebook obviously has a signed-in domain, which is very helpful. And both are good at optimizing to improve viewability; that is viewing persistence. And so those are good reasons to go to quality because it would improve your scores on fraud and viewability.</p><p>But the downside is they're walled gardens, as Martin's just mentioned, and the path to purchase is never a linear thing. You can never know enough about your prospects.</p><p>We know that what puts people off and causes them to get ad blockers is too many ads and too high frequency. And so we're hoping that our complementary technology, which sits above the walled gardens, makes our advertising more welcome, fundamentally.</p><p>JULIEN ROCH, ANALYST, BARCLAYS: Julien Roch, Barclays. The usual three questions. The first one. In a recent interview you said that because of Brexit you were seeing some clients freezing investments. However, we all talk to --</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Just so we're clear, what I was referring was freezing capital investment. I wasn't referring to ad investments.</p><p>JULIEN ROCH: Okay. Clear, then. Second question is on the media review. Amusingly but unsurprisingly, the winners say it's all about quality. The losers say it was all about pricing. So, if you look at the overall impact on the industry, in a one-word answer would you say negative, neutral or positive?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: The reviews?</p><p>JULIEN ROCH: Yes.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: In terms of pricing?</p><p>JULIEN ROCH: Yes.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Well, the honest answer is it must be negative. Right? It must be negative.</p><p>The other interesting observation is when you ask the losing agency, what were the revenues? Somebody may say they were [50]. When you ask the winning agency what the revenues were, they say it's</p><p>[100].</p><p>In fact, there's one specific example I can think of where we know the figure was 100 and we know that the winner was getting 50 and those are the actual numbers.</p><p>So I think you would be, again, in cloud cuckoo land to suggest that it would be positive. The pressures are there. We've all got to be realistic about it.</p><p>Now, if you're talking about like for like is one thing. If you're talking about extensions or additions, it may be different. But, head to head, clients are looking for improvements in pricing. So the honest answer, I think, is neutral at best, negative at worst.</p><p>JULIEN ROCH: And the last question is on Kantar. Massive restructuring for the first time --</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: One other thing. What Adam said is also that you've got to look at two communities get affected by this; the agency community and the publisher or media owner. So, whatever the negative is, it's absorbed by both those communities.</p><p>JULIEN ROCH: The last question on Kantar. Massive restructuring for the first time in a while and you said it was partially about top line and consumer insight, again, dragged the overall growth down. So, taking into account that --</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Just so we're clear. So syndicated grew, custom didn't.</p><p>JULIEN ROCH: But if you look at the overall business, taking into account the restructuring, how many years before consumer insight gets to 2% to 3%?</p><p>And a subsidiary question is, to help get there, isn't it -- don't you have some assets in all of those businesses that don't really belong to WPP, like political polling or whatever, which you could sell to improve the growth rate?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Well, where I differ with you on this, I think there are high-growth spots and there are low-growth spots and we've mentioned the difference between syndicated and custom.</p><p>You may be right, there are smaller parts but I think you do that by changing the leadership. I don't think you improve it by putting a for-sale sign out over the top of it.</p><p>The fact of the matter is in our industry, and the history is littered with examples of this, the moment you put the for-sale sign up the value falls very significantly.</p><p>So I don't think that's the way to deal with it. The way to deal with it is try and position the business in the strongest part of the growth. So it might be the fast growth markets, it might be syndicated, whatever it happens to be.</p><p>The other thing is that there are the intangible benefits. You just asked me, or I've been asked, why is it that we do well on the media front and in the media reviews? I think it is -- and I said technology, data and content. Well, data's the second one of the three and our assets -- what we get by combining the insights that we have at a TNS or a Millward Brown, in terms of consumer insights or client insights, is very considerable. It gives us actually a very considerable advantage.</p><p>JULIEN ROCH: How many years do you think it's going to take until it grows at 2% to 3%? Is that two years turnaround? Or --?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: As long as it takes. As long as it takes. I think, strategically, it's a really important part of the jigsaw.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lisa, Goldman Sachs. My first question is on your outlook for the full year of over 3%. I was just wondering how much are you budgeting for rest of the world and especially China? And if we can get any color for other regions that would be helpful.</p><p>The second is on the FX impact on your margins. Obviously in 2015 you had a 20 basis points headwind, so why shouldn't we expect at least 20 basis points tailwind for 2015? And if you can explain how that works that would be helpful.</p><p>And I guess the last question is on the growth rate you expect for the agencies in general for 2016 compared to the overall advertising market growth, which is about 4.5%. Is it just because the agencies don't benefit from the quadrennial effect? Or is there anything structural --?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Just on that point. So if it's 4.5% and you're looking at net sales, you're going to see a difference. If you're looking at revenues, you aren't. Okay? So this is the confusion that sets in. We would get out of this confusion if everybody produced a net sales number.</p><p>So you're comparing apples and oranges compared --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: But the other agencies are --</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Well, what we said for this year is revenues well over 3%. And the language was very specific. In relation to net sales it was over 3%. So take that in mind.</p><p>When you look at 4.5% you've got to adjust the 4.5% because that's worldwide GDP. It's not WPP GDP. And you've got to make that adjustment, whichever way that goes, and then you get to the agency number. What we are saying is we'll grow with the market, basically, at the revenue level.</p><p>Do you want to talk about the first point?</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: So let me talk about the outlook in terms of the mature versus faster growth markets.</p><p>If we were to look at our budgets, we are seeing a bounce back in some of the parts of the faster growth regions that were soft, or relatively soft, in 2015. So, for example, Asia Pacific picks up in terms of growth rate. Latin America, which was strong overall last year, remains strong. And where we see, I think, an improvement overall is a relative growth coming back in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa.</p><p>So put all those combinations of factors together, we do expect a faster rate of growth from the fast-growth markets in 2016 versus the mature markets.</p><p>Some of the Western Continental European markets are not accelerating further than the rate of growth they've seen in 2015. So that's in answer to that one.</p><p>In terms of the currency impact on the margins, it's really very difficult to predict.</p><p>Just to give you an illustration, so of the GBP50 million of profit that the FX had a negative impact for the year, GBP40 million of it came in the final quarter and that's because we had that swing in currencies.</p><p>So the honest answer to you is we won't really know the margin impact of this until we understand what the final quarters 2016 pound versus euro, which will be post Brexit, pound versus dollar rates will be. And only then can we really have a half-intelligent estimate of what it might be, to be quite frank with you.</p><p>There is a natural assumption that it should spring back, because the last three years, as Martin said, our constant currency rate of growth has averaged 0.4%. So we've actually improved margin by 1.2%, whereas on a reported basis it's been 0.8%.</p><p>But it really does depend, in the quarter, pound versus euro, pound versus dollar, how their relative movements are, specifically that time of year. So it's very hard to predict.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: And we said this before. We still don't understand, it may sound silly for us to say it but it's about the third or fourth time we've said it in public, we still quite don't understand the reasons for the difference in the pattern of profitability in our business versus the competition.</p><p>Now we don't report quarterly on profit numbers, but we do tell you that 40% of our profits or thereabouts have come in Q4. And it's one-third in the first half and two-thirds in the second half, which we reiterated in the release.</p><p>Just adding to Paul's comments. Functionally for this year, if you look at the budgets, advertising and media and digital lead the way. Just so we're clear on it.</p><p>Functionally just a little bit more detail on the BRICs, which I guess you're really focused on. Brazil will continue to be difficult, although we did well in Brazil last year, and Latin America. I think other countries in Latin America will continue to be difficult, although, as I said, I think Mexico, Argentina, Colombia will probably be better.</p><p>Russia will continue to be difficult unless we see some resolution on the Ukraine and sanctions.</p><p>India will continue to be very strong. We crossed $500 million of revenue in India last year. We will cross $600 million of revenue in India this year. But, obviously, there are questions raised as to whether Modi can keep it going.</p><p>China. Our view is that the growth rate is not 6.5%, 7%; that the economy is growing probably at about 3% or 4%. And I think that will be the situation again this year.</p><p>We had a strong January, actually, in China but it's very volatile. This time last year I think we had, if I remember rightly, a weak Q1 and a strong Q2, or maybe it was the other round. Anyway, it's very volatile so difficult to predict.</p><p>Now we've got the People's Congress at the moment. We'll be going to the China Development Forum in two or three weeks' time so we'll get a better view about what's happening there. But I think, overall, that's where we are.</p><p>Interestingly, if you look at the numbers from last year, the Next 11 the CIVETS and the MIST, as we describe them, actually did far better than the BRICs. They were very strong. So it's the smaller, Indonesia-type markets, Vietnam, Philippines, those markets have been quite strong.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Tom, Citigroup. The first question was on headcount. I know there were some distortions from outsourcing to IBM but headcount was down 2% underlying whilst revenue was up 3%. I'm just interested in whether that's just a mix effect between the different businesses. Or is there some sort of hidden productivity benefit from horizontality that we're not necessarily seeing?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: It's a nice idea. Maybe we can adopt it.</p><p>I think it reflects two things. One is the IBM IT agreement, where we have outsourced. The second thing is, I think, our people are very focused on managing the headcount to growth in revenues or net sales.</p><p>And that's the key, at the end of the day, the key thing. We know that when our headcount rises faster than revenues or net sales we get into trouble. And when it doesn't we know that we can manage the business effectively. And that applies to every one of the verticals on that horizontality matrix as well.</p><p>So I don't detect yet -- the benefits of horizontality are top-line benefits, really. We get access to better opportunities and we are in the midst of pitching a major horizontality thing this week for a major multinational company. And we'll see. We've got a strong leader on the account. It's well integrated. It's a very strong offer across everything that we do.</p><p>The pitch does not cover everything that we do but we've won recently media business in that case and creative, but there'll be some other opportunities. So we'll see.</p><p>But I think the benefits, Tom, are not so much on reducing the number of people or improving their effectiveness. It's really on the top line.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have one follow up, which is probably for Paul. It's on Xaxis. I think you've actually got a forecast for 2016 sales of $1.1 billion. I just wanted to double check two questions on that. One, is that net sales or revenues? And any detail on the growth --?</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: That would be the revenue number, which is the billings number.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Got it. Okay. And is there a 2015 base for that?</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: Well, they didn't meet the $1 billion brand diamond, which we were keen that they did. Let's put it that way.</p><p>(laughter)</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: So if you assumed about [$920 million,</p><p>$940million, something like that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay.</p><p>CHRIS COLLETT, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK RESEARCH: Chris Collett, Deutsche. I'm going to do some different and just ask one question, actually, and that's actually about acquisitions. So you made 50 acquisitions last year, indicating that it's going to be a similar\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: And investments. There were some tiddly ones. I don't one to diminish those tiddly ones but they were tiddly.</p><p>CHRIS COLLETT: So -- and you're indicating a similar sort of pace, perhaps, for this year. At what point do you get to the point where you can't really continue to add to meaningful growth to WPP through acquisitions without also then adding to the complexity of the Group and perhaps making it more difficult for that horizontality because there are so many new businesses coming in for people to learn about?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: One of the reasons that I put the horizontality matrix in, maybe too heavy but I don't know whether we can get it back on the screen, maybe we can get it back on the screen, actually, as long as those small, medium-sized acquisitions are grafted on to those, the problems occur not out of complexity, not when you add them on -- when you add them horizontally into separate sort of verticals, that's when the problems occur.</p><p>As long as you consolidate them in to an existing vertical, I don't think you do get more complex. You may find the Group complex, I don't. You can come -- we were just talking about this yesterday -- you can come to a review. In fact, I invite you to a review.</p><p>(laughter) It's two weeks every quarter in New York. You can come. I can reduce for you the whole thing to one sheet of paper. Correct? It's what we do. So one sheet of paper. It's not that complex.</p><p>So if you take this, you've got four, eight, 11 verticals there. Okay? And all run by people across the business. And then you have -- where there is, I think, more complexity, actually, is at the client leader/country regional manager.</p><p>I think it will get more complex to manage because we're trying to get more horizontal thrusted, if that's the right way of putting it, into the business. We're trying to get people to think not just vertically but take their blinkers off and look at things both at a client level and a country level in this way.</p><p>It will get simpler also if we can reduce the regional cost. The clients are certainly trying to take out regional costs; maybe because of zero-based budgeting, maybe because of technology improvements, maybe because McKinsey now recommends you can have a bigger horizontal span of control inside companies because things have improved technologically. I don't know. But it's not that complex.</p><p>Now, as long as you can graft on the acquisitions to each and every one of these companies, it's not that complex. And you don't increase the complexity. You'd increase the complexity if you increased the number of verticals.</p><p>By the way, you also create amazing problems if you start to muck about with the branding. That's when you start really to get -- because our people look at this and they're more attached to this. The clients are not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just back to three questions, if I may. Firstly, on the continued growth in Xaxis. You're talking about 20% growth at Xaxis. There was a survey out this morning from ANA saying that, of the marketers they're surveying, about 30% are wanting to bring more of the programmatic media buying and planning in house. And I was just wondering how you see that trend going ahead.</p><p>Secondly, just we talk a lot about Google and Facebook. I'm just wondering about your relationship with Tencent. I understand you've got better access to their data now.</p><p>And then, finally, and it's probably too early to give anything but just wondering if there's any indication on February, please?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: No. Go and ask everybody for January. Somebody wrote this morning, why are we giving out the January number? The answer is because we always do. Right? So as long you go away and get them all to give you January and every month and then we'll oblige. We don't even know what happened in February.</p><p>On programmatic, I find that statistic puzzling because our experience is there's less. And, in fact, what I think the press and the analysts, with all due respect, have not picked up is that people that used to do in-house media buying have gone out house. And, in fact, you look at the trends -- and our view is if people do go in house for programmatic, the technological demands and the people demands means it's very short lived.</p><p>But what's happening is so rapidly changing that you can't push the technology and improve the technology fast enough and people don't want to work on one client. On programmatic they want to do it across the board.</p><p>So if it is true, people often answer polling questions inaccurately, but if it is true, in our view it would be short lived.</p><p>The second thing is -- and, by the way, it was Xaxis' offer with Light Reaction and the changes or the additions they've made, give them tremendous flexibility. But, as Xaxis continues to strengthen and you look at Criteo, which is probably the nearest example to Xaxis, they continue to strengthen but, again, with the long tail rather than the short tail.</p><p>On Tencent we have a very, very important relationship with them. We'd like it to be even more important. We have access to their data. Ourselves and one other, it's Dentsu, actually, have access to their data. We've set up, with ex-Alibaba executives, an eCommerce company in Alibaba's home town. So it's not just Tencent but Alibaba too.</p><p>But the scale, on a worldwide basis -- we were looking at our top 20 media relationships and I don't think they get into the top 17, they would be actually 17 to 20. I think they're in that range. So smaller, global context but growing. And we would like to have more.</p><p>We do have two Chinese Board directors, Ruigang Li and Hugo Shong, which, I think, gives us a really good advantage in knowing what's going on in China.</p><p>Okay, if that's it, two hours and eight minutes.

Opportunistically looked for ways to increase pricing, which has helped to soften impact of declines in trading volumes and growth in off-exchange trading, which has impacted market share. 4. Two important issues impacting aforementioned businesses. 1. Financial transaction tax (FTT) in Europe. 2. Off-exchange trading in the US. 5. FTT: 1. Commission issued proposal on 02/14/13 for broad-based tax on equities, equity-like products, derivatives, bonds and others, which only applies to those member states but could have extraterritorial impact. 2. In terms of enhanced cooperation group, there is no agreement between 11 countries as to how tax will be collected, on what products it should be collected or how proceeds would be used. 1.

Given all these issues, Commission's implementation date of 01/01/14 seems optimistic. 4. Continues to be Co.'s view that this tax as currently outlined would likely destabilize European financial markets, negatively impact returns and increase fees for avg. investors and mutual fund owners, exactly wrong policy at wrong time. 5.

Richard Repetto, Sandler O'Neill.</p><p>RICHARD REPETTO, ANALYST, SANDLER O'NEILL &amp; PARTNERS: Good morning, guys. I guess the first question, Duncan, comes from your remarks on market quality. We know or at least it was reported in the media you have met with the SEC with some of the other exchange heads. I think I am aware of you meeting with even some companies as well. But when you talked about what are the remedies if one-third of the TRF volume is -- it looks like you are pointing towards the wholesalers, the other two thirds. What are the remedies besides a trade out rule that you see could bring back the market quality you're talking about?</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, </nameText></person>CEO, NYSE EURONEXT: I will start, Rich, and then I will let Leibo add to it as well. So we realize it is a complicated question. This didn't happen overnight. Our point that we keep trying to focus on is that it isn't just about dark pools. If we are talking about dark pools and those are block crossing networks that provide us significantly better customer experience that the public market may not be able to provide, I think there has to be a place for those in market structure in the US.</p><p>I think our bigger concern and to be clear we think it is going to have to be a combination of things that would get done. I don't think there is one single thing that would necessarily enhance the market quality but we feel like there is a degradation in market quality, the darker individual stocks seem to get the wider the spread seems to get. We don't think that is a -- we don't think that is a healthy trend and whether it is talking about some kind of a trade out rule that simply requires an internalizer to improve the customer experience in either size or price, the way they have done in Canada and are talking about doing it in Australia or thinking about a rethink of the access fees, there is a whole host of things that could be done.</p><p>We realize it took us a long time to get here, it is going to take us a while to kind of reverse the trend if it is even possible but I am encouraged by the fact that a lot of people are at least willing to come to the table to talk about it.</p><p>We are meeting with investors, we are meeting with a number of sell-side firms. We are all meeting together and having roundtables to talk about is there a better solution that would be better for the end clients and I am cautiously optimistic. Leibo, what would you add to that?</p><p>LARRY LEIBOWITZ, COO, NYSE EURONEXT: I think it is a pretty good summary. I just think that if you add up all the regulatory changes made over the last 10 years they have sort of caused just a natural competitive force that will drive more and more volume off exchange as other parties get more and more sophisticated about segmenting customer flow or recirculating flow before it gets to an exchange so that what gets to the exchange is lower and lower quality. And I think what we are really concerned about is it is not our market share. It is about what is the quality of the flow that comes to the exchange, how wide do the spreads get? Those sorts of things.</p><p>That is our main concern and we understand that this is going to be a balancing act where exchanges are going to have to give something and we are going to have to put this together in a piece that it makes natural sense for competition to find the right level.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Right, and look, we expect everyone to defend their business model and people should expect us to defend the same (inaudible). Right? Everyone is doing what they should do. So I think we are going to remaining engaged in this dialogue and we are happy to sit down with everybody and put other things on the table too if that is what it takes to strike the right compromise. Okay. Thanks.</p><p>RICHARD REPETTO: Got it. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Howard Chen, Credit Suisse.</p><p>HOWARD CHEN, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Good morning, everyone. Just with respect to the new global market data agreements coming into place, is your expectation still that the incremental revenue opportunity is about 10% additive on a full run rate? And if use and terminal count continue to trend a bit lower, how much does that eat into the potential upside?</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER, EVP AND CFO, NYSE EURONEXT: I will take the first part of that. In terms of the run rate, we have previously said that we expect the series of changes, the new products that we are launching, the price increases and the restructuring of the global data agreements including addressing the non-display access to generate a double-digit growth. Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: I think it is hard to predict where that trend is going to go. Remember that that is an overall industry issue. It impacts the size of the entire CPA pie not just specifically us but we are sort of dealing with that by being more aggressive, or balanced I would say in how we charge for non-display and the proprietary products we sell ourselves because we are developing a lot more of these proprietary products. So we expect that that would offset those things.</p><p>HOWARD CHEN: Understood. Thanks, Larry. Thanks, Mike.</p><p>OPERATOR: Chris Allen, Evercore.</p><p>CHRIS ALLEN, ANALYST, EVERCORE: Good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask on the information technology segment, just given the upcoming deal with ICE and some of the recent articles in the press about the potential looking at other partners which you guys acknowledge maybe some discussions there. Is it realistic to expect any large signing of agreements in that business until kind of the dust settles on that front, people can figure out who they are going to be dealing with longer-term?</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Sure. I think it is a really good question, Chris. I think what you are seeing here is an industry that is in transition. Our clients are going from buying products to trying to figure out how to rationalize large chunks of infrastructure. And the technology itself is in transition with more and more emphasis on cloud and virtualized computing and managed services, software as a service, things like that.</p><p>So to some extent, some of the hesitation you are seeing is that the things they are demanding are changing and the organizations themselves are trying to figure out the new solution. At the same time, our portfolio of solutions is changing to match that. Transitioning from the more traditional product-based to more of a solutions-based thing.</p><p>The backdrop of that, of course, is this ICE deal. So yes, I think that we are certainly going to get those questions and we would expect to get those questions. On the other hand, we are always looking to figure out what is the best combination of our portfolio with partners. That has been our way of doing things anyway, and you have a new management team in there led by Jon Robson that is really thinking about how do they provide the best solution set.</p><p>So I would expect that the industry is in transition but that we will start to see, and we are actually seeing, contracts signed. The results kind of hide some of the more traditional products are decreasing, while some of the new products are actually increasing. And we probably have to do a better job with you guys at showing the pipeline and showing that transition so you see how that transition is going, but we are signing new deals. It hasn't ground to a halt. And some of the new deals are actually larger deals and longer deals, and I would expect that that will continue.</p><p>CHRIS ALLEN: Thanks, guys.</p><p>OPERATOR: Alex Kramm.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM, ANALYST, UBS: Good morning. Maybe just to stay on the topic of what Chris just talked about on the technology business, can you maybe try to give a little bit more color on how you would break this business down or how this business breaks down in terms of what are the pieces that are actually really essential to an exchange like market data, how much do they account for?</p><p>And then on the other side when you talk to some of your customers, it seems like a lot of the pieces are not very well integrated and they don't really talk to each other as much. So do you actually think that there are some smaller components that are very easy to, I don't know, maybe throw into an auction and see some private equity holders would like to buy more? Do you think this business is actually more of a -- this has to go as a whole or stay together as a whole? Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: I can help you a little bit. As Larry mentioned, where we have discussed in the past, we restructured this business into three primary -- as the chart shows you -- three primary revenue segments, content, infrastructure, and liquidity and the two largest being content and infrastructure.</p><p>So in the content area is the proprietary market data, the data fee handlers, some of the software sales. In the infrastructure we have the connectivity, the safety services and the hosting and the [NYSX] business. In the liquidity we have the co-location services some of the market solutions we are doing for other exchanges and businesses like our (inaudible) operation in Japan.</p><p>So it is a pretty diverse segment. Clearly the larger area of growth for this year we are looking at is in content because that is where the market data initiatives are coming in but we have initiatives across hosting is where a lot of these managed services deals come in.</p><p>I think Larry was talking a little bit about the co-location and the connectivity that have both news sales and also some lower renewals at times but that is really how we break the business down into those three businesses.</p><p>LARRY LEIBOWITZ: Right. I think your observation that says that we haven't integrated some of these offerings is dead on and it is actually consistent with what I was saying about moving from a product based sale to an integrated solutions based sale. Some of that reflects the industry's attitude changing and some of it reflects that we need to do a better job of that and that is exactly what John and his team are working on.</p><p>I think speculatively we are going to sell various pieces off to private equity. The honest truth is it is in our competitors' interest to sort of fan those flames so that everybody thinks that these are weak assets. The truth is that most of our competitors are in a reasonable amount of transition themselves in this arena and I think that actually creates a lot of opportunity for natural providers of these solutions like we are because we have the market, we have the connectivity, we have the market data, we have a lot of the pieces that actually naturally sort of go into that and people would like to portray this as a weak position whereas I actually view it as a strong hand.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: I am going to add one more thing to that not to belabor the point. We think we have a pretty good idea of the origin of the leak last week. We actually think it was one of our competitors doing exactly what Larry just said like fanning the flame of uncertainty given the deal that is out there and then coming in behind and saying it is really hard to do something with those guys. I mean they are in a state of flux over there. It is like -- we are not in a state of flux just because a competitor says we are in a state of flux because it suits their marketing pitch.</p><p>So I am at a lot of these meetings, Larry is at a lot of these meetings. These are much more complicated discussions than a product sale. A product sale you show someone an a la carte menu they want one item or two. This is a much more comprehensive discussion about sharing infrastructure and things like that. So we are going to remain optimistic and we will remain focused and as we get closer to combining with ICE, we will be able to get the benefit of their input as well.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM: That is very helpful. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Niamh Alexander, KBW.</p><p>NIAMH ALEXANDER, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS: Thanks for taking my questions. If I could switch over to the clearing, so you are ahead of the deal -- even you are moving at the end of May as you previously guided. But can you walk me through how to think about the risk of clients, how easy can it be -- should it be for clients? There already is some technology overlap.</p><p>And then from the modeling perspective financially, doesn't this accelerate some of the cost savings? Does it accelerate maybe some impairments and some write-downs on some of the investment so far as well?</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: I will try to give you -- it is Duncan -- I will try to give you the outline on sort of what we are doing on the timeline and then Mike can talk a little bit about how that will translate to the results beginning in Q2 and what that means for what we have already spent on what we used to call Project Gemini, etc.</p><p>So as I said in my remarks, the project to move the UK derivatives piece from Liffe Clear to ICE Clear is on track to happen at the end of Q2 so it will be the end of June, not the end of May. We will be using May to sort of do member testing. We are collecting all of the Novation certificates now; that is all going very smoothly.</p><p>The nice thing about this transition is given that more than 90% of the clients who were connected to Liffe Clear were also connected to ICE Clear, there was very little migration risk. There were only a handful of clients that actually had to do a meaningful technology lift to get this done. The majority of clients were already connected and we are actually relieved that there was less work to do for them than there would have been had we proceeded down the Project Gemini route.</p><p>So we are highly confident that will happen by the end of June so we will be clearing at ICE Clear in the second half of the year and then Mike can talk to you about what that means for the kind of results going forward and what we are doing with the expenses that we had already put to work on Gemini last year and before.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: So the financial benefit of this transaction really twofold. Firstly, when we go live in the beginning of the second half, we will no longer be outsourcing the treasury and risk management with LCH and in turn we will be using ICE Clear and as we have indicated on the call, we will save annualized $30 million from that, $15 million in the second half.</p><p>The investment that we made in Gemini in our internal build last year prior to signing the ICE Clear agreement was all written off in the fourth quarter last year so there is nothing else on the balance sheet right now as it relates to that.</p><p>Secondarily we have the continental derivatives which we've talked about in the past that we today don't get any revenues or costs and we expect in the first quarter -- end of the first quarter 2014 to realize the revenues on that business and a healthy margin as we also bring that business -- execute that plan.</p><p>So two strong financial benefits second half of this year in 2014 coming from clearing.</p><p>NIAMH ALEXANDER: Okay, thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: We are going to wrap it there so Stephen, any -- we are going to give you the last word -- anything you want to do to wrap it up?</p><p>STEPHEN DAVIDSON, VP OF IR, NYSE EURONEXT: Thanks everyone for joining us and see you later.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: As always, the bit team will be available for any one on ones that people need throughout the day. Thanks a lot, everybody. Have a good day.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. That concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

Results: 1. Year started off pretty much as expected. 1. Revenue grew 17% from last year. 2. Core EPS grew 9% from last year due to incremental personnel costs needed to support growth expected in back half of 2014. 2. Dropped through some additional earnings, beating core EPS guidance of $2.70. 3. Organic revenue grew 8% driven by: 1. High single-digit organic growth at Epsilon. 2. Low double-digit organic growth at Private Label. 4. LoyaltyOne constant currency organic revenue growth essentially flat as AIR MILES redeemed dropped 4% vs. 1Q13. 5. BrandLoyalty: 1. Closed on 01/02/14. 2. Added approx. $112m in revenue. 6. Adjusted EBITDA net (reduced for funding cost and portion attributable to minority shareholders of BrandLoyalty) increased 3% vs. 1Q13, burned by higher payroll expense. 1. Estimates approx. $20m was development payroll. 1. It did not drive current period revenue; needed to support future revenue. 2. BrandLoyalty added about $14m of EBITDA, $9m net of non-controlling interest to 1Q which Co. believes will be seasonally lowest qtr. 3. Diluted share count was 66.1m. 1. Consistent with guidance. 2. With maturity of next and final tranche convertible debt in May, expects diluted share count to drop to approx. 63.1m for 2Q14.</p><p>1Q14 LoyaltyOne (B.P.) 1. Results: 1. Revenue $329m. 1. Increased 37% due to BrandLoyalty acquisition, which added $112m. 2. Fought through a couple of headwinds in core AIR MILES business as revenue declined 10% from 1Q13. 1. Canadian dollar down by about 8% from year-ago. 1. Lower translation rate dropped AIR MILES revenue by about $19m. 2. AIR MILES redeemed declined 4% from a year-ago. 1. Created revenue drag of about $6m. 3. Will likely face these kinds of headwinds throughout 2014. 3. Adjusted EBITDA: 1. 1Q14 $65m. 1. Increased 4% due to BrandLoyalty, which added $14m gross or $9m net to LoyaltyOne. 2. AIR MILES: 1. Down 10% from [1Q13]. 2. Essentially flat on constant currency basis. 4. Adjusted EBITDA margin: 1. AIR MILES, consistent between quarters at 26%. 2. BrandLoyalty 13%. 1. Believes Co. will definitely expand as year progresses. 2. AIR MILES: 1. Reward miles issued decreased 4% vs. 1Q13 due to weakness in consumer spending. 1. Some relate to timing of Easter holiday which landed in 1Q13 and doesn't actually land until 2Q14. 2. Some relate to regulatory changes, which are eliminating reward mile issuance from prescription purchases in some regions. 2. Expects full-year issuance growth to be in low-single digit rate for 2014, mostly due to: 1. Increased promotional spend. 2. Addition of new sponsors in back half of year. 3. AIR MILES redeemed decreased 4% due to reduced demand primarily for travel-related rewards. 4. AIR MILES Cash: 1. Instant reward program. 2. Gaining momentum with rollout of 300 plus IGA stores in Quebec. 3. Expects expansion of AIR MILES Cash offering to increase overall miles redeemed by approx. 3% vs. 2013. 3. Dotz: 1. 2014 priority is all about growth. 2. Excellent start to year. 1. Added 1.2m collectors. 2. Total collector count, 12m. 3. Plans to continue market expansion strategy in 2014 with target of four new markets by year-end, which would bring total market count to 13. 4. BrandLoyalty Acquisition: 1. LoyaltyOne acquired 60% stake in BrandLoyalty. 2. BrandLoyalty: 1. Based on Netherlands. 2. Employs over 400 associates in 14 offices globally. 3. Primary product offering, short-term loyalty campaigns that are run for grocery retailers in: 1. Europe. 2. Asia. 3. Latin America. 4. In the programs shoppers earn points using either digital or paper stamps for achieving spend thresholds during each shopping trip. 1. Points are then redeemed in-store for high quality merchandise that BrandLoyalty sources can distributes to retailer. 2. Through its subsidiary IceMobile, shoppers can download custom mobiles apps that add digital capability for earning and redeeming points and increasing customer engagement by targeted mobile messaging. 3. BrandLoyalty's programs are short-term in nature. 4. BrandLoyalty's turnkey programs are proven to drive increased visits to store and increased basket size, which results in measurable sales results and positive ROI for their clients. 5. Strategic benefits: 1. BrandLoyalty, one of two leading players in these types of short-term grocery promotions. 1. They have track record of double-digit organic growth. 2. Grocery retail key vertical for LoyaltyOne and BrandLoyalty. 1. Believes Co. can leverage existing relationships to grow BrandLoyalty platform in North America. 3. LoyaltyOne's advanced analytics capability and advisory services presents new product offering for BrandLoyalty customers, which will lead to future revenue synergies between organizations.</p><p>1Q14 Epsilon Review (C.H.) 1. Results: 1. Revenue $348m. 1. Increased 9%, all organic. 2. Technology led the way with 11% growth, supported by [50%] increase in database revenues fueled by expansion in both new and existing client base. 3. Email: 1. Part of technology. 2. Continues to be soft. 3. Believes next release of Harmony scheduled for 2Q14 will remedy this. 4. Harmony was recently ranked Number 1 by Red Pill Email for its features and functions; received perfect score of five in the categories of vendor security, queries and segmentation ease of use. 5. Preview of next release, which adds segmenting and multi-sound capabilities, has resulted in several new customer wins. 4. Agency: 1. Increased 9% vs. 1Q13 driven by continued strength in auto vertical. 2. In process of onboarding two new agency clients, which should contribute revenue as 2014 progresses. 5. 2014 outlook remains high single-digit organic revenue growth, supported by backlog which is up double-digits vs. same time last year. 6. Adjusted EBITDA net $55m. 1. Increased 1% vs. 1Q13 as higher healthcare cost attributable to higher associates participation rate, severance expense associated with integration of HMI and upfront expenses incurred to ramp up two potentially large new clients dampened revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA. 7. Positive about product cross selling opportunities generated from agency and continued roll-out of Harmony platform. 1. Could have done little bit better with expense control, more labor inefficiencies than Co. would have liked. 1. Some expense could not be avoided, given strong backlog and need to staff in advance. 2. Private Label: 1. Ninth consecutive qtr. of double-digit revenue growth. 2. Revenue $562m. 1. Increased 13% driven by 15% increase in avg. card receivables. 3. Organic revenue growth, 12%. 4. Adjusted EBITDA net $244m. 1. Increased 7% as revenue flow through was dampened by 26% OpEx increase vs. 1Q13. 1. This increase was expected as Co. added about 1,000 new associates, mainly in call centers to increase core capacity and prepare for future growth. 2. Expects leveraging OpEx as year progresses and Co. ramps up new clients. 5. P&amp;L: 1. Provision for loan losses increased 6% from 1Q13, primarily due to growth in credit card receivables. 2. Funding costs remained stable between years despite growth in receivables as Co. continues to replace maturing debt with cheaper, new debt. 6. Key metrics: 1. Total gross yields decreased 60 BP vs. 1Q13 due to impact of new programs. 1. Moving into 2Q, expects to see slight uptick in gross yields as this influence moderates. 2. Continued to pick up tender share as credit sales at core client, [meaning pre-2012 vintages] increased 7%, while overall client sales were about flat vs. 1Q13. 2. Normalized principal loss rates increased 20 BP to 4.9%, while delinquency rates increased 10 BP, both vs. 1Q13. 3. Based upon trends seen, expects stable-to-slightly improving principal loss rates for remainder of 2014. 4. Loan loss reserve: 1. Ended 1Q with 6% reserve rate; approx. 16 months of forward coverage. 5. Return on avg. assets 6.4% vs. 6.5% last year. 3. Liquidity: 1. Corporate liquidity at 03/31/14 $1.1b, after deploying over $300m on the BrandLoyalty acquisition and share buyback program in 1Q. 2. Debt levels remain modest with excellent debt service coverage ratios. 3. Had $345m convertible notes coming due in 2Q14, which Co. plans to cash settle. 1. Created little confusion in market, given that current settlement value of the convertible notes would be about $1.9b. 2. Working: 1. Co. pays $345m, face value of convertible notes. 2. Hedge counterparties pay $1.55b. 3. Noteholders receive total of $1.9b in cash. 3. Several months after debt maturity, has to settle the other side of hedge arrangement with counterparties, meaning the warrants. 1. At Co.'s current price, would issue approx. 5.1m shares to settle its obligation under warrants. 2. These shares are already included in diluted share count and [separated in apart] phantom shares. 4. Co. pays $345m in cash and issues 5.1m shares to settle convertible notes. 5. Guidance reflects all of aforementioned. 4. 2014 Capital Allocation Priorities: 1. M&amp;A will continue to be first priority. 1. Buyback program is still important. 2. YTD, spent $115m of $400m Board authorized program.</p><p>2014 Outlook (E.H.) 1. Details: 1. 1Q14 has got a lot of puts and takes and lot of moving pieces. 1. Pleased with organic growth rate of topline. 2. Feeling comfortable that this year Co. is going to run organically at 9%, maybe 10% and that would be in at least 3x GDP, which is Co.'s goal. 2. Believes from a revenue perspective, [talking 9%, 10% organic, 20% plus layering in] BrandLoyalty, topline looks strong this year. 1. Bumping up guidance accordingly on topline. 3. Expense: 1. Getting dinged with Canadian dollar is going to cost 50 or 60 on top and probably about $0.15-0.17 on EPS. 1. Believes Co. can play through that without a problem. 4. Strong organic top. 1. Overall top, 20 plus. 2. Seeing stronger revenue growth coming out of BrandLoyalty. 3. Looking at about $0.5b of topline looks like it will already be more like $550m. 5. Epsilon running little bit stronger than Co. had thought as is Private Label. 1. Taking those three, offset a little bit of it with the Canadian dollar and that's where Co. gets an upward bias in topline guidance. 6. Balancing act Co. is trying to accomplish this year, bringing on huge book of new business at Epsilon and Private Label. 1. Going to have to ramp up significant amount of folks. 1. Added another 1,000 people just in Private Label group to handle book of business that Co. signed last year and it is signing now. 2. This bodes well for back half of this year and going into 2015. 2. Needs to absorb it now without the topline against it. 3. That's a little bit of the drag seen in first part of year. 1. Feels comfortable that it is the right bet to make at the back half. 7. Based on where revenue is going, believes that Co. is right on track with where it wants to be. 1. Trending a little bit better. 2. Going to bump up guidance from $12.20 to $12.25 which will give Co. earnings growth of 22% for this year. 1. Believes this is probably conservative rate at this point. 2. Would hope to grip that number upwards as year progresses. 2. AIR MILES Program: 1. Expects constant currency revenue to be up in low-single digits and adjusted EBITDA to be up somewhere in mid-single digits. 2. Key metric, AIR MILES. 1. Cautioned people from trying to look at it on quarterly basis. 2. Looking at last year, issuance by qtr. was minus 3%, minus 5% then plus 11%, plus 12% and ended year at plus 4%. 1. This is pretty much what is going to be seen in this year. 2. Going to see this thing jump all over the place because a lot of it is driven by promotional spend. 3. Doesn't have visibility on quarterly basis as much as Co. does on annual basis. 3. Full-year goal, around plus 4%, plus 5%. 1. There is probably a point or so risk due to some legislation in couple of provinces regarding Co.'s ability to issue for when someone buys prescription drugs. 1. This could dampen growth in that metric a little bit. 3. BrandLoyalty: 1. Trending quite a bit stronger-than-anticipated. 2. Revenues are running stronger. 1. Bumping them up 10%. 3. Would expect their organic revenue growth to grow over 20% this year. 1. 9-10% organic growth excludes organic growth (inaudible) acquisition. 2. Organic growth for Co. would be even higher than that. 4. Brazil: 1. It's all about scale. 2. Looking back at 2011, was under 2m collectors. 1. 2012 6m. 2. Last year, ended just under 11m. 3. Up to 12m this year. 4. Expects to have strong year this year. 3. Looking to expand into four new regions. 4. Rule of thumb, would need about 2.5 Dotz collectors to be equivalent to about 1 AIR MILES collector. 1. Essentially in Canada, got about 10m folks and that generates $0.25b or so of EBITDA (inaudible) . 5. Epsilon: 1. Strong story from organic growth perspective. 1. Nicely balanced. 2. Database part or the technology part was quite strong, up double-digit during qtr. and should continue that. 1. Based on large number of builds that are going on now. 2. Brought on lot of folks for record number of databases that were signed last year. 3. Lot of this is again a continuing trend with folks wanting their own loyalty platform, their ability to collect that data on the consumer that can then be used for data-driven marketing. 4. Seeing strong demand for that. 5. If Co. typically signs about 15 of these type platform builds a year, last year it did 23 plus, this year it is currently running at that rate. 6. Scrambling pretty hard to can make sure Co. got folks on board to make that happen. 3. New Harmony platform: 1. Getting good reviews. 2. Will know probably by 2Q-end. 3. Is in process of converting some clients. 6. Private Label: 1. New client growth continues to surprise. 2. Historically, tends to sign about five new clients per year, which a bit under $400m of new portfolio growth or a vintage. 1. Most of Co.'s clients start from scratch. 1. It takes three years for them to fully mature. 2. $400m vintage means three years after signing. 2. This essentially gives tremendous visibility into next couple of years. 3. In 2012, there just seemed to be massive shift of interest from number of retailers and new verticals in retail for Co.'s particular product offering, which allows closed-loop network to pull out not just who the person is, but also information down to category or SKU level. 4. In 2013, shift continued to accelerate. 1. Signed first $2b vintage. 5. In 2014, tracking to another $2b vintage. 1. Announced Virgin, Venus, DSW and IDD. 1. Just these four should be about first $0.5b, when they fully spool up. 6. Has number of signings that will be releasing over next six months. 1. It looks like its going to another huge year. 2. This allows Co. to look into 2015, 2016, 2017 as these vintages spool up and be comfortable with type of growth rates that Co. wants. 7. Continuation in tender share growth: 1. If on a typical client, 30% of their sales flow through Co.'s card, that's probably pretty decent level. 2. Once the program matures at client, tends to grow or should grow at the growth rate of the client. 3. What Co. found during holiday season in 4Q and what it is continuing to see in 1Q is that this Private Label product is really beginning to take off in terms of probably the best type of loyalty tool that the retailer has. 1. Saw that in terms of comparing growth rate in card sales against growth rate in client sales overall. 8. First three months of this year, probably saw relatively flat sales growth in retail space. 1. Against that, core sales growth is more like 7%. 9. Credit card portfolio: 1. Did about 15% in 1Q. 1. This is going to accelerate. 2. Will be running around 20% as year rolls out. 2. Principal loss rate and funding rates pretty stable. 3. Not seeing blips here or there in terms of anything on the credit quality side, it looks good. 4. Brought on a ton of new folks, 1,000 plus people onshore, which will of course hit the expenses pretty hard until Co. has those programs ramped up and the revenue flowing through. 5. Mid-to-high teens growth in revenue. 6. Double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA. 7. Summary: 1. Ongoing shift of spend in marketing dollars from general brand spending into data-driven marketing and loyalty programs continues. 1. All three businesses continuing to see at high level of interest in every vertical. 2. Essentially has four pretty straightforward objectives for year. 1. Goal is to grow topline at 3x GDP, roughly 9%. 2. Expects overall revenue growth rate of 22% as Co. is seeing a bit stronger results on topline from BrandLoyalty, Epsilon and Private Label. 1. Got a little bit of offset with Canadian dollar. 3. Aforementioned will flow through to core EPS growth of 22%. 4. Expenses: 1. There is a lot frontloading going on both in Private Label and at Epsilon. 2. It's just the nature of those businesses that, Co. has to pay for it now and it starts flowing in a little bit later; this means that, it bodes well for future. 5. Building foundation for future, while on-boarding a record amount of new businesses. 3. Year is tracking a little bit better-than-anticipated. 1. Little bit choppy in 1H because Co. is building from 2H and into 2015, 2016 and 2017. 4. There has been a fair amount of volatility in the market to start up the year.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for your questions.</p><p>(Operator Instructions)</p><p>Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS: Just starting with Epsilon, the two new Agency deals that you guys spoke about, could you maybe just talk about when you on board the revenues are they're going to be significant incremental costs that you incur, or are most of those costs being incurred now and then the revenues come after? And maybe if you could give us a little bit more qualitative color on the nature of these two relationships, because they seem pretty sizable.</p><p>And then maybe just one on Private Label, could you just also talk about the M&amp;A pipeline? You have a player that's going public, and obviously Wells came into the market a little bit. So maybe you could just talk about how that M&amp;A pipeline is materializing. Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORP: Sure, let me start with the second and finish with the first. The M&amp;A pipeline, per se in Private Label, if you looked at the clients that we've signed, probably 90% plus of the clients that we're signing, they're are starting a program from scratch. So we're not really in the takeaway game from an M&amp;A perspective.</p><p>They will be one or two files probably per year that we will on board, and I would expect that to be the case this year as well. But for the most part, Sanjay, this stuff is coming from clients who either have had a program in the past and it's dead now and they're going to start cranking it up again, or folks that have never had one.</p><p>So I think in terms of running into the other folks, for the most, unless it's a really large file, I think we're comfortable in our sandbox. Our biggest challenge is trying to convince the prospect that the Private Label platform is the better loyalty option than other options. Of course, one of the other options is Epsilon, so it's a delicate balance there.</p><p>Speaking of Epsilon itself on the agency deals, we're beginning to see some traction in terms of selling through the stacks, so to speak. Which would be not only the creative and Agency side of it, but also allowing Epsilon to be the provider of things such as the demographic and psycho graphic data, the database build, as well as the analytics and distribution side of the business as well.</p><p>So, I'm not going to get into the specific clients themselves. But we are seeing some traction on that side. On the expense side, whenever you're in a strong -- when you're assigning a strong book of business, you're always going to have expenses that are running in front of the revenue, and that should even out as the year progresses.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Okay. And just one more on the Epsilon question, just is the opportunity to move some of those new relationships into the other lines as well? So will they materialize as revenue in database and technology as well?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, that's the game plan, or they could be a big tech client today, and we would try to sell in the Agency side.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Okay. All right, Great. Perfect. And then I just had one last one for Brian. Maybe you could just give us a little bit more of a refined window into Brazil. I guess, Ed, you mentioned the $25 million collector target to get to roughly the size of Canada. How do you guys get there from where you are right now? Because it seems like a lot of the you got thus far came from Banco do Brasil.</p><p>BRYAN PEARSON, EVP &amp; PRESIDENT - LOYALTYONE, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORP: Yes, I think they did come from Banco do Brasil, but they also came very much from the retail partners that we have in each of the regions that we've launched, Sanjay. So I would suggest the following. Is that, we've been doing a market by market rollout. We've been trying to get and look for a national sized grocery player, which would help us penetrate the two largest markets which are basically Rio and Sao Paulo.</p><p>So remember that we're now at 12 million customers in that marketplace, and we're not in the two largest cities in Brazil. There's still a number of markets there are left. So you can think about it three ways.</p><p>One is, we continue growing into new markets, as we've been doing, and that would take us on the pace and the cadence the we're on today. The second piece would be by adding additional partners to the mix. So whether that's a big grocer or a new fuel player or a bigger electronics player, whatever it may be, those will make the program more attractive and add even more customers from the existing markets we're in, but also lend us the opportunity to do the third thing which is really grow that national presence which would bring Rio and Sao Paulo into the mix.</p><p>That's the path to daylight. I think we're quite comfortable that we can continue at the pace of growth that we've been on in the last little while, and the focus for us right now is to build a very viable program in all the markets that we're in. Which, today, the collector activation, which would be the measure of how many points they're earning, are they redeeming, how many partners are they using. Those metrics are tracking quite nicely with what the early days were in Canada, and so we feel quite confident that we're on the right track in terms of the value proposition we have for the marketplace.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Darrin Peller with Barclays.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: If you could help us understand what may have surprised you with regard to your top line growth during the quarter versus your initial I think $1.25 billion guidance, maybe beyond currency? And then maybe you could just rank the key drivers enabling you to raise revenue guidance for the year, despite this quarter. And is it maybe just conservatism in the Private Label business that was going into the year, or is it that you had better than expected results in BrandLoyalty? And what other key variables should we focus on? Thanks.</p><p>CHARLES HORN, CFO, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORP: Darrin, in terms of the revenue, I'd say really came from two areas. One, FX of was a little bit worse than we anticipated, so you had a little bit more pressure coming through on LoyaltyOne. The second was, we just acquired BrandLoyalty, and initially probably were a little optimistic on terms of the revenue. But really, it's a sequencing issue, which is they're still going to hit there, as Ed talked about, we're actually going to have a very good year for BrandLoyalty revenue.</p><p>Where probably initially, we thought the revenue would be a little bit stronger in the first quarter than what it ended up shaking out. So I think it's just more of a timing issue for us, nothing more. The currency was a little more pronounced, BrandLoyalty timing issue on the revenue was still very strong for the year.</p><p>And then if you go through and look at why we feel better about the revenue stream, obviously Ed has already talked about BrandLoyalty going from $500 million to $550 million. Ed also talked about Private Label. We started the year with 15% growth on average receivables, now we're talking about 20%. So that's the upside you're seeing.</p><p>The third of it is, we did start off a little bit stronger with Epsilon, good high single-digit organic growth. Looking for some new clients to come through on Harmony, which could give a little upside to the back half of the year. And then, going back to Sanjay's point, as we do have these two to big clients ramping, if we get to a point of revenue growth where we can recognize it Q3, Q4 that gives upside to the year as well.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER: All right, that's helpful. So if we were to rank it, it sounds like it is basically the BrandLoyalty upside. Although it sounds like the first quarter was a little bit weaker, but you're still expecting that ramp up enough and see the evidence that it will ramp up enough to actually do better than you initially planned latter part of the year. Okay.</p><p>And then, Private Label, obviously you're looking at 20% versus 15%, and then those big deal still ramping in. All right, that's helpful.</p><p>Just on the credit quality side, one question. It seems like provisions were about $20 million or $25 million below your charge-off level in the quarter, which to the way we see you guys more in line or a little higher. Although, you also seem like, at least by our calculation, you're still over 100 basis points higher in terms of your allowance level than your charge-offs, which is still a really conservative cushion. Are we thinking about this correctly in the sense of how you want to keep that level going forward, or can give us a little guidance in terms of how we should think about your allowance levels for the rest of the year?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I think you're right Darren. In terms of the spread between the reserve rates and trailing charge-off rate, 100 to 110 bips is reasonable. Like we talked about, we're still looking at about 16 months forward coverage in terms of the reserve we currently carry. So that's obviously very robust when most card companies would carry more like 9 to 12 months worth of coverage. So I think we'll continue to be very conservative, or what I'll say, appropriate in that regard. Good forward coverage, good spread, think of it being in the 100, 110 points range.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER: Okay, very helpful. All right, thanks, guys.</p><p>OPERATOR: Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.</p><p>BRETT HUFF, ANALYST, STEPHENS INC.: Hello, can you guys hear me okay? Sorry about that. One quick -- just to put a little finer point on the guidance, Charles, I wanted to make sure I understood this. What was your expectation for the Canadian headwind in the prior guided range versus the I think it's $55 million now? And I'm just trying to balance that with it seems like the benefit of an extra $50 million or so we're going to get from BrandLoyalty.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: So, when we came out with our guidance last quarter, were assuming the Canadian dollar would be about CAD0.94. Now we think the Canadian dollar will be more like CAD0.91 for the year. Now, the headwinds we face will be throughout the full year, but it's worse in the first quarter and lightest in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So what we saw was a little bit more of a negative impact in Q1 than we had anticipated. We have taken it down a little bit for the year, which is obviously included in our $12.25 core EPS guidance. But again, as the year goes on, it abates in terms of the amount of the headwinds.</p><p>BRETT HUFF: That's helpful. And can you talk about -- a little bit more on the Epsilon front-end loading? I think you called out in the press release $2 million, but it sounds like it might be a bigger project than that. And somebody already asked that question, but I just want to know a little bit more on is it $2 million, or is there more ancillary stuff in there that's harder to quantify? We thought the profitability would be better at Epsilon, and I'm trying to understand what's going on there.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I guess I'd considered it more direct costs we're incurring to roll out the platform with these clients. Again, if it's a large client and it's technology platform in this case software we're rolling out, it takes number of months to get rolled out. During that timeframe, we're incurring the expense, the direct expense, to do the rollouts but we're deferring the revenue stream until it really gets up and ramped.</p><p>So what you're seeing now is deferrment on the expense, expense we have to incur to get the technology platform rolled out. But then when we get to the point of recognizing the revenue stream in Q3, Q4, then you can see the leveraging coming through and a little bit obviously the EBITDA margin contribution.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, I think one of the things that we're beginning to see now given the size of Epsilon with north of 5,000 people, is that when you're signing 23 new deals a year on platforms and stuff, you've got to bring in a lot of folks. And these are what we call, folks who have the hot skills where were competing with the other folks out there, the Googles and Facebooks and stuff like that for the same talent.</p><p>And so getting those folks, getting them in the door, and getting in the size of the labor force that we need, it's becoming something that is now more of a challenge than it was when we were a lot smaller, I'll tell you that. And so, we will probably air on the side of getting a little bit more in the door sooner rather than later to make sure we have the pool available.</p><p>BRETT HUFF: And then one last question, I think, Ed, you'd talked a little bit about Private Label going forward, and it sounds like you're spending time there. And I think the last call, you had said the 2015 Private Label spots to start implementing were starting to look a little scarce. First of all, I want to make sure that I'm remembering that right. And if so, can you give us your sense of that same view today?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, in terms of 2014, obviously, we're all booked up and it's straining the resources a little bit at this point. And so we probably -- we are drifting into slots for 2015 already, to your point. I would say we could probably launch up to at most 20 clients in a given year, given that we used to do five.</p><p>I'd say folks have done a spectacular job giving us that capacity, but I would say 20 is about it. And it goes back to the overall theme that we've been talking about which is organic top line is very strong. Revenue is very strong. We're going to flow through enough of it to give us the 20% plus earnings growth.</p><p>Our real issue this year is not going to be bringing in top line and organic growth. Our biggest issue this year is on execution and making sure that with these record books of businesses, especially at Epsilon and in Private Label, that the machine doesn't break down frankly. And that's where we're putting all of our efforts.</p><p>In terms of the year itself, I think the financials are in very good shape for the year. There may be a couple of minor tweaks as the year unfolds, hopefully to the upside. But we are 100% focused right now on just handling the two books of business that we've signed, and getting those on without things fraying at the seams.</p><p>BRETT HUFF: Great. Thanks for your time.</p><p>OPERATOR: David Togut with Evercore.</p><p>DAVID TOGUT, ANALYST, EVERCORE PARTNERS: Thank you, and good morning. Could you comment on the unit pricing outlook for Private Label, Epsilon, and LoyaltyOne for this year and next year?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I'm not sure exactly what you mean David. I'll probably answer a little bit differently. If you were looking at EBITDA margins, we're looking probably for stable to maybe slightly up at LoyaltyOne AIR MILES. Obviously, well see some improvements coming through on BrandLoyalty as the year progresses. For Epsilon EBITDA margins, probably flat to maybe up slightly.</p><p>For Private Label, just because we'll have a little bit of a reserve build associated with the growth, you'll probably see a little bit of EBITDA margin compression in the Private Label space. Is that where you're going David?</p><p>DAVID TOGUT: That's helpful. And to follow that up, in the Private Label space, I'm curious if you're seeing any change in unit pricing as you compete for some of these new awards, or have most of these awards that you highlighted in the quarter really been sole sourced?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I wouldn't say we're seeing really any pricing pressure in that regard. If you look through the year, we're saying that gross yields may be down as much as 40 basis points. If I take out the ramp of the new programs, the required programs, basically flat to maybe slightly up.</p><p>So that would tell me really what you're seeing is the influence of the growth, not the influence of pricing pressure coming through on re-signing some deals or some of the programs that we have. Really it's just the ramp you're seeing.</p><p>DAVID TOGUT: That's helpful. And just a quick final question on the Co-Branding side. Could you update us on your strategy in Co-Branding?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. I think that one of the things we're trying to do in our Private Label business is to diversify a little bit away from our traditional verticals, which would be soft goods, jewelry, home furnishings. And so Co-Brand, the choice of whether to use Private Label or Co-Brand is really up to the client.</p><p>And what we've found is there are certain verticals where Co-Brand works best, and specifically that would be T&amp;E, hospitality. Those are the areas where there's a huge amount of interest in just having Co-Brand. So if you see an announcement in those areas, so for example with Caesar's or with Virgin America, something like that, those are going to be the Co-Brand space. The majority of our business will always continue to be Private Label, but there is a slot that's opening up for Co-Brand.</p><p>DAVID TOGUT: And then on that point, to what extent can you extract SKU level data from a Co-Brand card?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. It's the same gig. It's actually what you do is because we are the merchant acquirer and the issuer for Co-Brand, if the transaction takes place at that retailer, clearly, we can extract the same type of information as long as the merchant once again agrees to give us that information.</p><p>For purchases outside of the retailer, we can't get that level of information. We could probably only get where you went and how much you spent at the location. So for stuff that takes place at the retailer, we can get the same level of information, that's the deal with the merchant. And outside of that, we're stuck with just total dollars being spent.</p><p>DAVID TOGUT: What percentage of purchases on Co-Brand typically occur at the retailer on the card versus outside of that?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I don't know David, I don't have that stat.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: It's all over the place.</p><p>DAVID TOGUT: Okay, thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: David Scharf with JMP Securities.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Morning, thank you. Two areas. First, on Epsilon, wanted to follow-up on earlier questioning about cross-selling. Has there been a history thus far of moving any Agency clients to become data and technology clients, or is there a track record over the last couple of years since you've entered the Agency business?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: It hasn't been nearly as strong as it should be. A lot of that has to do with we really just finished, I think when you're talking about last year, the organizational changes at Epsilon. Where as before, we sold by product. So you would have someone responsible for the agency P&amp;L, someone else responsible for technology, someone else for distribution, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>We rearranged everything so that now the P&amp;L is by vertical. So if you are in the auto vertical, your P&amp;L responsibilities are now cut across all the products. And as result, your comp is cut across all the products. And we have found that when you tie your comp to that type of goal, that that tends to move the needle.</p><p>So I would say that you had a smattering of deals last year. This year, we're beginning to see much more sellthrough, and it goes both ways. It goes Agency clients, which are now going into the technology side, and technology going upstream into Agency. I would say this year and next year should be significant years for the sellthrough.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Got it, that's helpful. And then secondly, turning to Private Label, that was helpful commentary on the yield outlook. Maybe there's more type of question to answer, it's more qualitative or macro driven.</p><p>But setting aside the near-term headwinds on gross yields just because you're boarding on more new clients, you have to build bigger reserves. Can you give us a sense for whether gross yields are still running below ignoring the new client aspect, whether gross yield are running historical peaks just based on the percentage of your yield that's coming from late fees.</p><p>I'm just trying to understand whether or not as we think about ultimately where that portfolio can trend, whether it's still, let's say, more of a prime portfolio, or a higher credit score portfolio than you actually like? Just trying to understand what key profitability can be, and whether late fees are still representing about a third of gross yield, or if payment rates are still too high.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I think if you take out the influence of the new program, it's right around to where it is. It is about we'd want it to be. To put it another way, we're not really trying to push it up or push it down.</p><p>You'll have some influence that's coming through there, David. Obviously, we have an APR tied to prime rates. So if you see short-term rates go up, then you're going to see the APRs go up, so you're going to see a little bit of float there naturally. The increase in APR offsetting the increase in funding costs.</p><p>The flip side of it is that, obviously, we are doing a little bit more Co-Brand than what we did in the past. Co-Brand is going to carry a little bit lower gross yield than what a typical PLCC would. So I'd say, [investing] for those will be somewhat static.</p><p>But those will have an influence on a go-forward basis that it's hard for me to really answer your question exactly. We do have a prime portfolio, we'll endeavor to keep it that way. Going back even 2007, we've kept our underwriting standards very consistent. Approval rates now are still pretty low for us, we could [exceed] them to come up over time as people repair their credit. But aside from the two [fedras] I talked about, I don't any impetus to make it to go up or down.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Very helpful, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY, ANALYST, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY: Good morning, thank you for taking the question. Ed, I appreciate the color on the pipeline, and it sounds like demand is strong across your businesses. I've been following Alliance for a while, and I certainly have less than perfect memory. But I can't remember a time when you called out 1,000 new employees in a call center, for example.</p><p>Can you just frame up for us how you balance visibility? And I think you mentioned a couple of potential large customers at Epsilon suggesting that they're not signed. Can you just frame up the balance between the front end loaded investment, and perhaps the risk on either timing of new deals coming on this year? Or the risk that you don't win the contracts that you think you're going to win, and how you frame that up in the context of your real confident second half outlook?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. You hit the nail on the head. It's a balancing act. What we're finding is that really especially at Epsilon and Private Label, you're just seeing more demand, more demand, and more demand, which is, as we say, a great problem to have.</p><p>I think hiring 1,000 people at Private Label, we need those folks up and running. We need the call centers built. We need the space provided well in front of these clients spooling up.</p><p>I think the messaging here is that none of this is hiring on spec. We're hiring folks based on deals that have been signed. So in the case of Private Label, as we said, we've got 20 new folks, 20 new clients spooling up this year. The backlog looks very strong, and at Epsilon we've got 23 big platform builds going on this year and getting those people in the door. That's the big challenge, and we're going to try to match delivering 20% earnings growth this year, at the same time not letting business fall through the cracks so we can have strong growth outlook for 2015 and 2016.</p><p>It's a long-winded way of saying it's a balancing act. It's a good problem to have, but it doesn't take much either way to get your expenses to shoot out of control for a quarter or two. And we want to make sure that doesn't happen.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY: Okay. And you guys have a good track record of forecasting your business. One last one, if I might, just with regard to the loyalty business generally. When you step back and look at the traditional AIR MILES business versus some of the other things you're doing, whether it's BrandLoyalty or the cash rewards business in Canada or certainly the growth in Brazil, would you frame that up at all as a changing of the guard or a maturation of your loyalty business generally? Or is that too dramatic a comment?</p><p>BRYAN PEARSON: Let's put it this way. The program is 22 years old. When you've got a business that's been running for that long, and you've got 70% of Canadians participating in the program, you could look at it and say is it in a maturing phase as a business overall. And I think that you could put that color on it. The reality is, that we still see a lot of opportunity in that business for growth.</p><p>Is a going to be a strong double-digit growth in the future? No. Does it have the potential to be mid- to high single-digit as you go forward? Yes. And do we have some things that we put in place that will help us get there? And the answer to that is yes.</p><p>We probably had the best year of signing new partners that we've had in years last year. If you look at that 10 million households, there's a portion of them that they're very engaged in the program, and there's a portion of them that are using some sponsors but they're not holistically engaged in the program and using it as their primary reward vehicle.</p><p>And so, we see opportunity to continue to add sponsors in categories, to continue to basically add -- to continue to add more cross sponsor activation, as we would say. In other words, a measure of engagement. And as a result of that, we think that there's opportunities with things like the cash program to change the nature of what our growth pattern has been over the last few years.</p><p>I think as much as anything, Canada has had an anemic spending environment for probably the better part of 18 months now. And I think the consumer is cautious in terms of how they're spending, and so a little bit of economic recovery and a little bit of these other strategies will get us back to a healthier outlook going forward.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY: That's great, thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Okay, I think that wraps it up, and we'll talk to you next quarter.

Highlights:</p><p>1. Results were pretty much as expected.</p><p>2. Revenue $1.68b, up 5%.</p><p>3. Core EPS $3.84, up 5%.</p><p>4. FX rates reduced both revenue and core PS by about 2 points.</p><p>1. FX rates seem to have stabilized and the drag could drop to near zero in 2H16.</p><p>5. 2016 Outlook:</p><p>1. Expects growth in each qtr. to accelerate as 2016 progresses.</p><p>2. 1Q16 revenue growth of 5% is expected to increase to 8% in 2Q16, and then double-digit growth in 3Q16 and 4Q16.</p><p>1. Adjusted EBITDA and core EPS are expected to follow a similar trend.</p><p>3. Gross yield compression at Card Services should lessen each qtr. as Co. anniversaries several programs changes made last year.</p><p>4. Loss rates are expected to drift downward from 1Q highs.</p><p>5. BrandLoyalty has passed its most difficult comparable.</p><p>1. In 1Q15, revenue was up over 100% on constant-currency basis.</p><p>6. Epsilon's agency weakness should lessen, coupled with a record CRM backlog for 2H delivery.</p><p>6. Acquired 2m shares under repurchase program for approx. $414m.</p><p>1. Buyback program remains top capital allocation priority.</p><p>1. Expects to execute somewhat ratably over remainder of 2016.</p><p>2.

On constant-currency basis:</p><p>1. Revenue $381m, decreased 2%.</p><p>2. Adjusted EBITDA $85m, increased 10%.</p><p>3. AIR MILES (constant-currency):</p><p>1. Revenue increased 4% and adjusted EBITDAR increased 11%, driven by:</p><p>1. Favorable issuance mix.</p><p>2. Prudent cost controls.</p><p>4. BrandLoyalty (constant-currency):</p><p>1. Revenue down 9% due to program timing differences.</p><p>2. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% due to higher margin programs that were driving a 300 BP expansion in adjusted EBITDA margins.</p><p>5. AIR MILES issued increased 5% or 57m miles over 1Q15.</p><p>1. Issuance was particularly strong with financial vertical as Co. continued to convert BMO MasterCard holders to the premium World Elite card that has a more compelling consumer proposition and higher [AIR MILES earn] offer.</p><p>2. Growth was achieved despite economic uncertainty in Western Canada due to declining global oil prices that has been negatively impacting activity at grocery partners and also the suspension of point issuance on prescriptions in British Columbia.</p><p>3. Anticipates 2% decline in issuance growth for 2Q16 due to reduced promotional activity and one-time conversion of Sobeys' program that happened in 2015, which would not be repeated.</p><p>4. Quarterly results can vary based upon timing of promotional activity.</p><p>1. Target remains full-year issuance growth of mid-single digits.</p><p>6. AIR MILES redeemed increased 6% vs. 1Q15.</p><p>1. AIR MILES Cash program (instant reward option) drove approx. half of the increase as its liquidity feature resonates with collectors in current macro-environment.</p><p>2. For full year, anticipates redemption growth to be in line with issuance growth.</p><p>7. Anticipates full-year constant-currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for AIR MILES to be in mid-single digit range.</p><p>2. BrandLoyalty:</p><p>1. Anticipates strong 2Q16.</p><p>1. Revenue could be up as much as 50% on constant-currency basis.</p><p>2. North American expansion:</p><p>1. Continues to increase presence in Canada with six promotions planned for 2016.</p><p>1. Represents significant increase in sales over last year.</p><p>2. Launched first pilot in US late in 1Q16.</p><p>1. Looks forward to additional programs.</p><p>3. Full-year expectation continues to be mid-teens constant-currency growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA vs. 2015.</p><p>3. Dotz:</p><p>1. Co.'s Brazilian coalition program.</p><p>2. Seeing steady growth in collector base to over 18m currently.</p><p>3. In Nov. 2015, successfully launched the coalition program in Rio de Janeiro with Cencosud grocery banner called Prezunic as a key partner.</p><p>1. Cencosud is the third largest grocer in Brazil.</p><p>2. Collector reception has been positive with over 1m collectors now enrolled and active in Rio.</p><p>4. Precima:</p><p>1. Co.'s data analytics unit.</p><p>2. Recently signed a deal with Morrisons, one of UK's top 4 grocers.</p><p>5. Summary:</p><p>1. Solid results.</p><p>2. Positive outlook for remainder of 2016.</p><p>1Q16 Epsilon Results (C.H.)</p><p>1. Overview:</p><p>1. Revenue $493m, decreased 2%.</p><p>2. Adjusted EBITDA $81m, decreased 22%.</p><p>3. Results were mixed as three-fourth of the business, Digital &amp; Technology Platforms, grew 8%.</p><p>1. Remaining one-fourth (inaudible) with revenue declining 23% vs. 1Q15.</p><p>4. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $23m from 1Q15, primarily due to higher payroll costs.</p><p>1. Staffing levels increased in anticipation of revenue that is yet to occur.</p><p>2. New Reporting Format:</p><p>1. Digital &amp; Technology Platforms consists of businesses which is primarily derived from revenues tied to one of the many core data and to technology platforms that Epsilon and Conversant manage.</p><p>2. Remainder of business, Agency Media &amp; Services, consist of services which are primarily focused on supporting the agency sector, both media services delivered to agencies on behalf of their clients as well as agency engagements in which Epsilon acts as the primary agency directly on behalf of its clients.</p><p>3. Digital &amp; Technology Platforms:</p><p>1. Revenue grew by $28m YoverY, or about 8%, mostly due to continued success of the cross-sell efforts and on-boarding of strong CRM backlog within Conversant.</p><p>2. Products offered within the CRM business continue to resonate with both new and existing clients.</p><p>1. 15 new contracts have already been signed this year vs. 30 all of last year.</p><p>3. 2016 vintage thus far includes GNC, Brooks Brothers, Coach and Sears.</p><p>1. Great follow-up to last year's efforts.</p><p>2. These clients, along with others like Walgreens, are connection with real people as a result of combining [anonymized] first-party with third-party data and 80b daily online interactions to develop a persistent consumer ID.</p><p>4. Agency Media &amp; Services:</p><p>1. Revenue declined 23% from 1Q15.</p><p>2. For traditional agency business, saw broad-based weakness, especially in telco, CPG and retail verticals.</p><p>3. Agency business at Conversant, which is the non-data driven traditional display business, was down as large agencies pushed more programmatic buying through their internal trading platforms versus using third-party DSPs.</p><p>4. Will likely continue to see volatility within agency on a quarterly basis.</p><p>1. A key part of the CMO selling process, which attracts more broad and less IT centric relationships.</p><p>1Q16 Card Services Results (C.H.)</p><p>1. Overview:</p><p>1. 17th consecutive qtr. of double-digit revenue growth.</p><p>2. Revenue increased 17%, driven by 27% increase in avg. receivables.</p><p>3. Adjusted EBITDA net grew 9%, dampened slightly by provision build.</p><p>4. Principal loss rates 5.2%, 10 BP better than original guidance.</p><p>2. Key Drivers for Growth:</p><p>1. Credit sales increased 25%, driven by Co.'s proven ability to build customer loyalty for both longstanding and newest brand partners, as well as favorable weather and an early Easter.</p><p>2. Core business, brand partners with Co. for four years or more, continues to contribute roughly 50% of credits sales growth.</p><p>3. Continues to grow tender share, up over 200 BP, by leveraging Co.'s large understanding of its brands along with a deep data analytics Co. brings to bear.</p><p>1. Most of the tender share pickup is being driven by card members who have been engaged with a card for multiple years, not from new accounts.</p><p>4. Revenue grew 17%, driven by the strong AR growth.</p><p>5. Realized strong OpEx leverage as Co. was able to drop expense ratio by 70 BP.</p><p>6. Gross yields experienced some compression, driven primarily by brand mix, accounting for acquired files and lower late fees as Co. has several declines for several months in first-stage delinquency bucket.</p><p>1. This pressure is predominantly in 1H of the year.</p><p>2. Expects yields to normalize as Co. anniversaries these items.</p><p>7. Managing losses was key in 1Q16.</p><p>1. Exceeded guidance previously outlined.</p><p>2. Losses, delinquency levels and funding costs were all in line with both expectations and seasonal trends.</p><p>8. Decided not to renew two card programs coming up for renewal at year-end.</p><p>1. Related receivables, net of allowance for loan loss, have been reclassified to assets held for sale at 03/31/16.</p><p>2. $430m has been removed from card receivables and $15m has been removed from allowance for loan loss.</p><p>9. Reserve for loan losses was 5.7% of reservable receivables at 03/31/16, up from 5.5% at 12/31/15.</p><p>10. Reserve dollars dropped by $15m from 12/31/15 due to the reclassification previously discussed.</p><p>3. Summary:</p><p>1. All key metrics:</p><p>1. Outpaced industry.</p><p>2. Consistent with expectations.</p><p>2. Positioned for another record year, in line with strategy of 20% plus credit sales and AR growth, leveraging both organic growth and new partnerships.</p><p>1Q16 Business Review (E.H.)</p><p>1. Overview:</p><p>1. Toughest qtr.</p><p>1. Comp vs. last year was difficult.</p><p>2. Plus 5% top, plus 5% earnings.</p><p>3. View into the rest of the year looks solid.</p><p>4. Moving into 2Q16 and rest of the year, things are accelerating nicely.</p><p>1. Has good line of sight into rest of the year.</p><p>5. Consolidated, came write in where Co. said in terms of guidance at about $1.7b top and about $3.84 on earnings.</p><p>1. Got hit on FX side; about $26m in top and about $0.05 on earnings.</p><p>1. If it holds, will start to anniversary moving into 2H16.</p><p>6. Toughest comp of the year is now behind Co.</p><p>7. Pretty active in buyback, taking in a bunch of shares which co. thought were pretty cheap.</p><p>8. Overall, consolidated, got where Co. wanted to be.</p><p>9. Remain on track for the year.</p><p>2. Card Services:</p><p>1. Portfolio continues to grow quickly with over 20% growth, revenue in high-teens.</p><p>2. Due to the fact that Co. is growing so quickly, needs to set up reserves.</p><p>1. That tends to be a damper on EBITDA.</p><p>1. Nonetheless, that grew 9%.</p><p>3. Yield, a little over 200 BP due to multiple factors.</p><p>1. Already beginning to burn away.</p><p>2. Expects less compression as each qtr. goes by for the year.</p><p>1. Has good visibility into that.</p><p>2. More of a 1Q issue.</p><p>4. Loss rate:</p><p>1. Credit quality came in a little bit better than anticipated.</p><p>1. Expects it to drift downwards as the year progresses from a seasonally high 1Q.</p><p>2. Normalizing loss rates in the file.</p><p>1. Right now, Co. is tracking nicely to that.</p><p>5. Tender share:</p><p>1. Tender share up 200 BP.</p><p>2. If 30% of the sales at a retailer were on Co.'s card a year ago, now it's 32%.</p><p>1. Not being moved by putting on a bunch of new accounts.</p><p>2. When the retailer is growing 2%, 3%, Co. is growing 10%.</p><p>3. First 10 points of portfolio growth are coming from deeper penetration of that retailer sales base.</p><p>3. 80% of tender share gain is coming from mature accounts, accounts that have been Co. for 20-24 months or more.</p><p>6. Pipeline:</p><p>1. Expects another year of $2b in new vintages.</p><p>2. Has a bunch that have been signed haven't been released.</p><p>1. They will be released over the next couple of quarters.</p><p>3. Epsilon:</p><p>1. Focused on some weakness on the Agency side, which is about 25% of Epsilon/Conversant.</p><p>1. Saw a general pullback in a number of the verticals.</p><p>2. Digital &amp; Technology Platforms up 8%.</p><p>1. 75% of Epsilon/Conversant.</p><p>2. Seeing strong take-up in terms of the data-driven targeted display offerings from Conversant.</p><p>3. Number of wins that Co. is seeing right now are already half of what they were for the entire year last year.</p><p>4. India office is up and running.</p><p>1. Continuing to staff that up as the year progresses.</p><p>2. Will finally begin to move the needle on expense side towards the latter part of the year.</p><p>4. LoyaltyOne:</p><p>1. BrandLoyalty is a choppy businesses.</p><p>1. Had a little bit better 1Q from EBITDA perspective than Co. had initially talked about.</p><p>2. 1Q15 revenue was up 100%.</p><p>1. Was down in 2Q15.</p><p>2. Will have strong 2Q16, driven by when the grocers have decided to put the programs on the calendar.</p><p>3. Expansion into North America:</p><p>1. Canada is doing quite well and moving nicely towards goal.</p><p>2. In US, beginning to make some nice inroads.</p><p>2. AIR MILES:</p><p>1. In Canada, issuance was very strong, specifically issuance in the financials services space, which had been lagging before, actually came back quite strongly.</p><p>2. Revenue and EBITDA; plus 4%, plus 11% constant-currency basis.</p><p>1. Best in years.</p><p>5. Summary:</p><p>1. In Cards group, yields were a little bit worse than anticipated, but losses were a little bit better.</p><p>2. At Epsilon, Digital &amp; Tech Platforms remained on track.</p><p>1. Agency Media was weak.</p><p>1. That was offset by the fact in LoyaltyOne that AIR MILES was better, while BrandLoyalty was tracking.</p><p>3. Pluses and minuses will hopefully even out to get to double-digit growth rate for the year.</p><p>6. Full-Year 2016 Outlook:</p><p>1. Reiterating guidance:</p><p>1. Revenue $7.1b, up 10%.</p><p>2. Earnings $16.75, up 11%.</p><p>2. Slowest qtr. is behind Co.</p><p>3.

For 2016 and 2017, as losses normalize and with the huge growth in the file, setting aside reserves for future losses.</p><p>1. Still looking at low and double-digit growth rates in top and bottom.</p><p>1. This year, looking at 10% and 11%, and that includes some drag from FX.</p><p>2. In 2018, if these rates have stabilized, it would snap right back to the prior model and would have a re-acceleration in growth rates.</p><p>12. Long-term, looking somewhere mid-teens to high-teens revs and core EPS.</p><p>1. In a period of externalization and building reserves, looking at low-end top and bottom double-digit, and snap back to sort of mid-teens when that normalizes.</p><p>13. Keeping the guidance the same.</p><p>1. Looks pretty solid at plus 10%, plus 11%.</p><p>1. That puts organic growth rate actually quite a bit above 3 times GDP target.</p><p>14.

When it comes to FX and all that other stuff, will adjust it when it becomes meaningful as the year plays out.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)</p><p>Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS, INC.: My first question is on the agency side of Epsilon. Charles, you mentioned that you are not sure if it is structural or not, in terms of the weakness there. And maybe Ed or Charles, you could talk about it a little bit more. Is that weakness specific to Epsilon? Or are others seeing similar weakness? Obviously adjusting for maybe one or two large clients that have unique issues?</p><p>CHARLES HORN, CFO, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION: It is a good question. Don't know enough yet at this point. We do know -- I can only say what happened in our business, which was, across a number of our verticals, CPG and Telco and retail, it was interesting, we also have pulled back in Q1. It looks like it is beginning to trickle back in, as we start moving into Q2, but it still little bit soft.</p><p>So we don't want to call it yet, but it seemed like a lot of people just stepped on the brakes in Q1. So I just don't know what the others are seeing out there right now, Sanjay. But from us, it looks like Q1, people just pulled back. And then as we're looking at Q2, it looks like it is beginning to loosen up a little bit. And so if it continues to loosen up, we are not going to need to take any action. If it continues to stay soft like this, we are going to have to take some internal actions.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: And I assume you are assuming continued softness for the rest of year in your guidance?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: We are assuming, for the three-quarters of Epsilon and Conversant that's the tech and digital and everything else, we assume they're going to continue to be quite strong at about plus 8. And then on the agency side, to your point, we are assuming in our guidance that it will be soft, but not nearly as soft as Q1.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Got it. And than just second question, my final question. Just on those two portfolios that you chose -- or that are not renewing in card, could you just talk about how that unfolded? Why? And how tenured were those relationships?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT AND CEO, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION: Yes, this gets. It is a good question, and we are at the point now where we've got the business growing, the files growing 25% a year, which is pretty much -- we don't want to drift much higher than that. But we are also finding that the pipeline -- the number of opportunities that are out there, as people shift their dollars to the data-driven targeted spend, frankly, there's a whole bunch of business out there. And there are times in the past where we've had some clients who have decided not to pour all their energy and efforts into driving tender share growth and card growth.</p><p>That usually comes with a change in management. Other times, it's a change in strategy. And normally, we've just said, that's fine, we will go with the flow. Right now, we are dealing with, how do we allocate our capital? And if we want to continue to grow the business, the file 20% plus of the year, how do we maintain the type of returns that we expect? And frankly, there are a couple of programs there that based upon -- how do we say it -- the comments being made about the dollars that folks are willing to put into it, and the direction of those businesses, it did not look like the best use of our capital.</p><p>And so we have reallocated that capital to a couple of wins that we think are -- I think more down the fairway for us. So it is a nice -- I'm trying to be a polite way of saying, there is going to be some times where the capital is better used elsewhere, and this is one of those times. We've just never been capital constrained, but we are at the point now where the growth rate in the file is pretty much at our max level.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: And how does it affect the growth assumption for that business? Does it?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: It doesn't affect -- no, there's no effect at all. It's already been spoken for. And I know we had some -- already some questions about whether it was -- which client it was. And obviously, we haven't negotiated anything in terms of where we are going to put the file. But it is just FYI, it is not any client on the left coast. So that's all I can say on that one.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Okay, great. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Darrin Peller, Barclays.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Thanks, guys. Let me just quickly follow-up on the Epsilon side. If you can give us a little more granularity, first into the strength of the tech and data side there? And I know Conversant, in the pipeline, looks strong still. But -- I guess I just want to make sure that's sustainable, in terms of, you're not seeing any of the same clients on the agency side pull back at all on the tech side. Obviously, the growth doesn't show that yet.</p><p>And then if you can give us a little more color on the levers that you have capable of pulling, from a cost standpoint, at Epsilon? And if it has to start next quarter, I guess how much room do we have? It just feels like an area that you've tried to cut costs in the past, and outsourced things to India, et cetera. So I'd love to just hear more color on how much room there is.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, right now, what we are seeing is the continuation of strong demand for the digital products at Conversant, specifically the SKU level, data driven targeted display offerings. Very strong. In general, the more core Epsilon, big loyalty and customer database builds are strong, and data offerings are strong. So all the heavy tech stuff demand continues to be strong. We expect that to continue for the rest of year.</p><p>On the agency side, look, we need to be very careful we don't knee-jerk this thing. If it is an air pocket, then great, and we are back in business. If it looks like it is softer than we expect, then it is a very project-intensive, people-intensive business. You would have to move quickly to make sure that revenues and expenses sync up. But what we're seeing right now is, the softness in Q1 is already lessening a bit as we move into Q2. So we're going to hold off knee-jerking this thing.</p><p>And if, in fact, Q2 comes in very soft on the agency side, we will still make our [nums] for the Company, from a guidance perspective, for sure. But we will have to take some expenses out, to make sure we make our nums for the year.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER: Maybe I just missed it. But in terms of the 5%, what was your overall Epsilon outlook for the year now, in terms of organic growth, for the whole segment?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: What we talked about for Epsilon is mid-single-digit plus on top and bottom. I think we'll stay there.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER: You're staying there now, okay. All right. Thanks. Let me just shift, and then I'll turn it back to the queue. But on the private label, on the card services side. I guess first on growth, do you agree -- co-branding, I know, is tougher now from a competitive standpoint. So just revisiting the addressable market, in terms of opportunities, obviously, given your divesting, I think this is the first time I remember hearing you guys divesting a couple of portfolios, based on better opportunities for probably more profitability elsewhere.</p><p>But either way, I guess just revisiting the addressable market would be helpful, given it seems like it is more private label focused than co-branding now. And then on that note, the yield compression is a combination of things, like you guys mentioned automated payments and new vintages, but also co-branding. With all of those things anniversarying and co-branding potentially moving lower now as a percentage of the mix, should the yield potentially rise in 2017? Or at least be stable?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I think the yield will be relatively stable in 2017, exactly to your point. As we are burning through these compression issues and the (technical difficulty) anniversary, and to your point exactly, a little less emphasis on the co-brand side, you won't have that large compression that you've seen the last couple of years of 100 basis points or so on the yield side. [It will be] significantly less than that.</p><p>And that has to do, again, with, we are looking to optimize the portfolio, which means that at this part of the cycle, you've got an awful lot of mouths to feed when it comes to co-brand. So that isn't quite as exciting to us at this point in the cycle. We've seen this play out before. So we are looking to optimize the files, continue the growth at 20% plus, and keep the compression much more modest on a go-forward basis. And based on the pipeline and what we are signing and what you will see released later this year, we feel pretty good with it.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER: All right, that's helpful, guys. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Does that complete your question?</p><p>DARRIN PELLER: Yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Kevin McVeigh, Macquarie.</p><p>KEVIN MCVEIGH, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Great, thanks. Nice job, guys. In terms of -- Charles, the improvement in credit to 10 bps, what drove that? And how should we think about that over the course of the year? Still sticking with the [5.5%]? Or should we expect some improvement there, as well?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: What we gave guidance to is a [5.0] loss rate for the year. (multiple speakers) We came in a little bit better in Q1. I think you will see we could come in a little bit better in Q2 and Q3, could be up a little bit in Q4 compared to original guidance. But I would say we are right on track to hit the 5% for the year. In terms of [missing] -- doing better by 10 bps of the first quarter, some of its timing. But I would say for the year, we're tracking right to the</p><p>[5.0] loss rate that we gave as guidance.</p><p>KEVIN MCVEIGH: Got it. And then as we think about the mix of private label versus co-brand, going forward, we are still in the range we talked about historically? Or more of a shift on the private-label side?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I would say we're still around 80/20, 80% private label, 20% co-brand. To Ed's point before, we're doing less co-brand. That's where most of the competition is, so we're focused more on private label. You know us. Private label is our secret sauce. That's where we have all the expertise. And so you will see more growth coming there, which, long-term, should benefit the yields, going back to Darrin's question before.</p><p>KEVIN MCVEIGH: Awesome. Thanks. I will get back in queue.</p><p>OPERATOR: Bob Napoli, William Blair.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY: Thank you, good morning. Hey, Ed and Charles, are the additional buybacks in your guidance? You bought back about 400 million. You said you had 500 million, and I think you expect to buy back closer to 800 million to 1 billion?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: So the second piece of our authorization is not considered, Bob. So the initial 500 million was considered. The second 500 million is not considered in guidance.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: Okay. Thank you. Then on the tender share improvement, the 80% from mature accounts, that is very helpful ago. But are you -- is that piece being driven by increasing credit lines for those individuals that are using the line? And obviously, since they're mature accounts, they -- I'm sure they are performing well, credit wise?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. We are not popping up lines. We've never had, really, an issue with an open to buy. I think, Charles, you may know better than I. But if we have a $500 balance, we may have an $800 line. So there is plenty of room on the open to buy, and we re-score all 40 million accounts every quarter. So it is not a credit line issue. It is more of if I have an 800 line and a 500 balance, and I'm growing it normally 5% a year, how do I get it to 7% or 8%?</p><p>And that's basically the whole tender share game, which is, how do I get her to make one more visit if they are not visiting the store itself? A lot of our tender share gains, or I'd say the bulk of it, is coming through online sales, where we reach out to her and make some type of compelling offer to her, and she will go online to buy it. And a lot of this is, to use the lingo, she's snacking online. Meaning that we're seeing a lot of incremental purchases that are relatively small in size, but they are happening very frequently.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: Great, thanks. And then just last question. On the agency business on the Epsilon business, is that -- have you lost -- is this just pullback by client? Have you lost some clients? Are you losing share of a client to another competitor or piece. So what's going on there? I don't think the industry has pulled back as much as we saw in your business in the first quarter. And who are you primarily competing with today in those sectors?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: It is a good question. We don't -- one quarter doesn't a trend make, so it still up in the air, in terms of what exactly is [moving on]. All we did see was, we saw project business basically dry up in the first quarter that we had counted on. And as a result, the business we needed to close to make agency hit Q1 did not happen. Now, are those projects beginning to drift back in? It looks like they are slowly drifting back in. So that's all we know at this point.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: And who are you seeing as your -- by sector, agency versus tech, who would you point out as your two or three largest and toughest competitors?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: I think it is all over the board, in terms of when it is pure agency, you could have the big Madison Avenue players involved there. You could have some of the other digital smaller agencies involved there. But for the most part, what we do is, we like to link the agency as the tip of the arrow, to get in the door with the CMO to flow through to the big heavy-duty, high-visibility tech platforms that we build for them. The project-based stuff on the agency side, as you can tell, is the stuff that can jerk around quite a bit on a quarterly basis.</p><p>So that's what we are seeing. The big tech platforms continue to be built, and it is just these projects on the agency side that we just saw softness in Q1. So we just don't want to get out in front of this thing and start saying, my gosh, we've got long-term weakness in agency, when it could very well just be a one quarter phenomenon.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: So Bob, the only thing I would add is, it's not a case where we're losing clients. It's not a number of clients going away, it's just less spend. So in the first quarter, we really saw less spend going back to its point where on a project basis, CMOs cut their budgets with us for whatever reason.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: Great, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY, ANALYST, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Ed, I guess I want to ask a big pictures strategic question with regard to Epsilon. Is there -- as you think about agency, irrespective of the quarterly volatility in that business, is there still the same competitive strategic rationale for having agency as part of Epsilon as you might have thought there was five years ago? Has your thinking changed on that at all?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: No. I think it is absolutely critical that we have that skill set, because that's the skill set that can get in the door, have the conversation with the CMO. And that will then lead to the pull-through to the big client database work, the big loyalty platform builds, the big CRM business at Conversant. So no, it's -- I think the skill set there is critical, in order to pull through for the other parts of Epsilon. It is almost like even though it is a bit soft this quarter, my view is, if you take it away, what you're going to wind up with is, you are going to cut the head off the rest of the big tech pull-throughs at the rest of Epsilon, and the whole thing will eventually slow down.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY: Okay. And is there -- with regard to, again, agency, is there a customer concentration issue, do you think, within that business? Is that part of the reason we see the volatility? And is there anything you can do about it if there is?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: It is part of it, Andrew. If you look, our biggest clients in Epsilon are all on the agency side of the business. So when they pull back on any project or maybe not supporting a particular offering, they can move the needle quickly. And being project-based, they can do volatility intra-quarter quite a bit for the year. You can pretty well estimate what they are going to do.</p><p>But they can basically open up the faucet or close it quite quickly, based upon what they're wanting to do with their marketing spend. And so what we saw in Q1 was, they basically closed the spigot. We think that they will open it up as the year progresses, so we are not sounding alarm bells. But it is big companies, big budgets, and they can flex it quite quickly.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY: Okay. And then quickly, with regard to your outlook for what may be a loss rate plateau in 2018 and beyond. Can you dig a little bit into the rationale or the thought process that gives you confidence that we might see something that's pretty unprecedented, historically, in terms of stable charge-offs?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, if you look at it, it is a great question. The fact that, as we talked about, the bulk of our growth, the 10% in the core growth that we're seeing, is really coming from accounts that are very mature, have been well seasoned, well past the peak charge-out cycle, we are normalizing the loss rate. I think maybe two more stats might be helpful, which is look, we thought, before the Great Recession, our normalized loss rate was 6.5%. We are saying it is 5.5% now. Why is that? Why are we comfortable that's our long-term run rate?</p><p>And that's what we are normalizing towards. Probably a couple of interesting stats there. One is, with the new mix of co-brand, which carries a higher-scoring customer, as well as some of the higher-end type retailers that have joined us, we are attracting card holders that tend to skew a little bit higher on the credit spectrum. So for example, if you were to compare all of our active accounts today versus 2007, the scores today, on average, are higher than they were in 2007, even with some of -- a lot of the accounts that we've added recently.</p><p>So from an active account basis, the average score is higher. Also, if you looked at it from a balance perspective, the average score per balance today is higher than it was in 2007. And so you put those two together, and that's how you get to, we are not going to normalize out at 6.5% -- we are going to normalize out of 5.5%. But look, it is not like we are trying to keep it lower. The fact is, you give up some yield by not being at a higher loss rate. So I'm not sure it is a strategy of ours to keep it at 5.5%. It's just the way the file is playing out right now.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY: Okay. Appreciate it, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ashish Sabadra, Deutsche Bank.</p><p>ASHISH SABADRA, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the agency weakness here. So the agency has (inaudible) worsened as well as core Epsilon. I'm just wondering if the 23% decline that you saw that was consistent across both those segments? And then Charles, you mentioned that there is intra-quarter volatility there, depending on the projects.</p><p>Is there something you can do strategically, going forward, to lower that volatility? Or is it just that as tech continues to grow faster, it will be a bigger portion of the revenues? I was just wondering, how should we think about the volatility coming down in the agency? Because it has been a volatile over the last several quarters now.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: You are right, Ashish, we are going to have grow the technology piece of the business quicker. That's just frankly where it's going to be. Agency, in a good year, is going to grow 3%. Technology, in a good year, is going to grow 10% plus. So from a mix standpoint, you will basically take some of the volatility away from it. If you look at the breakdown, it was weakness in both categories. We saw weakness in traditional agency for Epsilon, where we saw we weakness across many verticals. I couldn't pinpoint it to any one client, because it was broad-based.</p><p>On the Conversant side, on the traditional display, we definitely have seen fewer people trying to use their private exchange. You've got the big agencies trying to push the programmatic buying through their own trading platforms. So regardless of the quality of the impressions we can provide, they're trying to stuff it through their own system. And we just saw a general pull-back there. So that was a little bit unexpected. So I would say it was both sides of it. We do think we will get some stability as the year goes on, but there's really, going back to Ed's point, nothing in particularly we can point to, aside from it just seemed like there was soft spend in Q1.</p><p>ASHISH SABADRA: Okay. Just quickly, on the margins for the Epsilon business, you highlighted a couple of reasons for the margins being lower. But how should we think about margins, going forward? Technically, if agency tends to be a lower margin, tech was higher-margin business. And as tech is growing faster, you would expect the margins to go up, going forward. So just wanted to better understand, how should we think about the dynamics for Epsilon margins over the next several quarters, but also the longer-term?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: So the way you would look at is basically, you are right. Agency will grower slower. It's the lower EBITDA margin. Your technology will grow quicker. It's the highest EBITDA margin, so just from a pure mix standpoint, you should get some EBITDA margin expansion in this year and in the future. Clearly, we will have to look at the agency and play through it. Is this the short-term hiccup or air pocket, as Ed said before? Or is it a case where we have to structurally cut back on cost to get our margins back where they need to be? That's a little bit of the unknown at this point. But long-term, I would expect the margins to expand slightly, based on mix.</p><p>ASHISH SABADRA: Okay, that is very helpful. And one final question, on the gross [and compression]. So the late fees have been weighing on -- the lower late fees have been weighing on. Which is actually better, because it helps you -- or [it's reflective] of the better consumer environment. But just how should we think about that compression? How much visibility or how much confidence do you have that comes off in the second half and going into 2017? Thanks.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, we have very good visibility into this, as we go into the second half. A large chunk of it, probably half of it, relates to what I call consumer-friendly programs, which I probably should define. It basically means we looked at all of our practices and basically said, how do we continue to be the premier provider in the marketplace, the most customer friendly provider in the marketplace, as we continue to ramp up? And so there's a bunch of things that we put in place, as we went into the back half of last year.</p><p>So for example, it doesn't seem like a lot, but it does move the needle, in terms of if someone gets paid on the 15th of each month, but their bill is due on the 13th, that doesn't work out all that well sometimes. So what we have done is, we've given everyone the right to move their due date to later on in the month if they wanted to. And that -- again, it doesn't seem like much, but it actually does affect the late fees. And -- but at the same time, it also helps our OpEx, as you see with the leverage, because we have much lower talk time of people calling up saying, I need a couple more days. So you have that.</p><p>You have people who are calling in, where they used to be a fee if you are paying by the phone. We decided that wasn't best practices. We took that out, as well. And so we just took a number of things out of the system that frankly caused more grief than they added. We got a lot of it back in lower OpEx, in terms of talk time and everything else, and we have a much happier client and customer base. And so I think that's what it is. None of it was dictated by any regulatory authority.</p><p>It was something we proactively went out and just did. And we think taking the hit now for it, and seeing it anniversary in the back half, is probably the best thing to do. And hopefully that will pay dividends down the line.</p><p>ASHISH SABADRA: Thanks, Ed.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: One more? Okay.</p><p>OPERATOR: David Scharf, JMP Securities.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll apologize in advance, Ed, because it is a repeat of some that have been asked, but I just want a clarification. On the agency side, can you give us a sense for how much of the business for agency is so-called project-based? Versus, I guess, work that you would deem to be, while not an annuity, pretty reliable and recurring? Obviously, it is all based on CMO budgets. But is the vast majority of the business things that you would deem to be quarter-by-quarter project-based, where there isn't necessarily great visibility?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Definitely on the Epsilon side of it, that's the case, where it is -- you've got one or two year contracts, but it is project to project. On the Conversant side, it is going to more volume driven, because it's basically [site display]. Basically, you have got a lot of unpredictability when you get to agency. You can have a longer-term contract, but if it flexes based on volume, predicting what it's going to be on a quarter-to-quarter basis is just a difficult thing to do, David.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Got it. And when we think about the cost structure -- and obviously, the agency business has always had the least amount of operating leverage, given it's people intensive. But can you -- you've talked about, in the disclosure, that agency is roughly maybe one-quarter of the Epsilon segment, the traditional Aspen business plus Conversant. But from the standpoint of the percentage of fixed cost, how should we think about it?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: I would say your premise is right, David, it is a higher fixed cost business. It's more of a people driven business, so variability is pretty low. Part of the reason why you saw that our EBITDA was down quite a bit in the quarter was because the revenue was down on agency, and it doesn't flex very much. So you are right, I don't have an exact percentage. But you can assume it is our highest fixed cost business would be within agency. So if we see it's a structural issue in the market, then we'll have to go through and address the fixed cost. And we can do so pretty quickly if we need to.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Okay. And as we think about the description of a lessening degree of revenue decline in Q2, 23% is a big number. Should we be thinking 15% to 20% down, or more closer to 10%? Just trying to get a little bit of context.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: Yes, I don't think we are in a position to really say that at this point, as to what it is going to be. We do feel good that it's going to get better. We had a difficult comp in Q1, so we know it's going to be less than Q2. But at this stage, it would be very difficult for me to quantify it for Q2, Q3, Q4. As you know, David, we look at our guidance in total, not in any single piece. So just like in the first quarter we had over-performance in some areas and weakness in other, we would look for the year to be the same way. So it's very difficult for me to quantify that for you by quarter, David.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Got it. And as you referenced, a little bit of loosening in Q2, maybe some of the project-based expected or hoped for backlog is starting to materialize again. Are those coming specifically from those larger clients that may have pulled back unexpectedly? Or are these new wins, new contracts?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I would say it is a little bit of both. You do have some new wins coming through, and we'll look to focus on that during the course of the year. And I do think you're going to see budgets open up a little bit with us as the year progresses, as well. As Ed said, before, we think there was a little bit of a knee-jerk reaction with CMOs in Q1. I know I was told over and over we heading into a recession quite quickly in the US. So I think many people listen to the rhetoric, and I think on project-based, discretionary-based marketing, I think pulled back a little bit in Q1.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Got it. And then just lastly, on the card side. It sounded like some pretty guarded or crafted language regarding the two programs that won't be renewed. But is it fair to say -- should we think of that as two retailer partners that perhaps are not willing to commit as much marketing push behind the product as before? Basically deemphasizing the store card as one of their marketing tools?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Got it. Okay, thanks very much, guys.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Okay. All right, everyone, thank you. We will see you next quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference, and thank you for your participation. That does conclude the conference.

General situation in Middle East and Syria, oil supply politics, and impact on USA energy industry on banks and impact on oil producing nations.</p><p>6. Traditional media continues to be under pressure.</p><p>1. Seen impact on:</p><p>1. Traditional legacy newspaper and magazines spending on both sides of Atlantic.</p><p>2. New entrants experimenting in agency space.</p><p>7. Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Egypt, Nigeria, Mexico, Columbia, Peru, Argentina, Post-Macri Argentina all offers opportunities.</p><p>1.

Emphasis on three areas of technology, data and content.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON, FINANCE DIRECTOR, WPP PLC: So if you can just put your hand up, say who you are and just wait for the man with the microphone, I would be very grateful. So just start on the left -- my left, your right.</p><p>CHARLES BEDOUELLE, ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS: Good morning, Charles Bedouelle from Exane. A couple of questions. The first one is do you get any inspiration from the finally positive growth from Ipsos last quarter and what it could mean for consumer insight, market research?</p><p>And the second question is for Paul. Where do you see the net debt and average debt maybe at the end of the year? Thanks.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL, GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE, WPP PLC: On data, you've seen that in the first quarter it was flat. We had a stronger March. The integration of our data business with our media business, you put the two together, the combined revenues of the two businesses are GBP10b out of approximately GBP20b.</p><p>So media and data are really half of our business. Another quarter of our business, maybe a little bit more, is digital. So three-quarters of our business are media, data and digital heavily linked together. But we think that the leverage that we're getting from media and from data is quite significant.</p><p>Ipsos is -- business tends to be more custom than ours. We still see a difference between the custom business, which is much more project orientated, and the syndicated or semi-syndicated business that we have, which is built around copy testing and tracking and our panel business. Which is more, let me put it like this, a Nielsen-type business which is more syndicated. And we did see a little bit more stronger growth in March. But margins are strong and much stronger. Some of the restructuring expense that we took in 2014 and 2015, a significant part of it was directed at the data business and particularly in Western Europe. So I think we saw a little bit of improvement in March.</p><p>But one of the primary focuses is to make sure that we leverage what we are doing in data and measurement more effectively. One of the big areas is ensuring that we get maximum utilization and application that came out in Adam's and Rob's report in the area of measurement.</p><p>And being able to access the data, the sort of data that Google and Facebook are developing. And there are signs, certainly with Google and I think latterly with Facebook as well, that they're starting to free up some of the data, if not all of it, to then make available to our media operations and our data operations. And that they will be less of a walled garden, if I can put it like that in terms.</p><p>Do you want to add anything to that, Rob?</p><p>ROB NORMAN, CHIEF DIGITAL OFFICER GROUPM, WPP PLC: No, we have great relationships with all of them in terms of them feeding data into our own research and analytics models. We are still seeking more transparency from them into the real shape and nature of their audiences and the profiles of their heaviest using segments which we believe are important to advertisers to really understand the social significance of those platforms relative to other media.</p><p>And it's a tremendously productive relationship, but it's relatively tough sledding to actually get to the final datasets we want.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Okay. So Paul, do you want to cover the net debt question.</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: So Charles, I'll talk about the average for the year, so to December 31. So last year, as you may recall, the year-to-date average was around GBP3.5b. And in terms of the average net debt to EBITDA ratio, the end of the year about 1.78.</p><p>I'm expecting the average net debt throughout the year to increase by the end of the year around GBP500m on a constant currency basis. But the ratio at the end of the year to be very consistent with what we saw last year end.</p><p>I think there are two just adjustments you need to keep in mind. Is because of the weakness of sterling, and we had the majority of our debt in euros and dollars, in terms of the gross debt number, there's around a GBP200m adjustment at 2016 rates.</p><p>It doesn't affect the leverage ratio because obviously we're going to get the benefit on the EBITDA in a similar fashion. So the ratio remains the same. But also in addition, with the completion of the STW deal, although we did not pay cash and we've been issued shares for our assets, we are taking on their balance sheet, which had on balance around GBP200m of debt as well.</p><p>So without those two adjustments, just to keep it clean and simple, it's around GBP500m higher average net debt but the ratio the same. And we're looking to have I think a more even balance to the cash generation and the cash outflows in 2016 whereas last year we were quite a heavy outflow of around GBP560m.</p><p>JULIEN ROCH, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Julien Roch with Barclays. First question on P&amp;G. You just announced recently that they were continuing to cut how much they were paying to agencies. They've already cut by 25% which is about GBP400m. There's about another GBP200m to come. So is anybody doing it? Because I know you talked about pricing pressure. But are we talking about 35% cut, which is quite big and why is there no impact on overall agencies because if you look at the growth rate, it's pretty similar? That's my first question.</p><p>Then ISBAR this morning sent to their 450 members a standard contract because apparently there's a lot of capacity and keeping of rebates among agencies. And I'm sure that's not the case for WPP agencies, but it's the second industry body that's said ether's something wrong in media buying at D&amp;A. So your comments on that.</p><p>And the last question is on account wins. Publicis is telling us it's going to cost them 100m, 250m of organic. And yet as the winner, you seem to have no benefit as this year growth is supposed to be like last year. So a comment on that as well. Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Well let me just deal with the first one. I don't think we can talk specifically about one specific client. P&amp;G is our third-largest client after Ford and Unilever. But I think it would be inappropriate to talk about specific clients other than to say, as you know from the analysis that we gave you, the macro and micro analysis on the slide, we do refer to pressure. And then the pricing pressure that there has been in the marketplace, the pressure on payment terms and the like. This is not a new thing. This is something that's been going on for a significant period of time.</p><p>But I come back to the general point that what we're seeing is that corporates are very focused on returning capital to shareholders.</p><p>There are others that are looking at growing the top line and ultimately I think everybody accepts, even zero-based cost budgeters, that in the longer term, they have to invest in brands and have to grow the top line to prosper. So in any particular case, any particular company will go through cycles, or go through cycles where they emphasize costs, and then having done that, and having created a much more efficient base for their operations, there'll then start to build again. Packaged goods companies in particular are very focused on advertising and promotion.</p><p>Unfortunately, we don't get often the breakdown between advertising and promotion. Promotion, by and large, if A&amp;P rises because A is rising, obviously that's good for agencies. If it rises because of promotion or P rising, that's not so good. And similarly on the downside. So I think it would be wrong to categorize everything in the garden as being rosy.</p><p>And we've had this discussion with you before. We talked about parallel universes; you have to be optimistic if you operate in our industry. But having said that, there are pressure points, and we have highlighted consistently over a long period of time that there are these pressure points, ever since, really, Lehman. We had to snap back in 2010, but from 2011 onwards, it's almost like a square root sign you saw, the snapback, but it's with a gently sloping upward tail to the square root sign. So without, again, focusing on specific clients, that is the situation.</p><p>On ISBAR and the agencies, I haven't seen the contract. But of course, we have contracts with our individual clients. And as we've said in the case of the ANA, if any client has any issue with any of our agencies, we have a constant dialogue, not through ISBAR and not through the ANA, with each of the clients. And if they have any concerns about the relationship or the way that we operate, or indeed anybody else operates, they should do it directly with the agencies. And we do have strong dialogues all the time with all our clients.</p><p>On the new business, I'm a little bit mystified by the question because you do see the benefit of it, and you do see the benefit. You've seeing the increase in our market share in North America. We are, according to RECMA, our billings are GBP104b I think in the last RECMA survey, which was around I think 2014. I don't think they've issued the full numbers for 2015. We give you an audited number. You know that we did GBP73b of billings last year. You know that our billings are up by 8.3% reported and 6.7% constant for the first quarter of this year.</p><p>I think, coming back to your comment on ISBAR, and indeed, the ANA, a lot of the issues that are supposed to be focused on could be removed by every agency giving their billing information, every agency giving their revenue information, which they do, and every agency giving their net sales information.</p><p>We included the table in the press release, which is somewhat unorthodox, some people observed, but we put it in into the press release because we think it shows -- it highlights the difference in the data. We give you the revenues of each company for the last quarter. We show that local -- in local and revenue, because sometimes the exchange rate varies a bit, and we give an explanation of that. We gave you the growth rate. And we gave you the growth rate our revenue and net sales. And we now know that at least two, maybe three of the competitors have their own platforms, and buy media as principles.</p><p>Now we were very forthright on Xaxis and the opt-in basis of Xaxis. Omnicom then revealed that they had their own platform, Accuen, and they give a -- in response to questions they give each quarter an indication of what the impact of principle digital buying has been in the United States.</p><p>Publicis, in their last call, referred to their Apex platform, which as I understand it, from what I've been told, has been in operation for some time.</p><p>IBG say they don't act as principle.</p><p>Havas I don't know whether they do or they don't. I think from what we've heard, they possibly do.</p><p>So we think that, coming back to your question about benefit around new business wins, etc., you can see it in the numbers.</p><p>And going back to the ISBAR question, I think a lot of the question marks would be removed because it then get into the areas of barter and pass through costs. The other area that makes the difference between revenue and net sales, in our case, is not just online media buying as principle, but also the pass-through costs on data.</p><p>And obviously other people have pass-through costs. IBG in their call this quarter referred to pass-through costs yet again. So showing revenue and net sales, I think is important.</p><p>TOM SINGLEHURST, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Good morning. It's Tom here from Citigroup. I have a couple of questions. The first one is on the convergence of agency models and the moves towards horizontality and cross-group client teams. It strikes me that the way we should think about WPP's approach is basically they have a series of concierges basically dipping in and out of the main agency brand. And the question is, given some of the big competitors are now going to full unified P&amp;Ls, and on the face of it slightly more integrated approaches, is the concierge approach going to be enough in the context of what's happening in the world landscape? So that's the first question.</p><p>And then the second question. You mentioned the Bollore model. You didn't really talk about whether it was a good thing. And I just wanted to understand whether that's some sort of signal that we should expect you to (inaudible).</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: I raised it as an interesting point, Tom, because I know you follow these things avidly. I just think it's a different model. It's yet to be determined whether it's a good thing or a bad thing. But I think it's probably one of the most interesting things going on in the industry, if not the most interesting thing, that you have a model that combines a telecom's platform, and it may well be that Telecom Italia company, that the network is separated from the pipework, if I can put it, or the cables.</p><p>But I think it's just very interesting that in a group, and it's a group of companies, really, minority interests, so effectively controlling interests, is being put together for the first time that I can see. I think there are some parallels in some parts of the world. I can think of one in South America.</p><p>But it's unusual to have agency services plus a telecoms platform, plus media ownership, plus content ownership being put together in this way. It does raise all sorts of interesting issues, and I think it's just interesting that convergence, and I think it is the fact we are seeing convergence in a number of areas, is just manifesting itself in a different way.</p><p>Going back to your concierge question, this is not a concierge operation. I think that's a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation. Whilst -- the point I'm making is this. If you've got one end of the spectrum is let's say vertical, and the other end of the spectrum is total integration or what we would call horizontality, we have clients that we have totally integrated, where we literally have one single P&amp;L, where we've literally fused it and there is not a cigarette paper of difference.</p><p>And there are two or three of those that are very strong. They are effectively agencies within WPP to service a particular client. And we see that in the automotive category, in the packaged goods category. There are some clients who insist on global decentralization. I don't like that the word concierge. I wouldn't even call -- describe them as concierge, but where they're much more comfortable with let's say the vertical operating as the integrator.</p><p>The risk, I think, of going too quickly is that you disrupt your organization, and you can see it in the exit rate, in the churn rates that you can monitor, actually, increasingly. If you look at various social media, you can monitor what's going on. We monitor very closely what's happening to the churn rates, the turnover rates, between ourselves and key competitors. And that's particularly the case since the POG merger or the mooted POG merger. Since that broke apart, and we've continued to monitor that, and that shows quite clearly some differential turnover rates that are quite significant.</p><p>The point that I was making in our presentation is given the difference between vertical and horizontal, it's got to be done gradually. It can't be force fed, because it causes far too much disruption.</p><p>The brands that we have, have been in existence in one case for well over 150 years. And to force-feed people, to cram it down their throats that they're going to move to horizontal, unified model, uni-branded model in a short period of time, I think our judgement is that's highly destructive.</p><p>Others in our industry are more vertically geared and aligned, and they've used the value of their brands is greater than the benefits they will get. So this is not concierge. I react against that word, because we have models that are highly unified. We also have models that are highly decentralized. I think the trend is towards more unification. The difference I would have is the pace at which it gets done.</p><p>RICHARD JONES, ANALYST, POWERHOUSE: Hi. It's Richard Jones from Tower House. Can I just follow up on that question, just how client attitudes towards client conflict have changed over the last five, 10 years?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Richard, we'll come back to the conflict, but Rob just wanted to add something.</p><p>ROB NORMAN: Yes, within the horizontality construct, I think it's interesting how it's operating in some parts of WPP. And I think of the agents Plus for Chanel. I think if they keep L'Oreal, for L'Oreal, I think of [Team Arrow] for Target in which we're taking assets across countries and across disciplines and across agencies from within GroupM even in order to build custom assets for clients whilst retaining complete sovereignty for many others in MediaCom, Mindshare and so forth.</p><p>So I think what we've got is a very flexible infrastructure and the muscle memory of collaboration in building throughout the business. It's no longer unusual, and it's much easier to do this through muscle memory than it is through dogma.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Okay. Fair enough. On the conflict issue, Richard, I think broadly the answer is it has become less of an issue. And clients have accepted conflicts within structured parent companies, holding companies, as long as there's separation and there are rules of engagement, or rules of disengagement. So there are all sorts of things in relation to privacy, secrecy, confidentiality, audit, cooling off periods in relation to people working on pieces of business.</p><p>So I think generally, the issue of conflict is less prevalent. It is still probably more than, with all due respect to the investment bankers that might be in the room, or brokers who might be in the room, that the conflicts that you have to deal with are indeed consulting companies. That they are able in one brand to handle conflicts, whereas in our industry, for good reasons or bad reasons, handling conflicts in one vertical is difficult.</p><p>And that comes back to the previous question, Tom's previous question, often you have to maintain -- and this is this question about how fast you go, if you slam everything together and unify it into one, that whole conflict issue that you raised is going to become more difficult to deal with.</p><p>So there is a logic to the separation, not just about different cultures or different brands or different histories, but conflict of clients, and indeed I will add another conflict, conflict of people. Sometimes people just don't want to work with or for other people, and you have to respect that, and respect that difference. So that's another reason why going too fast can be a dangerous thing to do. But I do think generally concern about conflict has got less. And of course, if there is pressure in the system to reduce pricing, to -- on payment terms is another thing that we've discussed over time, the result is there has to be consolidation, which there has been in our industry.</p><p>And I think one of the things you're seeing, one of the questions that was previously, why is it that the industry seems to be in reasonably good health, if you look at -- and you look at GDP growth? And I think part of the reason is that the bigger agency groups are gaining share because it is more difficult, again, rightly or wrongly, for smaller or medium-sized agencies to continue to operate independently.</p><p>We were talking to one company yesterday who said that the chief reason they were interested in talking to us was because they needed more global representation, even more regional representation in the context of the US market. So the whole -- and they had been precluded from agency RFPs because they didn't have the requisite resources.</p><p>So one of the maybe unintended consequences of greater pressure on pricing, etc., is that the conflict differentiation is less necessary as a result, certainly less necessary than Don Draper would have seen -- would have known.</p><p>LISA YANG, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Good morning. It's Lisa from Goldman Sachs. My first question is on your organic growth for the full year, and how you think about the shape of it. It looks like the comps in the second half are getting tougher, yet you expect stronger growth. So any kind of comment that would be appreciated.</p><p>The second one is on Kantar. You recently announced a big reorganization. So I know it's early days, but any color you can give on how this reorganization is going, and when do you expect to achieve top line growth?</p><p>And the last one is a bit more on the topic about need to invest in your brand to grow your top line. It looks like there are more and more outside companies that grow their brands without having to invest much in traditional media if I take the example of just your traditional media you would use, etc. So I'm just wondering if you think that digital will lower the barriers to build the brand, and what are the implications for the agency?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Adam, if you could just deal with that third question about the relative importance of tradition, because I think you've got some strong views on that, on traditional media and the balance. And then I'll come back on the organic second half and Kantar.</p><p>ADAM SMITH, FUTURES DIRECTOR, GROUPM, WPP PLC: Yes, in the Interaction report we've just published, one of the sections deals -- looks at specifically the amount of traditional media used by online brands to increase their market penetration, which is substantial. And to give you a specific example, in the UK, the big tech brands are growing their TV investment at double the market average. That's on the one side of the coin.</p><p>On the other side of the coin, do digital media reduce the barriers to entry? Well, one very distinct sign I see here in the UK, if you look at regional advertising, which is by definition small budgets and national (technical difficulty). The ratio of -- the cost of getting the reach is falling, because digital media are cheaper but you have to manage the data that go with it. And so earnings profile seems to be distinctly moving in the case of smaller budgets from fees and commissions and media placement to payment for data-related services, essentially. So there are still barriers to entry, although I agree that the media cost may well be cheaper.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Thanks for that. Rob?</p><p>ROB NORMAN: No, I think other than to say that, as Adam points out, as regards becoming bigger and bigger investors, there is a definite need for many of these companies to achieve significant celebrity in their own mind. One of the newest clients is Max, in the US, for example, is Jet.com, which is a competitor to the other e-commerce platforms. Its a marketplace level business and it needs to drive a level of awareness so people consider jets.com versus Amazon and eBay and others, and they are pushing very aggressively into the marketplace with traditional media.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: And you -- Adam, just to further underline the point. In your Interaction report, you talk about TV is definitely not dead. Do you want to add anything in relation to -- and particularly one of the questions that flows from that is what's happening to the -- and Rob, you can comment on this as well, on the upfronts here and the scatter markets here. Do you want to just talk about TV and its role, Adam, a bit?</p><p>ADAM SMITH: There is this perception of TV as in some kind of crisis with the departure of younger viewers. And so we asked our networks to quantify the scale of this. And the net result is that yes, of course there's been some erosion of younger viewers, I would say typical more than 10% loss of volume. But what we buy is reach. And 10% loss of volume does not equate to 10% loss of reach. It equates to something rather less than that. So I visualize that problem as managing the problem.</p><p>We compensate for the loss of reach by using digital media where we know this audience resides. Rob's earlier points about some of the digital companies not telling us as much as we'd like to know about reach, is quite important because I think it may benefit them to be a little more open so we can establish just exactly how much reach we can pick up quite easily. I think there maybe there is an incentive there for them to be more open.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I've done some -- no.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: You've been told on pain of death not to say anything.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. There is the [high occupation] area calling the upfront at this moment.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: All right, okay. So discretion is the better part of valor. Just coming back to organic. As we've said in the statement, we think on the basis of the Q1 one RF that we have, as I say, we're going to go through that in some more detail the next couple of weeks. But we think that the second half will be slightly stronger despite the stronger comparatives. So I think that's the pattern that we see.</p><p>As far as Kantar is concerned, it comes a little bit back to Tom's concierge question. If you look at Kantar, that is definitely not a concierge operation. But what Eric Salama, who runs Kantar, which is, as you know, is about a quarter of our revenues, is doing, which is no different actually to what we've been doing in other parts of the operation, but I think it's interesting, because it is emblematic of what we're trying to do elsewhere, and in fact at WPP as a whole is a, he calls it, Kantar first.</p><p>And he's building a much more integrated Kantar where in each country there is much more of a unified back office, the pipework is much more standardized, and yet you have people focusing on country and country cooperation across brands. Not losing, again, coming back to the importance of the brand, at least from our point of view, not losing their brand, not being -- not becoming uni-branded, but certainly trying to get the maximum amount of efficiency and the maximum amount of cooperation clear from what we've seen.</p><p>And it relates to the other part of the question about top line growth. What's clear is that having implemented that, there's a totally different attitude in each of the brands as they work together as to how they treat RFPs, how they treat RFPS if they can't compete with them for -- it might be Richard's question about conflict or whatever it happens to be or capability that they are much more aware of the other capabilities within Kantar and within WPP</p><p>So I think that structural -- and we're looking at it very carefully in terms of how it's implemented because it has lessons for us in what we're doing in other parts of the operation.</p><p>That 11 vertical slide which simplifies the structure with the four agency groups, GroupM, Group H, B2B, etc., gives you an idea of how the structure has been simplified. And what you've got is subgroups around function, that each and every one of them is becoming much more streamlined, much more efficient, much more back office shared service center, ERP efficient. And that's the way we think it should go. But being a little bit careful on all the issues that we talked about.</p><p>ADAM SMITH: And Kantar's reorganization is a very significant issue for the collaboration with GroupM. So I think of [Serene Wong] who leads the L'Oreal relationship with both Kantar and GroupM overall, I think of [Gera Sumenska] who I think leads the Nestle operation for both GroupM and Kantar. It's streamlining those relationships is making it easier for us to yield the data investment management dividend on media.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Okay.</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: Right. Some of the regions last year relatively underperformed in the second half of the year, in particular Asia Pacific market sector, Middle East and rest of the world. Those are expecting quite a strong bounce back in the second half, which is logical given their performance last year.</p><p>And I'd say in terms of the discipline of the specialist businesses, it effectively gets stronger, although it's had a good start throughout the second half of the year. So there is a logic to the understanding, despite higher comps. Some of the underperformance relatively last year is being made up on the second half of this year.</p><p>PATRICK WELLINGTON, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Patrick Wellington, Morgan Stanley. Just quickly, three questions. China. Is your optimism simply based on comps as the year goes on or is there something more substantial making you feel that China is going to get better?</p><p>And just on the UK, are we seeing any Brexit effect in Q2?</p><p>Secondly, quickly, the ANA report, is that ever going to come out? There was some talk it was going to come out in April. Has it ever happened?</p><p>And thirdly, Martin, you mentioned that bigger agencies are taking share, which potentially gets us back onto the old theme of is WPP thinking of making another acquisition across those row of agencies. There's some smaller ones on the far right could easily be consolidated. Are we back on that theme?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: It doesn't strike me as being a quick question, Patrick. And there were four there, I noted. Your three has become four. But anyway, let me try and deal with them.</p><p>China. I think it is a comps, a comparative point. I think first quarter was pretty -- was limp, I would describe it. GDP growth I think in China is not at 6.5%. Probably most observers that we talk to think it's around 3% to 4%. But we'll have to see how it shakes out for the rest of the year. But I think it's more to do with comparatives than anything else. But we remain very strong, unabashed, not just of China, but of Brazil, despite the difficulties they're having at the moment. And I would add Russia, but that will take a longer time clearly to come through.</p><p>On the UK, to my knowledge, April hasn't finished, so I don't think we can answer your question.</p><p>I don't know whether Adam is going to add anything on the Brexit thing. But I have not seen stuff that I would associate on advertising spend with Brexit yet. I've heard clients say that Q1 generally was soft, not because of Brexit but for other reasons. One said to me even the pattern of holidays, the pattern of where Easter is, whether Easter is early or late, so there are lots of potential reasons. I do think, however, that Brexit, or the possibility of an exit, has affected other investment decisions.</p><p>So on the ANA, I don't know. You would have to ask the ANA as to -- I think I've said on a previous call, a meeting has been arranged between at least -- I think it's four of the agency holding company heads and the ANA. But that will be sometime in June. So I don't know about the reports.</p><p>On the bigger agencies, we remain very focused, Patrick, on the small and medium-sized acquisitions. We have done a public company deal which was STW. That is effectively -- it's not a nil premium merger, but it's a small premium merger. We stepped up from 21%, I think it was or 22%, to 60%, 61%, and the deal that was done was merging our remaining assets in Australia and New Zealand with STW, now being called WPP Australia New Zealand.</p><p>And when you look at the structure of that transaction, although we did pay a small premium on the value of their business in relation to ours, effectively it's a nil premium, or close to nil premium merger. So we think if we are going to do something of that nature, we get credit for doing that in that way rather than blundering in in the way that you seem to be suggesting by your fourth question.</p><p>I just think that -- just on structure, and I'm not saying we would be involved in this. But I do think since six becomes four in time, I'd still hold that view. But we shall see. The interesting thing about the Bollore model is that creates a different model. So Havas, which is the smallest of the six, is -- you can conglomerate it with the other assets that the Bollore family have, you have a very different -- it's a very different kettle of fish. So I think that in and of itself is sort of interesting.</p><p>CHRIS COLLETT, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Good morning. It's Chris Collett from Deutsche. Just two quick questions. One was on IBOPE, obviously one of the larger of the acquisitions you've done recently. Could you just comment on how that has been performing in what -- this is a difficult market?</p><p>And then secondly, it was just to pick up on a comment that was made about some of the walled gardens from Google and Facebook, the garden walls coming down a little bit. Could you just talk a little bit more about what is driving that and why, what's the incentive for them to lower their garden walls, if you will?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Well, we have an expert on -- an expert gardener here. Rob, go ahead.</p><p>ROB NORMAN: Well, I think that the walls remain robust. They're fine brick and mortar. They are merely taking more stuff over the wall that they've built. And I think what they have realized, not under pressure from advertisers and us, but in quite collaborative conversations with their advertisers and us, that it's in their interest to see all the boats flow upwards of brands growing. And they know that brands will only flow upwards if there is media investment and advertising investment across channels and the attribution is more able to be considered.</p><p>I think they've grown more confident, incidentally, in their own ability to deliver certain numbers of advertising objectives to different people. And the more confident people become in the performance of their channel I think the more happy they are to share some of the data from their channel which endorses their position.</p><p>We would like it to come down further. Our own strategy is to gather up the original data we collected in WPP from Kantar Shopper and transaction level and elsewhere, and back to consumer and behavioral data with KPMG in other parts of the Group and then to append more and more data so we have some visibility across the piece and they're not entirely dependent on them.</p><p>I think we are reaching a kind of mutual status, if you like, on that data sharing where they're keeping secret what they want to keep secret, and we are making use of what we need to do to achieve is our overall goal being cross-channel demand driving business.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Just to add to that and, Adam, you might want to come in as well. But I'll just ask Rob, it's not just the Google and Facebook walled gardens. There is the Amazon walled garden. There is the Ali Baba walled garden. There might even be a ClickCarts walled garden. There are a number -- the Apple walled garden -- there's a number of them.</p><p>ROB NORMAN: Well, the coincidental nature between all of the people who finish those walled gardens with are the people that are the biggest owners who want to become the virtuous first party data. So the people who have created terms and conditions for use of services, often utilities like Facebook or commerce services like Amazon, or entertainment services that come with Apple, who have acquired through their user agreement a number of rights to the use of data and targeting and so forth. And there is a clear separation between those businesses and what we think of as the rest of the traditional media sector. So that is highly significant.</p><p>And data alliance, which we created between GroupM and Kantar and Wunderman and other assets within WPP, has been absolutely focused on opening up the partnership pipes between us and all of those companies. And I'm glad to say we do have partnership rights between us and all of those companies. And the job is not to turn the fire hose on, as it were. The job is to take enough to inform appropriate decision-making. We are not unhappy with our progress in that area.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Yes, and I'll just add to it, Chris, before Adam, if you want to add anything else. What's really interesting is there is a considerable amount of concern. You know the regulatory concern in Brussels with the new competitiveness, DG, invest to go in relation to Google. You know, I'm sure, that a number of people are concerned about the data that, for example, Amazon has and controls.</p><p>And in fact, the data that an Ali Baba gets through the</p><p>[Tarval] platform in terms of what's happening to movement of product and service and replication of that product and service. So there is -- the more walled gardens there are, in a way, the greater the role that we have. It's a bit like fragmentation of the media. It plays in a role that we have in not arbitrating between them, but helping our clients navigate.</p><p>ROB NORMAN: There's a general rule that businesses like ours trade quite well in environments that are characterized by strong oligopolists rather than massively fragmented markets or single monopolists. So I think that we are now moving into a phase of a number of very strong oligopolists and I don't think that's a terrible thing for us.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Adam, anything you want to add before I respond on IBOPE?</p><p>ADAM SMITH: No, only that I have visualized this shift in our relationships with the big tech companies as being -- they are coming from a transactional direct response mindset to the more brand focused, intangible idea that most of our clients are pushing, where reputations are at stake. I realize part of what we do is risk management around price quality, security, context, reputation, this sort of thing. And the more collaborative our relationships are with the media vendors, I think the better the issues can be delivered.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Just turning to Chris's question on IBOPE, I think it's gone quite well, actually. One of the reasons why I think, if you compare the statistics and you got the statistics, or we can supply you with the statistics of the Latin American breakdown between us and the competition, one of the reasons we might have exhibited, certainly Brazil has been tough in the first quarter for everybody, including ourselves.</p><p>But I think in the context of Brazil and Latin America, IBOPE, because of the nature of its business, gives us more stability than perhaps we would have had without it. So on balance, good. And within the region, I think becoming stronger actually, when you look at it on a market-by-market basis.</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: I think, Martin, that's the last of the questions. Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Okay. We've got Fran Butera is over here with me and with Rob and you are there, Paul, with Chris Sweetland. So thanks, everybody, and we'll be talking to you at the end of the first half.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Briefs are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Accelerated share repurchases to offset equity dilution from Visa Europe acquisition.</p><p>3. Plans to maintain healthy dialog and good relationships with investor community.</p><p>1. Co. is in planning stages to hold an Investor Day in June.</p><p>1Q17 Financials (V.P.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. Revenue and EPS exceeded expectations, driven by accelerating fundamentals, which more than offset drag from exchange rate shifts.</p><p>2. GAAP net revenues up 25% and EPS up 7%.</p><p>3. Net income $2.1b.</p><p>4. Diluted EPS $0.86.</p><p>1. Adjusting for $255m non-cash gain in 1Q16 from write-off of Visa Europe put liability, EPS up 23%.</p><p>5. Exchange rate shifts vs. prior year, negatively impacted both net revenue and EPS growth by approx. 3 percentage points.</p><p>6. Key drivers of outperformance:</p><p>1. Constant dollar payment volume growth stepped up between 1-2 percentage points in most geographies.</p><p>2. Normalized for impact of Visa Europe, cross-border recovery accelerated by 2 percentage points globally from 10% to 12%.</p><p>1. Acceleration was broad-based.</p><p>3. Normalized for impact of Visa Europe, processed transaction growth picked up by 1 point from 12% to 13%, driven significantly by India and US.</p><p>4. Timing of client incentives and delays in expenses added almost $0.03 to results.</p><p>1. Strong business fundamentals more than offset negative impact of strengthening US dollar and weakening euro.</p><p>2. Balance between strong business fundamentals and unfavorable exchange rate shifts will drive results as Co. looks ahead to rest of FY17.</p><p>7. Co. did not issue $2b in debt as it had planned.</p><p>1. Issued $567m in commercial paper to fund stock buyback and operating cash needs.</p><p>8. Has over $8b of offshore cash, which could be repatriated if it can be done tax efficiently.</p><p>1. Will wait to see what new administration plans for permitting cash repatriation, before Co. issues longer term debt.</p><p>9. Continues to work on other strategies to bring cash back to US.</p><p>1. Until there is clarity on this front, Co. plans to issue commercial paper or short-term debt to fund buyback and other onshore cash needs.</p><p>10. Bought back 22.3m shares of Class A common stock at an avg. price of $79.77 for $1.8b.</p><p>1. Has $3.9b remaining in stock buyback authorization.</p><p>2. Key Metrics:</p><p>1. US payments volume grew 12.4%, as credit grew 20.2% helped by Costco and USAA.</p><p>1. US debit grew 4.6%, helped by USAA debit conversions, but hurt by Interlink volumes.</p><p>2. Interlink volumes down due to lapping significant win in 4Q15 and PIN debit routing choices by acquirers and merchants.</p><p>3. Excluding Interlink volumes, US debit growth rate stepped up by 3 points, due to USAA and rising gas prices.</p><p>4. Gas prices added approx. 1 point to both credit and debit payment volume growth in US.</p><p>2. As reported, 1Q international payment volumes grew 70.5% in constant dollars.</p><p>1. Step down in growth rate from last qtr. is due to exclusion of co-badge volumes in Europe.</p><p>1. Effective 06/09/16, Article 8 of EU Interchange Fee Regulation states that payment networks cannot impose reporting requirement or obligation to pay fees on payment transactions, where their payment brand is present, but their network is not used.</p><p>2. Prior to this regulation, Co. collected a small service in a few countries, particularly France on domestic payment transactions where V cards are co-badged with domestic network.</p><p>3. Clients in Europe continue to report co-badge volume through qtr. ended Sept. 2016.</p><p>4. However effective Dec. 2016 qtr., Co. co-badge volumes in Europe are no longer included in reported payment volumes.</p><p>5. Excluding co-badge volumes, European payment volume growth stepped up from 7% last qtr. to 9%.</p><p>6. There was strength across Europe and especially in UK.</p><p>2. Payment volume growth rate in Asia up 1.6 percentage points, driven by India, Japan and Australia.</p><p>3. CEMEA region growth rate higher by over 3 points, helped by Middle East and some improvement in Africa.</p><p>4. Only region with slowdown in growth was Latin America, pulled down by continuing weakness in Brazil.</p><p>5. Adding in Europe to last year's payment volumes and adjusting for co-badge volumes, in other words on comparable or normalized basis, constant dollar global payment volume growth accelerated by 1.5 percentage points in 1Q vs. last qtr.</p><p>3. On reported basis, cross-border volumes grew 140%, driven by inclusion of Visa Europe.</p><p>1. On comparable or normalized basis, constant dollar cross-border growth globally was 12%, up 2 points from last qtr.</p><p>4. US cross-border growth in constant dollars [hit] double-digits for first time since 1Q14.</p><p>1. Strong dollar drove robust outbound commerce from US, especially into Mexico, Canada and UK.</p><p>2. Large US acquired business was stable, benefiting from commerce in from Canada and parts of Latin America.</p><p>3. Weak pound is driving significant inbound commerce into UK from all parts of globe.</p><p>4. Eurozone cross-border growth rates remained healthy, helped by weakening euro.</p><p>5. Cross-border commerce was strong across most of Asia, especially outbound from Australia and Southeast Asia.</p><p>6. Other high growth corridors were outbound commerce from Russia and Eastern Europe.</p><p>5. Overall, cross-border business was important contributor to outperformance.</p><p>6. Reported basis, global processed transactions grew 44%, driven by inclusion of Visa Europe.</p><p>1. Comparable and normalized basis, global processed transactions grew 13%, up 1 point from last qtr.</p><p>2. US processed transactions grew 11%, due to Costco and USAA.</p><p>3. Demonetization in India drove increase in international processed transaction growth.</p><p>4. European processed transactions were stable.</p><p>7. Through Jan. 28, US payment volumes are up almost 13% in constant dollar.</p><p>1. Normalized for Visa Europe, constant dollar cross-border volumes grew 13% and processed transaction growth was 14%.</p><p>8. 1Q growth trends remain intact so far in 2Q.</p><p>3. Results:</p><p>1. Service revenues grew 17%.</p><p>1. Growth was helped by announced price increase on US acquired debit card service fees, offset by negative currency translation impact.</p><p>2. Service revenue growth is lower than payment volume growth Co. reported in Sept. qtr., reflecting fact that service revenue yields are substantially lower in Europe than in legacy Visa business.</p><p>2. Data processing revenues grew 28%.</p><p>1. Transaction revenue growth is lower than processed transaction growth, reflecting lower yield on European processed transaction relative to legacy Visa business.</p><p>2. India demonetization doubled transaction volume, but did not contribute much to revenues in 1Q.</p><p>3. In response to a request from Indian government, Co. voluntarily charged no fees for processing through 12/31/16.</p><p>3. International revenues grew 44%.</p><p>1. Up from Sept. qtr. growth rate driven by cross-border volume acceleration, higher than avg. currency volatility, offset by an unfavorable exchange rate impact.</p><p>4. Other revenues grew 2%.</p><p>1. No longer include Visa Europe license fees.</p><p>5. Client incentives came in well below guidance range of 20.5-21.5%, due to timing of deals being done in US, Asia and Europe.</p><p>1. Many of these renewals will be executed in 2Q, shifting these client incentive payments from 1Q into 2Q.</p><p>6. Low client incentives due to delayed deals added approx. $0.02 to EPS in 1Q.</p><p>7. Expenses grew 16%, due to inclusion of Visa Europe.</p><p>1. There were some shifts in marketing and technology spending to upcoming quarters.</p><p>2. As Europe completed consultation process, new hiring, growth projects and integration activities were modestly delayed.</p><p>3. Delayed expenses added $0.01 to EPS.</p><p>4. These expenses will be incurred through balance of year.</p><p>8. Tax rate 30.5%, driving EPS of $0.86, up 23% on adjusted basis.</p><p>9. Looking ahead, two significant countervailing trends will drive results.</p><p>1. Strong business momentum especially cross-border growth is tailwind.</p><p>2. Strengthening of dollar and weakening of euro are headwinds.</p><p>3. Cross-border recovery is broad-based and accelerated in 1Q.</p><p>1. Co. hopes this will be sustained.</p><p>2. This is higher yielding revenue stream, which improves revenue mix.</p><p>4. Continued strength of dollar is risk to monitor.</p><p>1. Treasury volatility staying above long-term averages as it did in 1Q will also help.</p><p>2. Broad acceleration in payment volumes globally is another reason for optimism.</p><p>10. Counter trend is exchange rates.</p><p>1. Based on spot rates and forward curve, dollar has strengthened around 4% vs. major currencies since Sept.</p><p>2. Stronger dollar is stiffer headwind than Co. expected.</p><p>3. Hedging program will offset some of the negative impacts.</p><p>4. Euro has weakened almost 5% vs. dollar since Sept.</p><p>1. Since Co. did not own Visa Europe until late-June, it is not hedged on euro exposure.</p><p>2. Euro is now a functional currency for Co. and it can only do economic hedges, which could add volatility rather than dampen it.</p><p>3. As such, Co. may choose to stay unhedged on euro exposure.</p><p>5. Weakening of euro will hurt Europe results as reported in dollars more than Co. expected last Sept.</p><p>6. This counter trend of favorable business fundamentals and unfavorable exchange rate shifts drive FY17 outlook.</p><p>4. 2Q17 Outlook:</p><p>1. For 2Q, Co. is assuming payment volume momentum will be sustained.</p><p>1. Strong dollar could cause some moderation in cross-border growth.</p><p>2. Client incentive spend will step up with deals that are shifting into 2Q from 1Q.</p><p>2. Expects client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be well within guidance range of 20.5-21.5%.</p><p>3. Expense growth rates are expected to be higher than 1Q as Co. ramps up spending in Europe and delayed initiatives in technology and marketing move into 2Q.</p><p>5. FY17 Outlook:</p><p>1. Reaffirming ranges Co. previously provided for nominal revenue and EPS growth.</p><p>2. Expects that stronger business fundamentals will offset stiffer currency headwinds.</p><p>3. Has increased likely currency translation drag on reported revenue and EPS growth rate by 1 point vs. prior estimates.</p><p>4. Client incentives were lower than expected in 1Q.</p><p>1. Expects client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be very much in 20.5-21.5% range for year.</p><p>5. Other elements of outlook for year, operating margins and tax rates remain unchanged.</p><p>6. Working on tax and repatriation strategies related to Visa Europe acquisition.</p><p>1. If and when Co. is able to execute tax reorganization, it will let investors know what its impact will be on future tax rates and cash debt management plans.</p><p>7. Visa Europe revenue and operating income are tracking well, despite negative impact of weaker euro.</p><p>1. Integration plans are modestly behind schedule, due to longer consultation process.</p><p>2. With employee consultation process now complete, reorganization is being executed.</p><p>3. Technology integration planning is on track.</p><p>4. Discussions continue with clients to ensure that pricing stays competitive post elimination of rebates and to extend existing contracts.</p><p>5. Even as this process is underway, vast majority of volume in Europe remains under contract.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.</p><p>(Operator Instructions)</p><p>Bob Napoli.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY: Thank you very much. Al, congratulations on a very nice quarter. You really have accelerated momentum since you have become CEO, so congratulations on that.</p><p>AL KELLY, CEO, VISA INC.: Team effort, but thank you, Bob.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: The question is on client incentives. The change in client incentives from last year to this year, what percentage of that is from the integration from the Visa Europe acquisition versus other items, like Costco or just general business conditions? And do you expect as we look to FY18, 2019 to see that percentage continue to increase?</p><p>AL KELLY: As we said on our call last quarter, we said it was roughly half due to Europe, and some of it is how the accounting works when you remove rebates and replace them with [client] incentive. And the rest was driven by Costco USAA and also renewals that we expect this year. So, nothing has changed much on those fronts.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: As far as the longer-term outlook? The trend into 2018. Sorry.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU, CFO, VISA INC.: I think it's too early to talk about that. We will certainly get into all that as we get to later in the year and talk about next year. As you know, we are tracking below our range in the first quarter, so you should (inaudible) with that and it will catch up in future quarters this year.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: Thank you very much.</p><p>AL KELLY: Thanks, Bob.</p><p>OPERATOR: Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS, INC.: Thanks. I was wondering if we get more color on where you guys are with the pricing initiatives in Europe, for the year.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: You know, they are moving ahead with plans we had, and some of it, as we told you before, we don't plan to announce them per se in calls like these. Certainly, in the market in Europe people are well aware of what we have done.</p><p>As we said in our comments, we are engaged with all our clients and issuers and acquirers in Europe on all these issues, they're ongoing discussions. We're happy with how things are going. And as far as that is concerned, we are very much on track in terms of everything we wanted to do.</p><p>OPERATOR: Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.</p><p>JASON KUPFERBERG, ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC: Thanks, guys. Just in light of the longer consultation period in Europe and a little bit of the delay in the integration, is 2% to 3% EPS accretion from Visa Europe still the right number?</p><p>AL KELLY: I think that's certainly what we're continuing to target, Jason.</p><p>OPERATOR: George Mihalos from Cowen.</p><p>GEORGE MIHALOS, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Great, thanks. Nice to see the encouraging trends pretty much across the globe.</p><p>Curious within the US market and others, I know there's a number of deals that are still ramping up. On an apples-to-apples basis, are you seeing an acceleration on the part of your issuers in trying to push more credit products and maybe the volume you're seeing again on a same-store sales basis ex Costco and USAA?</p><p>AL KELLY: Given the continued amount of attention reward products are getting, we're certainly seeing that our issuers are very focused on the credit card segment, for sure.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: [General] credit growth rates when you normalize for all things that are, as you said, adds to our business, the underlying growth trend is higher in credit than debit and is roughly stable quarter over quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research.</p><p>CRAIG MAURER, ANALYST, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: Yes, hi, thanks. I was hoping with all the noise in the numbers, you could help us see through to some level of organic growth for the European franchise. Thanks.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: We've tried to do our best to give you the business drivers, so if you go to our operational performance package, what you will see is that European payment volumes grew two points faster than they did last quarter. So, it was 7% growth last quarter, 9% this quarter, and that is item 2 in the operational performance data, so you can see that.</p><p>And then in the commentary we talked about cross-border been quite strong in Europe. We are seeing a huge amount of inbound commerce into the UK, certainly helped by the pound. Generally speaking, cross-border across Europe is quite strong. Helped by the weakening euro, Europe is definitely a beneficiary of a lot of inbound commerce.</p><p>And then in terms of transactions, I think you heard us say in our comments that transaction growth rates in Europe were stable. We're moving very well in terms of all the other actions you want to take in Europe, as it relates to cost and so on.</p><p>So, all in all, as Al said earlier, we feel very good about both Europe's financial performance and also the accretion that we anticipated this year. We are on track to do as well as or better than we had assumed we would this year.</p><p>GEORGE MIHALOS: Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Darrin Peller from Barclays.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Thanks, guys. Just a little bit of a followup on that, and then on the incentive side again. First, can you help us understand, is there a way that you can tell us what the pro forma growth revenue growth rate would've been had you owned Visa Europe this time last year?</p><p>And then part of your guidance obviously some seems predicated on, as you said, Vasant, incentives being notably higher than the run rate in both fourth quarter and now the first quarter was the same as a percentage of gross. You had USAA and Costco both in there.</p><p>I know a lot of the European banks were done already. Why would it increase that level? Thanks again, guys.</p><p>AL KELLY: There were a couple of deals that we thought would close in the first quarter that have just drifted into the second quarter. And a couple of them are big deals outside of the United States. And so, we have pretty good insight to what the second quarter is going to look like, based on the fact that these deals are either have closed or were at the very last level of red-lining the deal.</p><p>We have pretty good insight. So, I think the guidance that you heard from Vasant is good guidance.</p><p>In terms of the first part of your question, we are not in a position to start getting into a lot of the detail on Visa Europe individually, and I think we are very excited to have moved to a one-Visa concept that is quickly as we possibly can. We are going to be happy to able to talk about it on a total global company basis.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to divide up the reports, the financial reports into this is Visa Europe's performance separately. We try to help you as much as we could in the business drivers to give you a feel for how Europe is performing and how the business is actually performing on an organic basis if you adjust for Europe. And then I think the other question you asked was why would we expect incentives to be higher this year than the fourth-quarter of last year.</p><p>It's a variety of reasons, some of which we walked through on the call last time. Some of it has to do with all the accounting for the rebates worked, post the acquisition of Visa Europe. It's Visa Europe coming into our numbers, it is Costco and USAA being in there for the full year, and it's some of these renewals that we were anticipating this year that Al mentioned.</p><p>So, what we told you is what we still expect. And that's why we indicated that what you saw in the first quarter was a result of some delays, but the overall full-year expectation for client incentives does not change.</p><p>OPERATOR: Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Hi, thank you. I will ask on the debit routing modification that caught a lot of news when it was announced in December.</p><p>With you taking up guidance here, does it seem to be a big issue from a P&amp;L standpoint? Just curious if you can comment on how impactful that modification or clarification has been or could be to your P&amp;L. Thanks.</p><p>AL KELLY: Per the request of the FTC, we made the clarification, but I think that for the most part, we were acting in the appropriate fashion. But we have seen very little impact of any meaningful level on the business, whatsoever.</p><p>OPERATOR: Dan Perlin, RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>DAN PERLIN, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Hi, quick question on India. You talked about significantly increasing transactions, but not driving much revenue, and part of that was a function of the Indian government asking you guys to keep prices subdued for a little period of time.</p><p>I'm wondering, as you think about the guidance that you just gave us, are you assuming more normalized pricing in that horizon? If not, when would you expect that to somewhat normalize in your opinion?</p><p>AL KELLY: I think we are assuming some pricing in that model. I don't think we are -- I would say, being fairly conservative in what we expect to be able to gain in terms of revenue. This is, I think for us, very importantly and strategically, this is a build opportunity that the government really has put out there in front of us.</p><p>And so, in my mind, at this point, I am much more focused on capitalizing on this opportunity and investing heavily behind driving both awareness for consumers and incentive for merchants to get signed up. There's only a very fractional amount of the merchant community in India that is enabled today to be able to accept electronic or digitized payments. And we want to try to get that number up as much as we possibly can.</p><p>I think when you consider the economics of the investments we'll make in India, plus a fairly conservative pricing, it's certainly not going to be a market in this fiscal year that is going to drive a lot of profit for us. But I think it's a great year for us to make sure that we do everything we can in one of the two largest-population countries in the world to get as good a position as we can to help us over the next decade.</p><p>DAN PERLIN: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ken Bruce, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p><p>KEN BRUCE, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thanks, good afternoon. My question also relates to Europe. I'm hoping you might be able or willing to compare and contrast the go-to-market strategy with the issuers, and how -- what you are doing or what you plan to do in Europe differs from the US.</p><p>You pointed out that you've got a very incentive-driven market here in the US, and you are able, you've been very successful in terms of using the interchange framework here to drive a lot of issuer wins. Can you maybe help us understand how you are attacking Europe differently?</p><p>AL KELLY: I think, Ken, Europe is almost a number of different segments in and of itself. Europe for us right now is hugely dominated by the UK, where we have most of the debit market taken up. Then there is four or five other markets across the EU where we have a reasonable amount of business.</p><p>And then there's a number of big economies, certainly Germany being one example, where it's still a heavy cash society, where I think we've got a lot of opportunity, in the medium to longer term, to see more of commerce digitized or in some form of electronic form. Europe is also different than the United dates in terms of processing. Where there are in certain markets domestic processing schemes, and we've got a strategy to try to win more processing volume in Europe, as well.</p><p>So, we are engaging I would say, hopefully, what I believe to be a thoughtful segmented approach with different issuers, and different acquirers on a country-by-country basis, because each of these countries is different. And having spent most of my life as an issuer, on the issuing side of the business, I know full well that the issuing business is really a local consumer business, and you've got to figure out the right strategy on a market-by-market basis. We are not going to have a pan-European strategy, it's really going to be a market-by-market strategy within Europe.</p><p>OPERATOR: Lisa Ellis from Bernstein.</p><p>LISA ELLIS, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO.: Hi, good afternoon. Al, I just wanted to ask you if you wouldn't mind commenting on two areas that you did not explicitly mention in the strategy that you laid out. One is Visa's expansion into adjacent markets, like remittance or potentially into B2B, and what your plans are there.</p><p>And then secondly, when you mentioned partnerships you did not call out the big tech firms, like Apple, PayPal, Alipay, et cetera. I'm curious if you have a comment there. Thanks.</p><p>AL KELLY: On the latter, Lisa, I think I maybe shorthanded it, but I did say that we are working with all the pays. And so, it's all of those pays. And we are at different stages of relationship with all of them, but obviously they're increasingly important payment people in the payments ecosystem as mobile devices become an important form factor in the digital world. So, absolutely, we are working with them.</p><p>Look, I think there is a lot of vectors for growth for Visa. And the whole commercial space and disbursements of different kinds and business-to-business kinds of payments are very much on our radar screen. We have a group of people headed by a very senior person who is dedicated to this space now.</p><p>We are not as strong a player as we would like to be, but we are staffed up and spending a lot of time on this issue. And it's something that we do want to get a stronger position in the whole commercial and B2B space.</p><p>OPERATOR: Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities.</p><p>MOSHE KATRI, ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: Thanks for taking my question. Can we get an update on the PayPal agreement in terms of where we are, and in that context, going back to Visa Europe, have we seen any change in issuer attrition while you are renewing your book there? Thanks a lot.</p><p>AL KELLY: In terms of the latter question first, I think either in mine or Vasant's remarks, we talk about the fact that a lot of our issuer volume in Visa Europe is under contract. So, we actually bought Visa Europe at a time where we've got a pretty good book of business that is going to be with us for a while. That said, as I said in my remarks, I am very much a client-focused person, we're going to work hard with every single one of our clients in Europe as well as around the world; but we do have a lot of good long-term relationships locked up.</p><p>In terms of PayPal, I'd say that everything is progressing as planned. Our issuer clients who are very important to us, obviously, are engaged with PayPal and they are working to migrate customers off of ACH back onto their cards. PayPal has been executing marketing campaigns, changes in their user experience to make it much easier for Visa card holders to pay with their Visa card and to make it their default payment option.</p><p>OPERATOR: Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities.</p><p>ERIC WASSERSTROM, ANALYST, GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES LLC: Thanks very much. My question, Vasant, is just on the use of CP and short-term debt rather than the debt issuance that you had planned. What motivated that decision, [briefly] given that the rate environment presumably would be pretty good still for term debt?</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: The fact is that we have offshore cash, and let's say we issued $2 billion of long-term debt and were able to repatriate somewhere [in the region] of $8 billion of offshore cash, either because there is a change in the rules that allows it to happen tax efficiently, or because we are able to as part of our -- some thoughts and ideas we have on the reorganization in Europe, been able to repatriate cash. We would have more cash than we need to keep for settlement guarantees and all that.</p><p>And that excess cash is available. So, that is the reason to wait a bit, and see whether we want to use our own cash rather than lock in more long-term debt. This is something we monitor on a regular basis, and if there any changes on that front, we will certainly let you know.</p><p>OPERATOR: Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.</p><p>BRYAN KEANE, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Hi, just want to ask, in the US debit market you talked about some headwinds due to the PIN debit routing choices. Is that a shift from Interlink to other EFT networks? Or are you guys seeing or think you are going to see a switch in the market towards more pin versus signature?</p><p>And quickly secondly, on cross-border volume, what are you guys expecting exactly in the guidance, continue at these elevated levels or to fall back down? Thanks.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: On the first question, what we talked about was really that our signature debit business actually stepped up in growth rates by 3 points this quarter. That's driven a lot by USAA. All we were referring to was switch-away from our PIN debit volume, which would be Interlink volume.</p><p>Some of it is because either the Interlink volume declined this quarter as it did last quarter, some of it we told you was because we were lapping a significant win from the fourth-quarter of 2015. And then some of it was because volume moved to other PIN debit networks, so it is all around volume away from our PIN debit network, or hard comparisons for our PIN debit volumes, versus prior years.</p><p>So, that was the answer on that one. What was the other question?</p><p>BRYAN KEANE: Cross-border volume.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: I think as I said in my comments, the first 28 months, cross-border volume is certainly holding up. The first 28 days of January, cross-border volumes growth was certainly holding up.</p><p>But the dollar has strengthened, so our go-forward assumptions assume that a cross-border growth rate is healthy, but perhaps a little bit of a moderation in the rate of growth than what we saw in the first quarter. So, we will wait and see.</p><p>OPERATOR: Jason Deleeuw, Piper Jaffray.</p><p>JASON DELEEUW, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY &amp; CO.: Thanks. I was hoping to get an update on Visa Checkout, what some of the current investments are right now on the consumer merchant side. What is the longer-term vision for Visa Checkout, and how does that fit in with the partnerships with the other pays? Thank you.</p><p>AL KELLY: We think of Visa Checkout as a platform, and it's all part of us trying to make sure that we are a leader in terms of bringing potential solutions to the market. Because we feel very good about the fact that we now are up to $18 million users signed up for Visa Checkout. It happens to also be a very active base of customers in terms of usage of Visa Checkout.</p><p>We are facilitating more of our issuer clients to put their products side by side embedded within Visa Checkout. And at this stage, the pays are out there obviously doing their thing, as well. And we are going to continue to work with them.</p><p>I think it's too early to tell how all of this is going to shake out. My personal view is that there are too many wallets out there, consumers are not going to ultimately want to have 50 wallets, and we are not necessarily anxious to be in the wallets business, per se. But we are anxious to be -- to take advantage of us being a trusted acceptance mark in the payments eco space, and want to be able to make sure that we are taking a leading position in establishing Visa as a trusted mark, and as an important partners to our issuers, in terms of them trying to establish as much volume as they can get in the digital space.</p><p>OPERATOR: Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>JAMES SCHNEIDER, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Wondering if you could maybe comment on the impact broadly that you expect from the Trump administration and other congressional policies. Both in terms of tax policy, regulatory impacts, or other impacts, and maybe talk about some of the largest positive or largest potentially negative things you can see in the future.</p><p>AL KELLY: Jim, I think it's too early to tell. We are barely two weeks into this presidency. And while the president has been active with executive orders, I think as things start to settle down and we get into more specific policies, and his cabinet is confirmed and in place, and the legislature gets going, I think it remains to be seen what happens.</p><p>I will tell you this, that we have a world-class group of government relations people, we are already fully engaged as much as we can in the relevant conversations in Washington. But I think there are things that relate to trade, relate to taxes, all of which could play into our business, but I honestly think it's too early to start to speculate. And we're certainly not building anything into our plans, positively or negatively for that matter, related to any policies that might come out. But I can assure you that we are watching it very closely.</p><p>JACK CARSKY, HEAD OF GLOBAL IR, VISA INC.: Thanks, Jim.</p><p>OPERATOR: James Faucette, Morgan Stanley.</p><p>JAMES FAUCETTE, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thank you very much. Wanted to follow up on that. You talked about having visited with a lot of customers, as well as government officials, et cetera, around the world since you've taken on the CEO role.</p><p>Can you talk and summarize a little bit what the particular regulators are asking from Visa, and what their objectives are, and how Visa can help fulfill those? And I guess what has happened in India creates an interesting lens through which to view that, so, maybe you can elaborate a little bit on some of those relations, et cetera. Thanks.</p><p>AL KELLY: I have talked to regulators in both very developed markets, as well as regulators in developing and emerging markets, and I think that the content and tenor of the conversations is a bit different, depending upon who you talk to. There are governments around the world who very much are seeking a close partnership with us. Their desirous of learning how they can be helped in moving to a much more of a cashless society.</p><p>How they can get many more of the people in their countries actually engaged in a financial system, how there could be greater financial literacy. And so, in those particular cases, I would say that we are trying to take a very active role, and in some cases a very proactive role, in helping shape how the government thinks about what steps they ought to take.</p><p>Including, by the way, in some cases working with governments to have them be a role model by making sure that they are moving away from paper in favor of a digitized world. So, for example, in Egypt instead of vouchers being handed out, giving people prepaid cards so that they can in fact begin to start to have an experience with plastic. And what that does is it automatically start setting up and incenting a whole merchant network to get built out as these people have to have a place to go to be able to spend their money that is on these prepaid cards. And merchants in this particular example, who are involved in food and beverage, for instance, want to be able to get their fair share of that volume. So they are very quickly incented to get to a point where they can accept plastic and be signed up as a merchant.</p><p>In more developed countries, there are countries where the ship has sailed, and they've made decision on interchange, as an example. Probably Australia and Europe being two real examples there, where I think now it's just a matter of what does that mean and how does that play out for issuers and consumers in those markets?</p><p>I think there are countries that I've talked to, where there is pressure on both sides of, say, the finance ministers in countries where some of the merchant coalitions want to see lower interchange. But in markets, for example, where reward propositions are big on plastic, or on whatever form of payment vehicle it is, the consumer is going to get hurt in terms of those programs if interchange is lowered, because it's a two-sided market. The economics sector, there's only so much economics and people do what they'll have to do to make sure that they stay economically viable.</p><p>So, I think there are a number of markets where, truthfully, the government is trying to stay out of it and let the free market system takeover. And I think in general, there is markets where the regulators are taking a very active role, and in other cases, I think, a much more passive role. Again, often quite different, depending on the specific country we are talking about.</p><p>JACK CARSKY: Thanks, James. We have time for one more question.</p><p>OPERATOR: Tom McCrohan from CLSA.</p><p>TOM MCCROHAN, ANALYST, CLSA: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. You've covered so much ground on the call, I will ask a simple question. Total integration cost of $450 million to $500 million over the next three years, any change to that?</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: We said it was $80 million this year, we will wait and see how things go, and give you any updates as we get towards the end of the year on future outlook. But at this point, really, we wouldn't say anything different about the future. We expect that we will spend the $80 million we thought we would spend this year.</p><p>TOM MCCROHAN: Thank you.</p><p>JACK CARSKY: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has any follow-up questions, feel free to call Investor Relations.</p><p>And when we have a set date for our June investor day, we will put that out in the public domain. Thank you, all.</p><p>AL KELLY: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Highlights:</p><p>1. Had another excellent qtr.</p><p>2. Grew FFO by 8.5%, AFFO by 16.4% and same property cash NOI by 7.7%.</p><p>3. Straight line value of office leases signed was 23% greater than prior leases for same space.</p><p>4. Made good progress on two multifamily development projects.</p><p>5. As is true everywhere, tenants are now struggling with impacts of pandemic on their business.</p><p>1. Cities in which Co. operates, passed unusually punitive ordinances, prohibiting evictions and allowing rent deferral for residential, retail and office tenants regardless of financial distress, by eliminating any fees or interest and providing long payback periods; tenants essentially have option of free of rent.</p><p>6. April Rent Collections:</p><p>1. To date, collections represent 87% of aggregate rent bill, with residential at 95%, office at 90% and small retail component at 22%.</p><p>2. Doesn't know whether April will prove to be good predictor of next few months or remainder of year.</p><p>7. While Co. also does not know how long pandemic will last, over numerous cycles during last 30 years, designed operating platform, capital structure and investment strategy to weather downturns.</p><p>1. Entered this downturn with strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet.</p><p>8. At 1Q-end, had $175m of cash on hand, undrawn $400m line of credit, no debt maturities before 2023, no financial covenant that could force Co. to issue equity at wrong time, and 41% of office portfolio is unencumbered.</p><p>1. Therefore, owns many of highest quality properties in strongest, most desirable submarkets of Los Angeles.</p><p>9. Diverse tenant base represents, nation's most competitive industries and limits vulnerability to any single-tenant or industry.</p><p>10. Markets have no meaningful new supply, so faces no overhang from new construction, as recovering from this crisis.</p><p>1Q20 Operations (K.C.)</p><p>1. Overview:</p><p>1. On operational front, buildings remained open, safe and available for tenants.</p><p>2. Focuses on providing excellent service, while ensuring stringent cleaning protocols, safe distancing, face covered in common areas and reduced elevator density.</p><p>1. As one might expect, sees lower tenants in office properties, which will likely continue at least until lifting of stay-at-home orders.</p><p>3. During this time, expects some savings from variable expenses to help offset expected declines in parking revenue.</p><p>4. Cities where Co. primarily operates, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica, have all enacted enforcement moratoriums to cover residential, retail and office tenants.</p><p>1. Ordinances had some carve outs for large tenants and generally prohibit landlords not only from evicting tenants, but also from imposing any late fees or interest.</p><p>1. Under ordinances, tenants are required to pay back deferred rent within 3-12 months after end of emergency.</p><p>5. On capital front, construction is continuing on two large multifamily development projects, although it may take a little longer under current conditions.</p><p>6. In Honolulu, where Co. is developing 500 apartment units for office conversion project, already pre-leased a number of units and expects to deliver them over next few months.</p><p>7. For Brentwood apartment tower, currently expects delivery of first units to be pushed into 2022.</p><p>1. For the moment, suspended work at new office repositioning projects and acquisitions in markets seem to be on hold as buyers and sellers evaluate new conditions.</p><p>8. Well positioned to take advantage of any opportunities and emerge.</p><p>1Q20 Lease Details (S.M.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. Had 174 office leases, covering 702,000 sq. ft., including 184,000 sq. ft. of new lease.</p><p>2. Leasing spreads 22.6% for straight-line rent roll-up, 9.3% for cash roll-up.</p><p>3. As discussed last qtr., had high number of expirations impact 1Q and anticipated early (inaudible) occupancy this year.</p><p>1. Decline in occupancy for total office portfolio to 90.8% was in line with pre-COVID-19 expectations.</p><p>4. By late March, pace of new leasing and office portfolio slowed to trickle, but starting to see some signs of life as tenants and brokers adjust to new normal.</p><p>1. Often talked about how Co. makes leasing experience and small tenant office portfolio mirror ease and speed of that in apartments.</p><p>1. Thereby, Co. was early adopters of virtual touring technology and well equipped to complete entire leasing process remotely, from tour to space planning to electronic document execution.</p><p>2. This experience should serve well in current environment and going forward.</p><p>5. Multifamily; portfolio remained essentially fully leased at 98%.</p><p>6. Residential new leasing activity slowed somewhat in late March but not to same extent as office.</p><p>1Q20 Financials (P.S.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. YoverY growth:</p><p>1. Revenues 12.1%.</p><p>2. FFO 3.5% to $112m or $0.55 per share.</p><p>3. AFFO 16.4% to $99m.</p><p>4. Same property cash NOI 7.7%.</p><p>2. Only 4.1% of revenues, G&amp;A remains, well below of benchmark group.</p><p>3. Doesn't know what will happen in May or in subsequent months.</p><p>1. Any things could change even before stay-in-place orders begin to be lifted.</p><p>4. Many of Co.'s small tenants applied for federal assistance, which can be forgiven if they pay their rent by June.</p><p>5. Local governments that have authorized rent deferrals are considering excluding office tenants, which would reduce or eliminate that headwind.</p><p>1. These things can start to recover as tenants come closer to end of their existing leases.</p><p>6. Could see more tenants stop paying rent if impact of business grows.</p><p>1. Aforementioned uncertainties are compounded by many other critical variables on which Co. has little information:</p><p>1. How long the current stay-in-place orders remain.</p><p>2. How they are phased out.</p><p>3. How businesses react after they are phased out.</p><p>4. Whether there is second pandemic wave in fall.</p><p>7. While in past recessions, tenants have shown lower default rates, Co. can't be sure what will happen this time.</p><p>1. Thereby withdrew guidance for all of 2020.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jason Green at Evercore.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a question on the tenants who have not paid rent, do you have any insight as to how many of those tenants are experiencing real financial distress versus how many are just opportunistically seeking rent relief?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, DOUGLAS EMMETT, INC.: Considering -- this is Jordan. And I'm sorry our voices sound so -- don't have their normal rich timbre, but we have 5 people in a 46-person conference room spread out in respect to social distancing, and we probably would feel the microphone also needs to be 6 feet away. But anyway, the -- when it comes to the office tenants, and you know the office markets we're in and you know our credit underwriting, I think we feel pretty good about our tenants' ability to pay. It's hard to go in. I mean everyone is impacted by this. When it comes to our retail tenants, we actually have some large retail tenants that probably can pay, but you can understand why they're not. And as you saw, the residential came in around 95%.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN: Got it. I guess just one more on capital allocation. You guys announced the approval of a share repurchase program in the quarter but didn't repurchase any shares when the stock hit the mid- to low-$20 level. I guess just what was the thinking behind not repurchasing shares when it got down to that level?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, we set up that program to make sure we had that flexibility. But at the same time, we -- I don't know then or even now whether we have the right kind of visibility to know what we're facing, whether it's months, years, whatever, to know exactly what we want to do. So the first stage of what we've been doing has been kind of organizing the company, for starters, to keep it protected and running right -- run our buildings right and keep our people employed, do all that stuff right. And then the second stage is to look for opportunities. And I think we've done a good job with the first step, and we're starting to evaluate the second step.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Craig Mailman at KeyBanc Capital Markets.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I know it's a little bit early in May here but just curious what the early trends you guys are seeing, if you're on the same pace you were in April or if more people are maybe taking advantage of the moratoriums that are in place.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, we're -- right now, we're tracking about the same as April. Although it's -- in terms of business days, it's early to know where we're really going to end up in May. And I think that we are seeing some tenants are starting to get the PPP, and I think we've also been pressuring some tenants saying what you're doing is not right. And frankly, we've been talking to some of the cities and saying to them, you've put together programs that are more punitive than any of the other gateway markets in the United States. It's almost kind of you're almost asking the tenants to not pay with the way you're providing this sort of free 12-month loan. So with all of those things swirling around, juxtaposed with the fact that now it's -- now we're in our second month of COVID and stay-in-place, it's hard to know how we'll really end up.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN: Okay. That's helpful. And then the big themes of work from home and easing of densification are kind of topics in the office space. I'm just curious, you guys tend to skew smaller, just your thoughts on kind of how dense your tenants got versus maybe some of the larger tech firms and whether this work-from-home could just cause some of your smaller tenants to just say, you know what, I'll just do my work at the house, if it's kind of a small company. Just kind of curious, as you guys have kind of looked through that, kind of thoughts here.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well -- okay, so the first part of your question, I -- this is very hard -- I mean, I don't -- frankly, we don't have a lot more information than you guys do. But I will say that in terms of our market, generally, our market, I do not think that our markets are built to the density that other gateway markets are built to, just right out of the gate. So we're still building out most people's space. Our space, for instance, and many others is built to 200 feet plus in terms of the build-out. And when you get to very small -- we're in about 50,000 feet. But when you get to really small tenants, those numbers are even larger. So I'm not sure for a lot of these small tenants that we've evaluated our space.</p><p>We have some areas we need to work on. I'm not sure that they're not in a relatively good position to come back even with no changes to the build-out of their space. But I think the densification that has been rolling -- that kind of rolled through the last decade, whether it be New York or Boston or the big tech floors up in San Francisco, I'm sure that they're trying to figure out how to loosen that up. Now you would just -- that, by itself, you go, wow, that could be a pretty good net positive for those markets. But I don't know if what that means is that they just say, all right, we'll keep this space, but we're going to move another group to another area, or I don't know what happens there.</p><p>The second part of your question was whether our smaller tenants are going to choose to just stay home and work. I think for most of our tenants that -- they've always been able to do that, and they like having their offices, especially our whole play here is that we're a very short commute from where they live. And I've literally been saying for decades, these guys should all move out of their houses and move into their office space because what they're spending for these houses on an imputed per foot basis, the office space is a bargain and a half. I think they like having their offices. I think they like having somewhere to work. So I don't see the fact that people have been able to work from home causing them to say, wow, now I'm just going to work from home.</p><p>I've always felt like the fact -- and when we talk to people even now, I think most people are saying, I can't wait to not be home 24/7. I want to get out of all this. I want to go back to work. And I know they have the concerns about the virus and things being clean and safe and all the rest of it, but I think it's human nature to want to be able to not be in one place all the time.</p><p>So I've always felt like that's been going off for probably 2 decades now, what technology has done in terms of people being able to work from home is to expand the workforce and people that couldn't come into an office and work or couldn't -- or for whatever they were doing, it was an efficiency thing, and it allowed the workforce to be even larger and add more people to the workforce. I don't think the part of the workforce that comes in the office, works with their colleagues, use that as part of like the way their day runs, I don't think that changes.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Jamie Feldman, Bank of America.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR US OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL REIT ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I guess just thinking about your liquidity position, and I know you're cutting back on some spending this year, can you kind of -- can you still just walk us through how you're thinking about your spending needs this year, and then to the extent you see dislocation in the market, how you think about potentially funding any investment opportunity? Or do you feel like you're not even ready for that at this point?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, I'm not sure how long the list of investment opportunities is at the moment. We aren't seeing a lot come out. And by not a lot, I'm not -- I'm saying pretty much almost nothing. Probably the opportunities in front of us on the capital market side is 3 groups. It's refinancing, we are focused on that because rates, as they go down, we just always aggressively chase them. And then you have -- obviously, we put the stock buyback program in place, but I don't think we're ready to do that at the moment at least. And then you have the construction, the third-party construction, and we have chosen to continue our 2 large projects. We backed off on probably another $100 million of stuff that we can do during the year in terms of building repositionings, lobby rehabs, et cetera, to make sure that our cash position was very strong.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: So I guess, how do you think about like sources and uses this year with kind of your revised capital plan?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, I think our income will be sufficient to fund our uses. If you're asking me the simple question do I think we're sort of trapped in something where we're forced to be a net borrower, I don't think we are. And I don't project that even with the fact that I think we ended up 12% off in April or something like that continuing, I think we're in plenty good shape.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Okay. And I guess, similar with the distribution at the current level, cover everything?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, if you're asking me does the distribution cover our income, I think we're in fine shape. I think the dividend, you're talking about the public company dividend, right?</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Yes.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Yes. So yes, I think we're -- no problem there at all.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Okay. All right. And then as you -- can you just talk about what the co-working companies are doing in your markets now? I mean have they been -- I know you don't have any, but are they paying rent? Are they -- are you hearing that they're crumbling? Just any color from the ground.</p><p>KEVIN ANDREW CRUMMY, CIO, DOUGLAS EMMETT, INC.: It's kind of case -- this is Kevin, Jamie. It's kind of case by case. The -- and speaking with my peers in the marketplace, some of the larger co-working companies are paying and some of the other ones are asking for a little rent relief right now while people aren't using their offices. But we don't have very much exposure in West L.A., so it's anecdotally throughout the market. And I know that the -- WeWork has paid some landlords and not paid some other landlords just like across the country.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Emmanuel Korchman at Citi.</p><p>EMMANUEL KORCHMAN, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: If we think about the 90% collections in the office portfolio, is there any commonality, whether it be by industry or by size or by some other characteristic of the 10% that haven't paid, other than the fact that the municipalities have given them the right not to?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Frankly, if you -- and I've kind of been on the road on this with the various city councils in the cities we're working in. There is a shocking relationship between not paying and the rules surrounding the moratorium in the various cities that how well people pay or don't pay. So we -- I don't want to call out any cities, and I think they're working to fix this situation for us. But in the cities where blanket and there's literally no cost and long payback periods, we -- meaningfully, statistically meaningfully worse collections than the cities that had more restrictions, maybe you could still charge fees but certainly the payback much shorter, so the benefit of kind of having an angry landlord wasn't as much there than better pay rates. That's the one thing you can see in that last group that really stands out.</p><p>EMMANUEL KORCHMAN: And then in terms of your new leasing, it looks like the leasing costs were elevated. I don't know if that had to do with mix and the base rents in that pool were higher or if it just had to do with spaces. But could you give us some color as to why those -- the new leasing costs specifically seem higher than recent trends?</p><p>PETER D. SEYMOUR, CFO, DOUGLAS EMMETT, INC.: Yes. I mean, look, I think -- this is Peter. There's the overall rate ends up much lower, right? So we had a much lower on the renewal side. And then the new leasing, we did a small number of deals and a couple of them were at slightly higher cost, but it doesn't look like it's indicative of any kind of trend. And as a percentage of rent, the rent that we're giving is the combined blended rent. So when you take that -- when you take new leasing just over the new leasing rents, it's pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER SANDLER &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: You guys are pretty brave to all be in the same room together. So...</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: It's such a huge conference room, it's almost absurd.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Now everyone is realizing that their homes are not big enough. Two questions. First, can you just talk a little bit about Hawaii? It sounds like the state overall has been fine COVID-wise and that, hopefully, it can start to reopen. But clearly, it's going to be a while before tourism returns. So your products out there, the apartments, the office, what are you guys seeing? And is your view that tourism absolutely has to return before you can see benefits in your properties? Or do you think the local economy is sufficient enough for you guys to continue the building conversions and pushing rents and all that good stuff?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, I'll tell you, first of all, if there is a group that I think has worked hard and done a good job, what I've seen happen in Hawaii, they've really jumped on it. They did well with COVID. I thought the city, city-state, county leaders, whatever that group is, they're all kind of mashed together, did a really nice job. They have 4 local banks there. They got -- because we -- for the stuff we do in Hawaii, we use local banks. We got conversations with them. They were really aggressive. Literally midnight, the first round of PPP, they made sure they got all the local companies covered and got a good chunk of money out to all of them. You saw really good engagement out of the mayor and others in terms of walking the line to what's open, not open construction. So in terms of management, I really -- maybe it's because they're all like a big family there, they all know each other. But I give them a really high grade.</p><p>So I'm hoping that -- and they're super focused on recovery and protecting their economy. Now they, for sure, have the problem of being a very tourist-dependent economy. They have construction. They have a huge chunk of military in there. They have other stuff, but tourism is a big deal. Now I know that they are working as hard as any hotel company or any airline to go how do we solve this and how do we make people feel comfortable coming back when the time is right.</p><p>On the other side of the coin, when you talk about Douglas Emmett and our resident -- our residential projects are going -- our construction is going there, and our occupancy is fine, and our pay rate is fine, all good. On our office projects, they're -- interestingly, we went into Hawaii originally, now it was 2 decades ago, with the thought that a run-up in tourism and facing Asia would be very good for that economy and then now would flow through to the office product. And that was what we do, office and residential, so that's what we did.</p><p>Hawaii is where we learned that tourism, for sure to the plus side, as tourism kept running up, we did not see it roll through to the office product. So we saw tourism -- when we went into Hawaii, I think the tourism was like $4 million to $5 million; and last year, probably $9 million, $10 million, right? So you would have said, wow, you called it right, but that did not drive much in terms of the office product. I'm not sure that, that decline will drive much in the way of the office product. But overall, having a strong economy is going to be important. And I think more than any of the other places where we operate, they are just collectively growing as a team to make sure that Hawaii, that doesn't suffer too much. So we've been very happy about that.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Okay. And then the second question, Jordan. When you have the discussions with your local California politicians and they do the eviction moratoriums, I'm sure in their wisdom, they also put in place a real estate tax moratorium, so it offsets and doesn't put the landlord in the middle position. So when you raise that point -- well, because California is very logical and it understands how math works. So when you raise that point to the politicians, do they understand that? I mean I know that Gavin was facing that, the payment, a few weeks ago, but do they understand the ramifications and your ability to -- maybe not Doug E directly but landlords in general to withhold taxes if they're not being paid because of government mandates?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, I didn't use quite the level of sarcasm that you used since I'm trying to get them to do something for me, but I did point out that essentially, when these -- the impact of these moratoriums, what it's been is to essentially -- is to shift us, shift the -- if it exists, the borrowing responsibility to us versus a tenant, and I don't know why that would be a fair shift. Now to be fair to their point, they are worried about mostly -- so most of these ordinances were designed, first of all, by non-real estate people that were -- all they were thinking about was residential. And they literally, when you talk to them, they're like, oh, yes, office.</p><p>I don't think they were really targeting office. What they were targeting was residential. And then when you talk about it, they go,</p><p>\"Well, we don't want to treat our local retailers to go away because it's part of the fabric and culture of the area, right? We don't want a bunch of empty storefronts.\" And I would say, across the board, when you sit and talk to them about that and you talk about it like, look, you were really trying to protect housing, no evictions on housing, you're really trying to protect your local retailers, they have been very open-minded about making a change for the rest.</p><p>The problem is they're just inundated with problems, right, not to mention that their budgets are just destroyed now. So getting their attention, which we've been able to get, and getting the city attorneys to change and redraft these emergency ordinances, it's just a time-intensive process, and we're going through that with them, but they have not been -- they haven't been that tough on this thing. When we explained it to them and we said, look, I think you're trying to include -- they go -- well, they'll say commercial. Well, who are you saying we are covering or not? I say, well, I think you're trying to cover people who collect sales tax on a majority of their revenue. I don't think you're trying to cover hedge funds in my office building. I'm like, oh, yes, you're right, there is a difference between them. That's the first time they even started splitting retail from office.</p><p>A lot of these things only have commercial. It doesn't say retail or office. So they're sort of accepting that. I think they're going to make the right changes in that, but it's taken -- just in time, you got to think of -- I mean these things got put in place like the beginning of April. And here we are a month later, and we've gotten meetings with them, with the top -- with the mayors, council members, and they're working on it. So that's been very good.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Right. But they understand that you can't be the middleman or a lender of last resort. Like if you suffer implodes on the top, obviously, it's going to -- you shouldn't be expected to pay out at the bottom. They understand that, right?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: They haven't understood that because we're still paying all our city business taxes and fees. But as I said, I'm not putting it to them like that because I want -- we're trying to achieve this goal of getting commercial released.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from John Kim at BMO.</p><p>FRANK LEE, SENIOR ASSOCIATE, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: This is Frank Lee on with John. First question I have is do you have a sense of what percentage of your multifamily rents are currently delinquent. And can you walk us through your plans on addressing any of this?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, yes. So that -- unhappily, that 5% that did pay, and maybe this is just math but I think it's a little more than math, it seemed to be highly concentrated with tenants that pay to be in some of the nicest spaces in our buildings on the beach with rents that are very high. And certainly, they're renting that space because they have a lot of net worth, and they wanted to be looking out at the beach and walking out on the sand. And so that -- when I was looking at that listing, and I actually just took the list and ranked it by rent, like by rent, and I feel like if we -- just we're collecting from the people that paid over -- I think it was $4,000, you would collect like a ton of that money. And if someone's paying</p><p>$4,000 for their apartment, they probably can afford to pay.</p><p>But those rules are set in stone. Those people just have been told flat they don't have to pay. I've told the cities -- they don't want to hear it about apartments, by the way, but I've told them, you realize that the tenants that feel they're the most financially sophisticated seem to be the ones taking the most use of these ordinances, not the -- your normal run of the mill person who's like, yes, I don't want to have my rent pile up on me, I got to live here, and they're just paying the rent. So it's the ones that kind of feel like, yes, no problem, I'll pick up the extra money and I'll pay it later, they seem to be the ones that are making up a lot of that missed money. But that will play out.</p><p>FRANK LEE: And then what's your expectation to recoup that 5%-ish of kind of lost rent from those tenants?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, it's hard to predict now. We haven't even -- we're trying to get the collection rate higher each month, and then we'll go back. And as I've said, we have -- we're pretty good at our underwriting when we lease space. We never -- in the last recession, we never had defaults. So you're talking about defaults here, not the city's allowing them not to pay but then later they pay, real defaults. I don't think our defaults ever really got over 2%. I don't think they did. They might have gotten to 3%, but I don't think they really got above 2%. Now what happens to us in a recession is we pick up vacancy and maybe rents go down, but we are really good on the default front. So if you say default on those numbers, I would expect them to be low, but time to collect seems to be stretched.</p><p>FRANK LEE: Okay. And then second question I have is, if I look at your top tenant list, did all these tenants pay April rent? I'm just curious particularly on the lease with Equinox.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: We're -- you know what, we're not -- we never really like talking about tenants, and we don't really like calling out individual tenants, and so we're not going to start today.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Dave Rodgers at Baird.</p><p>DAVID BRYAN RODGERS, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just I guess with your smaller tenants and much faster roll, the shorter lease term that you generally have versus office, I mean what are those discussions like today for the next kind of 3 to 5 months? I mean typically, I think larger deals would be done, but I think you guys do it a little bit more just-in-times. So can you give us a little bit of color on how those discussions are going and what you'd expect here in the near term on some of those near-term rolls?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Yes. I'll give you what little I know. Maybe Stuart knows more. But smaller guys will usually feel like a lot of pressure to get their stuff done about 5 months ahead of when their lease is coming up. So in terms of having data for you on where the world is on renewals right now being a month into this, I can't say that we have a lot of data on that because there's not many people wait until the last day that they had to renew, right? So there's not a lot of data. Leasing is going. We're doing leases. Go ahead, you can fill in on this?</p><p>STUART MCELHINNEY, VP OF IR, DOUGLAS EMMETT, INC.: Yes. No, I think that's fair. I think that a lot of people are just delaying their decisions at this point, but we're still getting a decent amount of leasing done. It's definitely slowed the way down, starting to pick up. I mean we're seeing volume, we're seeing calls, all that stuff's coming back again after shutting down almost completely for a while. And like I said in my remarks, we're pretty well set up with virtual tours, and we're getting -- just trying to get the brokers' community and the tenant community used to this world.</p><p>And the brokers are definitely hungry to do deals. They're not making money when they're not doing deals. So we're seeing it start to come back. I think, like Jordan said, mostly we're seeing our tenants kind of delay their decisions for a little while, but most of our tenants tend to go maybe 6 months before they're -- before the end of their lease is our average when they're making their renewal decision.</p><p>DAVID BRYAN RODGERS: And then I guess maybe just on the rate side, Jordan, it wasn't long ago, we were talking about pushing rate and having tenants really pushing back and complaining and personal phone calls to you, et cetera. As you kind of think about this next phase in terms of where rents are on leases and where you feel comfortable pushing those or pulling those, how are those discussions going? And what's the expectation near term that you think about?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: No, we haven't had any rate discussions. I have had no rate discussions. I don't think we -- I mean, to what -- no. I don't think we've raised rates, and I don't think we've lowered rates, and I think we're doing deals. I mean there's like -- there's a measure of just like social sensitivity or something. I'd be a little nervous to raise rates. Even if the market stays very tight, I'd probably have a little breather for a little while. There's just a lot of tension out there in the world, so you don't -- certainly you don't want to do anything that could ever be viewed as aggressive or predatory or taking advantage, and I think we're going to be equally alert and aware. We operate in small -- obviously, L.A. is not a small community, but in the various markets we're in, we -- we're certainly in a period right now where it's good to have more friends than just kind put of a wall around.</p><p>DAVID BRYAN RODGERS: Okay. And then maybe a last one, if I just could, on the parking. You mentioned parking revenue. How much of that could be at risk or isn't part of or baked into some of the leases on a number basis?</p><p>PETER D. SEYMOUR: Yes. It's Peter. I mean we're probably at this point -- but it's hard to say how it's going to go. We're probably getting about half the parking income that we normally have. But as I said, that's on a very short time period and really hard to see where it's headed to in the next couple of months. And especially as things start to reopen, just don't know which way it's going to go.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, I think they're going to -- when things reopen, I think they're going to drive, they're not going to take a bus. I mean they will want their parking spaces back. I suspect parking becomes a very short-term phenomenon of people being told to stay home.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Rick Anderson at SMBC.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON, RESEARCH ANALYST, SMBC NIKKO SECURITIES AMERICA, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I'll take that question even further. I think there should be a parking REIT in the aftermath of all this because everyone is going to be driving all around the country, in my opinion.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: That might be right.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON: It hasn't come up yet, but not to pile on the regulatory silliness of California, but Prop 13, do you agree with Victor and Hudson that that's on the back burner for now for at least a while?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: I don't think back burner is the right term. Look, it's going to be on the ballot. I think that it is -- I think that we are doing a lot of work to fight it. I think it's a bad idea. And I think -- and it's polling quite poorly. For me, it's not just going to be beating it. I mean we want to really beat it so that we don't have to face it again. I mean it shows up at times from groups that are not really stakeholders in our markets, to be perfectly frank, and they are looking to raise money for their own purposes. And you don't see the state or any of the rest of them saying we think this is a good idea.</p><p>And so we want to make it clear of not just beating it but beating it enough so no one wants to waste their money or our money in the future to having to deal with that again. But I still feel if what Victor said was that he feels confident that we will beat it, I think that's reasonable. I feel pretty confident that we'll beat it and because it's polling so poorly. And Californians in general, not just for that, which is much harder to justify, but even some things for schools and otherwise, have just been saying enough is enough when it comes to taxes, they're just done. And that's unfortunate because we've put some taxes on it, were for very odd and special things during the heyday because maybe some special purpose group talked people into it, and now they're going to really need that money for the general state budget. And so I think there's going to be some shifting there, but we'll see what happens.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON: Okay. Given that you have -- you're known for small tenants in terms of lease size and all that, do you feel like there's any incremental vulnerabilities to your business just in terms of small companies and perhaps less financial wherewithal in this environment that they may perhaps be more exposed to, God forbid, closing down business or that kind of thing? Or is that just not in the conversation right now?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, I don't think the fact that they're small or large plays the role that you're indicating in the impact of the economy on them, their capitalization or them closing down their business. Frankly, most of what I'm reading it's large companies closing down their businesses, not a lot of these smaller ones that are throughout our portfolio. I think that it's fair -- I think it's -- I think they're -- they have an easier time controlling their expenses, and they actually -- when you look at the capital backing them as it relates percentage-wise and all other ways to their rent obligation or all of their costs in running their companies, I think it's actually more capital backing that than some of these larger companies that we know are all over the country that have been running at -- literally like losing money every year and borrowing to support that.</p><p>So I don't think the economy -- if you would have gone back to the last recession, that we'll call it the financial [any's] recession, the bank recession, that was hard on a lot of our companies because, not because they weren't in a good position but sort of the banks stopped lending and doing stuff with all those guys and that was just hard on them, it was hard for new formation. But this doesn't seem to be that kind of recession. So I don't think they will be hit in that way. And I think that if you just look at the industries that they're in, tech, entertainment and medical research and just a lot of them, I actually think that money is going to come, more money into that, into those areas. So I'm not as worried with the small tenants.</p><p>And as I said, even the financial recession, the one that really like banks and liquidity squeeze, that happened in, what, '07,</p><p>'08, '09, whatever you want, '10, we never really experienced more than 2% default. So from that perspective, I feel like we did probably better than a lot of places. And by the way, our rent, because we go into these things without new supply overhang, we don't see the same decline in rents. We have a chart that's on our website that shows that in the last recession, we -- the lowest point of rents for our company in the last recession was still 10% above the previous peak. And that cannot be said for any of the other gateway markets, except Washington D.C., which in the last recession didn't feel the impact, but in all the other markets.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Peter Abramowitz at Jefferies.</p><p>PETER DYLAN ABRAMOWITZ, EQUITY ASSOCIATE, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just want to ask you about the multifamily portfolio specifically. You've had 2 straight quarters of negative same-store revenue growth. So just in comparison, I guess, to some of the apartment peers that are in the 2% to 3% top line growth range, anything specific that's going on to your portfolio that might be a drag there?</p><p>PETER D. SEYMOUR: It's Peter. I don't think there's any specific trend. We've been running at really high, well over 99% for a whole bunch of up quarters. And they're small numbers in the same store, so it's -- yes, it's super sensitive. 1%, I think, is 19 or 20 units. So a little blip and it drives that number down. But at 97.5% leased, it's still an incredibly high lease rate. But early to say whether there's -- what the long-term impacts of this whole pandemic are going to be, but it's certainly going into the end of the quarter, we didn't see any specific trends.</p><p>PETER DYLAN ABRAMOWITZ: Got you. Is the lease rate going down, say, a couple of hundred basis points in the quarter, was that at all pandemic-related in March, the beginning? Because I think the building with the fire was excluded from that, if I read correctly.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: We're not seeing any of that. No, we're not seeing that as a driving force.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Daniel Ismail at Green Street Advisors.</p><p>DANIEL ISMAIL, SENIOR ANALYST, GREEN STREET ADVISORS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Great. Just following up on a previous question about parking revenue, I don't think I heard a percentage of revenues that comes from parking. Are you able to provide that?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: We don't break that out separately. I did say that it's -- we've probably collected about half what we normally do.</p><p>DANIEL ISMAIL: Okay. But is that like low single digits like sub-5% or somewhere higher than that?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Yes, no, we don't break that out. And parking and other is a line item on our income statement. So take that line item and cut it about in half.</p><p>DANIEL ISMAIL: All right. So the majority of that is in parking and not other sources of ancillary income.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Yes. The majority of parking and other is parking.</p><p>DANIEL ISMAIL: Okay. And then, Jordan, given those -- you mentioned the restrictions on evictions, are you able to utilize security deposits and letters of credits to make up some of the shortfall and nonpayment?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: We really haven't been doing that. I think that if we can -- I think we can write that last group if I get these changes in the cities. I'm not -- in the end, of course -- look, there's nothing -- well, maybe something we just said earlier on the call, we have not forgiven any rent, okay? We haven't forgiven any rent for anybody. So this is all -- none of these collections are a function of, well, we may deal with them and we forgave some rent, so -- and I hope that when all is said and done, and I'm not going to say we're never going to forgive any rent, but if we forgive rent, it will be in exchange for some other terms in a lease or some other improvement in a lease or term or whatever the case may be.</p><p>So I don't think pulling security deposits and starting to sort of unravel a lease going kind of [DEFCON 4] on them I just don't think it's the right idea right now. We're just not there right now. I think if we get these moratoriums worked out to be less penalizing, I think a lot of these people are just going, \"I'll pay now.\" I think it's the equivalent of you don't owe your 2019 taxes until July. So now how many people paid their taxes in April because the federal government is hurting? I don't think very many, and that's what we're dealing with. It doesn't make them bad or good. They're just -- they got presented with something and they took it. So we aren't prevented from doing what you said, but I don't think we're really doing it.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Tayo Okusanya at Mizuho.</p><p>OMOTAYO TEJAMUDE OKUSANYA, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES USA LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. A couple of questions from me. The first one, the Barrington Plaza, the apartment complex, could you tell us what the latest is with that in regards to refurbishing the apartments that unfortunately did burn down and kind of what the status is with some of these pending class-action lawsuits?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Let's see. So in terms of the litigation -- I mean we're not going to discuss litigation, but as we've told you, we're insured, that unfortunately, in the world that we're in, people have a hard time not trying to take advantage of disasters. Put that to the side, if you say what's happening with the building, we're deep in the process of redoing the floors, getting the plans approved and working, I think, quite well with the city who -- which the city does not have a -- we wanted to sprinkler the buildings. We wanted sprinkler on after the first fire. And the city does not have an ordinance that kind of shakes hands properly with the fair housing department that allows you to go in and actually retrofit and sprinkler a high-rise residential building. And we've gone to them and said, look, we know you want us to have them, and we know we want to do it. And they have been really good about saying, yes, we're just going to try and figure out a way to get you there.</p><p>And so I'm pretty confident now that we're not only going to be redoing those floors, getting them done, but I think the city is really kind of in a great way come on our team to say, we're going to make provisions or a way, even though it's not in our code at the moment, where you're going to get to sprinkler these buildings. So that -- we're feeling good about that.</p><p>OMOTAYO TEJAMUDE OKUSANYA: Got you. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to go back to Frank's question around tenants. He did ask about Equinox, but I'm curious what you're hearing from Morgan Stanley given some of the vocal comments the CEO did make on their earnings call about needing less office space going forward because more of the employees will be working from home.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Okay. And what's -- a quick -- I mean I've already said -- wait, who made this comment?</p><p>OMOTAYO TEJAMUDE OKUSANYA: The CEO of Morgan Stanley.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Okay. And he thinks more people are going to be working from home?</p><p>OMOTAYO TEJAMUDE OKUSANYA: That's what he said on their earnings call that they would be looking at having -- taking less office space going forward because of that.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Okay. I mean I don't know what those big investment banks will end up doing. They already -- they're kind of the prime group that's worked their hardest to get down to 150 feet per person, 140 feet per person. I mean we're there when we're in New York, we're visiting, and we go out onto those big trading floors, and it's certainly packed in at a level that we haven't seen before.</p><p>I can't imagine that he is going to have so many people working from home that he's going to achieve for the people working social distancing and actually also reduce their space and create that kind of proper environment, but maybe he figured out how to do that, I don't know.</p><p>But I do think that for the people that are in that position, I don't think they have any choice but to keep people working from home for a lot longer than other companies because I don't think -- just practically speaking, I don't know how they'd bring -- I mean even going every other seat, I think they have a tough time being 6 feet apart. So I mean that's going to be an outlet for them for a long time. If you say to me human nature, I watched people, I watched technology come, and everyone said, oh, technology, no one's coming into the office. Actually, office space filled up more because individuals became more productive and more people were coming into offices and working with computers there.</p><p>And then people got to a point where they said, all right, I think we're going to expand and expand the workforce and have people work from home and let a lot of people work from home. And then even the technology companies said, you know what, we've just found out we're not in love with people working from home. We want teams together. And then you saw a shift happened where they said, no, we're going to pack them into our space because we want people to even casually run across each other so that they can have creative conversations and collaborate and all the rest. So there was sort of a complete revolt towards working from home.</p><p>And now in the situation we're in, people are saying, \"Hey, what about working from home?\" Okay, I think when all is said and done, they're going to end up figuring out that, first of all, when people are working in the office, they don't want to be in a position where they're almost forced to be in a collaborative conversation all the time. They want their own space. And I also think they're going to find out that, that space needs to be more than 20 square feet, right? And I think that they'll find out that there are a lot of people that can work from home and an additive way to make them more productive. But if you're saying human nature is that people are going to say I prefer to work from home or companies are going to now switch back and go, okay, we changed our mind again and now we now like people working from home, I never saw that as a long-term trend. And I still don't think it will be a long-term trend.</p><p>OMOTAYO TEJAMUDE OKUSANYA: That's helpful. One more, if you could indulge me, just around the office parking, other income line item in 1Q. Just kind of given some of the discussions, you talked about your parking trend. That line item was actually up $3 million in 1Q '20 versus 4Q '19. Could you talk a little bit about that delta and what caused that big increase?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: I don't know that answer. I see Peter starting or trying to look around his papers.</p><p>PETER D. SEYMOUR: I think there were some true-ups there from prior quarters. I mean it's -- quarter-to-quarter, you get variability there, but there's nothing...</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Nothing stands out. We didn't prepare for the question.</p><p>OMOTAYO TEJAMUDE OKUSANYA: So there's just some accounting true-ups in 1Q '20 on that. That's kind of it?</p><p>PETER D. SEYMOUR: Yes. And the other factor, you do have to remember we consolidated the -- one of our JVs, yes, partway through the fourth quarter. So that will contribute.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Emmanuel Korchman at Citi.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN, MD, HEAD OF THE US REAL ESTATE &amp; LODGING RESEARCH AND SENIOR REAL ESTATE ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Michael Bilerman. Where is -- where did April occupancy end up at the end of the month?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Where did which occupancy?</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: April occupancy, office.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: No. I don't think we're publishing month-to-month occupancy. And frankly, I don't know.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: I mean was it -- I mean you had negative net absorption in the first quarter which, because of your short lease duration, you're running, call it, 120 basis points of expirations every month, right? And so and you are -- Ken runs a leasing machine. I think you do like 2 to 3 leases a day historically, right, whether they're renewals or new leases just given the tenant size and the number of leases you have, the spaces. And so I'm just trying to get a sense of what occurred during April so that we understand sort of the cadence of the occupancy declines as the shelter-in-place orders still are there and just in terms of how low -- at what point will that low point settle in.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Yes. I don't -- well, but what creates occupancy declines, and I -- literally, I do not know the exact answer to your question. But if you look at what creates occupancy decline, I don't think any of that could have happened in April. I don't think -- obviously, it's impossible they'll default in our markets. I didn't hear about -- if you're saying a person's -- right in that month of April, the person's lease came up and they moved out and we lost it, I don't think really anyone was moving. I don't think -- no one was coming, no one was going, no one was doing anything. I don't think -- even if we had the exact information of April, I don't think it would give you any indication of a trend line until you see people kind of -- the world start going again and people start making affirmative decisions about things because nobody's doing anything. I wouldn't be surprised that occupancy April 1 and occupancy April 30 is the same number. I don't think that's a trend. I just don't think anyone has been able to do anything for the last month.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: I guess what happened to all the leases that expired? You probably had like 50 or 60 leases expired during the month of April. Were all those renewed at...</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, no, because that's what I was explaining earlier at one of the earlier questions, what I said was these guys, nobody goes and renews or doesn't renew on the month of expiration. I mean I said 5 months, and then Stuart corrected me to say actually, the average for these guys is 6 months -- or not even the average, the short end. So people -- 6 months ago, those renewals happened. Now you'd go, well, people that are 6 months on from now, how come they're not feeling pressure to do their renewals? They probably are, but they're not doing anything or they did their renewal.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: Right. And what are you doing from just bringing your -- in terms of reopening and bringing people back into the office, I think about the larger landlords who have very large tenants are working hand-in-hand and providing those services to be able to bring employees back into the office in a social distanced way, right? And they'll go up to -- maybe get to 50%. I would assume with a much smaller tenant base, you're dealing with an average lease, average tenant size of about 5,000 square feet. I guess what do you need to do in those spaces to get those people back in and the cost of doing that just from a sanitation and just opening your building perspective?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: So within the suites, we're doing our cleaning, as we always have. And outside, in the common areas of the buildings, we are putting together programs to bring people in, limit the number of people going through the elevators, requiring mask, coming -- we're putting all those programs together and starting to get ready to steer them out. Actually, there's a meeting about -- another meeting about it today. I think that -- I don't think that we have -- we have similar problems, not the same problems as these huge markets with gigantic buildings, whether it be in New York or Boston or San Francisco. I mean the timing of people arriving is a little more varied here, and we don't have those colossal crunches to the elevators. I mean we have some other opportunities to lighten things up, and we're looking at all of them. And we're putting all those programs in to try and make people feel safe about coming back to work.</p><p>Now if you say in the people and offices, how many people -- how many are they bringing back, I mean that's the choice of the tenant, not us. All we are doing is creating good accommodations and notifications and cleaning and all the rest of that stuff for people coming in through the building and the lobbies and the elevators.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: How do you think sort of the Warner Center market fits into all of this and in a post-pandemic world, is better or worse for it?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: I think the short-term post-pandemic world is bad for all businesses because the economy is slowing down. And at the end of the day, the economy is the model that drives everything. And so I don't think you could say Warner Center separate from Santa Monica, separate from Beverly Hills, L.A., New York, Boston, you name it. I don't think anybody is going to escape these impacts. So everything would only be on a relevant basis. And I don't know that Warner Center will be any more or less impacted than what we would expect out of the industries that are driving the L.A. economy. But if you say is the L.A. economy going to be hit, Hawaii's economy going to be hit, yes, and all the others. I just think everyone is going to be hit.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: Right. I just know it's been a challenge for a while just in terms of getting that occupancy up, and I'm just trying to think about how the industry trends and where it's located, how that evolves post all of this.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, yes. I mean we're going to try and give up as little occupancy as we can. But of course, nothing is free because then that would translate into rate. But if you say, wow, I mean, you're going and blowing, and now this hit, now what's next? Okay. I know what's next is not going and blowing. I mean we've got to like put the hat on and keeping the buildings full and let the economy recover.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: Right. Just lastly on the deferrals, how long will those drag on? Is it entirely dependent on shelter-in-place? Or are there other variables in those deferrals?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Most of these cities have either said April and May or April, May and June. So they've like named the months that have the deferrals. Now if we're successful, we will get a good part of what we have in our portfolio free of that. But every major market has a moratorium on evictions, and then that moratorium comes with 4 different components. And depending on what those components are depends on how punitive or how much it's encouraging a tenant whether they needed or not to take a free loan. And that is who's covered, whether late fees or interest can be charged, whether significant documentation is needed and how many -- whether they've even said how many months past the crisis the deferral goes.</p><p>And what we've seen in most of these markets is they all have, we'll say, 2 of those components. Maybe they all have -- maybe they have, okay, everyone's covered, and you can't charge late fees. But maybe then they say, but you have to provide very good documentation. And if you don't, then you don't get the benefit of this. And by the way, once the emergency is over, it's between you and the landlord because now the rent's due the next day, okay? So you can choose 2 of the 4 things, and you probably have not created a bad situation where people are trying to get a free loan.</p><p>We're in markets where all 4 of those things exist: not very big need for documentation, just impacted by COVID; very long payout periods; everybody's covered; and no fees. Okay, that's a recipe for disaster, and that's what we're facing. And we're trying to get that changed. So we'll see with the change how long -- if they change it and they go, \"Oh, we didn't mean to include office,\" well, now we don't have that problem anymore.</p><p>OPERATOR: At this time, we show no further questions. Would you like to make any closing remarks?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Yes. Thank you all for joining us. And we hope that very soon in the future, we're able to meet you again in person.</p><p>OPERATOR: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Protection from eviction and late fees.</p><p>2. Creation of payment plan.</p><p>3. Dissemination of information about governmental and community resources.</p><p>8.

West Coast Rental Markets:</p><p>1. Prepared scenario for 2020 rent growth expectations that incorporate macro US forecasts for GDP and job growth that are prepared by broad spectrum of industry and Wall Street economists.</p><p>1. While span of forecasted outcomes is wide to unprecedented extent, there is common expectation that US will experience double-digit declines in 2Q GDP growth, and overall contraction in economy in 2020, with job losses for year estimated at around 7%.</p><p>2. Expects approx. 900,000 job losses or 6.6% in West Coast metros in 2020 vs. net addition of 207,000 jobs from estimate last qtr.</p><p>1. Approximate 14% reduction in estimated total housing deliveries sequentially is not sufficient to offset impact of negative job growth, leading to belief that market rents overall will decline avg. of 2.8% in 2020 vs. 4Q19's estimated 3% increase in market rents.</p><p>3. Extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus programs that have been implemented by federal government have already helped stabilize capital markets and should limit risk of financial contagion.</p><p>1. Considering by contrast, major stimulus programs from Great Recession, they occurred roughly year after recession started.</p><p>2. In today's case, they were just days and weeks into crisis and have been much larger in scope.</p><p>4. Highlights impact of $600 per week federal supplement to unemployment insurance that was part of CARES Act.</p><p>1. While effectiveness of program has been muted by processing delays at state unemployment offices, weekly checks have started to rise and will substantially offset income loss for large segment of population that has suffered from job losses and furloughs.</p><p>2. Highlights this program because it hasn't received much attention.</p><p>5. Given aforementioned benefits, income shortfalls for lower to middle income workers are much less severe than they would have been otherwise.</p><p>1. In some cases, at lower and middle income levels, some workers will receive more in unemployment benefit vs. their compensation.</p><p>4. Apartment Transaction Market:</p><p>1. Yields or cap rates per apartment transactions generally exceed interest rates on related debt.</p><p>1. Resulting positive leverage is powerful force in market.</p><p>2. Unlike great financial crisis, large banks have maintained relatively conservative lending standards and strong liquidity and capital positions, and interest rates have declined further since crisis began.</p><p>1. Recently received quote for seven-year Fannie Mae loan on JV property with fixed interest rate of 2.75%.</p><p>2. Believes these factors will be sufficient to avoid widespread distress in apartment space.</p><p>3. Unlike REIT stocks, private market values in terms of cap rates are generally sticky, meaning that they don't change immediately in reaction to events, but rather seek to reflect longer-term financial performance of property.</p><p>1. Many potential buyers are seeking higher cap rate due to pandemic.</p><p>2. Apartment owners generally have no distress, and exceptionally low interest rates provide opportunity to improve cash flow through refinance to take advantage of record-low positive leverage.</p><p>1. Due to these factors, spread between buyer and seller expectations has widened and gap separating them is probably around 30-60 BP, likely resulting in fewer apartment transactions in near-term.</p><p>2. If stock price was higher, Co. would be aggressive buyer in this environment.</p><p>4. Historically, periods of disruption have resulted in great opportunity for Co.</p><p>1. Confident that Co. has team, resources and strategy to thoughtfully act on these opportunities, consistent with long-term track record of outperformance.</p><p>1Q20 Operational Review (J.B.)</p><p>1. COVID-19:</p><p>1. Over past few weeks, seen countless demonstrations of Co.'s spirit throughout community.</p><p>1. Teams have shown grit and determination in face of rapidly changing working conditions.</p><p>2. Shown compassion to each other and to residents, from proactively reaching out to those in need, buying residents' groceries, and obtaining and distributing personal protective equipment.</p><p>2. Published resources on website to assist residents in finding financial assistance they may need during this time.</p><p>3. Created library of resources for residents, whose children are home from school or who are simply looking for productive ways to use their time during this crisis.</p><p>4. Most residents and prospects have been understanding of changes Co. has needed to make at communities, and appreciative of great efforts of team to continue to provide exceptional service during this time.</p><p>2. Results:</p><p>1. Achieved 3.2% revenue growth YoverY.</p><p>1. Results were in line with expectations.</p><p>2. April metrics and recent market activity:</p><p>1. As this situation is unprecedented with numerous key variables impacting supply and demand, commentary on future market expectations and conditions relies on numerous generally positive assumptions, like:</p><p>1. Relaxation of shelter-in-place orders in near future.</p><p>2. Reduction of new supply entering market.</p><p>3. Restart of economy in orderly way.</p><p>2. Currently, rental market is disrupted.</p><p>1. There is gap between bid/ask price for rental transactions at certain properties in market.</p><p>2. Rental transactions are disproportionately occurring at stabilized properties, offering 2-4 weeks free rent, while other properties are losing occupancy.</p><p>3. April 2020 YoverY same-store economic rents up approx. 1.5%, while financial occupancy declined 1.3% YoverY.</p><p>1. Currently offering various leasing incentives, which includes 2-4 weeks free rent.</p><p>2. Expects market will move back to equilibrium in June, as shelter-in-place requirements are relaxed and Co. enters summer leasing season.</p><p>4. Historically, during periods of reduced demand, portfolio has benefited from people taking advantage of lower pricing and moving from outlying areas to core areas, where Co.'s portfolio is located.</p><p>1. Expects same market dynamics to play out in coming months.</p><p>5. Operations post shelter-in-place:</p><p>1. Leasing applications in portfolio bottomed first week of April, and have increased each week since that time.</p><p>6. Same-store financial occupancy decreased 1.3% in April from March.</p><p>1. Roughly half of decline in occupancy was due to COVID-19-related lease breaks.</p><p>2. Remainder was related to reduced leasing velocity.</p><p>7. This last week, saw activity increase dramatically.</p><p>1. Tours increased 47% and applications increased 62% over prior four-week period avg.</p><p>2. Initial shock appears to be over, and now market is moving to equilibrium.</p><p>3. April delinquencies:</p><p>1. Delinquencies in total portfolio on cash basis was 5% in April vs. 33 BP for full 1Q20.</p><p>2. As magnitude of this crisis became more apparent in March, acted immediately to form resident response team to:</p><p>1. Engage with residents.</p><p>2. Understanding their situations.</p><p>3. Identifying resources for them.</p><p>4. Partnering with them to get them back on to firm financial ground.</p><p>3. Approx. 4,600 tenants representing 7.4% of total portfolio completed online request form in April, confirming that they have been financially impacted by COVID-19 and requesting assistance.</p><p>1. 36% of those residents paid their April rent in full.</p><p>2. 36% made partial payment, averaging about 50% of their rent.</p><p>3. 28% were unable to pay their April rent.</p><p>4. Residents representing 60 BP of portfolio, requested to move out immediately, which Co. allowed, enabling residents to move forward with their life and Co. to potentially avoid future delinquency.</p><p>5. Of residents who stated they were financially impacted by COVID-19:</p><p>1. 16% were in food and beverage industry.</p><p>2. 9% each in retail and personal services, which relates to fitness, massage or beautician services.</p><p>3. 7% each in healthcare, transportation, construction and professional and business services.</p><p>6. 2.2% of residents are delinquent, and Co. has been unable to contact them.</p><p>1. Some of them have made partial payments.</p><p>7. Delinquency at property level within selected market had fairly large variations.</p><p>1. Certain properties were substantially more impacted than others.</p><p>2. Believes this disproportionate impact is root cause of market dislocation.</p><p>3. Would compare it to randomly-located new lease-ups, aggressively attempting to increase occupancy.</p><p>4. Owners at highly impacted buildings, with respect to occupancy and/or delinquency and those who are struggling to compete in this new virtual sales world are likely to be ones aggressively offering concessions.</p><p>4. Expenses:</p><p>1. Withdrawn financial guidance.</p><p>2. Utility usage and related expenses will be higher due to shelter-in-place mandates.</p><p>3. Expects significant ongoing increase in expenses related to personal protective equipment, and cleaning supplies and related increased labor costs, due to new cleaning protocols.</p><p>5. To protect employees and residents, stopped performing non-emergency work orders in occupied units.</p><p>1. Provided residents with self-help videos and other resources to help them fix many of their own issues.</p><p>2. Expects that there will be some level of pent-up work orders as conditions change.</p><p>3. Operating Strategy:</p><p>1. Technology vision and related operating strategy that Co. has been executing, positioned it well going into this rapid change.</p><p>2. Cloud-first strategy enabled relatively smooth transition, as stay-at-home orders were implemented.</p><p>1. Remained fully operational, while rapidly transitioning to working from home.</p><p>3. New operating environment of social distancing requires solid digital presence, including:</p><p>1. Video tours.</p><p>2. Digital maps.</p><p>3. Self-help information and related videos.</p><p>4. Smartphones for FaceTime tours and other similar tours.</p><p>4. Made decision early on to rapidly accelerate technology-enabled transformation, completing implementation of mobile maintenance app 2.0, sales lead management system 2.0, and several other initiatives, shaving 4-12 months off the original rollout plan.</p><p>5. As restrictions are relaxed, positioned well for this new environment.</p><p>6. Operating strategy, going forward, will balance occupancy and market rent, maximizing revenue.</p><p>1. Will likely operate at lower occupancy than Co. has over past several years.</p><p>2. Will continue to leverage technology platform and operate consistent with social distancing protocols, by using combination of virtual tours and live video tours, where sales associate is either on-site touring prospect via phone or resident is on-site and sales associate is live answering questions and explaining various features and benefits of particular unit and amenity.</p><p>7. Smart lock digital entry systems enable Co. to provide access to vacant units for self-tours, thus eliminating need for agents to be on-site to provide access.</p><p>8. These were challenging weeks for certain.</p><p>1. Co. is emerging from this challenge stronger.</p><p>2. Well prepared for future.</p><p>4. Markets:</p><p>1. Seattle:</p><p>1. April 2020 YoverY same-store economic rents up 6.1%, while financial occupancy declined 80 BP YoverY.</p><p>2. Delinquency in Northern technology-driven markets were lower.</p><p>1. In April, delinquency in Seattle same-store portfolio was 1.8%; lowest in same-store portfolio.</p><p>2. Northern California:</p><p>1. In Bay Area, April 2020 YoverY same-store economic rents up 17 BP, while financial occupancy declined 1.2%.</p><p>2. Delinquencies for same period in Bay Area 3.9%.</p><p>1. Santa Clara County sub-market had lowest delinquency at 2%, while Alameda, San Mateo and Contra Costa counties were 4.1%, 6.3% and 7.9%, respectively.</p><p>3. Consistent with rest of market, four Bay Area lease-ups, 500 Folsom, Station Park Green, Mylo and Patina at Midtown had little activity since late March, which was due to construction challenges and reduced demand in marketplace.</p><p>3. Southern California:</p><p>1. Same-store economic rents up 1.1% YoverY in April 2020, while financial occupancy declined 1.6%.</p><p>2. In same period, Southern California region had higher delinquency overall in same-store portfolio at 7.5%.</p><p>1. Ventura and San Diego delinquency was at 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively.</p><p>2. Orange County delinquency 7.5%.</p><p>3. LA County delinquency 9.4%.</p><p>3. LA CBD and Woodland Hills sub-markets were hardest hit at 12.1% and 13.8%, respectively.</p><p>4. As of 04/30/20, same-store portfolio's physical occupancy was 94.4% and availability 30 days out is 6.5%.</p><p>1Q20 Financials (A.K.)</p><p>1. Overview:</p><p>1. Had strong start to year, with:</p><p>1. Same-property NOI growth of 3.9%.</p><p>2. Core FFO per share exceeding midpoint of guidance by $0.07.</p><p>3. Achieving 7.7% growth YoverY.</p><p>2. Withdrawn 2020 guidance due to unprecedented uncertainty caused by COVID pandemic.</p><p>2. Funding Plan:</p><p>1. Committed $106m of capital towards structured finance investments at avg. yield of 11.2%.</p><p>1. Funding for these investments is expected to start around Sept. and occur over period of 6-12 months thereafter; Co.'s funding needs for 2020 is only about $40m.</p><p>2. Development funding needs for 2020 is de minimis at about $75m.</p><p>1. This represents 50% of total development commitment.</p><p>2. Approx. 90% of current development pipeline is expected to complete lease up within next year.</p><p>3. Begun reducing exposure to direct development several years ago, because rate of construction cost increased at greater pace than rent growth, ultimately compressing yields.</p><p>1. This is consistent with plan Co. has discussed on previous calls.</p><p>3. Funding Sources:</p><p>1. Expects to receive total of $215m from structured finance repayments, of which:</p><p>1. $115m can be allocated to investment needs.</p><p>2. $100m can be allocated to fund stock buyback.</p><p>2. Repurchased $176m of stock.</p><p>1. Remaining $76m will be match-funded with cash flow from operations.</p><p>3. Dividends:</p><p>1. Raised annual dividends by 6.5%.</p><p>1. 26th consecutive dividend increase.</p><p>2. Proud of this track record, which few companies have achieved.</p><p>2. Even though cash flow from operations may be lower than original plan for this year, dividend remains secure and covered by free cash flow.</p><p>4. With over $1b in liquidity, no debt maturities in 2020 and funding commitments well covered, Co. remains in strong financial position.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Nicholas Joseph with Citi.</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mike, you mentioned the transaction market and that your cost of equity isn't where you would like it to be. But if you see good external growth opportunities, either repurchasing your shares or on the acquisition market, would you execute an increased near-term leverage?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: Hi, Nick. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. I think at this point in time, given this incredible uncertainty, we would like to stay more leverage-neutral in terms of how we approach our different investment types. Not to say that we won't sell property in order to pursue other types of opportunities, but at this point in time, until we see greater clarity because I would say at this point in time, there are more unknowns than knowns out there given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic itself. And so we're going to remain fairly conservative when it comes to leverage for the foreseeable future.</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH: And then just maybe on operations. You mentioned the concessions that you're seeing on some stabilized properties. What sort of concessions are you seeing on lease-up properties today in the different markets?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART, SENIOR EVP &amp; COO, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: Sure. This is John. The lease-up properties, just going back to the stabilized just for a second, what we're seeing is we're seeing 2- to 4-week pretty common is where we're seeing rental transactions. And I mentioned the comment as far as dislocation because simply looking at asking rents and assuming that asking reflects the actual rent, that's what I'm getting at. It doesn't necessarily reflect that. Where the transactions are occurring is where there are some level of concessions that are going on out there. As we move from the stabilized market, and that, again, back a step, that really relates to what I see as a dislocation that's caused by the impact of some of the delinquencies hitting certain properties and not others, kind of creating many lease-ups out there. I think that will abate in the near future.</p><p>As we move to the lease-ups, the lease-up concessions are closer to 2 months, and there are some other specials that are going on. Again, the whole market just kind of expanded out from shorter concessions on lease-ups and no concessions on stabilized, to 2 to 4 weeks stabilized and basically 8 weeks on a new product across the board. Does that answer your question?</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH: Yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.</p><p>AUSTIN TODD WURSCHMIDT, VP, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Curious what your thoughts are on the collections across your markets, married with the comment you said regarding the slow rollout of unemployment benefits, and then also balancing that with some of the tenant activism that's made headlines of late.</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes, I'll take that. What we're seeing, I'm going to start with an amazing event, and we're really seeing some good people that were impacted by situations outside their control, really all trying to figure it out and do the right thing. I don't want to focus on the potential of a few bad actors. The reality is we have a lot of great people that are working hard. Our resident response team is engaged with them, and we're seeing good behavior by really the majority of those people. I acknowledge there are some people we haven't connected with. But even those people, some of them have actually paid some levels of rent. They might just be a little bit shellshocked from this whole situation.</p><p>My expectation is that as the government assistance rolls out, that people will probably make as much rent payments as they can. And then again, as I mentioned, we do expect the relaxation of some of the shelter-in-place requirements and a somewhat orderly challenged, but orderly economic improvement. And so we expect to see people starting to go back to work, being able to pay rent. And for those that can't pay rent, they may end up moving out. But again, our markets that we're in benefit from this chronic undersupply. And so what we've always seen in the past is whenever there is some level of a shock, it takes some time, 1 to 3, 4 months, and we start to have people from the outside areas moving into our markets and supporting occupancy and therefore, rents. So I see -- I have a somewhat optimistic view as to how this goes, but again, I want to be very candid that where we are today, there's a little bit of dislocation going on right now.</p><p>AUSTIN TODD WURSCHMIDT: That's helpful. What do you think the likelihood that you collect some of that unpaid or delinquent rent is over time as some of those benefits roll in?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Hi. This is Mike, Austin. We don't know. Honestly, that falls in the bucket of we actually have more unknowns than knowns, which is why we didn't give guidance. I think this is one of the key issues out there. And historically, as John said, we have somewhere around 30 to 40 basis points of delinquency. And it does not present an accounting issue. We just assume. Effectively, we treat it on a cash basis. And so it's a little bit different now. And fortunately, because of the timing of when all this happened, we have pretty much 3 months to work through those issues and have better information.</p><p>We know, historically, that the further you get away from the move-out date, the more difficult it is to collect. And that's just our experience over time. And so we are motivated to move pretty quickly and -- which, of course, many of these eviction prohibitions and other governmental actions prevent us from doing that. And so as John said in his prepared remarks, which I think is important here, that if someone comes to us and says, hey, I'll move out, we're going to likely let them out of their lease, which means that we're going to have a little bit more turnover, but we're going to control the unit at a time when, again, because of these eviction prohibitions, we don't have a lot of choices. So we're working through all that. It's, I think, one of the more complicated issues that we have to deal with, with respect to this whole challenging scenario.</p><p>AUSTIN TODD WURSCHMIDT: That's helpful. And I know there's still a lot of uncertainty, but you guys, kind of leading into this, had preferred equity over ground-up development. I'm curious, as you think about coming out of this and how you want to be opportunistic, how are you weighing those types of investments.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. This is Mike. And Adam is here too so he may want to add something. But yes, we still like the preferred equity investment. We're not in the first loss piece. Again, we come in to those transactions at the point in time that they are beginning construction. So costs are known, financing's in place, et cetera. So we're not taking a great deal of risk upfront. And typically, those deals underwrite to somewhere in the high 4 to low 5 cap rate. And they were, of course, at the -- around the 85% loan-to-value ratio, which means our effective cap rate is somewhere in the mid-5s. So the chances of having distress at that level, I think, is incredibly unlikely. And in terms of investment policy going over -- going forward, direct versus preferred equity, I'll let Adam handle that.</p><p>ADAM W. BERRY, SENIOR VP &amp; CIO, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: Yes. To echo what Mike has said, we continue to aggressively pursue on the pref equity side throughout this crisis. We've underwritten deals a little more conservatively, increased interest rates commensurately with our additional cost of capital that's happened over the last month or so. And we've continued to identify deals, and we're in the process of due diligence on a number of pref equity deals.</p><p>Going forward, there are definitely development deals out there, and we'll continue to track and monitor. We -- there's some expectation that costs will come back toward us with decreased construction. We haven't seen any of it so far, and we have our finger on the pulse with a number of pref equity deals out there right now. So haven't seen a decrease in pricing, and sellers are very, very hesitant to decrease their pricing expectations. So I think the development world will take a little pause, but we continue to, like I said, aggressively pursue on the -- that side.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.</p><p>NICHOLAS PHILIP YULICO, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just want to first ask on the market rent forecast you gave, which is for market rents being down about 3% this year. Can you just give us a feel for how fast that could manifest in your portfolio in terms of a decline in new lease rates? And I guess I'm also wondering if the impact could be bigger than that on a short-run basis and you assume some sort of recovery in rates in the back half of the year. Any perspective there will be helpful.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, Nick. This is Mike, and I'm sure Mr. Burkart has an opinion on this one as well. So I think what you have here is a shock to the system. So -- and anecdotally, lots of people that can't afford their apartment, potentially moving to different places and other things. So that will be the shock to the system. And then there's a recovery. The recovery is almost always people backfilling from further-out locations into areas that are closer to the jobs, and then we benefit from that over time. But this takes time to play out.</p><p>So this presumes, since we were up 3% in Q1, on S-16, last quarter and now we're at minus 2.8%, it assumes a pretty dramatic drop-off in market rents. Of course, we don't turn units. We turn units ratably throughout the year. I think part of that, because we enter what's traditionally a more seasonal period, so the fourth quarter is a little bit more challenging for us on the demand side anyway, we still have the deliveries of apartments into the markets. And so we think it will be pretty choppy going into the fourth quarter, and then we think it recovers from that point on.</p><p>So the other point I would make is John's comment about stabilized concessions. I think that stabilized concessions are assumed to continue in our economic growth forecast on Page S-16. And again, just to remind everyone what this is. This is a scenario based on macro factors, effectively supply/demand factors. When you throw them into our model for what happens with various supply/demand factors, what happens to rents, this is what we get. There's still a whole bunch of unknowns on top of this. Again, the policy issues, will there be more regulation in these markets, which we don't see. We think there's been plenty of regulation, actually, but we don't know what's going to happen with that. The cadence of move-ins and move-outs, we can't predict that. And the collection of the delinquency is another challenging subject. So that's why we decided to give this data on S-16 without giving guidance because there's a whole another level of assumptions. And we think that there's enough very large assumptions embedded in S-16 that it just didn't make sense to push it further.</p><p>NICHOLAS PHILIP YULICO: Okay. That's helpful, Mike. And then just in terms of supply, if we look, Oakland and San Jose are 2 markets that are facing some of the biggest supply deliveries in the second quarter, third quarter of this year. Is your sense that any of those projects have now been delayed in terms of timing? And then also, if you could just maybe tell us in a real-time basis what you're seeing for projects that are delivering and lease-up, I mean is it -- you mentioned 2 months earlier. Is that the norm in these markets? Is it worse than that?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. It's -- it can be worse than that. But I would focus you on the percent of supply, total supply to total stock, which is at 0.6% for the portfolio. And Northern California is a little bit higher at 0.7%. But then, again, Northern California also has more momentum. I think we believe that tech markets are the winner here. And because their business models are pretty COVID-19-resistant for the most part, not that venture capital hasn't been affected, it has a little bit and jobs haven't been affected, they have. Although when we look at, for example, the top 10 technology companies, job openings are down a little bit, but they're still very strong.</p><p>So our view is that the tech markets do better here, and we'll continue on the path of leading the West Coast markets. And obviously, that's been a key part of our investment. So I guess what I'm saying is I would be less concerned about supply in Northern California, given the strength, the overall strength of the job markets and the companies here. Probably, if we have a concern, even though it appears to be the least amount of supply, it's Southern California because it doesn't have the job drivers that Northern California and Seattle have.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.</p><p>NEIL LAWRENCE MALKIN, ANALYST, CAPITAL ONE SECURITIES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to go back to -- I just wanted to kind of go back to the question that Austin brought up. I believe in your supplement, you've called out 2% of the delinquency is -- or 2% of the total rent is people who are not affected by COVID but haven't paid. So that's basically the moral hazard. I guess I would be interested in, if you can at all, Mike, just maybe walk through what markets you're the most concerned about. Obviously, people are talking about rent strikes. It seems like the legislature and judges have no interest of pushing through evictions anytime soon. I guess any more color on how you see that kind of playing out, when you see the eviction, I guess, the market normalizing? And how much worse could that moral hazard get as we continue to have an elevated unemployment environment for a longer period of time?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. It's a good question. And I believe you're talking about, on S-15, the 2.2% which is the percentage of units delinquent in April not requesting assistance. So I guess most of that category is people that we haven't heard from. And I think that there are really 2 components. There is the moral hazard component, those that just want to take advantage of the situation, the various laws and the reluctance of the courts to process evictions, et cetera. But I think there's another piece of that, which is people that are just overwhelmed and/or, for whatever reason, ignore their notices. So I think it's still a little bit early to tell exactly how that breaks down.</p><p>I guess, from my perspective, that's not a huge number in the scheme of things because I know when we were talking to our Board, we gave them a much larger range of delinquents. And so I think our actual experience is better than what we thought. And I was concerned that, to your point, that if you're going to give people, there's no hammer as it relates to evictions, maybe in late fees for some period of time as part of our overall program to try to help residents through this difficult period, et cetera, that there might be more of those people that just say, oh, I'm just not going to pay rent. Keep in mind that they still have a credit issue, and so there is a reason to pay rent. They still owe the money. And we still fully intend to pursue the collection effort. And we will have to approach it a bit differently, given the magnitude of it. And so -- but we're going to still push hard to collect it where we can. So this falls within one of the unknowns, and we're not sure exactly what's going to happen with that category. Fortunately, it's only 2.2%.</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes. Mike, let me just add. In my comments, I mentioned that those are the people that we haven't spoken with. But I also said some of them have actually paid partial payments. So to be clear, you can't look at that group and say that they're a moral hazard. I'll give you an example. One of the things we did at Essex is we -- early on, realizing the challenge that this was for so many people, we identified residents that have been challenged with us in the past. They may have had reviews that they wrote that they were upset with for whatever reason, and we reached out to them just to check and see how they were doing. The feedback we got was amazing, but what we found is many people were somewhat shellshocked. They really just weren't interacting with the public. And so we had people that were saying, wow, call me back next week. And so I think how this impacted a lot of people were some people just kind of went back into their units and just disconnected from everything, and then others were just trying to work through it. And maybe they were working, and they're connecting with other people.</p><p>So I don't associate the 2.2% as being reflective of moral hazard. I recognize there may be some of that out there. But I think people will come along, and we're seeing good behavior overall. We're hearing amazing stories. So I wouldn't associate that with moral hazard.</p><p>NEIL LAWRENCE MALKIN: All right. I appreciate the detail. Yes. Another one I have is, in terms of the H-1B visa program, I know a lot of that goes to tech. I know a lot of that goes into your markets. And so I'm just wondering if you have any sense as to what that looks like going into the summer. Is that sort of demand or occupancy that you assume now will be lost? And then the venture capital side as well, I guess, sort of like the 2 specific to the West Coast had these demand drivers. I just had questions on that.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Yes, this is Mike again. We haven't spent a lot of time on the H-1Bs, given all the other things that we're working on. Anecdotally, we have not heard -- in terms of what they're actually doing, we know that they don't qualify generally for unemployment. And therefore, to the extent they're displaced, then maybe there's a possibility that they will go home. And so that's out there. But it's just -- it's too hard to tell at this point in time. And I'm sorry, I missed the second part of your question.</p><p>NEIL LAWRENCE MALKIN: Yes. Sure. Sorry. I was just asking about venture capital. You had alluded to it.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, yes. Yes, venture capital. So yes. No, I did. I did. Yes, venture capital, I mean, it still remains strong in our markets, still above the dot-com era. The last funding by quarter last quarter was -- first quarter 2020 was $12 billion versus about</p><p>$10 billion in the dot-com period, so still strong. Again, anecdotally, we're hearing that venture capital valuations are dropping pretty substantially by a big number. We also -- when we go through the WARN notices or the notices of layoffs, there are a lot of venture capital-funded companies that are on that list. So trying to figure out how to kind of continue operations at a time when valuations are not really attractive. So I would put this in the bucket of still a lot more unknowns than knowns as the venture capital world is trying to figure out what to do.</p><p>I know, in our case, we have our technology fund consortium of -- that the REITs and other multifamily owners put together. And we're seeing some pretty attractive deal flow as a result of that and lower valuations overall. And so we think it's actually a very good time to be an investor in technology at this point in time compared to the recent past.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR, MD AND HEAD OF UNITED STATES REITS, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: If I missed this, I apologize. Can you discuss May collection so far, what you're seeing?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes, you didn't miss it. This is John. They're materially consistent with April. One thing I would say is, because of when the fifth falls, things can move around a little bit, but we're right on path with April.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Okay. Great. And then I believe, Mike, in his opening remarks, talked about an expectation for a decline in market rents in 2020. I believe I heard negative 2.8%. Just given what's going on, it just -- it doesn't seem so bad to me. Again, I know it's down, and you were expecting up 3%-plus. But is that correct? And can you put that in perspective, let's say, versus what you saw during the tech crash or Great Recession, that minus -- was it minus 2.8%?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, Jeff. Yes, keep in mind, this is actually published in S-16 of the supplement, where we try to give you an idea of what we think market rents are going to do on average for 2020. And so we come to 2.8%. However, keep in mind, we have 3% rent growth, market rent growth in the first quarter. So to average 2.8% for the year, we expect rents to decline pretty substantially between now and year-end.</p><p>And again, I go back to John's comments about stabilized concessions because if you give away a month free, that's actually a pretty significant reduction in market rents. And I think it's somewhere in that magnitude where we expect, again, as we're working through all the delinquents and some of them are moving out, and we've created more units than we would ordinarily have to rent and now we have to draw people into those units that we think we're going to have to provide more incentive to do that. And so that will be probably mostly in the form of a concession. But I think that's the environment for the rest of the year, and then I think John points this out too, then we probably hit equilibrium at some point in time, we would say, toward the end of the year. And then I think things can recover from that point. Does that make sense?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Yes. And can you compare that -- the minus 2.8% for the year to, let's say, what happened during the tech crash or Great Recession?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Well, overall, market rents declined in the financial crisis about 15% over a couple of years. In terms of -- but keep in mind, we don't actually realize that or realize it over time because we have leases in place. And I actually have these numbers. So in 2009, the reported revenue drop was 2.8%, and 2010 was 3.3%. So we had 2.8% -- same-property revenue dropped 2.8% in 2009, 3.3% in 2010, on an overall, about 15% reduction in market rents. And so as you can tell, I mean the reported numbers are pretty dramatically less than given leases in place compared to the market rent numbers. Does that help?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Yes. It's very helpful.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM, SENIOR REAL ESTATE ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: I was interested in the commentary about the increased tours and applications in the past 4 weeks and trying to compare that with the 140 basis points of occupancy that was lost during April. Do you think that with the increased activity, that occupancy has basically troughed already? And how do those metrics compare year-over-year?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes. So the -- I definitely believe that activity troughed. It troughed in the first week of April. And the commentary that I gave related to the last week versus the April average, and it was up substantially. Our applications were up over 60%. So we saw a lot of market activity. So very good outlook going forward. What we're seeing is the market is moving toward equilibrium. We're offering some level of concessions. People are renting units. Things are going in the right direction. That's a good thing.</p><p>As it relates to year-over-year activity, we're definitely lower. It's a little harder to compare because when you look at, say, tours, we're up an infinite amount on virtual tours right now. We had no virtual tours a year ago. And so when you're trying to compare those numbers, it's a little challenging. That's why I gave away the trough, which was the first week of April and then this last week, where we are in comparison. We're continuing to see this with good leasing traffic, good activity. But overall, definitely, the market for April was, and we call it shellshocked, it was less than what it was a year ago in April, but given exact comparisons, it would be misleading.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM: Okay. So the activity is a good leading indicator. I was wondering if you could also clarify the difference between financial and physical occupancy on S-15? That's basically 100 basis points and I'm...</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes. Financial occupancy relates to whether or not someone's in our unit for the full month of the period, whatever the period is, compared to our scheduled rent, whereas physical occupancy is just simply looking at the units and whether or not they're occupied. So the -- at one point in time. So our -- we quoted our physical occupancy as of April 30, which was on that day, whereas our financial occupancy for April would have been the whole month. So a little bit different.</p><p>The reason we were doing that is we're trying to give out to people, again, full transparency, give a good understanding of where we ended up because we did end up lower than where we were for the month. I will say, though, that things have picked up and is what you would expect. It's consistent with what I'm saying. We do expect occupancy to continue to pick up. I think that was probably our low point. When you think about it with traffic being in the low at the first week, that's typically going to relate to occupancy being in the low several weeks later and then all of a sudden, it picks up. So this whole thing is working out as expected consistently. And I expect our occupancy will continue to pick up going forward, which it is right now.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM: So is it fair to say that the physical occupancy is a leading indicator for the financial, and then the tours and applications are, I mean, an indicator for both?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER SANDLER &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: And I apologize for the background noise. So a few questions. First of all, I think you guys are pretty bold to let tenants do their own home repairs. I can't wait to see the photos of the aftermath. But 2 questions. So first, Mike, can you just -- you talked about the different markets, and Seattle's strongest, the Northern L.A. suburb's the weakest as far as rent collection. Can you just -- maybe I missed it, but can you just give us some color on urban versus suburban? And especially that you guys have sold down, you've been selling down your urban exposure, so just sort of curious how you're seeing your portfolio rent collections, et cetera, play out between that dynamic?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Sure, Alex. Good question. And yes, I don't want to see the drywall patch job that our residents do for sure. Let's see. The -- I think...</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes. I mean I can talk about their delinquency. Yes, I'll talk to...</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Why don't you just start? Yes.</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: The delinquency, first off, Alex, we are a high-service shop, so some of the self-help might literally be replacing the lightbulb. But anyway, the -- as to the delinquency, as I mentioned, we aren't really seeing a high-rise versus low-rise of rent. We're not seeing correlations as it relates to that. When I look at the -- what occurred, certain assets were impacted more than others. And when I dug deep into that, you could see the logic, like an asset that perhaps is next to a mall or one that's highly impacted by a school, and you could understand what was going on. But then when I tried to apply that fact to other assets that had similar situations, next to a mall, 10 miles away, or highly impacted by a school, the results weren't the same. It was really interesting and unique.</p><p>And what I did find, though, is that there was a submarket distinction, and that's why I brought up the submarkets. And so Downtown L.A. was highly impacted. And that's why I brought that one up specifically as was the Woodland Hills, and Woodland Hills has exposure to the entertainment industry. So we did see those types of impacts. We also saw regional impacts, less in the Pacific Northwest. And of course, there, we have a lot of assets on the Eastside, many of them are garden-style and that type of thing, really low impact. And then in the middle was the Bay Area, and in more in the South, we had greater impact. Some of it was the Disneyland effect.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. And Alex, let me pick up on that. So yes, we have sold some buildings in the downtown. MaSo, as you'll recall, was sold in Q4 of last year and 8th &amp; Hope the year before, one in Downtown San Francisco, one in Downtown L.A. And I would say, most of that motivated by some of the issues and the grittiness of the downtown and our expectation for some of the areas to be cleaned up more quickly and transition more quickly than they did.</p><p>So I think that, that continues to be a pretty significant issue here on the West Coast. And our performance has been -- it's been okay in the downtowns. It hasn't been great because of some of those factors. And so our -- we become more suburban over time. And again, with -- we want to own property in the, I would say, B- to A quality area, in areas near jobs and never too far from the major job nodes. And I would say that suburban generally has outperformed the urban here on the West Coast. I realize that, in other markets, you can have different outcomes.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Okay. And then the second question is sort of going to that geographically. Obviously, New York, here, we've been really hit hard. But speaking to folks in the rest of the country, including out even in the Bay Area, it seems like COVID has really been much less of an impact and that there's a sense of people who want to get back to their jobs much quicker than the politicians want. So in your view, do you sense that there's this pent-up demand where people are ready to get back to their jobs, and you guys may even rebound quicker than people think just because the level of COVID is less and the people are just far ready for it because they don't have to rely on mass transit? Or do you think that it will take longer to reopen in your markets?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: It is the million-dollar question. And certainly, I don't have an answer to it. I put this definitely in the unknown category. I think that we tend to have high-income levels out here, and the people that are earning high incomes want to consume services. And the services, for the most part, restaurants and a variety of things, those services are really not open at this point in time. So I think that there is a motivation to start opening things up again.</p><p>Having said that, there -- I think the governmental entities are incredibly, let's say, conservative and concerned about surge capacity and some of the other issues that go along with it. So we're going to take it one day at a time and can't exactly predict what's there. But I totally agree with you. I think that the demand for services is building and is pretty intense out there. And so hopefully, that motivates. We've seen various different things on the news about this in terms of closing the L.A. beaches. Boy, that's a tough one, but because people want to get out and go do things. So I can't exactly tell you what's going to happen, but I definitely can feel the pressure building.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>RICHARD HILL, HEAD OF U.S. REIT EQUITY &amp; COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE DEBT RESEARCH AND HEAD OF U.S. CMBS, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just wanted to follow up on the negative 2.8% macro forecast. And by the way, thank you very much for that. I'm sure it's not easy to put together right now. But I think one of the things that I'm certainly trying to understand, and I think a lot of people are trying to understand, is the cadence of that. And I'm not looking for you to give a specific guide. But maybe if you could just walk us through if you think you're going to see a deeper 2Q '20 trough and then a quicker rebound. Or is it going to be more stable but down over the course of the year? And the reason I asked the question is I think about your -- I think it was a negative 7% job growth forecast for the year, which is a little bit more severe than Morgan Stanley was projecting, which maybe suggests that you're expecting it to be delayed out but maybe not as deep in 2Q. So any color you could provide on that, that would be really helpful.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, Rich. This is Mike. And I think I went through some of this previously. But the job forecast and the GDP forecast or estimates, again, we survey a wide range. We don't do any fundamental research as it relates to the macroeconomy. And as you know, there's wide dispersion of what people think is going to happen. And as we sort of triangulated all that, we got the minus 900,000, 6.6% job loss in our West Coast markets. So that's where that came from.</p><p>We don't -- again, we don't add -- we don't try to add value. We just try to report the facts as it relates to that. What this has intended to do is take those macro forces and consider what would happen with rents in a normal situation because we don't have a COVID-19 model because we've never been through this before. But in a normal situation, if you had minus 6.6% jobs -- job growth and you had about 0.9% apartment deliveries, what would happen with rents? And so that's where the 2.8% number came from in terms of our rent forecast, minus 2.8%. And again, that compares to plus 3% that we achieved in the first quarter. So in order to average minus 2.8% for the year, when you to start with 3 months of 3, yes, things get pretty ugly in the second half of the year.</p><p>We view this as more just part of the shock of -- to the system. There's been an extraordinary shock to the system. And I think John's equilibrium comment is the right one. We need to get back to equilibrium, and there will be short-term pain in order to get back to equilibrium. And best I can tell, it's going to be somewhere around 1 month free on stabilized communities, which is sort of embedded into the minus 2.8%. So that's where it comes from.</p><p>And -- but this is just our modeling. This is what happens in our rent forecasting model when you put these various pieces in. Again, it doesn't reflect a COVID-19 scenario and the extraordinary uniqueness of the situation. So it could be different. And again, this is why we didn't follow up with this and then push into guidance because there's a whole another set of assumptions that would go into that.</p><p>RICHARD HILL: Yes. Yes. And I -- that's helpful, and I recognize I'm asking a tough question. It sounds like, given the 1-month free concessions right now, and hopefully, those will burn off towards the end of the year, maybe we could assume something more than severe than the negative 4.75 that the average for the next 3 quarters would assume in 2Q and then gradually getting better because I think you had noted that you begin to inflect in 1Q '21. So I was just trying to get my hands around what does that average look like. And it sounds like it might be a little bit deeper in 2Q but then start to get better as the year progresses.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. In our model, it gets progressively worse because, again, you have seasonality that comes into the equation. Although we would say Q3 is normally our best quarter, let's say, and we're not going to get the benefit of the positive seasonality, and so maybe the negative which typically comes in the fourth quarter will be more muted. But we just don't know. So we -- the way that our model runs is it gets progressively worse, and then we'll hit bottom sometime in Q4 and then rebound from there.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman &amp; Associates.</p><p>HARDIK GOEL, VP OF RESEARCH, ZELMAN &amp; ASSOCIATES LLC: And Mike, congratulations on buying back stock. Second downturn in a row. That said, I really wanted to get your thoughts on -- you guys talked -- you guys track the labor market really well. We've gotten great commentary in the past about what job trends are like. What does your work there really tell you about not just start-up employment but employment from the big tech companies? And how would that compare to last year? Can you contextualize that?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: We can. Let's see, let me pull out a slide on the big tech companies, which I have here somewhere. But again, we -- there's a piece of it that we don't know, and that is to what extent do things open up as we -- as California and Washington open up, how many of those jobs will come back. Will it be half the restaurants that get -- that become filled given social distancing? And that's kind of our best guess, but that, of course, means that the other half don't come back immediately, and what happens with them. So this is part of the unknown with respect to that part of it. And again, I think the good thing about our markets is that we have high-income people. We generally are in the better areas. And people have the -- want to consume services, which are not there right now, but I think there's going to be a lot of pressure to bring them back. So I guess that's the first statement.</p><p>In terms of specifically, our process of tracking what's happening with the top 10 tech companies, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market, we have, let's see, total openings at 22,900 as of May 1, 2020. So that compares to last quarter of -- at March 27, it was about 28,000 or 29,000. So there's been about a 20% reduction there. But if you go back in time, you hit about the same level as Q4 '18 in terms of the number of open positions, so Q3, Q4 '18 in terms of the number of positions open. So I would put that in the still-strong category. And even though it's off, it's off the all-time high that we achieved last quarter. So I think still pretty compelling. Does that help?</p><p>HARDIK GOEL: And just as a follow-up to that. I think John mentioned a few times -- and that is really helpful, by the way. John mentioned a few times equilibrium pricing. And I was just wondering what do you guys see as equilibrium maybe in 2021 once we're past some of this uncertainty. Is it the economic environment stronger than 4Q '19? Or is it something where we still have a 6% unemployment rate and pricing power inherently is not as strong as the late cycle?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Again, I think this is -- goes within the category of, hey, there's been an extraordinary shock to the system and the markets are trying to find equilibrium, but they're changing as time goes on. Again, there are people that are on unemployment. Some of them will be brought back and -- to work. And some of them won't have a job, given you're probably going to chop the capacity of a restaurant in half, for example. And maybe that's made up with delivery or pickup-type services or whatever, but it's just going to be different. And I would say it's beyond our ability to really predict with any degree of certainty when it comes to what that scenario is going to look like, which -- but it will -- we will have equilibrium.</p><p>Historically, when you talk about the great financial crisis or 9/11 or the dot-com period, these periods go on for maybe 18 months and then kind of turn the corner. In this case, I think we've had all the negative part of that 18 months in 1 month. And so it's all been compressed, and then now we have the second part where we're hopefully hitting bottom and now we're recovering. So I would expect that whole process, therefore, to compress to maybe 9 months or something like that.</p><p>HARDIK GOEL: Got it. That's really helpful. And just if you would oblige me one last one. Could you give us a range of the prices in which you bought back stock? I know the average was [2 27]. And I may be reaching here, but I have to try.</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: Hi. This is Angela. I think you're trying to be a troublemaker here. So let's just leave it as is. That's our average and that's what we report. Yes, I'll give you some credit for trying.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street.</p><p>JOHN JOSEPH PAWLOWSKI, ANALYST, GREEN STREET ADVISORS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just one for me. Mike, there's been a flurry of cities to enact their own type of rent freeze measure, and I realize most of them won't really impact your portfolio at all because they abide by Costa-Hawkins. There's a few examples of cities kind of violating Costa-Hawkins right now, but again, a de minimis impact, at least from [our lands] in your portfolio. When you step back and you evaluate the legislative landscape, is there anything on your radar that would prohibit your renewal pricing power beyond your own proactive 90-day window? Is there any issues with any cities later in the year where you won't be able to push renewals?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Well, John, I know you guys tracked us pretty well, and we do, too. And there have been all kinds of proposals out there. Fortunately, most of them have not moved forward. And in California, obviously, we have AB 1482, which is statewide rent control, imposing a cap of CPI plus 5 with a cap of 10. So we're managing through that environment. Fortunately, the more aggressive proposals have not been adopted, thank goodness.</p><p>I would say the one that was most concerning, really, maybe 2 of them, one is L.A. extending the rent payment program out a year. And then there's the judicial council that essentially is not going to hear eviction cases for some period after the state of emergency is raised. So we track it, but we think that, for the most part, we're working through it. And as John said, the good news is that most of our residents have chosen a higher path of working with us to work through their situation. And again, I look at that 2% bucket that hasn't communicated with us as being probably, ultimately, good news with respect to those that aren't trying to take the maximum advantage of these various laws.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Wes, you there?</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY, VP &amp; EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Well, sorry, I forgot this whole mute function. Sorry about that. Looking at S-16, the 2.8% rent decline, have you made any adjustments to the Essex model for the CARES Act neutralizing job loss?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: No. I don't -- no, we have not. Again, this is -- take the macro inputs, job growth, GDP growth, supply, and it's straight, this is what comes out of our model if we put those factors in and again, for the marketplace. So I think the CARES Act will definitely help. That's referring to S-16.1. And the pretty great unemployment benefits that are out there, I think that helps with respect to people hopefully being able to stay in our units longer and paying rent for a longer period of time and minimizing the damage. Even if they pay a half a month, that may be okay. At least they don't accrue a balance that becomes so large that they just can't -- we just finance it. So I think it will help. It will help more on the delinquency side probably than it will on the rent side.</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY: Okay. And then did you comment already about retail exposure?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: No. I'm glad to hit that. Retail is a really small part of our portfolio, like 1%, 1.5%. Our retail delinquency was basically about half of the retail tenants paid what they owed. So it was roughly in line with other things I've seen in the industry. That group of retail where they're located at multifamily sites typically are relatively handing out their service providers. So when the business shuts down, they struggle. We're working with really all of them and are pretty hopeful that they will be able to reopen back up. And we also will work with them on payment plans. So -- but that group was hit hard, and we've seen that really across the industry in everything I've seen.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.</p><p>HAENDEL EMMANUEL ST. JUSTE, MD OF AMERICAS RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES USA LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So Mike, I guess I was intrigued by your comments earlier on not being afraid to capitalize on the transaction markets should the right opportunities emerge. And I had flashbacks to the time around the great financial recession when you guys backed up the truck and acquired a sizable amount of newly completed or near-completion construction and lease-up type of assets. Those deals you're going to merge with BRE were instrumental in lowering your portfolio age and broadening your submarket and price point selections in your California market. So I guess I'm curious if you would be similarly interested in buying up busted condo projects or development lease-ups in size. And would you be more willing to cull from the bottom of your portfolio to fund it or perhaps use a fund structure to pursue these types of deals?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Haendel, those are great questions. I guess the difference between now and the great financial crisis, in the great financial crisis, you had mortgages being made to people that couldn't afford to pay them back. And the amount of distress within the housing sector was extraordinary, as you'll recall, which created this opportunity to buy vacant brand-new condo buildings at 50% of replacement. There is nothing even close to that out there at this time. And again, my comments in the script about record-high positive leverage. If you take a typical deal that might be a 6, let's say, 6.5 unlevered IRR with positive leverage, you're probably in the high 9s to low 10s, somewhere in that zone in terms of IRR -- levered IRR. So I think that, that is going to prevent any kind of significant distress within the markets. Of course, there are always some transactions that manage to find very aggressive lenders, and they manage to leverage our property up to 90% or more. And they're out there for sure, but they are few and far between, I would guess, at this point in time.</p><p>So in terms of our basic view of transactions, we view it as, okay, what can we do with our portfolio on a leverage-neutral basis? So what's the arbitrage ability within our portfolio? What can we sell and replace at a higher overall yield or growth rate or IRR, let's say? And how do we transact? So we're always thinking about it that way.</p><p>And so I would say that preferred equity is still pretty important to us. It's still sort of at the top of our list. And also, I would say, certainly, joint ventures, which take greater advantage than on our balance sheet, or a little bit higher leverage than the joint ventures at -- when we begin, and then, of course, that leverage drops over time but utilizes the leverage to a small extent or to some extent beyond that. So I would say those 2 things are transactions that we're looking at and are interested in. And I didn't mean to exclude Adam from this discussion because he's the expert at it. Adam, what did I miss?</p><p>ADAM W. BERRY: You nailed it all, Mike.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Did that help, Haendel?</p><p>HAENDEL EMMANUEL ST. JUSTE: It did. It did. I appreciate that. I want to go back to an earlier question, I guess, from a different angle. Just I'm curious if you're hearing anything in terms of rent forgiveness bills being contemplated in California and Washington beyond the tenant protection on -- for the temporary ban on evictions that we've been hearing here. As I'm sure you know, New York state is kind of contemplating such a forgiveness bill. I think it's NY S1825. So I'm curious if there's anything you're hearing. And it's -- just more broadly, as a concept, does that even work? Or how would that work? Just the idea of the government stepping in and telling landlords to forgive 1, 2, 3 months free rent. So curious on maybe what you're hearing and what you're thinking on that.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Well, clearly, this is California, and so you're going to hear some of those things and there have been various proposals out there. And we don't think that they're constitutional, but that doesn't necessarily stop them from being circulated. There actually is a bill in Sacramento, AB 828, that would give the courts the right to force landlords under certain circumstances to reduce rents by 25%. We think it's unlikely. But it's out there. We think it's very unlikely. We don't think it will happen.</p><p>And again, from what we understand in all these discussions throughout the West Coast, which are mainly cities, there have been a lot of proposals, but the city attorneys have been pretty good at pointing out the legal peril with respect to that position. So they have -- those bills have not been passed. And I think at this point in time, it appears that we're beyond that period where we're getting what seems to be a new legal mandate a day. We're kind of beyond that period now, and I think we're more in the period of let's figure out how to get back to work and open up. So I think that, from a timing perspective, the time for those bills has come and gone.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Michael Schall for closing comments.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Please call or e-mail us with any questions or comments. And our best wishes to you and your family during this challenging time. Thank you. Good day.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Emerging business initiatives fall squarely within this effort.</p><p>2. Continues to be pleased with progress across group with growing opportunities.</p><p>14. Marketplace business grew more than 70%, excluding Facebook, driven by growing global demand for ethically-sourced people-based data and trend towards BYLD (Bring Your Own Data).</p><p>15. Continued to be encouraged by TV opportunity, which grew multiples with acquisition of Data Plus Math.</p><p>1. Integration underway and on track.</p><p>2. Excluding Data Plus Math, which will be included in results beginning in 2Q, TV business grew roughly 30% in 1Q20, driven by increase in addressable TV campaign volumes and ramping CTV business.</p><p>1. Bookings outlook for remainder of year gives even more confidence in business.</p><p>2. Seeing contract values expand as more homes become addressable.</p><p>3. Growing data enablement of CTV inventory presents strong tailwind for business.</p><p>16. Almost any co. that is doing any marketing can generate better results by utilizing Data Store.</p><p>Product Strategy (A.G.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. Focus inside products is to establish RAMP as trusted industry standard for connected data.</p><p>2. To do this, Co. has built defensible and extensible identity and data connectivity platform for enterprise, one that anyone everyone in industry can use as integral part of their own independent technologies.</p><p>1. Co. helps customers and partners navigate growing industry and regulatory complexity impacting their businesses.</p><p>3. Believes Co.'s unique positioning enables it to help entire industry in three important areas:</p><p>1. Identity.</p><p>2. Data stewardship.</p><p>3. Innovation.</p><p>4. Identity:</p><p>1. Today, there's proliferation in unique and proprietary identifiers including names, addresses, emails, first-party cookies, third-party cookies, mobile ad IDs, subscriber and user IDs, device IDs, and many more.</p><p>2. Concept of connected identity is essential role that RAMP fulfills for industry.</p><p>3. Co. vs. partners:</p><p>1. Co.'s goal isn't to own all identity, but rather to power every owner of identity to get greater value from their data.</p><p>2. As Co. embeds new identifiers, integration and partners into its product, customers gain access to more capabilities to configure, manage and activate their own version of identity.</p><p>3. Co.'s efforts enable ecosystem interoperability and protect participants from being held captive to any single source of identity.</p><p>4. Added number of new identifiers and increased coverage in emerging addressable channels.</p><p>1. Consumers consume content across increasing number of medium, and Co.'s customers want to talk to these consumers in omni-channel context wherever they are.</p><p>2. Customers can now reach over 55m people on connected TV, over 17m people through MVPD integration, and over 80% of US population through Co.'s premium publisher integration.</p><p>3. Customers will be able to reach people across display inventory, regardless of availability of third-party cookies or mobile advertising IDs through RAMP's ATS offering launching at end of Aug.</p><p>5. Through Smart Reach program, advertisers can broaden their identity coverage by sharing first-party identities in permissioned and non-discoverable context.</p><p>1. In last year alone, grew mobile Smart Reach contributions by 350%, offline contributions 19x, and online contributions by more than 20%.</p><p>6. Co. is taking steps to enable addressability regardless of whatever industry shifts may occur in future.</p><p>1. In last year, incorporated RAMP's IdentityLink into bidstream for programmatic display.</p><p>2. IdentityLink is the only people-based omni-channel identifier available in bidstream.</p><p>3. Co. now has billions of bid requests within IdentityLink available on which to bid.</p><p>4. Four out of Top 5 SSPs are currently committed to implementing IdentityLink in bidstream.</p><p>5. Has 11 DSPs live, who are implementing ability to bid directly on IdentityLink.</p><p>7. Through ATS, suppliers can ensure stable relationships with their customers and monetization of their traffic.</p><p>1. ATS enables IdentityLink to be directly tied to first-party identifiers so that publishers can own their first-party relationship with user and effectively make their inventory addressable to advertisers.</p><p>2. This enables publishers to build enduring business models independent of whims of Big Tech.</p><p>5. Data stewardship:</p><p>1. Consumer protection afforded by GDPR were accompanied by regulatory complexity that impacted many businesses.</p><p>2. Complexity is growing, with new regulation contemplated in many additional international markets, and many US state, and at federal level.</p><p>3. Data stewardship extends far beyond legislation.</p><p>4. Co. feels this is tremendous tailwind for RAMP, and has taken steps to ensure it provides value to ecosystem as safe trusted choice to enable companies to operate within legal and ethical parameters.</p><p>5. Co. is ensuring customers and partners are ready for regulatory change.</p><p>1. Preparing for GDPR, and being responsive to new rulings and interpretations of law, has prepared Co. really well for tackling CCPA-readiness.</p><p>6. Key areas of focus relating to CCPA-readiness:</p><p>1. Co. is updating privacy policies to ensure that California consumers understand and are informed about their rights under CCPA.</p><p>2. Reviewing contracts to ensure that all parties who interact with Co.'s network are transmitting data in privacy safe compliant manner.</p><p>3. Ensuring Co.'s products and systems recognize and support core stipulations of CCPA like perpetuating consumer opt-out downstream.</p><p>7. Co. is making it easier for ecosystem to collect and manage consumer permissions.</p><p>1. Faktor is core to effort, and its consent management platform for CCPA is set to launch later this fall.</p><p>8. Continues to serve as trusted safe haven across businesses.</p><p>1. Co. is often one of only companies that customers trust with access to their PII.</p><p>6. Innovation:</p><p>1. Increasingly, Co. sees customers collaborating with one another across RAMP's platform to create entirely new products.</p><p>2. Believes that by making products ever more modularized, Co. can unlock further innovation in ecosystem.</p><p>3. Neutral data safe haven for measurement:</p><p>1. Social media, premium publishers, search and other publisher platforms building ad-supported businesses need to be able to show ROI and enable granular optimization for advertisers.</p><p>2. Without RAMP's data connectivity, these platforms are limited to tracking only online or mobile conversions in their ROI analysis.</p><p>3. Across retail today, less than 11% of sales are online.</p><p>4. Over past couple of years, RAMP has been developing programs with publishers to bring in-store sales data from retailers safely and securely into these platforms to enable omni-channel measurement.</p><p>5. A few years ago, Co. had only handful of these programs.</p><p>6. Today, Co. enables store sales measurement into over 15 platforms and has over 50 clients leveraging one or more of these programs.</p><p>4. Modularization and seamless integration:</p><p>1. Co. is currently at tail-end of migration to Google Cloud Platform, which is critical step in scalability of its business.</p><p>2. Co. is laying groundwork today to execute on API platform strategies post migration to simplify internal platform and expose more functionality externally.</p><p>3. Many customers, both brands and platforms, are building their own identity graph, and they're looking for faster and easier ways to do identity translation within their own environment.</p><p>4. Through Co.'s efforts to modularize and expose more external API's, it is creating greater flexibility for customers to develop on top of its core identity and data connectivity capabilities.</p><p>1Q20 Financials (W.J.)</p><p>1.

We've continued to see the U.S. really power the results with the growth rate higher than the company overall. I know the International story is still an early one, but what are the sort of key checkpoints we should be looking for on that to see it accelerate?</p><p>And then Warren, a bit more specific for you. We see that you picked up the buyback, particularly in July. Obviously, you got past some milestones with some acquisitions and got visibility on it. Just curious if that contributed to the timing of picking up the pace in July. Or it's more you were saying something about the stock after a bit of a pullback. But lastly, would love to just to hear your updated thoughts on where you expect the pace of trends of the buyback to be in light of that elevation here lately.</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON, PRESIDENT, CFO &amp; EXECUTIVE MD OF INTERNATIONAL, LIVERAMP HOLDINGS, INC.: Thanks Dan, this is Warren. I'm going to jump in on both the International and then the buyback. It's really been quite fascinating as we've gone through GDPR and then as we think about CCPA because I would say number one, having gone through GDPR the way we did over the past years has been incredibly beneficial. It's also been incredibly beneficial as we've even further hardened our routines internationally. So number one, this has been a big benefit to us, we believe in how we're approaching regulation in the U.S.</p><p>The second thing that I wanted to point out internationally is because of GDPR, I think we've also been incredibly innovative, and this will get to the pace of where are we focused and what -- where is International leading. And by the way, where we're leading internationally can also benefit the entirety of the company. I'd highlight 3 or 4 things that we are working on today that we think ultimately will cause us to hit the inflection point that you talked about, Dan.</p><p>Number one, what we are doing with transactional data. We have incredible partnerships with retailers, with grocers and others in both France and the U.K., that we are connecting with advertisers to where we can complete the whole entire measurement loop. This is working extremely well and will be something that we will continue to roll out across the company. So basically, connecting advertisers with actual transaction data. The second thing, which you've heard a lot about, is what we are doing on data sharing. The Carrefour platform is incredibly innovative. It has global attention. We have multiple tenants now up and running I believe on 4 -- over 4 continents.</p><p>Next, what's going on with Data Store. Obviously, overall and in terms of internationally, we had a great quarter with Data Store in marketplace. We think this will continue to benefit us internationally. And then finally, nothing per se this quarter that I wanted to talk about but you'll also see TV, I believe or we believe, become a material part of our overall International story. So a lot of things in the work -- a lot of things that are in the works, much more to come. We believe all very, very positive for us internationally.</p><p>And I guess finally, I'd put one other wrapper which also fits into our global story. Internationally, clients are turning to us for assistance. We've made a statement before that data-driven marketing is as important in Tokyo or Paris as it is in New York City, that is 100% the case.</p><p>Next, on the buyback. Just as we said in the prepared remarks, we believe we've really been walking the talk over a long period of time when it comes to capital allocation or returning capital to our shareowners. It's pretty interesting, when we were preparing that little analysis going back, when Scott started out here, we believe our market cap was somewhere around $800 million or $900 million, and we actually bought back more stock in our entire market cap since that period of time. And this quarter was another good example of that. We felt like there was an opportunity to be opportunistic. Therefore, we were in the market the way we were even after the quarter closed.</p><p>That said, we want to be consistent or we want to be appropriate and balance all of our different needs going forward. Therefore, our guidance remains the same. In the near term, we expect to be conservative in our approach just as we've outlined before. That said, depending upon the facts and circumstances, we will also, from time to time, continue to be opportunistic.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next call -- question is from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.</p><p>STEWART KIRK MATERNE, SENIOR MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on a good quarter. I was wondering maybe if Anneka could weigh in or Scott could weigh in just on -- when you look at to the back half of the year, given some of the changes Google is going through and CCPA, are the types of conversations you're having with customers getting -- are they longer? Meaning, are these things creating longer sales cycles? Or are customers kind of beyond that at this point in time? I just wanted to get some color around that just as we head in the back half of the year.</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, LIVERAMP HOLDINGS, INC.: Yes. I will tell you 2 things. Number one is we've had the benefit as Warren just mentioned of living through GDPR, and all of that experience is helping us prepare clients for CCPA and a flurry of other state and international, and hopefully someday, federal legislation. Most of the companies that we work with, enterprise companies, tend to have global businesses. So they too have been through this before. And as a result, a lot of the remediation that they perhaps had to do in Europe is going to parallel what they now have to do in the U.S.</p><p>And so we look at this as a tailwind for us in so much as it's really hard for all of our clients and partners, even the most sophisticated to stay up to speed on all of the changing regulations. That's the entirety of our business. And so now more than ever, we're being asked for our perspective on what we think, where we think things are going and importantly, what our clients and partners need to do to prepare for that future.</p><p>STEWART KIRK MATERNE: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe one for Warren, I'm going to sort of dovetail 2 together. Dollar-base retention you mentioned is right in line with your guidance of last quarter. What has to happen in the back half of the year to sort of do a little bit better than that 105% target? And I was just -- and actually, I just have one other follow-up, so why don't we just start there?</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON: Okay. You know what I'd like to do is I think it might be helpful for everyone for me just to reconcile from, call it, last quarter we were at 114% down to the 108% because what you will find, Kirk, is that the same drivers that drove it from 114% to 108% are the same drivers that are leading us to and get you to 105%.</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE: Why don't you talk about reconciliation, and I'll jump in about what's next?</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON: Okay. Good. So within the concept of reconciliation, what we've done is -- and ask you to put up on top of your page, 115% and then we've divided sort of the reconciliation into 3 buckets. The first one is large deals, the second one is nonregrettable churn and then third is kind of all other.</p><p>So let me start with large deals. In the year ago quarter, and remember for everybody on the phone, dollar-based net retention is about a revenue cohort from a year ago. So what clients did you have a year ago generating what subscription revenue and how did that then translate to what you did in the current quarter. So in the year ago quarter, we had 3 large deals that materially contributed to upside, we were unable to repeat that performance with those large clients. That resulted in about 4 points of the decline. The second piece was nonregrettable churn, which we've also talked about. That was 1 point and everything else amounted -- everything else was 1 point. So 4, 1 and 1, 114% to 108%.</p><p>When we talk about the back half of the year, it's really more of the same, just as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. Again, I'm reconciling from 115% to 105%, about 6 points of that is large deals, about 2 points is nonregrettable churn and another 2 points is all other. Scott?</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE: Yes. In terms, Kirk, of what we need to do to now increase it. The good news is there is no silver bullet here. It's all about execution. That's what sales is always about. And so it starts with the whole concept of just upselling, which is having conversations with all of our enterprise clients about what they are trying to accomplish, bringing them ideas. And those ideas and conversations then turn into product tweaks or new configurations, which then manifest themselves into our pipeline and then ultimately, into bookings. It's Sales 101.</p><p>Now as we generate those bookings, some of them you'll see in our net dollar retention. And that's going to be increases to our core subscription business, that upsell. Some of it, quite frankly, you won't see in our net dollar retention because it's going to go sit somewhere else in our P&amp;L. So the things that we're doing, the things that drove, for instance, marketplace are many times with the existing book of business but those aren't factored into net dollar retention. So things like television or Data Store, which are a result of those upsell conversations won't actually show up in that dollar retention.</p><p>The second thing that we're doing which isn't a problem per se, but it's just an opportunity is really trying to manage churn or downsell from clients more effectively. So putting in place early indicators of when a client isn't having as much success and then getting back in front of those clients and evangelizing, educating them how to use our products and technologies such that they cannot not only avoid churn but actually fall into the upsell bucket. Again, not a problem for us but definitely an opportunity. As long as churn is above 0, we're never going to be happy with it.</p><p>And then the final thing that we're doing and I referenced a lot of this in my prepared remarks are really like just core accountability and sales management basics. Things like, as we've scaled our sales force, training, ensuring that we surround our core sellers with subject matter experts that can go in and help get a client across the line when they have questions. Or just ensuring -- and Anneka gave a couple of examples of this, the whole concept of partner alignments such that we're understanding what they are trying to do and tweaking our products such that the partners' products are more effective. And that's really the translation from sales to product. So the good news is all those things are underway. And I think they're all quite manageable.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Shyam Patil from Susquehanna.</p><p>SHYAM VASANT PATIL, SENIOR ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP, LLLP, RESEARCH DIVISION: Great quarter. I had a couple of questions. First one on CTV, can you talk a little bit more about how that business is ramping for you guys here in the U.S. as well as internationally? And then, just how you're thinking about Amazon opening up Fire TV, the third-party demand and just how LiveRamp fits into that?</p><p>And then second question for you, Warren, is when you look at the subscription revenue, can you talk about just how the direct revenue portion of that has been trending? And just kind of how you're thinking about that growth going forward?</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE: Yes. So this is a Scott, and I'll start. In terms of television like our core television business, that's pre-Data Plus Math, grew around 30% for the quarter. And remember not all of the television efforts we do show up in television, it also draws a lot from Data Store, so some of it actually will sit there. But with the Data Plus Math acquisition, I will tell you that our expectations here really have skyrocketed. Our TAM has increased. And I really have to go back to our acquisition of LiveRamp to see clients as excited about a new offering in our portfolio as they're excited about Data Plus Math.</p><p>Virtually, all of our enterprise clients are doing some kind of television advertising, and we think that with Data Plus Math, it just makes them more effective at that television advertising. It extends what they might already be doing in search or display or e-mail, what have you. So we would expect that our television business for the remainder of the year is going to grow significantly, significantly faster than our baseline.</p><p>With respect to Amazon, 2 thoughts. Number one -- and both of them are good. Number one is, remember that we're one of the early partners of Amazon powering their DSP. We already have dozens of advertisers live with that. And our API, will -- goes live at the end of Q2 should make it even easier for advertisers to get on board there. So we have a really good relationship with Amazon. Moreover, we think that anything that drives awareness of advanced television of any sort is good for our business. Because remember, one of the things that LiveRamp does is we play across all of the elements of advanced television, whether it be connected television, OTT, data-driven linear, the full gamut. And so awareness in the industry means inquiries and opportunities for us.</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON: And then let me comment on the second part. And I'm going to answer the question really 2 ways. One, I'm going to talk about both our subscription revenue and then the variable part of subscription revenue, and then the second way is I'll talk about direct versus reseller.</p><p>So in terms of the variable piece of subscription, it's trending right where we thought it would be, right around 10%, 12% so kind of 11%, and we see that holding in strong. When it comes to direct versus reseller, both are up nicely. And in fact, we were hopeful, again, over the long term, to increase our reseller relationships because we increasingly see a number of the consulting firms or others very interested in partnering with us as they do their strategic work with their global clients.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>STAN ZLOTSKY, VP, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe just to start. So very strong Q1 results which is great, but then when we look through the deck, it looks like your revenue phasing for the rest of the year shifted more towards Q4 versus Q2. And also, the full year revenue guidance didn't move up despite a very strong beat in Q1. How should we think about the -- your outlook for the rest of the year? What you baked into your forward guidance and given the phasing that you are now seeing more towards Q4? And then I have a quick follow-up.</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON: Yes. I guess what I would say, first of all, obviously, we didn't change the full year. And let me come to that point first, Stan. We just think it's too early to change our full year outlook. If things change throughout the back part of the year and it warrants that we raise, we would, of course, do that. From our own internal perspective, yes, we had a solid beat materially, things have not really moved around in our own internal expectations relative to Q2, Q3 and/or Q4.</p><p>Our outlook, we continue to expect a very strong outlook for marketplace. I want to remind everybody that we are expecting a material step-up in revenue in Q3. That step-up is based about 50% of what's going on in marketplace, which we think is solid based on our current run rates and also what we expect to have happen in Q3. Our increasing subscription revenue, Q2 to Q3, is right in line with historical averages. And when we think about what we have actually committed today and in the books, well in line with historical -- well in line with historical standards.</p><p>Where we are feeling some pressure is on our subscription growth rates. And that has directly to do with the strength that we saw from these large clients in the back part of the year. That said, just as Scott did, we have a lot of growth levers, we're very optimistic about our long-term growth, but we are seeing some pressure in our subscription growth rates in the back part of the year.</p><p>STAN ZLOTSKY: Got it. And if I could just maybe go back to the discussion around the sales changes, I'm not saying -- about the adjustments that you're making as far as focusing your sales organization on net revenue retention rate. Could you maybe dive into that a little bit more, specifically around the strategy functions that you're adding about the upsell of analytics measurement, data lakes? And that's it for me.</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE: Yes. I'd really talked about 2 changes and let me just say, this train has left the station and it has been rolling down the tracks for several years. So don't think that there's any huge strategic shifts here. This is just normal course of business. You've heard us talk before about the importance of education and evangelization. It is very difficult as a category creator going out and talking to large clients. We have to educate them around what we do, how to utilize our capabilities effectively. And so one of the things that we realized over time is that we have to surround our kind of account quarterbacks with subject matter experts. And that's increasingly true as we add more products into our portfolio.</p><p>So we have television subject matter experts, who can accompany the account owner to a meeting and help get those conversations across the line. Likewise, we spun up a group that's really focused more on measurement because the whole concept of measurement, the creation of data lakes, that's a deep subject matter expertise that not everyone in our organization has. And so there we have kind of a one to many selling relationships. Those subject matter experts work across much smaller group, works across our entire client portfolio.</p><p>The other thing that we talked about in my prepared remarks was the construct of sales excellence team. One of the things that we did, and this isn't just in sales but really throughout our business. When we went -- when we've sold the legacy Acxiom business, we've stood up LiveRamp as a public company, we really had to focus on how do we get a spotlight on everything that matters at our business. And so relative to a year or 2 ago, we have so much granularity in how we look at all the key levers of our business, the things we are measuring and tracking, the dashboards with which we can arm our teams. And so the sales excellence group was stood up really to help manage those dashboards and work across all of the sales teams to help them interpret their results, determine what to do about it and long term just manage their bulk of businesses more effectively.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research.</p><p>VASILY KARASYOV, FOUNDER, CANNONBALL RESEARCH, LLC: I wanted to go back to Data Plus Math and had a question about that and maybe Anneka can step in here too. So my question was trying to understand exactly the service and the TAM that the company has here. It would seem, and correct me if I'm wrong and I want to understand where I'm wrong, it seems like the service that they provide has to do more with direct response advertising, TV advertising, and which would imply that it's not necessarily applicable to all of the television advertising market. And so I'm assuming I'm not understanding entirely the suite of services they provide. So if you could correct me and tell me how it works with brand advertising on television, I would really appreciate that.</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE: Yes. I would say a couple of things on this and Anneka can jump in here. Number one is it's not just for direct response advertising. It's really beneficial for accountable advertising. And in some cases, that could mean someone saw an ad and subsequently purchased, but in other cases, it's about they see an ad and visit a website. So there are opportunities to measure things that have historically been thought of as building awareness but doing it with accountability.</p><p>The second thing that our television business allows us to do is historically, traditional television has been bought on TRPs and GRPs, broad reach measures. But what we can now do is bring all of the more granular data. The more interesting data is someone in the market to purchase on the automobile in the Northeast, that tells us something far more interesting than just simply age and gender. And so even for brand advertisers to buy with those dials, it allows them to buy with much more precision than historically has been accessible to them.</p><p>OPERATOR: My apologies. I'd like to turn the call back over to Warren Jenson for closing remarks.</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON: Let me simply conclude again by thanking everyone for joining us today. And I'll close with just a few final thoughts. Again, thank you. We just finished a great quarter. Our business is strong. It's predictable. It's recurring. We are enterprise SaaS and we are Switzerland. We're pleased to have this call today with multiple growth levers in place. Our products are -- and services are in the sweet spot of martech and helping create billions of dollars in value for our customers. The great news is we have a clear path to profitability, ample liquidity to see us through our progression. And again, thank you. Our transformation at LiveRamp has only just begun.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference call.

DJ is pleased to be reporting EPS growth, as well as linage gains for the fourth quarter in a row. 2. Excluding special items, DJ earned $0.41 per diluted share, which is up 52% from $0.27 per diluted share in 2Q03. 3. DJ's strong operating leverage was evident once again as an 11% increase in revenue resulted in a 62% increase in operating income. 4. On the Electronic Publishing side, DJ had another strong quarter of revenue growth at Dow Jones Indexes and at Consumer Electronic Publishing. 5. Within its news wires businesses, the Co. successfully integrated its recent acquisitions of Alternative Investor Group and VWD. 6. DJ's community newspaper group, Ottaway continues to post strong revenue growth and profit, while maintaining one of the highest margins among its peers. 7. At its Print Publishing segment where revenue and profits also were up, color advertising continues to grow, up 22% in 2Q04, and up 32% for 1H04. 1. And that follows strong color ad growth of 28% in 2003 and 34% in 2002. 8. DJ has also continued to attract new advertisers. 9. Personal Journal ad linage is up more than 52% in 2004 and actually is approaching the healthy ad levels in the Co.'s very successful weekend Journal section. 10. DJ saw per issue linage at the Journal in April and May up around 7-8% while June was down 3.5%, which adds upto the 3.3% increase for 2Q04. 1. This month-to-month ad volatility has in turn been driven by inconsistent trends across major ad categories which the Co. sees continuing into 3Q04. 2. And even as DJ posts some positive gains, it is well aware that ad levels remain significantly below what it considers normal preboom, prebust levels. 11. During 2Q04, DJ was once again recognized for the quality of its products as the Wall Street Journal was honored with a number of global awards and Newswires won its second straight annual news provider of the year award from inside market data. 12. Dow Jones News plus, a 'Business Now' initiative won its first ever Cody award, and the online Journal brought home two more. 13. A few weeks ago, DJ did reach to a settlement with IAPE (Phonetic) that is the union that represents about 25% of DJ's employees, which includes many of the 'The Wall Street Journal' newspeople. 1. This agreement has the support and endorsement of the union's bargaining committee, its executive council, and Board of Directors. 2. It is going to go to the IAPE (Phonetic) membership for ratification shortly. 3. The tenant agreement represents a full and fair resolution of many difficult issues and that should enable DJ to devote its full attention, going forward to its publications, products, and customers.</p><p>S2. Financials (C.V.) 1. Highlights: 1. Before special items, 2Q04 EPS was $0.41, which is about the current First Call mean of $0.38 and 52% above 2Q03 earnings of $0.27 per share. 2. YTD through June, total revenue is up 12% and EPS before special items was $0.63 per share and 62% above 2Q03, as DJ continues to significantly leverage its cost reductions. 3. Total Co. revenue was in line with expectations of an 11% increase 2Q04, with increased revenues at Electronic Publishing and Ottaway offsetting slightly lower-than-expected advertising revenue at Print Publishing. 4. Lower OpEx across the portfolio drove the improved earnings performance vs. DJ's April guidance. 5. 2Q04 revenue increased to $438m, including roughly 3.5% of the increase from its recent acquisitions, Stockton, Technologic Partner, Alternative Investor Group, and VWD. 1. This is the last quarter that the Co. will report Stockton results separately as an acquisition, as it has now anniversaried its May 2003 purchase of the property. 6. 2Q04 OpEx of $382m were up roughly 6% over 2Q03 before special items and better than DJ's April guidance of an 8% increase, as it continues to tightly control expenses at all business units. 1. This includes: 1. Approx. 3% related to the Co.'s recent acquisitions. 2. Less than 1% for increased news print expenses. 3. 1% associated with the increase of foreign currency costs. 2. All other expenses were up only 2% over 2Q03, including a $2m charge for a small workforce reduction and circulation distribution of the Journal, part of the Co.'s 'Business Now' priority to improve circulation efficiency. 3. Nearly offsetting this charge was a nontaxable benefit of roughly $1.5m relating to accounting for the Medicare Prescription Drug Act. 4. DJ will save a similar amount in 2H04 as a result of that charge. 7. 2Q04 ending headcount, totaled about 7,150. 1. Excluding employees associated with DJ's acquisitions, comparable headcount was down 2% from 2Q03. 2. Other Key Figures: 1. Total newsprint cost in 2Q04 were up a little more than 5% with consumption down 2%, and DJ's avg. cost per ton up about 8% vs. 2Q03 levels. 1. DJ is staying at roughly $30 per ton after the Feb. price increase took hold by the time it was all said and done. 2. And as DJ has done in the past, it also used inventory where possible to mitigate some of the impact. 3. The Co.'s internal forecast also anticipates a late-summer price increase that follows the path of last year's, that is it takes a few months to stick, and when it does, not at the full announced rate. 2. Before special items, DJ's expected tax rate was 40.9% for 2Q04, and is expected to come in around 41% for the year. 3. CapEx totaled $15m in 2Q04 vs. $12m in 2Q03. 4. DJ continues to tightly manage working capital and cash flow items and cash flow and balance sheet remains strong. 5. After CapEx, dividends, investments, and all other outflows, DJ used $33m of excess cash flow plus $11m of cash to reduce its debt by another $44m in 2Q04. 6. DJ closed 2Q04 with debt of $215m, vs. a debt level of $210m in 2Q03, and $258m at the end of 1Q04. 3. Outlook: 1. With a seasonally low 3Q of ad volume at the Journal, DJ expects its excess cash flow to be about flat in 3Q04, returning sharply positive in 4Q04, which it will use to reduce its debt balance further.</p><p>S3. Detailed Financials (R.Z.) 1. In Detail: 1. In 2Q04, DJ posted significant gains in revenue, earnings, and margins in each of its 3 business segments. 1. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of such gains. 2. DJ has also posted increased advertising linage at 'The Wall Street Journal' for the past 4 consecutive quarters. 1. As a result, over these past 4 quarters: 1. Revenue is up 9%. 2. Operating income is up 53%. 3. EPS before special items is up 52%. 3. DJ's Print Publishing ad volumes and its overall earnings are being constrained by the cyclically soft B-to-B ad environment and are well below what the Co. considers normal levels. 2. IAPE Contract 1. IAPE represents about 1600 of DJ's employees including those in news, advertising sales, technology, circulation, and administrative areas. 2. These folks have been working without a contract since April 2003, and after much negotiation, DJ has agreed to pay them wage increases of: 1. 0% in 2003. 2. 2.5% in 2004. 3. 3.25% in 2005. 4. 3.5% in 2006. 3. Also, DJ will make lump sum payments totaling $2,000 to each IAPE employee. 4. In addition, IAPE members will be subject to the Co.'s new medical plan effective on 01/01/05. 1. This new plan, which other DJ employees enrolled and effective 01/01/04, incorporates design changes aimed at reducing cost for both employees and the Co., and for the first time requires employees to contribute to monthly medical premiums. 5. DJ believes that this settlement is fair to both IAPE members and its shareholders. 6. Taken together, the lump sum payments and wage increases are in line with those settled at other publishers. 7. The new medical plan, while still very generous by competitive standards, will help slow the rapid escalation in Co.'s medical costs. 8. Taken together, these items enable DJ to continue to control cost in this still uncertain revenue environment. 1. The Co. will incur one-time cost of about $4m in 3Q04 and $2m in 4Q04 for the lump sum payments, after adding in an additional $1,000 payment for each nonIAPE, nonmanagement employee to keep them whole with IAPE members. 9. With all IAPE and nonIAPE employees now subject to the new medical plan, DJ expects to save nearly $9m annually in medical and retiree health costs. 10. The agreement is subject to a ratification vote by the IAPE membership, and the Co. hopes to have the whole process wrapped up in the next 6 weeks or so. 3. Print Publishing: 1. Print Publishing's total revenue is up 8% from 2Q03. 2. Operating income more than tripled to $17m and margins grew to 6.8%. 3. DJ said that in an improving ad environment, about $0.80 of every new dollar of Journal advertising revenue flows through to the bottom line. 1. This flow-through was 60% in 2Q04, but adjusting for increased newsprint prices and foreign currency costs, this flow-through was 78%, very close to DJ's 80% target. 4. Making similar adjustments for the full year, DJ expects to hit its 80% target for the full year. 5. DJ saw continued volatility in monthly comps at the US Journal with per issue linage in April and May, each up around 7%, and in June, down 3.5%. 1. This led to an increase of 3.3% in ad linage at the US Journal for 2Q04. 6. While financial advertising has been relatively strong through 1H04, unfortunately, technology advertising has been weak. 1. Financial advertising increased 5.3% in 2Q04 as strong wholesale advertising more than offset weakness in tombstone and retail financial advertising. 1. This was the third consecutive quarter of increases in financial advertising volume and DJ is cautiously optimistic that it will strengthen a bit in 2H04 with continued strength in wholesale and improved trends in tombstone and in retail ads. 2. Technology linage was down 28% in 2Q04. 3. During 2H04, particularly in 3Q04, DJ is expecting technology ad spending to remain weak due to a combination of tough comps in 2H03 and cutbacks in ad budgets at many large B-to-B tech companies driven by their spotty profit growth and uncertain outlook for global technology spending. 7. In the Journal's general advertising category, linage was up 15% in 2Q04 on strong increases in professional services, insurance, luxury, travel, and healthcare advertising categories. 8. Auto was down a modest 4% in 2Q04. 1. However, DJ expects the auto category to rebound in 2H04 as comp fees, and the Co. sees a number of new vehicles and incentive programs launch in the fall. 9. The Journal posted an 11% increase in classified and other linage in 2Q04, driven by strong increases in real estate, recruitment, and other classified advertising. 1. Looking beyond linage to ad revenue, DJ is pleased that for the fourth consecutive quarter, ad revenue gains at the Journal significantly outpaced linage gains. 2. In 2Q04, DJ posted a 9.5% increase in advertising revenue at the Journal on a 3.3% increase in ad linage. 10. Today's Journal continues to drive positive results. 1. The expanded color capacity in Today's Journal drove a 22% increase in color ad pages and 32% increase in color ad revenue during 2Q04. 2. The Co. is averaging roughly 8 full color page equivalents per day out of its total color advertising capacity of upto 20 pages per day. 3. Color pages have nearly doubled since the Co. increased color capacity at the end of 2001. 4. DJ is also using Today's Journal in its new Personal Journal section to expand consumer advertising, to reduce its reliance on financial and tech advertising. 11. DJ's targeted consumer categories of auto, travel, healthcare, and luxury consumer goods showed linage gains of 8% and revenue gains of 13% during 2Q04. 1. Ad revenue in these categories is up about 24% since the end of 2001. 12. Elsewhere in Print Publishing, at the Asian and European editions of the Journal, total advertising linage increased 6% per issue in 2Q04 on strength in nearly all categories offset by weakness in tech advertising. 13. At Barron's, ad pages increased a healthy 21% in 2Q04 driven by very strong financial and auto advertising. 4. Electronic Publishing: 1. DJ continues to improve its profits and industry-leading margins. 2. 2Q04 revenue was up 20%. 3. Operating income was up 43%. 4. Operating margins were up 370 BP to 23.8% over 2Q03. 5. Excluding acquisitions: 1. Revenue was up 7%. 2. Operating income was up 29%. 3. Margins were up 430 BP, driven by strong revenue and profit performance at both Consumer Electronic Publishing and Dow Jones Indexes. 6. At Newswires, revenue was up 21% driven by the recent acquisitions of Tech Partners, Alternative Investors Group, and VWD. 1. The integration of these acquisitions is going as planned and the Co. is on track to meet its profit projections. 2. Revenue in Newswires core business was about flat during 2Q04. 7. At Consumer Electronic Publishing, 2Q04 revenue was up 13%, driven by a 35% increase in online advertising revenue and 4.5% increase in circulation revenue. 1. Subscribers at the end of 2Q04 were 684,000, up 2% over 2Q03, and down slightly from 1Q04. 2. Importantly, usage of the Co.'s paid site, WSJ.com as measured by unique visitors was up 13% during 2Q04. 8. At Ottaway 2Q04: 1. Revenue was up 11%. 2. Operating income was up 17%. 3. Operating margins were up 160 BP to 28.7% over 2Q03. 4. Revenue gains were driven by the May 2003 acquisition of the Stockton Record and same property revenue growth of 6.4%, which in turn, was driven by a 5.5% increase in ad linage in 2Q04 with strong auto and real estate classified linage. 5. Same property operating income at Ottaway was up 13% over 2Q03. 5. 3Q04 Outlook: 1. For 3Q04, recent trends appear likely to continue. 2. While DJ expects continued gains in financial wholesale, general B-to-B, consumer and classified advertising, and expects improved trends in auto, tombstone, and financial retail advertising, much of this is likely to be offset by weakness in technology advertising, as well as in travel advertising, as the Co. is up against very difficult post-war comps and travel ad. 3. By month, DJ expects per issue linage comps at the Journal to be down slightly in the slow summer months of July and Aug., followed by a nice gain in the busier month of Sept., all leading to 3Q04 linage up in the low single-digit range. 4. Together with continued strong gains elsewhere in the portfolio, this leverage of level of linage gain will result in 8% increase in total revenue for 3Q04. 5. On the expense line, DJ will continue to hold on to the vast majority of its cost reductions. 1. The Co. expects total operating expenses to be up about 6% in 3Q04. 2. Of this, about 4% is due to expenses for its: 1. Recent acquisitions. 2. Increased newsprint and foreign currency cost. 3. The lump sum payment related to its tentative labor contract settlement. 6. This leaves comparable expenses up only 2% over 2Q04. 7. The net of all of this is an EPS estimate before special items of about $0.20 per share for 3Q04, and this is after deducting about $0.03 per share for the lump sum payment related to DJ's tentative labor contract. 1. This is up from $0.14 per share in 2Q03. 6. Summary: 1. In 2Q04, DJ improved revenue profit margins virtually everywhere in its portfolio. 2. At Electronic Publishing and Ottaway, DJ increased its margins, which were already near the top of their peer groups. 3. At Print Publishing, the Co. got another strong glimpse of how highly leveraged its earnings growth is to an improving ad environment. 4. Going forward, DJ will continue to control everything it can to maximize its upside as the ad environment continues to improve.</p><p>QUESTION AND ANSWER SUMMARY</p><p>Q1. What is the organic revenue and operating income growth for the Electronic Publishing segment in 2Q04? (Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs)</p><p>A. (Rich Zannino) If you exclude acquisitions, revenue was up 7%, operating income was up 29%, and margins were up 430 BP to 24.4%.</p><p>Q2. And the primary driver of the margin gain is just the inherent operating leverage in the business model? (Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs)</p><p>A. (Rich Zannino) Absolutely.</p><p>Q3. Anything specific in terms of price adjustments or particular units within Electronic Publishing that is driving that margin gain? (Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs)</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) I would encourage you to take a look at the leverage now that we are seeing in our online operations where the advertising increase of some 35% has continued pretty nicely. Our Dow Jones Indexes business also has very significant revenue increases and that has become a very significant margin business.</p><p>Q4. What do you think a normalized level of margin for Electronic Publishing business might be over the next couple of years? (Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs)</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) I think, as Rich said, we are already toward the very top of our peer group. So, I wouldn't want to suggest that it can go a lot higher than now. We are very focused on growing the topline while maintaining these kinds of margins.</p><p>Q5. The Print Publishing business has been unprofitable for the last several years in the third quarters, is the revenue momentum you are seeing currently sufficient to get you to profitability in 3Q04? (Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs)</p><p>A. (Rich Zannino) We are going to look at that.</p><p>Q6. Specifically on tombstone advertising, why is it not better and is there somewhat of a secular change here where in a more regulatory scrutinized environment, investment banks are hesitant to take out big ads announcing deals, or is this a function of deal size? (Douglas Arthur - Morgan Stanley)</p><p>A. (Rich Zannino) First of all, pure tombstone's new issue advertising represents about 5-6% of total Wall Street Journal linage depending on the year. So, while it is a meaningful category, it is nowhere near as large and as meaningful as some of the other financial categories or as some of the tech categories or even auto. To put it in perspective, it is about the same size as our travel and professional services advertising categories. So, that gives you some dimension on our exposure to tombstone advertising. Having said that, tombstone advertising, we believe, is a function of 4 factors. Deal flow and we all see that getting much stronger. Deal size, and while deals are getting bigger, most of them are still pretty small. Deal performance would be a third factor, and deal performance has been a bit sketchy here so far this year. I think 34 out of 100 deals that have gone off this year are underperforming their offer price, their IPO price. And then finally, there has been a moratorium on the part of some of the major investment banks against running tombstone ads. So, we think those are the 4 factors that drive tombstone advertising, that are driving it in the current environment. I have not heard anything so far about the regulatory environment constraining banks in running tombstone. I think some of the larger banks have basically questioned the value of a tombstone ad, and we have lots of research that we share with them, and more and more now with the issuers on the value of tombstone ads and the value is significant. Since the people look at them, they act on them, they call the banks, and they are called to action for people to do things with the banks. So, we think research supports the value of a tombstone ad. To put other numbers against all of that, so far this year, there have been 100 IPOs priced. We have received tombstones on 22 of those so far. About 40 from the so-called moratorium banks, and the remaining 38, we'll get some of those, but many of them are too small and are underperforming. Again, 34 out of the 100 are underperforming, so we won't get those. The good news is we see the calendar strengthening in the balance of the year. We see the banks that are doing the deals. We think we are going to see increased momentum in the back half of the year and get back into positive territory again like we were in 1Q04, on tombstone advertising. Of course, nobody else is getting these tombstones. They are not going anywhere else. The Journal still has 100% market share for tombstone. And so, I think there is another 200 or so deals in the pipeline for the balance of the year, and we will get our share of those, but I think, summing that all up, it is a relatively small category. It is not all going away. We are working hard to get as many tombstones as we can by going directly to issuers with our research and to the banks with our research, and given the pipeline going forward, and the pipeline does have a few very large deals, not the least of which is google going forward. So, going forward, we think we will see positive comps again in the category.</p><p>A. (Chris Vieth) Answering Peter Appert's earlier call, Print Publishing's operating income was a negative $11.5m last year. We will make significant progress against that this year and reduce it, but it will still be negative in 3Q04.</p><p>A. (Rich Zannino) And, of course, the US Journal will be profitable in 3Q04 as it was in 3Q03.</p><p>Q7. Could you remind us what color ad is of the percentage of total Journal? You talked about low single-digit linage in the 3Q04, obviously, we saw low single in 2Q04, can we expect, I guess, a similar yield off of that linage in 3Q04 as we saw in 2Q04? Could you tell us what tech spending was up online? We saw a pretty a strong growth from CNET yesterday, and I am just wondering if the online trends are mirroring the offline and tech spending. (Christa Sober - Thomas Weisel Partners)</p><p>A. (Rich Zannino) Color represents about 30% of our total linage, and it would be a higher percentage of our total revenue, because color, a full-page sells at 27% premium to black and white and half page sells at 37% premium to black and white, but we always talk linage. So, it is about 30% of total Journal linage. As far as yield, we hope to be able to continue to have revenue growth in excess of linage growth and advertising, and would hope to see, might not be 6% in 3Q04 in terms of the spread between linage growth and revenue growth, but we would hope it would be in the 4-5% range. It will depend somewhat on mix ultimately, the mix between classified and display advertising. But color should drive it, and our new rate card should drive it, and favorable mix in some of our other categories should definitely continue to help it.</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) In terms of online advertising, as you mentioned the advertising in total increased 35%. Display advertising was up 37%. Technology and financial, those two categories really dominate the online categories. Technology spending was in line with the overall percentage increase that we saw in 2Q04.</p><p>Q8. Could you give us how the yield looked in 3Q, the mix between price and color and the components, and then also, the deceleration that happened in Consumer Electronic Publishing in 2Q vs. 1Q, where that came from? Just wanted to get the mix of the yield, your 6% yield improvement in 2Q, can you break down that and its components? (Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank)</p><p>A. (Rich Zannino) Between how much was driven by color vs. how much was driven by rate?</p><p>Q9. By rate increase and then the mix relative to 1Q where it was 10%? (Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank)</p><p>A. (Rich Zannino) Well in 1Q, it was certainly driven more by mix, because in 1Q, display advertising, I think was actually very close to classified advertising. And in 2Q, our display advertising was up low single digits, and our classified advertising was up 11%. So, classified runs at a much lower ad rate, line rate than display. So, that would explain the difference between 1Q and 2Q, just the heavier proportion in the mix of classified in 2Q.</p><p>Q10. The deceleration of CEP, what was the driver of that from 1Q, the 13% YonY revenue growth in CEP in 2Q vs. the 18% in 1Q? (Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank)</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) Part of that is the fact that the subscriber is paying the full new price increase over time. Obviously, a higher percentage of them are doing that. Two-thirds of the revenue from the online Journal is from subscriptions and so, even as we see very large increases in advertising revenue, the subscription revenue tends to move more in line with volume.</p><p>Q11. Refresh my memory, what was the advertising for CEP in 1Q? (Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank)</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) It was in line with 2Q04, in the mid-30s.</p><p>Q12. Could we just go over the technology outlook for 2H04 again? I was under the impression that it was going to improve and I am wondering if something has changed from earlier calls and it sounds like maybe you are basing it again on some of the profit reports that have come out which would make sense. Could you just give us a sense of what you were paying in newsprint per ton in 2Q04 and the timing of when you might have paid an increase in 2Q04, and what do you expect to happen in 2H04? (Lauren Fine - Merrill Lynch)</p><p>A. (Chris Vieth) The newsprint price increase that was announced on Feb. 1 came in slowly. Some suppliers raised and put through the price increase on invoices right away, others didn't. We also used inventory to buy around some of the price increases. So, by the time it was all said and done at the end of 2Q04, we were up about $30 a ton. Traditionally, we have steered away from actually quoting the price per ton that we pay, but what we have said is that for the year, we expect newsprint expenses to be up about 11% over last year, and we expect newsprint price increase in the late summer to follow the trends of what they did last year, and all of that has remained constant with our guidance from the beginning of the year. So, we are pretty much consistent with what our expectations are.</p><p>A. (Rich Zannino) On your tech question, I would just like to clarify the way you started it. We actually said in 1Q04 that we expected tech to be soft for the balance of the year. You might be confusing us with another large daily newspaper, projecting it to be up in 2H04. But, our tech category includes tech and telecom in that category. We were up against pretty tough comps in 2H03. We were up about 13% in 2H03. So, we were up against that. We are also seeing some of the big tech guys cut back on their budgets. I mean you read in the last week or so, Microsoft saying they want to cut $1b in expense, and to do it without cutting headcount. And my guess is they are not going to cut R&amp;D either. So, I think we are up against tough comps. People are cutting their budgets, because they are not seeing the profit growth that they want to see. They are also a little bit skittish given what people have been saying lately about future plans for capital spending on technology products. So, I think they are being cautious. Having said that, we think 3Q04 will be a much tougher quarter than 4Q04. We think we will see an improvement in trend during 4Q04, just based on some of the RFPs that are out there and some indications we are getting from some of the big tech spenders in terms of their plans for 4Q04. So, while we are saying 2H04 will be weak, we are predicting it to be much weaker in 3Q04 and then to come back somewhat in 4Q04.</p><p>Q13. In terms of global ad sales across the properties, could you give us an update on how that's going? (Lauren Fine - Merrill Lynch)</p><p>A. (Karen House) Our global advertising revenues continue to grow.</p><p>Q14. Would you say it is meeting your expectations? (Lauren Fine - Merrill Lynch)</p><p>A. (Karen House) It has actually exceeded budget this year. So, it is exceeding our expectations.</p><p>A. (Chris Vieth) We actually saw a nice improvement in ad yield in our international publications as well as this year driven in large part by the global rate program and the rate increase we put in this year to the global rate programs.</p><p>A. (Karen House) And we are growing in share in both Europe and Asia, which is obviously pleasing.</p><p>Q15. Could you actually refresh our memory on what you guys raised on the global rate and on the US Journal? (Lauren Fine - Merrill Lynch)</p><p>A. (Karen House) We raised the rate for the overseas publication, 25%.</p><p>A. (Rich Zannino) We put through roughly a 5% global rate increase, but we gave the entire 5% we are crediting to the international pubs as it should be, because they took the discount when we originally put the global rate in. So, it represents about a 25% increase in ad rates for the international publications in terms of their share of that new higher global rate. And then in the US, we put through on the rate card a 3% rate increase, but we also made some other changes to the rate card, which we hoped and, in fact, it has materialized, would drive a higher than 3% increase in yield.</p><p>A. (Peter Kann) We increased the price of color premium as well.</p><p>A. (Rich Zannino) The color premium went from 25% to 27% on a full page and from 35% to 37% on a half page.</p><p>Q16. Can you give us the annual run rate of your newsletter 'Business Now' with the acquisitions? Some of your other peers have really stepped up here recently to increase their share buybacks substantially, I was wondering what are your plans on upfront, given that your stock has pulled back? (Craig A. Huber - Lehman Brothers)</p><p>A. (Chris Vieth) With regard to share buyback, for at least the next few quarters, we will continue to direct excess cash flow to reduce our commercial paper balance, which, as I said earlier, is now down to about $215m. In the past, we have utilized share repurchase when conditions were right. That is, when we have had excess cash flow and debt capacity, when our shares are trading below their intrinsic value, when the ROI shares exceed that of alternate uses of the capital, and when we have had board authorization to repurchase shares. All of these conditions exist today except for our debt and we are making good progress here down another $44m in 3Q04. In the future, when all of these conditions are met, we could be back in the market again, but for now we are directing our cast to pay down our debt levels.</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) About newsletters, we created a new division within Dow Jones Newswires as a result of our acquisition of Alternative Investor and Tech Partners last year. Our financial information services that include newsletters, databases, and events, that will have revenues. Revenues this year is in the mid-20s. I might think about this more broadly, which is about a third of all of our revenues for Dow Jones Newswires this year will be from products or sales channels we didn't have a few years ago that are not dependent on traditional market data terminals, I suppose this is another reason why there is a growing gap between the terminal count and revenue lines. We have a financial information services division, local language, wires around the world, local web site revenues, many other sources, which is why we are no longer nearly so dependent on headcount trends among our customers.</p><p>Q17. Factiva had a very healthy pickup in operating income in 2Q04, do you expect that to continue here or is it a one off? (Craig A. Huber - Lehman Brothers)</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) We are very pleased with the performance of Factiva and its continued success in its market. Its operating income tripled to almost $9m. Part of that was driven by a one-time cost reduction associated with finalization of the migration this time last year to Factiva-related products, that is the (Indiscernible) of Dow Jones Interactive and Reuters Business Briefing products. Revenue growth has been sharp and consistent every month since that migration ended. The sales team at Factiva has been able to focus on net new installations rather than upgrades, and we have had net new installations in positive territory every month since Aug. 2003. So, I think you will continue to see performance improvement at Factiva. I don't think we will necessarily see operating income increases in this range every quarter, but it is a very solid business, making very strong gains in its market.</p><p>Q18. What would be the annual number for the equity line for 2004? I believe you've had a price increase on home delivery of the 'The Wall Street Journal.' I wanted to see how that is impacting your copies at this point. I mean subscription price increase? (Steven Barlow - Prudential Equity Group)</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) That went in April 1, so it is too early to tell in terms of getting a reaction. But retention rates are up. Conversion rates are up. And acquisition rates are up in circulation at the Journal, but it is too early to tell the impact, I think it was $10 price increase that went into effect on April 1.</p><p>A. (Chris Vieth) As far as equity investments for the year, we haven't given guidance for 4Q04 yet, but we expect it to be modestly better than last year at this point. It will be above last year.</p><p>Q19. On the stock buyback question, where do you want your leverage to go down to? Your leverage isn't all that high to start with, and you are sort of suggesting that condition has not been met yet. (Steven Barlow - Prudential Equity Group)</p><p>A. (Chris Vieth) Our internal target, what we are shooting for right now as far as I think about it from a debt-level perspective, is about, we would like to get it down to $100m. We've had it, last year it was down to $93m and in years' past it had averaged around $150m. As you saw S&amp;P dropped us the notch last quarter largely on the kind of volatility we have had in Print Publishing advertising revenues. So, those credit metrics are important us to and we are going to continue to dedicate our cash flow to drive down that debt level for the near term, at least the next few quarters.</p><p>Q20. On the union issue, just wondering if there are any other contracts over the near term, near-to-intermediate term with any other unions that are up for renewal? I If you look out for the full year based on the current trend lines, how big WSJ.com will be this year in terms of revenue in any margin contribution you can speak to? On the tech advertising, to try to put it in a bit more perspective, could you give us what your best guess is at the dollar run rate right now? Where was that maybe a year ago, and then where that was at the peak just for the tech category or the way you look at it, maybe tech and telecom? (William Drewry - CSFB)</p><p>A. (Rich Zannino) On the first question, the IAPE contract is far and away the most significant labor contract, and there aren't any others like that, sitting out there open.</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) The online Journal, we have had strong double-digit revenue gains so far this year. We would expect that to continue for the full year as well. In terms of operating income, we don't break it down quite that way. But I would say, several million dollars worth of operating income from the online journal, and a margin that, as you know, has turned positive, and we think has got potential margin that may be closer in its dynamics to additional (Phonetic) publishing business then necessarily to advertising driven business in, as much as subscription revenues continue to be a significant part of its revenue base.</p><p>Q21. Could you just compare it either in dollar amount or either percentage terms to the print Journal, just revenue? (William Drewry - CSFB)</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) The question is the percentage of revenue for the online Journal vs. the...?</p><p>Q22. Or give us the dollar volume. How much do you think it will do this year, $75m, $100m? (William Drewry - CSFB)</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) I think, rather than giving a precise number, I would say it is in the range of the lower amount you just asked about.</p><p>Q23. And tech dollars? (William Drewry - CSFB)</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) The run rate of technology this year compared to where it was in 2000, which was just obviously an enormous boom year, our technology linage is about a third of what it was in 2000. And, it is obviously below where it was and what we consider to be the more normal year of '98, it is probably somewhere around half of what it was in 1998. That's linage. So, the spread between revenue in those years will be a little tighter, but, that's the linage picture. We have got tremendous upside in technology linage.</p><p>Q24. That would just be tighter because you put through price increases since the peak? (William Drewry - CSFB)</p><p>A. (Gordon Crovitz) Exactly.</p><p>[CCBN reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Briefs are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Down from $0.64 per share on$654m in net revenue in 2Q10. 2. 2Q10 trading volume benefited from strong spike in volatility from advent of sovereign debt crisis in Europe, and flash crash in US. 3. Strong non-volume-related revenue combined with weakening of dollar YoverY increased net revenue by$51,m helping to more than offset impact of declines in trading volumes across most venues. 4. Technology Services: 1. Increased revenue by 14%. 2. Operating margins 30%. 5. Expense: 1. Cost managing discipline. 2. Increased$12m or 3% to$419.m 3. On constant currency and portfolio basis, declined 3% or$14m vs. 2Q10. 6. Global headcount below 3,000, despite completing several smaller deals since middle of last year, including acquisition of Corporate Board Member and JV with APX to create NYSE Blue. 7. With strong free cash flow, retired$200m in commercial paper which reduced debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 1.7 times, lowest level since merger of NYSE and Euronext. 1. Significant contributor to free cash flow has been CapEx reduction, which was$31m in 2Q, down from$70m in prior-year period. 8. Solid results YoverY against backdrop of avg. 17% decline in trading volumes across four primary venues. 2. Comparative GAAP Results: 1. Net income and EPS below prior-year, but in line with 1Q11. 2. 2Q10 results benefited from net$54m pretax gain from disposal activity, principally sale of 5% stake in National Stock Exchange of India. 3. This qtr., reported$18m charge for merger expenses and exit costs, which included$12m related to pending business combination. 1. YTD, total of$27m spent on pending merger. 3. Note: 1.

Transaction provides facility for partners to require Co. to purchase portion of investment at specific intervals over five-year period. 4. Expects to repurchase 10% of partner's stake in 3Q. 5. Increased market share from about 6% at time Co. acquired American Stock Exchange to 15% at 2Q-end. 5. Diluted share count increased to 263m shares in 2Q due to issuance of approx. 340,000 shares, to former Amex members, in connection with sale of former American Stock Exchange headquarters. 5. Consolidated &amp; Segment Results - Currency-Neutral: 1. US dollar weakened this qtr. vs. prior-year for both euro and pound. 2. For 2Q, 49% of net revenue denominated in either euros or pounds, and 51% in US dollars. 3. Currency impact on net revenue favorable: 1.$33m vs. prior-year. 2.$11m vs. prior qtr. 4.

Incremental revenue came from variety of streams including Technology Services, Listings and other revenues like Corporate Board Member and NYSE Blue. 4. When trading volumes return to more historical norms, will get full benefit of diversification efforts which helped Co. weather down volume cycles. 5. July volumes already showing more favorable trend. 6. NYSE Euronextvolumes for US Options and European cash trading each up over 15% on July 2010 levels while LIFFE CONNECT volumes were similar, and US Cash was lower. 7. Derivatives: 1.

These results achieved despite declines in US and European cash trading ADV of 35% and 11%, respectively. 2.

Complex cross-border deal. 2. Goal to create culture of performance that matches leadership position in global exchange space. 7. Given both companies' strong and rich histories of operating in international environments, and specific examples of team work as teams begin to work together, good example of which was winning overwhelming approval from shareholders of both companies, confident will be successful in integrating cultures. 3. EU Competition Review Timing &amp; Process: 1. European Commission review process has been on-going from sometime through pre-notification discussions after Co. announced transaction and recently with final competition filing, which was submitted in late June. 1. This week, competition authorities in EU expected to complete first phase of investigation during which they collected opinions from peers, customers, competitors and other stakeholders. 2. Some views that Commission collected have already been disclosed publicly. 1. Competitors have been most vocal about concerns regarding pending business combination. 2. Expected. 3. Confidence Commission will carefully consider source of objections. 2. Expects to be notified by competition authorities later this week Co. will embark on Phase II process. 1. Runs diligent and comprehensive process in close collaboration with colleagues at DB to respond to request from Commission. 2. Putting two companies together will create tremendous benefits for all customers and end-users in terms of capital efficiency, operational simplification and cost reduction. 1. Will strengthen and improve efficiency of EU capital markets in terms of liquidity, lower volatility and cost of capital. 3. Any negative impact on competition is not significant given global nature of derivative markets, increasing competition between OTC and listed markets generally and in Derivatives specifically and simple well-known fact that NYX and DB1 do not compete against one another. 4. Only area of overlap in current business models in some single name derivatives and, Co. is only two of many players in those markets. 5. Lot of speculation driven by competitors. 1. Much focused on remedies, in particular some who have opined on whether Co. would be asked to dispose certain businesses like NYSE LIFFE or Eurex Derivatives franchises. 3. European derivatives critically important part of combination providing synergies, capital efficiencies and other significant shareholder and customer benefits. 4. Confident benefits that combination will provide to clients and market overall do and will continue to resonate with regulators. 1. Looks forward to continuing constructive discussions with Commission and case team in Brussels, still hopeful Co. will close transaction in 2011. 4. Summary: 1. Due to diversification efforts over past several quarters, business model much better positioned to weather lackluster trading volume cycles as seen particularly in this qtr. 2. Additional drivers of growth gaining traction with interest rate futures on NYSE LiffeUS and NYPC. 3. Clearing in post-trade businesses will continue to be particular area of focus as combined co. 4. Strong growth coming from Technology segment in 2011 and beyond. 5. Sees momentum in Listings franchise, securing Number One position in global IPOs for second consecutive qtr. 6. With respective shareholder votes behind, fully focused on regulatory approval process targeting close for business combination with Deutsche Boerse in 2011.</p><p>QUESTION AND ANSWER SUMMARY</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Roger Freeman.</p><p>ROGER FREEMAN, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Hi, good morning. I guess my question would be around NYSE Liffe and NYPC in total. Can you give us ballpark or quantify how much those businesses are in a negative profit position right now or in a loss position? And secondly on NYPC, can you just talk to the growing open interest versus sort of stable volumes and marketshare? What is the nature of the open interest? Is that sort of a chunky block -- block trades coming in?</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER, GROUP EVP &amp; CFO, NYSE EURONEXT: I'll take the first part about the financials and then we will turn it over to Tom. So what we have indicated in the last couple of years is that NYSE Liffe has been in investment mode and that we have lost -- reported about a $30 million operating loss for that business. Now remember, we own 58% and we have minority partners who have 42% of that business. We don't report the profitability each quarter as the interest rate business is just starting -- it is in its infancy. I think we are doing a little better than that $30 million loss that we reported last year, but we are still in a large investment position at this stage.</p><p>TOM CALLAHAN, CEO, NYSE LIFFE US, NYSE EURONEXT: In terms of the growth of open interest, we said before we even launched the platform that our success would be measured as much by our growth in OI as by our volumes because we made a strategic decision back in 2009 when we designed the platform to really have capital efficiency as the centerpiece of the new exchange.</p><p>So the fact that both our partners and our customers are recognizing that and are really making a long-term commitment to the platform by moving open interest is enormously gratifying and exciting for us. We are seeing new partners coming into our market virtually every single day and as they do, the open interest, as you can see from the chart in the deck, is steadily increasing every single day.</p><p>So 800,000 lots of open interest across the exchange, 700,000 lots at NYPC for a platform that is five months old is just great progress and great early momentum and I think it validates the strategy of delivering operational and capital efficiencies through the NYPC platform.</p><p>ROGER FREEMAN: Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Rich Repetto, Sandler O'Neill.</p><p>RICH REPETTO, ANALYST, SANDLER O'NEILL: Yes, good morning, guys. I don't want to do this, but I'll stay on the topic of NYSE Liffe here since we have Thomas. You talked about the number -- I guess the loss, Michael, but we still have -- well, here is the questions. We still have the free marketmaking or at least some liquidity providers are still free until I think '12. And then -- so I am just trying to see what type of volume do you need to break even either before '12 or once the -- is it the fee -- once you start charging fees in March of '12, that could move it or how much volume do we need? And then also this relaunch of treasury, I know there was an issue with the contract and can you just remind us -- the efficient -- are there capital efficiencies with Eurodollars, as well as we know about the treasuries?</p><p>TOM CALLAHAN: Sure. So I think there might be three questions in there, so I will try to hit them one at a time. I think what you might have been referring to in terms of the fee holiday was the first three months of NYPC where there was a fee holiday on clearing fees that went from March 21 to June 21, so that has since expired.</p><p>In terms of the profitability of the overall platform, it really comes down, as you know, to the ecosystem of different types of customers because, of course, you have marketmakers all the way to end-user customers and the thing that we have been most gratified by outside of the growth in open interest that I discussed previously was the amount of end-user customers, the non-members that are coming into our platform. We have done over 300,000 lots of customer block trades from large US asset managers. So the fact that we are seeing that kind of commitment from real end-user customers really I think is a great vote of confidence in a new platform, but, of course, in terms of the rate per contract, that helps us enormously as well.</p><p>I think the final question was around capital efficiency and the Eurodollars benefit from the capital efficiencies of NYPC, the answer is absolutely. The largest source of margin at FICC is actually their repo clearing business and repos have a very high correlation with Eurodollar contracts, so there is a terrific amount of capital efficiency there. And I think that helps explain the open interest growth that we have had.</p><p>And then in terms of the relaunch of the treasury complex, when we launched the platform on March 21, the big difference between treasury futures and Eurodollar futures is, of course, treasury futures are physically delivered. Customers wanted to see that NYPC could manage its first physical delivery. It did that successfully in June and really more than anything, that helped build confidence once we got through that period into July for customers to really start increasing their level of activity. And that is why you saw when we relaunched the platform on July 7 our volume in open interest start to increase immediately.</p><p>RICH REPETTO: I think -- you are saying that all the trades were -- all the waivers for the trades were ended in June. I think on your website it still has trade fees waived for approved marketmakers till March 21.</p><p>TOM CALLAHAN: Oh, yes. That is on the exchange side, Rich, not on the clearinghouse side. Of course, for the people who make markets in our platform and sign market-making agreements, there are fee waivers and that is very standard in the futures industry. And that will, of course, continue because you always need marketmakers. But what I was referring to in terms of the end-user customers and the early adoption that we have seen, obviously those are fee-paying customers and the more of those we get, the better the balance sheet of the business will look.</p><p>RICH REPETTO: Got it. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Alex Kramm, UBS.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM, ANALYST, UBS: Hey, good morning. Just wanted to quickly shift gears to the deal, in particular that slide where you highlight the benefits for end users. Now when I look at the reduction in capital requirements, in particular, that $3 billion, I mean looking at that and talking to some, the broker folks in the industry, it sounds like people are generally very excited about this and I think they made that case heard in their antitrust submissions.</p><p>I think the big issue is to really have confidence with some of these numbers though. So hoping to see if there will be anything else that you can provide in the future. I mean if I look at that $3 billion number, I look back what CME and CDOC did in 2004, I mean I probably can come up with a number like that myself.</p><p>So I think what people struggle with, in particular on the dealer side, is can we put portfolios together, show them to you and you can tell us, hey, this is really what we are getting, in particular given that there are different regulatory frameworks between Eurex and Liffe and other challenges, but probably will take some time to put that together. So any commentary would be great there. Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, </nameText></person>CEO, NYSE EURONEXT: Alex, it is Duncan. I will take that one. So we certainly intend to be very transparent on that and as we get closer to closing or shortly after closing when we are talking about migration plans, combinations of clearinghouses and giving the clients a roadmap of when all that can happen, when we are one company, it will be a lot easier to go a lot deeper.</p><p>So far, obviously, we've wanted to be cautious. We came up with that number that we have quoted by doing sort of what you suggested. We went to a few big customers and we said, look, we can't really look at each other's positions right now. You know what positions you have in both places. Why don't each of us give you the data and then let's run some correlations, let's run some analyses and let's see what we come up with.</p><p>So we felt pretty good that EUR2 billion or $3 billion was a fairly good number out of the gate based on some testing that we did, but I imagine we will be able to put a much finer point to that as we get closer to the closing and into the operating as Newco. And it is a great question because it is a significant benefit to the marketplace and it is obviously in our interest to be honest about it, but also be as clear with as many as we can that that is a real savings, not an illusory one.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM: So do you think, and this is the same question, so do you think there will be any opportunity to give more detail to the participants so that they can still comment or follow up in Phase 2 during the antitrust?</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Yes, I think we haven't approached it that way to date, but we can. It is a good suggestion. We have gone to several individuals and I think we would be prepared to do that under the outline of the ground rules that I just went through where we are not looking into each other's clearinghouses prematurely -- that is inappropriate -- but certainly the end-user can see that for all of their clients and do that analysis.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM: All right, very good. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Patrick O'Shaughnessy, Raymond James.</p><p>PATRICK O'SHAUGHNESSY, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES: Good morning. So in June, CME Group announced that they are going to start to offer the Euribor contract. I was wondering if you could comment on how you think you guys are currently competitively positioned to defend against that entry, as well as any implications that might have on the antitrust concerns with your merger.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: It is Duncan, Patrick. I will take that one. I will answer the second half of that first. I would think that it is -- in terms of the impact on the merger, it has been duly noted by the competition authorities in Brussels that there have been a few competitive efforts in the last few months either embarked upon or announced. So frankly, we think it is an example of, like other examples, that there is an opportunity to compete.</p><p>At the same time, we think what we have learned in NYSE LiffeUS and in NYPC, as Tom went through in his material and this really gets to the first part of your question, if you are going to compete, we certainly understood we had to bring an innovative solution to the marketplace. I think listing look-alike contracts and not really adding any value from the capital efficiency point of view or whatever it might be we think are fairly easy to defend against.</p><p>So when we were trying to be an attacker in the US jurisdiction, we spent a lot of time trying to think about what more it had to be than just listing Eurodollars and treasuries. We didn't think that was much of a competitive threat to the incumbent. So I think what you saw us do was spend a lot more time on something that was innovative, not just simply list a look-alike contract and attempt to compete. Tom, would you add anything to that from your point of view with your derivatives hat on?</p><p>TOM CALLAHAN: I would tell you, I mean, of course, CME is an incredibly powerful global competitor, so we are taking the threat very, very seriously. We thought it was interesting that they chose to clear the products in Chicago, which is an inverse of when Liffe, unsuccessfully back in 2004, attempted to launch Eurodollars cleared in London and that proved to be a challenge for us at the time. So it will be interesting to see how European customers react to a Chicago cleared Euribor contract. But regardless, we are staying very close to our customers and we are taking the threat very, very seriously.</p><p>PATRICK O'SHAUGHNESSY: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Johannes Thormann, HSBC.</p><p>JOHANNES THORMANN, ANALYST, HSBC: Good morning, everybody. Johannes from HSBC. One question concerning your balance sheet, please. You have successfully reduced your debt to EBITDA ratio. What is an appropriate level for your Company and will you continue to decrease or at which point do you think you will increase the dividend policy also in the light of the merger with Deutsche Boerse? Thank you.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: We have mentioned in the past that our current comfort zone and our targeted leverage is around 2 to 2.25 times, so the 1.7 is below the norm and expectation for our business. We have announced a special dividend, so clearly we are building balance sheet capacity so that when we complete the merger, we will have the necessary cash to pay the special dividend. So you shouldn't read into the strength of the balance sheet as being the way we would run our business necessarily on a standalone basis, but clearly it is part of the plan to do the merger and as I said, develop (multiple speakers).</p><p>JOHANNES THORMANN: Okay, understood. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Howard Chen, Credit Suisse.</p><p>HOWARD CHEN, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Hi, good morning, good afternoon. Congrats on the shareholder votes. Mike, just a quick one on the financials. Can you discuss the impact from the Amex transaction, assuming no changes in its profitability position? Just maybe what would have earnings been if the deal had closed at the beginning of the June quarter? Thanks.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: So I believe we mentioned that in our talking points. So we are saying had we closed the transaction April 1 instead of June 29, we would have reported a $0.02 less earnings per share, so the minority interest on the partner's portion of the profitability. So if volume stayed the same, that is what you can expect in the third quarter and going forward.</p><p>HOWARD CHEN: Great, thanks. Sorry I missed it.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: That's okay.</p><p>OPERATOR: Daniel Harris.</p><p>DANIEL HARRIS, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Hi, good morning, guys. Hey, Duncan, you talked a bit about the issues that you guys have been having with Euronext on the technology side with the sporadic outages and the index calculations. I was wondering if you could delve a little bit deeper into what that was, but more so also I think that as part of the merged entity, you are not going to be using UTP going forward. Can you talk about the decision process on that versus what the alternative is obviously with the Deutsche Boerse technology? Thanks.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Sure. I know you guys are everywhere, but you clearly know some things about our merger that we don't know yet because we didn't know that the decision had been made about UTP, but thanks for letting us know. We appreciate the heads up.</p><p>I think I am going to let Dominique, who is sitting here with me, talk about how we have diagnosed these issues, what we think the root cause was, what we have done about it, etc. and then I will have him kick it back to me and we will talk a little bit about how that may be impacting the discussion we are having around the common trading and clearing architecture, okay? So Dominique, what don't we start with you?</p><p>DOMINIQUE CERUTTI, PRESIDENT &amp; DEPUTY CEO, NYSE EURONEXT: Yes, so indeed we had on the European side full incident to be clear in June and July and we take that very seriously free of the incident and the one you are mentioning are originating in a complex accord. We made -- Mike, since you are asking, we made an update on [microcore] that was mandatory on one of our software and it has created some packet loss. We have the best expert on our camp and from the vendors to analyze that and it is this change combined with high market volume and some new behaviors enabled by the new capabilities that we are offering to members that are figuring some instability in some legacy software that we still run. So that is what happened.</p><p>I don't want to go deeper; it could be quite complex. Again, we have analyzed the situation. We have taken mitigation actions in the short term and maybe more importantly, we are running the task force and we expect results in the next 30 days to check whether or not we have other vulnerabilities in our system and make sure that we will come back to our best-of-breed stability.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: All right, and then to get to the second part of your question, I think we continue to have discussions about, as I've said to some of you before at various analyst meetings, etc., we view the common trading and clearing architecture as having many components starting with what we would call the common customer gateway, to the safety network, to the trading engines, to the backend systems, to the data dissemination tools, to the clearing platforms, etc. and we continue to have very healthy dialogue with our colleagues at DB. Some of the decisions about which pieces we will be using have already been made.</p><p>I think what we have said publicly is the system we end up using won't be UTP or what DB runs right now; it will probably be an amalgam of all of the above. But I think on some of the components, we have already made the decision. Larry, do you want to add anything to that since you are on the call too as to where we are in that decision?</p><p>LARRY LEIBOWITZ, COO, NYSE EURONEXT: No, I think that is the right way to say it. We are going through a comparing functionality. The considerations really are functionality points, pain of client migration and really that matters a lot. We don't want to put the clients through a big migration here and then ultimate cost savings. And you can be guaranteed that this is going to be a best-of-breed and no matter what, best of technologists on both sides.</p><p>The problems we have been having in Europe really are related to not only microcode, but legacy systems. It has nothing to do with UTP and really haven't colored this discussion. I think it has been a very healthy discussion, not just among the technologists, but also among the businesses because the businesses are really concerned that functionality gets preserved and that their clients are not disturbed in this process.</p><p>OPERATOR: Niamh Alexander, KBW.</p><p>NIAMH ALEXANDER, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. If I could touch on the expenses because going back, going way back, this was officially -- the second quarter was officially the end of the integration phase for Euronext and NYX. But I am just wondering if it is kind of all solid on and behind you now or if maybe there's still some data centers, old ones that need to be run off because your expense guidance was not changed, but clearly the FX is driving it higher. Just trying to get a sense of the run rate going forward and maybe opportunities to lower it from this level.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: This is Mike. It is a challenge as we, from time to time, acquire a company or the euro or dollar fluctuate. We can keep updating the guidance. Our guidance was using 2010's average exchange rates, so we reported 1, 6, 7, 8 in costs and the portfolio we had at the end of the year, we were guiding that our costs would come below $16.50. And as I indicated on the call, adjusting for all that, we were at $8.07 in the first half. So we are clearly below our guidance, in line with our guidance. As Duncan mentioned, we continue to focus on opportunities to run our business more efficiently every day.</p><p>To your question, there are still some legacy data centers and other assets that we are exiting and there is some savings that are not going to be as large as they were the last couple of years, but there are some avenues for further cost reductions related to the transition and the integration we will start to see and experience as we get down to the end of the year.</p><p>So I think maybe at the end of the third quarter, when we will have three quarters under the belt, we can give a more precise expense number, but I think rather than trying to project which way the currency is going to move and/or we just added Metabit, we might -- whether or not we make any more acquisitions, I think a fair way to do it is to report the numbers as we do today and provide the reconciliation in our deck on how we are doing against our guidance.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Just to jump in for one second here, I think it is really important that, at a certain point, it becomes hard to figure out what is an integration savings, meaning from Euronext NYSE merger and what is just continued operating your business more effectively. And we continue to believe that we can continue to cut our costs as we move forward, even had we not done this DB deal. That is part of what you do as running your company properly and we still we think we have room to run. I think we continue to do that among the backdrop of investing in some new business and making some new acquisitions.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: Right, which is a great point, just one more follow-up on what Larry said. Our technology, our commercial technology business is not a fixed cost business. So as we aspire to have $1 billion of revenue there and we take on new managed services accounts, we are taking on costs. Our focus there is revenue growth in margin; it is not in keeping the costs fixed. So we have been able to absorb those incremental costs while continuing to bring down our overall expense base.</p><p>NIAMH ALEXANDER: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Chris Harris, Wells Fargo.</p><p>CHRIS HARRIS, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES: Great, thanks for squeezing me in here, guys. Clearly, you have had some excellent success in options with Amex remutualization and growth in maker-taker, but it looks like some of that momentum is slowing a little bit here. And just wondering if you could share with us what strategies you plan on implementing and options to kind of further your share growth? And as maybe a follow-up to that, would you ever consider selling a stake in Arca options given the success you have had at Amex?</p><p>LARRY LEIBOWITZ: So I think to jump in there, this is Larry again, first, you are seeing the effect of options being very competitive and we have a lot of competitors out there who have varying models. What you're also seeing over time is a blending towards the middle between pure maker-taker, meaning the Arca model and fewer directed flow like Amex. You see them, as the directed flow guys have adopted some functionality that looks more maker-taker like and vice versa. So we are going to continue to see that and we all push to continue to try to differentiate our platforms. We think that we have some interesting developments in the works and we are going to continue to push on those. It is a competitive market, but it is also a growing market, so that is a good position to be in.</p><p>CHRIS HARRIS: Fair enough. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&amp;A session. I would now like to turn it back over to management.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Stephen, why don't you call it a wrap since I am offsite?</p><p>STEPHEN DAVIDSON, IR, NYSE EURONEXT: Okay, thank you, everyone, for listening this morning and we will speak to you next quarter. Enjoy the summer.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Thanks, everybody.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation.

Dr. Ronan Lambe, Co-Founders and Dr. Joe Cronin, retired this week from Co.'s board.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>ROBERT PATRICK JONES, VP, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUPINC., RESEARCH DIVISION: You guys have been pretty upfront that gross margins will experience some pressure as you onboard, people to handle all the new project that you've been winning. I guess, maybe, it would be helpful if you can lay out how we should think about your ability to kind of maintain the type of gross margin we saw this quarter? And then, if there's any timeline you could provide as far as when you might start to again see some leverage against the infrastructure that you are currently building?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, ICON PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY: Yes, Robert, it's Steve here. You are right, we have been upfront about the pressure on gross margin. Obviously, as we build the business, we bring in new people. There will be inevitable pressure in that area. So we're offsetting that to some extent by looking at how efficiently we are running our operations. Our startup approach to our clinical trials is under plenty of attention and scrutiny, and we're looking at how we are improving our resourcing and our process there. Also looking at how we can bring in automation in that area as well. There are various offsets, if you like, on the gross margin side of things. And of course, I think, as we said before, we're also trying to offset any pressure on gross at the SG&amp;A line. I think you can see we have been successful in doing that again this quarter. And we continue to ultimately maintain our operating margin based on some offset at the SG&amp;A line. And we believe we can continue to do that. So we see our margins at the operating level being maintained and possibly increased slightly, but we're working very hard to do both -- on both those areas.</p><p>ROBERT PATRICK JONES: And I guess, just on a follow-up to that, Steve. You mentioned SG&amp;A, you guys closed in on this goal of 17% of the 606 revenue pretty quickly, looking at the results from this quarter. Anything you would call out there as far as what drove the progress? And then, is this the type of SG&amp;A as a percent of revenue level that we should think about for the rest of the year?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I think, in terms of what drove the process, we continue to look at it very hard, we continue look at our process, we continue to offshore appropriate parts of that business where we've been able to do so. We continue to challenge our business service leaders to hold their costs tight and be as effective and efficient. And we've -- as you've said, we got to our target a little earlier than we thought. We think there's still some further upside or at least further progress to be made there over the next, probably, longer term than medium term. And I think, I referenced in my comments, robotics automation as being a particular component of that. We'll talk a bit more about that at our Analyst Day in New York in a couple of months. We believe, there is some further progress we can make in that space, albeit probably not at the same rate as we've made over the last couple of years.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will now move to our question from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan.</p><p>TYCHO W. PETERSON, SENIOR ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: I want to start with backlog. I'm wondering if you can comment at all on [NIK's] biotech versus pharma? To what degree also fixed-price contracts are a part of that backlog?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I didn't get the second part of the question. The type of contracts, Tycho?</p><p>TYCHO W. PETERSON: Fixed-price contracts. How much of the backlog today are fixed price?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Okay. Let me start with the biotech with</p><p>[Saama]. Certainly, over the last 12 months or so we've seen -- I think, we've all seen a very strong funding environment around biotech, probably unprecedented, I would say. And that can certainly continue this quarter. So biotech and midsize has certainly increased in proportion in our backlog. We still remain a very significantly large pharma CRO that continues, and that certainly continues as well as part of our strategy, but the funding environment within the biotech has pushed that part of our backlog up. In terms of fixed-price contracts, I don't quite understand what that's all about. I mean, we -- well, all of the large CRO's do fixed-price contracts, there's nothing particularly novel or new there. Our customers expect us to put a budget down and fix the price according to the expectations in the scope of that project, recruitment rates, et cetera, et cetera. Particularly, as we become and we continue to become better in terms of our processes and our feasibility, we are able to nail our colors to the mast and actually fix a price in terms of what a recruit [made his buck]. No CRO -- and I don't care what they tell you, no CRO is going to be held to a fixed price if things like drug is not available or the FDA puts a hold on the contract or the project or those sorts of things. So we all operate to fix the price where it comes to operational parameters, like recruitment and us believing we can get the patients, et cetera. But there are always limits to that fixed price. And I don't believe anybody in the industry is operating outside of those limits.</p><p>TYCHO W. PETERSON: Okay. That's helpful. Just 2 quick follow ups. Pfizer, you had a sequential increase in the overall contribution, so should we assume that this is going to continue for the remainder of the year? And then, on the hiring point, back to Bob's question, where are you in, kind of, the overall process of hiring? You said 1,300 employees over the past year. Just how far down that path are you at this?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Let me take the Pfizer once. First, we saw it as a slow -- a bit of a bounce uptick on that Pfizer revenues this quarter. We think, we're -- we've reached pretty much a steady state with Pfizer, they remain our largest customer. And we believe we're at about the regular, sort of, cadence of quarterly revenues, annual revenues in the $220 million to $270 million sort of mark, that sort of number. So I think, we're in a good place there. Certainly, we won -- from this quarter to round about slightly under a 1 book-to-bill, but I think overall last 12 months, we're at about a 1 book-to-bill. So I think we're in a good place there. In terms of hiring, as I said, 1,300 people came in, about half -- a bit more of those came in through the Mapi acquisition. So we continue to bring on board new people, as we need to, to win the work. As you can see the backlog has gone up 16% year-on-year. So I don't expect we'll be increasing necessarily 16% of that people-wise, year-on-year. But we certainly have our HR machine and recruitment machine ramped up to be able to bring those people in efficiently and effectively. That's an ongoing process. As we continue to win more work than we're burning, we expect to grow and we expect to bring the people on at about the rate of revenue post of what we're going to pursue. So that's a process that's working well. And I think, we feel, we're able to bring them on at the right time. We're not bringing them too early and having them sit around. And we're not bringing them on too late and leaving revenue on the table. That's the challenge we have as an organization. And I believe our operational people are handling that very well.</p><p>OPERATOR: And we'll move to our next question from Ross Muken of Evercore.</p><p>ROSS JORDAN MUKEN, SENIOR MD, HEAD OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY &amp; FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe, just on, sort of, revenue cadence for the rest of the year and then, into next year. It feels like you had very strong bookings momentum now for some time, obviously, the backlog is growing at an elevated rate, as you spoke. We're starting to comp again some of the easier compares from last year, given some of the trials that fell off. So how are you thinking about, sort of, that burn rate and your ability to, sort of, get back to more of the normalized growth we were used to seeing from you, at least, on the</p><p>[core] basis? Because it feels like we're, kind of, hitting into this inflection period, into the back half of this year and the next year where we can get back to, sort of, the top line expectations we're used to seeing, given how strong you have done from a new business perspective?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I'll have a crack at that and then Brendan might jump in as well. I think we're seeing puts and calls on the burn rate. We were $9.4 million this quarter, we were $9.4 million last quarter. So we do think we're starting to approach the [NABIR]. The pressure down already is, we continue to win as a number of our peers do oncology work, which is long, complex, long term and certainly, without any shadow of a doubt, burn slower than other trials. And that is an increasing part of our backlog, we reflect the clinical development landscape there. So that is -- that does put pressure on the burn. On the other hand, as I outlined, we're looking at how we can get better and faster and more efficient at starting our clinical trials up. The focus on our startup approach is starting to yield some benefits in terms of our operational metrics and time to get to first sight initiated. We're seeing some -- certainly, some progress there. We obviously, wherever we can, look to win work that can burn a bit faster, but to some extent, we're constrained by what's out there. So I think there are, let's say, puts and calls on that. We do think we are approaching the [NADIR]. We are looking to try to bring that up, but that's, I think, more of a longer-medium to longer-term approach.</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN, CFO, ICON PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY: Yes, Ross, I think you wanted -- the points you're making in your question there was, obviously, we've had some tough comps in the first half of the year from a revenue perspective on the, sort of, the mix really of the Pfizer and non-Pfizer book of business. As we go into the third quarter, obviously, by this time last year, in the third quarter, we were through the bococizumab cancelations. So I think the organic revenue growth that we referred to this quarter at 2% will go up fairly significantly, as we look into the back end of the year. And I suppose, what I do is, I point you towards revenue guidance for the full year, which is like in that 7% to 10% range now, as we pushed it up in this current quarter. And certainly, we'd like to be seeing</p><p>[CDOs] that are certainly in that range, as we go into the next couple of quarters.</p><p>ROSS JORDAN MUKEN: That's helpful, Brendan. And maybe just, if you guys give a little color. There's a lot of strategic deal activity, a number of key renewals went on or going on. How are you thinking about the conversations for some of the larger contracts? Obviously, so much time has been spent on, sort of all the biotech businesses, given what demands look like in that environment? How would you just, kind of, characterize the conversations there? And what else is still left out there for the remainder of the year, at least that's big and chunky?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Yes, I think, we look at our performance. I think with these strategic deals, if you book it more over the longer term, what you win and what you're able to renew. Certainly, we've able to renew a number of ours. We've competed very hard, I think, in these areas and we win, I think, more than our fair share. We've been successful over the longer period of time in these deals. And they take some time to, sort of, mature. They take a little bit of time to evolve. But there's 1 or 2 them that we've won in the last 6 months that are starting to move very significantly, and certainly contributed pretty much on a new business wins perspective in this quarter, limited though, in revenue. Really the revenue takes something like 12 months, sometimes even longer to start with these -- particularly the newer strategic deals. So we're starting to see the wins come in. And we expect to see the revenue will start to burn later this year and certainly into 2019 and beyond.</p><p>These things take a little bit of time. And as I said, we believe we have good offering in the area. We're able to engage. We have a lot of experience. We've been part of the largest partnership in the industry for a number of years, that has given us some credibility and some experience in this space. We're able to bring that and bring that experience to some of these newer partnerships. We're also seeing some of the, perhaps, more midsized companies become interested in these more partnerships. And a midsized company, it may be outsourcing, of course, less in terms of dollar terms. But if you can win the vast majority of that or 1 or 2 partners in that, sort of -- you can secure yourself a very good revenue stream. So we don't just look at the top 10 or 15 companies on the partnership side of these, Ross, we're looking a bit more broadly in building partnerships, building relationships and going out proactively and approaching customers more in the top 30 to 40, who still have a substantial amount of work to outsource and a willingness, increasing willingness to do it with organizations like us. So we feel the environment there is good. I strongly feel we're competing really well, and our offering is being well received.</p><p>OPERATOR: And we'll move to our next question, which comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays.</p><p>JACK MEEHAN, VP &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Steve, I was hoping you can elaborate on the comments you made related to the expansion plans with the PMG network. And just specifically there, what are your plans regionally? Are there any partnerships you could use to expand there? And what level investment should we expect to build that out?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Yes, interestingly, Jack, we've -- we have expanded the PMG network. I mentioned the DuPage network of sites that we brought on. We have them and we've taken over that -- the clinical trials capabilities within that network without having to pay anything. It's something we've assumed responsibility for. Obviously, we've seen the costs and we assume the benefits. But it's not been something we've actually had to pay for. There are other -- there are 1 or 2 other networks in the same, sort of, state in North America. So we're looking at that. Not costing us all the money, its costing is, obviously, resource, and we're building our infrastructure and adding that and building it into the PMG network. So the expansion in the North America is really limited cost, but it's -- and it takes some time and effort, and of course, investment for us to build that out. What we want to go next is to Europe. And we've been actively looking in Europe for a network that we would be able to acquire. We've had a couple 1 or 2 false starts. We're fairly disciplined in terms of making sure we acquire an operation that has a very high quality of service, and is very well thought after or thought at -- has a good reputation. And -- so we've had a couple of -- little bit of stop-start in Europe, where we continue to look very actively today. And I think you could expect, certainly in the next 12 months, and I hope earlier than that, some progress on that front. But our site network is still very much a fundamental part of our strategy combining with our -- with the analytics and data strategy that we have around EMR in EHR records and analytics driving patients to the site. So it's fundamental to us and it's something that we feel, we can continue to develop and make progress on.</p><p>JACK MEEHAN: Great. And maybe one for Brendan. Could you just confirm that 2018 targets related to cash flow? And can you help us with the pacing going into the back half of the year? Just looks a little bit more back-half weighted than you've historically posted.</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN: Yes, that's probably fair, Jack. We were kind of -- we're in that, kind of, I suppose $300 million, kind of, level of expectation on cash flow. As you guys know in the past, we do have a pretty high percentage cash conversion cycle. I would agree with you, it is more back-half related. And obviously, we'll be looking to deploy that capital, either or predominantly on our M&amp;A strategy, as I think we've outlined over the last year or so. So yes, it is definitely more back-end related. So we expect probably -- and I think we've done about 100 year-to-date, maybe just shy of that, and probably the rest in the back half.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll move toward next question, which comes from Donald Hooker of KeyBanc.</p><p>DONALD HOUGHTON HOOKER, VP AND EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: On the continued -- everyone continues to be impressed with your discipline around SG&amp;A expenses. I was just wondering, is there a risk that you guys might be somewhat underinvesting in your business? I mean, do you feel like there are areas where -- is there a risk that you are underinvesting in the business where that could come back and bite you down the road?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Donald, you've always got to balance up between the investments you make and the efficiency you are trying to get and how you leverage that investment. So is there a risk? There's always a risk, but I don't believe we are doing that. We are disciplined in the way we look at our cost. We're very focused in that area. And we have a very good group of people looking after, particularly on the global business services side of things, who are not just able to take up a challenge when it comes to being efficient and make -- maximizing the value or the spend that they have, but being open to new ideas and new ways of doing things. And then that's a state of mind that, I think, our leaders in that group have that, sort of, differentiate them, perhaps, from others. They are open to doing things differently, be it robotics or process engineering or different ways of organizing their group or different ways of doing the work that they're supposed to be doing, or different locations for those people and how that works into our overall business and how it supports our overall business. So I think I'm lucky in that we have a strong group of people, who are -- not just on the global business service, but also in the operational area, who are innovative and open to new ideas. And so I don't think we are underinvesting. I think we're appropriately spending the money that we have. We're challenging ourselves, where we need to spend it. Perhaps such things like the security, IT security side of things. We have made significant investments in that area over the last 6 to 12 months, particularly given the environment we're all in now and the threats we're under with cybersecurity. So we've made solid and very significant investments in that as we brought the Mapi organization in, we've isolated them, quarantined them, sorted them out from our -- from a security point of view and brought them into the fold. So I believe, we're spending the money appropriately. We're spending it in a way that it's maximizing the value of that money, but we are also being creative and watching our pennies.</p><p>DONALD HOUGHTON HOOKER: Great, and certainly impressive to see. So my follow-up question will be more specific. Was curious, specifically, on the recent announcement with Practice Fusion, your relationship there. Can you -- how does the economics of that relationship work? What is -- obviously, I think I understand what you guys get. But how do we think about the other side? What is practice -- what are Practice Fusion's economics and that relationship for you?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Don, I have to be absolutely honest with you, I am not absolutely familiar with the detail of the economics that are offered. We -- they are an organization that has patient records and an ability to access patient records and the database of patients. They're helping put in place electronic medical records in, I think, it's around 20,000 practices, so a large number of practices. And they used -- those practices use those electronic medical records in those practices. And we, then, are able to have access if we pay up a fee to have access to those records. These patients have all opted in, so they're not de-identified, a very important distinction, I'd have to say, between us and someone between us, relationship with some of our competitors. These patients are opted in to be contacted for clinical trial opportunities. And our late-stage group, our ICON Commercialization Group is running a couple of pilots with them. I would have to say the economics of the relationship and the pilots is probably going to be a certain way and then different to how it will work out if we industrialize this, put it that way. So we would be paying some fee to access those records. They'll be making those available to us. We'll be then, using that data or finding those patients to bring those patients into the trial. That's the way it's, sort of, broadly work. I need to -- if you need any more detail on that, I think, we'll take it off line, but that's the way it's working (inaudible)</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question now comes from Erin Wright of Cr\\xE9dit Suisse.</p><p>ERIN ELIZABETH WILSON WRIGHT, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, CR\\xE9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Can you give us an update on Mapi? How that transaction is progressing relative to your internal expectations at this point? Did you break out the contribution as well from acquisitions of Mapi in the quarter?</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN: It's Brendan here. Yes, we're pleased with the inspiration of Mapi. As you guys know, we brought it actually around this time last year and have been working hard on the integration since. We're pretty much through, 95% I would say, of the integration process at this stage. And so, we're happy with the overall performance of the business unit. At the beginning of the call, I called out there just the -- I suppose, if you like, the revenue contribution from the different elements. And I did say that the CDO revenue growth was about 2% versus a constant currency growth year-over-year of about 8%. Obviously, the [FX] and the difference coming from the Mapi organization. So a little ahead, actually in the current quarter versus last quarter. So good progress from our perspective at this stage.</p><p>ERIN ELIZABETH WILSON WRIGHT: Okay. Great. And then, on the capital deployment front, I guess. Where are the holes in your offering? Or where are you seeing opportunities in the M&amp;A pipeline. Would you focus or target more postapproval, pharmacovigilance, Asia, or I guess, you were mentioning earlier investments in site networks? I guess, where are your priorities today?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: You pretty much answered your own question. You have outlined a couple of areas there that we would certainly be looking at or we are currently looking at in terms of M&amp;A and capital deployment. It's not that we -- I think we feel we're particularly weak in those areas, but we have an ambition to be in the top echelon in each of the segments we operate in, as all companies in this space. So there are a couple of areas there, certainly, we already talked about the site network and expanding that. We fundamentally believe that is the right strategy. We're starting to get some traction with that. And so that's an area, particularly in Europe. As I said, we've broadened out, we are broadening out in the United States. Our aspects of Asia, Japan is an area I think I've mentioned before that we're looking to actively deploy capital in. And so those spreads, and then you look at some of the functional areas. Pharmacovigilance, I believe, in the industry is ripe for some consolidation. So I think there's some opportunity there to build an organization in that space. And we've got a good pharmacovigilance safety group. We're implementing some new software and applications there to really move them along. And at that point, I think, that might be a good time to look at that space. So those are the areas that we are actively looking at. We have a number of opportunities in our sites at the moment. And we expect to be able to execute on at least 1 or 2 of those within the foreseeable future, medium term, next, I'd say, 6 to 9 months.</p><p>ERIN ELIZABETH WILSON WRIGHT: And the size of those transactions, I guess, what sort of size you would be targeting? I guess it was this time last year, there was news of a potential larger acquisition, so I just, kind of, wanted to get a sense of what you were thinking?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I have to say, we -- I think, again, we've been public in terms of opportunistic on the -- on larger transactions. What we're talking about is our string of pearls strategy, which is traditionally being what we've been focused on. And those acquisitions, I think, as you probably know, range from anything, $50 million -- $30 million, $50 million, but even smaller if they're strategic. Some of the site networks aren't that big, up to $150 million, $200 million. That's the sort of range we're expecting in that, sort of -- with that sort of an approach.</p><p>OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from John Kreger of William Blair.</p><p>JOHN CHARLES KREGER, PARTNER &amp; HEALTHCARE SERVICES ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a question to expand on your comments on site network. What percentage of your active projects would you say you are using some sort of a site networks strategy at this point?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: John, I would have to be honest, I don't have that specific number in my head. I would estimate at about 25%, possibly up to 30% of our -- that we would be currently using [now]. Having said that, I would say, 75% of our new -- 75% of new projects would be going into that network approach. Because actively promote our site network approach for all of our new projects. And that doesn't mean every one of them is suitable or appropriate, but we certainly have a higher proportion of new projects going into that strategy or that approach that we do traditional within our backlog, so to speak.</p><p>JOHN CHARLES KREGER: Got it. Interesting. And then, you mentioned a number of, sort of, new technologies in your prepared remarks. If you, kind of, step back, do any of them stand out to you as particularly exciting in terms of a value add for you or your clients? Anything that you can call out? And even just generally, do you see bigger opportunities, sort of, externally around maybe trial design and site ID? Or more opportunity in terms of internal operational efficiency?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: That's a broad question, John. We could probably spend days talking about that. Certainly, from a technology point of view, you're aware of what we are doing from an electronic medical records and that certainly a focus for feasibility and how we find patients. That will -- we're trying a number of horses and trying a number of tracks. We believe that's the right way to go. Some more successful than others, but we certainly -- we're certainly seeing some traction in the areas we're working in and getting some benefits. And quite frankly, learning a lot, as we go along. If I look at things like robotics, and we'll talk about a bit more of this at our Analyst Day on September 10 in New York. We're hoping to have some demonstrations of some of the technology there around our robotics and automation approach, but we see some very exciting things. I get exciting about it, some people may not, around our trial master file and how we -- I was seeing a demonstration yesterday from our IT guys in terms of how we're improving the designation and categorization and filing of follow-up letters to monitoring reports. A simple thing enough, but a robot can do this in a minute. It takes -- we've calculated, it takes our people 6 minute to do it. And we have a lot of people. We handle a lot of paper across our organization with the 500 clinical trials that we have running. And so that is a material -- that can be a material impact in terms of how we, more effectively, more efficiently, file -- putting documents into files for the regulatory authorities and for the auditors to look at. And again, a relatively simple thing, but something we're processing and moving forward. And we have a number of our folks, including myself, very excited about the benefits that can bring to us. Not just in terms of reducing costs and being more efficient, but being faster and being more up-to-date for audits. Gives us a quality angle as well as an efficiency angle. So there are number of things in there. Then if we look at the adaptive trial design, and that continues to be important for us, we continue to focus on. Does -- it hasn't perhaps got the take-up and the uptick as much, as I would have liked to see in the industry, but there are several customers who are very engaged in it. Certainly some of our alliance partners are very interested in what the capabilities we have, and how we can apply those sorts of new designs to their development program. So I think on a number of fronts, be it applications, be it software, be it IT, be it process, be it statistics, we're looking at a driving forward innovation and technology and bringing those sorts of solutions and new ways of doing things to our customers.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll now to move to our next question from Sandy Draper of SunTrust.</p><p>ALEXANDER YEARLEY DRAPER, MD, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just may be a very quick question. Just thoughts on any updated thinking on stock repurchases, obviously, did a bunch last year, it sort of slowed down as you anticipated. As you build up cash, there's a balance of M&amp;A opportunities versus stock buyback. But just thinking about the last couple of years you've taken points of being aggressive, any thoughts on how you feel so softly about stock buybacks? Has that changed at all? Or is it still pretty much the same thought process?</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN: It's Brandon here. I don't think fundamentally, we are shifting from where we have certainly been over the last 6 to 12 months in terms of our buyback mentality here. I think we've been very clear that our primary use of capital is going to be around the M&amp;A side of things. That's definitely what we want to do. By the end of this year, we want to see a couple of deals in the door and we're actively working towards that. In terms of the buyback program, it's not gone away. You've seen it's chunking away through the first half of the year. We did, again, continued it in Q2. I think, one of the things that we are mindful of is making sure that stock dilution that we get from exercise of the issue of shares to employees during the course of the year isn't impacting. And that's about 1 million shares a year. So that in itself is a chunk of change that is going to be used and we will continue to use. So I think that's possibly the best way to think about it in terms of our balancing, our M&amp;A portfolio and capital deployment around that, and our buyback procedures.</p><p>OPERATOR: And we move over next question from Juan Avendano of Bank of America.</p><p>JUAN ESTEBAN AVENDANO, ASSOCIATE, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: A lot of my questions have been answered, but I do have one. With regards to customer specific trends, revenue growth in your top 10 customers has picked up, particularly among customers 6 through 10. Can you tell us what's driving that or what's happening with those relationships? And then, also what was your net book-to-bill outside of your top customer?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I'll have the first one, Juan, in terms of what's driving revenue growth trends across the top 10 customers. I think, Brendan can answer your second one in terms of book-to-bills outside of that. I think, for us, we've -- one of our strategic pillars is around partnership and what we bring to a partnership. I think, as I mentioned, we have a lot of experience in this area and it's something we take very seriously in terms of where we're going with our organization. I think we've been able to bring that partnership approach to those -- I mean, the top 10 customers do tend to be our partner customers, our alliance partner customers. We've been able to wrap a solid execution and delivery around them. We dedicate specific and very competent resources to those customers. We get to know them very well. We spent time with them and we look at it in terms of very much a long-term relationship. And a number of those alliances have really moved to the next level now, and we're securing a very significant annual revenues from those customers. And it's not just within, say, our full service business, it's now broadening out across -- again, as I mentioned in my comments, across other parts of our business. And other parts of our business, our doctor IFS group is also bringing in opportunities for our full service. So there's a cross fertilization, if you like, across the various service areas and functions within the customer, within now across our company is also helping to drive the accumulation of significant revenues and broaden out the partnership and the relationship across those allied -- alliance customers. So it's -- I think it's been a very positive experience for us. And I think they are also seeing the benefits of that partnership as well. In terms of solid delivery, good operation metrics, we track the performance of those partnerships in terms of what we're doing on the day-to-day basis, how fast we are starting studies, how quickly we are completing the studies, are we on time performance wise, et cetera. Quality is a very important focus as well. With all of that, I think we gain further credibility and we build a relationship with those partners. It goes from strength to strength, it's a good news story. And obviously, we look to deploy it on as many -- on new partners as well and new customers as well. In terms of the book-to-bill, do you have that?</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN: Yes. Obviously, Juan, I suppose that</p><p>(inaudible) because we don't call out that number specifically anymore, because our biggest customer is now at a level that we think it is a sustainable number as we go forward. I think as Steve mentioned, we have a better one with a book-to-bill with them over the last couple of quarters. And excluding them, it's not a huge difference between what we actually would report, the 1.29 that we reported -- sorry, the [1.28 that we reported for the first half of the year. So excluding them it's about 1.31, 1.32.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will now move over next question from Justin Bowers of Bloomberg Intelligence.</p><p>JUSTIN BOWERS: Just wanted to follow-up on the robotics and digital strategy and some of the investments that you've made in kind of the plan going forward. I realize that these things take more than a few quarters to really affect the business. But if we were to look out, let's say, 1 to 2 to 5 years, how would you guys measure success from the broader digital strategy? Would this translate into market share gains, like an increase in burn rate, for example? And then, is that something that you are going to continue to do organically or with some of your existing big tech partners? Or is that going to include some external, kind of, organic efforts as well? And then, I have a follow-up.</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Okay. That's a pretty broad question, Justin, but in terms of our robotics and digital strategy, I think we see a number of advantages over many points or measures of success. I would say, obviously, margin -- I would probably say margin maintenance. Margins are solid now and strong. Maybe we can tick them up a little bit, but we do see the digitalization and robotics process automation really helping us to maintain margins overall and probably improve our SG&amp;A leverage spend, particularly around more routine tasks and having our people move up to more higher value tasks. So I think that's certainly 1 area of it. And then, I think, in doing so, we can make sure that our value -- the value we offer customers from a pricing point of view continues to be solid. And I think if we do that well, we should be able to take market share. That's a longer-term play but it's certainly within our strategy and it's certainly something we want to focus on. We believe -- I fundamentally believe that the clinical trial process is too clunky and too expensive and we do need to be able to -- we need to be part of the solution there in making it more efficient, more effective. And I think the robotics is just one aspect of what we can do to improve that and we have a responsibility and I think an obligation to do it. And I think if we can, we'll be very successful. I think it's a matter of reducing margins, in fact -- if anything, we'll be maintaining or possibly even improving them if we do it really well. Now we've got to execute on that, and that's always the challenge. In terms of who we partner -- our strategy at the moment is to work with different partners, particularly around the data strategy and the site in-patient EMI, EHR strategy, that's very clear. We have been very upfront with that for some time. In terms of robotics and automation I think, again, we'll be looking out who's out there. We're already doing some pilots, again we'll talk a bit more about that on September 10. But we're looking at who are the right partners and what are the right organizations and what are the right technologies. Let's just be honest here, we are fairly early in the process here. This is not something that's necessarily going to be implemented within the next quarter or 2. As I say, it's a medium- to longer-term play. But we do believe it has a fundamental role to playing in our continued success. We're embracing it, our leaders are embracing it and we believe it's going to be strong. The exact strategy into who we partnership or what sort of organizations and how we do that, is being worked out as we speak.</p><p>JUSTIN BOWERS: Got it. Thank you. The quick follow up is it sounds like -- I mean, funding has been strong all year, but it sounds like there's been kind of an improvement this last quarter. And I would say maybe even now versus the first quarter in terms of the RFP activity and the opportunities out there. Is that a fair characterization? And even a little more activity from the small to midsize?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I think that's a fair characterization. Yes, I think everyone is aware that the funding environment has been very strong. Not just this year, but certainly over the last few years, really. The public markets have been open [-ended]. We find that biotech is a well-funded and ambitious. They're like I said, 5, 10 years ago, they might have been looking to partner. Less so these days. So we find they have large programs and projects that they are ready to fund and able to fund themselves. So funding environment is great. We've seen, I would say, modest to mid-single-digit, sort of, uptick in RFP opportunities. We have a strong business development group who have been able to take advantage of that and I will win rate, if anything, has been increasing as well. So you get more opportunities and you get a stronger win rate, it adds up to a pretty solid formula from a business development point of view.</p><p>OPERATOR: And we move over next question from David Windley of Jefferies.</p><p>DAVID HOWARD WINDLEY, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: The -- perhaps intersecting with a robotics discussion, I'm wondering Steve, as you see this demand increase and I think you're pretty aggressive in adding staff. In 2Q, how do you see your sales position to service the growth? How fast do you need to be continuing to add headcount? What does the labor market look like? So how is the pool of available talent to service that or to feed that headcount add? And then how much are you able to alleviate your need to add headcount through some of this robotic and automation investment that you're making?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Yes. Interesting question, David. Let's -- I think it's premature for me to, sort of, declare that we could alleviate our headcount requirements on the basis of robotics at the moment. We are moving on this but it's going to take a little bit of time. We are doing some pilots, and I think it will be at least a couple of quarters before I'm in the position to even answer that question or make an attempt to answering that question in terms of what impact that is going to have. I would say we are very optimistic, we can see some bright spots and some real possibilities quantifying it. I think it's way too early to do that at the moment. In terms of the labor market, it remains tight, particularly around CRAs and project managers particularly with oncology experience, as you would expect. We have a number of approaches to build our own. We have a number of graduate -- from new graduate programs, certainly in Asia. In Japan, we brought on 50 new graduates and then we trained them and we literally sit them in the office ourselves for the first 6 to 9 months and train them up and then, gradually are able to assign them to work. So that's an investment we are making. We also doing that in the United States and couple of other European -- sorry, Asian countries, particularly as well, China. So we're alleviating some of those headcount or labor market challenges through things like that, training our own resources. Our retention has been very good over the last 12 months, it's improved fairly -- not dramatically, it was always fairly good. But I think we are at an all-time high in terms of retention now. So that always helps you. If you don't lose as many people, you don't have to replace as many. I think we're in a good position in terms of the work we've got coming in and managing the just-in-time process of bringing in those resources to do the work. As I said, not leaving revenue and work on the table but not bringing it in so early that people don't have enough to do. It's a fine balance that we have to strike, but I think with the tools we have and the competent folks we have running these groups, we are able to tread that from under [mile farther].</p><p>DAVID HOWARD WINDLEY: Just thinking about the revenue base, the totality of revenue and folks I know, me included, still thinking, kind of, Pfizer and ex-Pfizer. And I know you probably want to get away from that. But I understand early -- I jumped on late, and I understand earlier in the call you said you think Pfizer has kind of normalized around, maybe, [260 or 260 to 270]. I think that number in and of itself has bounced around a fair amount as we've tried to find the bottom one, on Pfizer post-bococizumab. I guess I just would be interested in hearing your answer again on the visibility that you have to the run rate from Pfizer. And then, given a steady book-to-bill outside of that, as you described, is that ex-Pfizer book of business something that you think can still generate -- continue to generate double-digit growth? Could it even be mid-teens as it was in the first quarter? How should we think about that ex-Pfizer book of business converting out of backlog and growing going forward.</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I'll have a crack at that and I'll get Brendan to add. In terms of Pfizer, I think as you've seen the revenues have come down over the last few quarters. I think this quarter, we actually bounced up a bit to around 60-something million dollars. And I do think -- so I do think we are looking at a steady state now, whether it's $260 million, a little higher, a little lower. I don't think it's going to be materially different to that. And I think that's a good number for us to be at. I think that's a number that they will feel comfortable with. We certainly feel comfortable in delivering at that level of work. We have a good pipeline of opportunities with them. The work we've won over the last 12 months, as I mentioned, is in about the [1.0] on the book-to-bill. So we figure that's about the right number, that's a good number for us to be at. In terms of ex-Pfizer growth, certainly, we have seen on a book-to-bill basis, very solid numbers posted and very solid revenue growth ex-Pfizer. And I do think that will start to, as Brendan said, start to really play in as we get towards the back-end of this year and into next year. I'm not sure about teens, but I would've thought high single digits, maybe low double digits is the sort of number we'd be actively looking at for 2019 and beyond. Dave, we think the work we've brought in, the quality, the backlog we brought in -- notwithstanding, a lot of it is oncology so I put that out as a little bit of a warning, but the quality of the backlog we have and we have won, particularly through our alliance partners and the newer midsized biotechs, is such that we believe we can get this moving and get to those sort of numbers. So we are optimistic and certainly very positive about the revenue growth potential for the company over the next couple of years, really. Do you want to add to that?</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN: The only thing that I would add to that, Dave, is just to say really quickly, we guided at the beginning of this year 12% to 14% of concentration from the customer. First quarter, we were 12%, second quarter we were 13.5%. So we are in the range. It will jump around a little bit, just like any other customer. So I think the expectation I'd say is just be careful on a quarterly basis if you're expecting absolutes. Look at it on a 12-month basis is how I would say it, and I think we'll definitely be in that or above the 14% range.</p><p>OPERATOR: As we have no further questions, I'd like to turn the call back over to you, gentlemen, for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Thank you, operator. Quarter 2 was another very strong quarter for ICON and we look forward to building on this progress throughout 2018 as we consolidate our position as the CRO partner of choice in drug development. We look forward to talking with many of you at our Investor Day at The NASDAQ Markets Day in New York City on Monday, September 10.

Mitchell Bradley Germain - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division,MD and Senior Research Analyst</p><p>OVERVIEW</p><p>Co. reported 2Q19 results. Expects 2019 adjusted EPS to be $3.70-3.80.</p><p>FINANCIAL DATA</p><p>1. 2019 adjusted EPS guidance = $3.70-3.80.</p><p>PRESENTATION SUMMARY -</p><p>2Q19 Overview (B.B.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. Adjusted EPS increased 11% YoverY, driven by two services segments (Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions), which together [log]:</p><p>1. 12% fee revenue growth.</p><p>2. 18% adjusted EBITDA growth.</p><p>2. Revenue growth was broad-based as every line of business within both aforementioned segments increased YoverY.</p><p>3. Adjusted EBITDA margins on fee revenue increased solidly in Advisory and Global Workplace Solutions segments, expanding by 90 BP on combined basis.</p><p>4. Real Estate Investments adjusted EBITDA declined, as expected YoverY, due to:</p><p>1. Timing of development dispositions.</p><p>2. To lesser extent, costs associated with starting up Hana (flexible-space offering).</p><p>5. Gains from development business can vary due to timing of project disposition.</p><p>1. Last year harvested gains from several significant projects during 2Q.</p><p>2Q19 Review (B.S.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. Another qtr. of strong growth with double-digit revenue increases in leasing, occupier outsourcing and US capital markets businesses.</p><p>2. Impact of reorganization, which Co. announced last year, is driving margin improvement in Advisory Services and Outsourcing businesses.</p><p>1. Cost efficiency was one of key objectives of this change.</p><p>3. Continued strength in leasing business is notable, as lease revenue growth has averaged 20% over past five quarters.</p><p>1. Benefited from healthy leasing market.</p><p>1. Strong performance reflects increasingly differentiated capabilities.</p><p>2. This is demonstrated by success in winning new account-based business, because of ability to integrate Advisory and Transaction Solutions in single offering, and to execute at high-level across markets.</p><p>4. US account-based leasing revenue increased 31% YoverY.</p><p>1. Large and sophisticated occupiers are asking CBRE for consultation and workplace design, deep expertise in industry sectors and full suite of digital capabilities.</p><p>2. They want Co. to bring it all together with top brokerage talent in market.</p><p>3. No firm in Co.'s industry is able to match scale and capabilities of CBRE's leasing business.</p><p>1. Thereby, when CBRE competes for new account-based leasing mandates, more often than not Co. wins that business.</p><p>2. Management Update:</p><p>1. Leah Stearns, new CFO.</p><p>2Q19 Financials (L.S.)</p><p>1. Overview:</p><p>1. Over last five years, Co. has generated:</p><p>1. 13% annualized growth in adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>2. 18% annualized growth in adjusted EPS.</p><p>3. About 70% total shareholder return.</p><p>1. This is all been achieved, while simultaneously diversifying business and strengthening balance sheet.</p><p>2. Aforementioned financial results have been supported by favorable secular trends, which Co. believes provide solid foundation to earnings its business generates.</p><p>3. Within Co.'s sector, CBRE has powerful competitive position to address customer demand, and thinks that's under-appreciated.</p><p>1. Global scale, breadth of services Co. can offer and ability to invest in digital capabilities are allowing it to pull away from competition.</p><p>4. Real estate continues to show signs of strength.</p><p>1. Institutional capital allocations to real estate continue to rise.</p><p>2. Simultaneously, debt costs are declining, while underwriting standards, loan-to-value ratios and cap rates all remain largely stable.</p><p>3. Sees few signs of overbuilding as supply growth is meeting strong occupier demand.</p><p>5. Given resilient and diversified business mix and strong balance sheet, Co. is operating from position of strength.</p><p>1. Sees tremendous opportunities ahead of Co.</p><p>2. Will remain opportunistic as Co. deploys capital into business to maximize total shareholder return in future.</p><p>2. Advisory Services:</p><p>1. Adjusted EBITDA grew 15%, driven by:</p><p>1. 11% increase in revenue.</p><p>2. 60 BP improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin YoverY.</p><p>2. Margins benefited from business mix and solid cost discipline, as OpEx rose just 2% on adjusted basis.</p><p>3. Leasing business up 19%; strong.</p><p>1. This was paced by Americas, which generated 70% of Advisory fee revenue and grew 26%.</p><p>2. Co-working companies comprised about 3% of Americas Advisory leasing revenue across all property types, contributing approx. 1 percentage point to growth.</p><p>4. Outside Americas, Advisory leasing was less robust:</p><p>1. Declining 1% in US dollars.</p><p>2. Increasing 5% in local currency.</p><p>5. Combined capital markets business, comprising property sales and commercial mortgage origination, grew 5%.</p><p>1. Up from slight decline in 1Q.</p><p>2. Americas property sales increased 8%, reflecting:</p><p>1. Market share gains.</p><p>2. Increase in commercial real estate transaction volumes, as investors return to market after tumultuous end to 2018.</p><p>3. Outside Americas, property sales declined 8% or 3% in local currency.</p><p>1. Decline was primarily due to residential business in APAC, where fundamentals remain weak.</p><p>4. Excluding residential, commercial property sales, revenue outside Americas increased 8% in local currency, against backdrop of generally soft sales volumes.</p><p>6. Global commercial mortgage origination revenue grew 16% YoverY.</p><p>1. Continues to support growth in loan servicing portfolio.</p><p>7. Debt markets globally remained liquid, with credit available from variety of sources, including banks, life insurance companies, debt funds, CMBS and both Fannie and Freddie Mac.</p><p>3. Global Workplace Solutions (GWS):</p><p>1. Momentum for outsourcing offering remained strong.</p><p>1. Results were supported by several large new client engagements.</p><p>2. In April, Co. on-boarded 100m sq. ft. of facilities for several clients in single day; Co.'s largest go-live day in history.</p><p>3. Fee revenue increased 14% despite 5 percentage point headwind from FX.</p><p>4. Adjusted EBITDA increased by over 30%.</p><p>5. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 180 BP.</p><p>6. Driving strong performance was Americas team, which generates approx. 70% of segment's adjusted EBITDA and had outstanding qtr. with:</p><p>1. Nearly 24% fee revenue.</p><p>2. Nearly 48% adjusted EBITDA growth.</p><p>7. Expects demand will likely be more balanced across global footprint in 2H19.</p><p>8. Within GWS, further penetrating key sectors like life sciences and retail.</p><p>1. Latter of which is being aided by FacilitySource capabilities Co. acquired last year.</p><p>9. Seeing particular success with clients that utilize multiple GWS services.</p><p>1. Multi-service clients have represented increasing percentage of pipeline for six consecutive quarters.</p><p>1. In Canada, won long-term contract to manage all of facilities and real-estate-related projects for Province of British Columbia, portfolio spanning 17m sq. ft.</p><p>2. Along with Ontario, this is second Canadian Province in Co.'s portfolio.</p><p>3. Co. was able to [unsee] long-term incumbent service provider and prevail over field of competitors, due to strong track record in Ontario and strength of digital technology tool.</p><p>4. Key part of client pursuit win with digital platform and ability to substantially overhaul and upgrade Province's existing facilities technology to drive operating cost savings, improved reporting and enhanced business performance for clients.</p><p>10. Margin growth was supported by handful of discrete items like decrease in health insurance reserves, which contributed approx. 100 BP to margin expansion and efforts to manage operating costs, leverage scale and increase selectivity in client pursuit.</p><p>11. Has strong momentum and record pursuit pipeline, which gives Co. confidence that double-digit fee revenue growth will continue.</p><p>4. Real Estate Investments:</p><p>1. Business fundamentals remained solid, including progress with initial investments in Hana (flexible-space offering) and in-process development portfolio, which reached new record level.</p><p>2. Saw $39m decline in adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>1. Mostly attributable to development business.</p><p>2. Co. had anticipated this decline, given strong comparable period and expectation that timing of development gains this year will be heavily weighted into 1Q and 4Qs.</p><p>1. QtoQ variability in development business largely goes away when assessing business over longer period of time.</p><p>2. Over last five years, development business generated nearly $600m of adjusted EBITDA, while requiring little capital commitment from CBRE.</p><p>3. Based on quality of development pipeline and Trammell Crow Company franchise, expects even stronger financial performance over next five years, assuming market conditions remain supportive and no economic downturn occurs.</p><p>3. Investment management:</p><p>1. Performance improved YoverY.</p><p>2. Adjusted EBITDA up $4m or 32% in local currency.</p><p>1. Growth is supported by increase in assets under management, which were up $5b YoverY to nearly $107b.</p><p>4. Launch of Hana (Flexible-Space Solutions) business incurred modest costs, which were consistent with expectations.</p><p>1. Continues to be pleased with market response to Hana as landlord clients are keenly interested in flexible-space opportunities and rising demands from occupiers.</p><p>2. Excited about upcoming opening of first Hana location, 67,000-sq. ft. first-class space at PwC Tower in Dallas.</p><p>5. Others:</p><p>1. Co. is in solid financial position.</p><p>2. Balance sheet is strong with net leverage of about 0.8 turns of adjusted EBITDA at 2Q19-end.</p><p>3. Remains poised to allocate capital opportunistically with intense focus on maximizing total shareholder return.</p><p>4. Taking into account Co.'s planned acquisitions, expects that it can invest about $1b for remainder of year, while maintaining net debt at around 1 times trailing adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>6. 2019 Outlook:</p><p>1. In light of performance in 1H and trajectory of business, raising adjusted EPS guidance to $3.70-3.80.</p><p>1. $3.75 midpoint, reflects:</p><p>1. $0.15 increase from initial outlook provided in March.</p><p>2. 14% gain over 2018 adjusted EPS.</p><p>2. If achieved, this would be 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings growth.</p><p>3. Expects adjusted EPS to be more heavily weighted to 4Q than in 2018, due to expected timing of development dispositions.</p><p>2. Expects 3Q19 adjusted EBITDA in Real Estate Investments segment to approximate level attained in 2Q19.</p><p>Conclusion (B.S.)</p><p>1. Summary:</p><p>1. Co. is in strong strategic position with excellent momentum in business, particularly in Americas, where it generates majority of revenue and earnings.</p><p>2. Co. is well-positioned, thanks to:</p><p>1. Ongoing investments in people.</p><p>2. Integrated solutions and technology.</p><p>3. Recent reorganization to drive great client outcomes and continued strong growth.</p><p>3. Plans to acquire Telford Homes, which Co. announced early last month.</p><p>1. If approved by Telford shareholders and government regulators, Telford transaction will enable Co. to strategically expand Trammell Crow Company development business internationally and into market, which is in early stages of secular shift toward institutionally-owned urban rental housing.</p><p>2. Telford's shareholders will vote on buyout offer on 08/06/19.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Anthony Paolone, JPMorgan.</p><p>ANTHONY PAOLONE, SENIOR ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: My first question is on leasing and the strength there despite a tough comp in 2Q '18. Can you talk a little bit more about what's happening there particularly? And how much of this you think is really market share gains versus the market itself?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, CBRE GROUP, INC.: Tony, it's both. The market was strong, particularly here in the Americas, and I think we performed quite well. What's going on with our business is, we've built a capability to serve our clients really well when they need account-based services with lots of advisory capability connected across markets both here in the U.S. and around the world. We saw 33% growth in our account-based leasing revenues, very reflective of the machine we've built to serve those clients. And yes, we did benefit from a healthy market circumstance.</p><p>ANTHONY PAOLONE: Okay. And so do you think that this higher level of growth will be present in the second half of the year because the comps remain pretty high?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Yes. Well, we've had 5 straight quarters of 20% leasing growth, so the comps were high this quarter, you already alluded to that at the start of your question. Look, I don't think anybody could expect that kind of continued growth indefinitely, but we just raised our guidance. We think we're going to have a very good second half. And as the prominent users of space in the marketplace continue to buy on an increasingly account-based approach, we think we're going to perform really well into that model. And by the way, we think we're going to perform particularly well when we couple that with our other occupier services in GWS business, Project Management, Facilities Management. All of that is working really well together.</p><p>ANTHONY PAOLONE: Okay. And then second item on capital markets. It seems like there are some mix signals between some of the data and performance there. Can you talk a little bit more about just what's happening on the ground as it relates to investment sales activity and also just mortgage side in light of lower interest rates?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS, CFO, CBRE GROUP, INC.: So Anthony, it's Leah. I'll talk to the capital markets piece first. I guess what we saw happen in the second quarter is that we really believe now it's clear that the decline in the first quarter was a reflection of investors taking a bit of a step back to assess the market in light of the volatility that they saw in Q4 of '18. At this point, we think that given the level of activity and the Americas was strong in Q2, that supports our view that the fundamentals around commercial real estate services remain solidly intact, and so that includes capital allocations to real estate and how they continue to rise; debt costs are declining, to your point; and we're also seeing discipline throughout the industry, that includes the underwriting process as well as valuations. So all in all, we think these fundamentals are very supportive of the attractiveness of real estate, particularly on a relative basis to other asset classes. And so from our perspective, we feel pretty good about where we came out in the second quarter from a capital markets perspective in the Americas. And I think it's actually interesting to note, given the fact that we did see that contraction in Q1, our Advisory segment during that quarter still increased by over 20%. So it just shows the diversification that we've built into that -- into our business and particularly our Advisory segment.</p><p>ANTHONY PAOLONE: Got it. And then last question. If we just think about combined principal business EBITDA for this year for the full year versus '18, any guide posts on that given updated guidance and potential acquisitions and so forth?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: I'd really just say, in terms of the Real Estate Investments segment, we're expecting the seasonality to be quite different from 2018. But all in all, given the fact that we're not updating outlook at a detailed level, we do believe we're tracking ahead of guidance but we do expect that seasonality to be in the first and fourth quarter in 2019 compared to what we saw in '18, which was the second and third quarter strength.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Jason Green, Evercore ISI.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a question on the strength of leasing, specifically U.S. being dominated by any specific industry or is it a widespread growth across all industries?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: We are seeing that widespread across most industries. I mean we did see some benefits from recruiting, we saw some M&amp;A. But overall, we did have a really strong diverse set of demand coming to the leasing set.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN: Okay. And then maybe on the Telford acquisition, just as you guys think about acquisitions generally, should we expect more of a focus on growing the business outside of the United States? Or was this just the right opportunity to grow the portfolio in an area that you saw?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: We are not biased U.S. versus Europe versus Asia in where we put our dollars. We have a very clear view as to what we want to do when we do acquire -- or what we want to get done when we acquire companies. We want to buy businesses that add to our capabilities to deliver outcomes for clients. We're not about bulking up. So if you look last year, for instance, in that FacilitySource acquisition, which we think was one of the really good ones we've done, it gave us capability to serve distributed outsourcing clients in retail, branch banks, et cetera. Telford gave us the ability to do something to leverage our Trammell Crow brand beyond the United States, but in an arena where we think there's going to be real secular growth, something different, something better than we've done before.</p><p>Another thing we're looking for when we do acquisitions is businesses that we think, when we bring them on to our platform, we can do more with them than they were able to do themselves and we can do more with them than our competitors can do if they were to buy them. That's what allows us to pay for acquisitions, that's what allows them to be accretive. So that's our model, and it's not geographically biased.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN: Got it. And then last one for me, you mentioned the percentage of clients utilizing multiple GWS services has increased. What is that percentage today? And where do you think ultimately that could be?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: So we're seeing the pipeline certainly increase. We've seen 6 consecutive quarters of our pipeline attributable to clients who are looking for, what we call, 3x, all 3 lines of business or full service. And so today, we're actually at nearly 30% of our current client base using that level.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN: And long term, kind of, where you guys think that level could be?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Certainly, we're seeing a pickup in demand as indicated from the 6 consecutive quarters of increase through our pipeline. I think it just goes to show that there is a opportunity for us to expand client services within GWS, not just from a service line but also geographically. And so when we take on a new client through our pursuit, sometimes it starts out on a regional basis, and we're able to grow that organically as we provide services both across their real estate footprint, both from geographic perspective as well as a service line.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Josh Lamers, William Blair.</p><p>JOSHUA KAPLER LAMERS, ASSOCIATE, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just want to follow up actually with Anthony's -- one of Anthony's question. Does the Fed's announcement yesterday in your opinion create somewhat of a tailwind for the capital markets business? Or does this end up causing a bit of a more pause and some uncertainty going forward?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: So I think just going back to my comments around the fundamentals of commercial real estate, I mean, we see those as really what's driving the opportunities within our capital markets business. And so -- and I would point more to just overall enthusiasm and the relative value opportunity for real estate as it presents itself today for investors as opposed to more of the macro trends that you're alluding to.</p><p>JOSHUA KAPLER LAMERS: Got it. Okay. And then it has been brought up a number of times, but could you touch on the advisory personnel initiative that was started a few years ago? Just wondering essentially how many are in that role now globally today? And if you could expand a bit more on how much of an effect that's having you -- having on you guys winning these larger national contracts?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Josh, I want to ask for clarity, are you talking about broker recruiting or you talking about the professionals we have that provide advisory capability to support our transactional capability?</p><p>JOSHUA KAPLER LAMERS: Yes. Yes. The latter, the advisory personnel that are...</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: The latter. We have over 1,000 -- yes. We have invested heavily in that capability not just in terms of that advisory capability but in terms of technology digital capability to support, and we have over 1,000 people today around the world as part of what we call our Advisory and Transaction Services team supporting occupiers that are advisory-oriented as opposed to transaction oriented. And of course, we put them on teams with transaction professionals and our transaction -- base of great transaction professionals is continuing to grow through that recruiting effort. That's the other side of the equation.</p><p>JOSHUA KAPLER LAMERS: Okay. Right. And then I guess last one for me just given the recent election in the U.K., curious to get your outlook for expected activity in the U.K., and whether it's sort of a downturn has already phased through and now there's a bit more certainty? Or whether this gives a reason for another pause in activity in the U.K. in the upcoming quarters?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Well, we've kind of given up on trying to prognosticate what Brexit means. It's just been a seesaw ride for 3 years. But what I will tell you is, in the second quarter, both our leasing and our capital markets business grew in the U.K. It's a big important business for us but yet it's less than 10% of our company. And one thing that I think we all need to keep in mind is that London is going to be, no matter what happens, one of the most important property markets in the world on an enduring basis. There's just no doubt about that. And so we expect to see some choppiness. We expect to see company stand on the sideline both in leasing and capital markets a bit until it all sorts out. But we don't think it's going to have a big impact on our company's overall performance. And we are going to continue to have a prominent and very capable offering there, and we think that's a good thing.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Jason Weaver, Compass Point.</p><p>JASON PRICE WEAVER, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, COMPASS POINT RESEARCH &amp; TRADING, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just another follow up on Anthony's question on capital markets. Can you comment on the pace of America's property sales transactions within the quarter, whether that was, sort of, level or more backloaded?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: It certainly was up. In terms of the pace, it was back-end loaded.</p><p>JASON PRICE WEAVER: Okay. And then can you give us some more clarity into the GWS wins you've seen, either year-to-date or within the last 12 months, what the service revenue mix looks like? Whether that's facility management or project development services driven?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Sure. And maybe just to touch on GWS for a second. I mean I think, we see broad-based strength in that business, not just from the service lines, but also given that we're providing that service across broad geographies. And so as a result, I think while FM is our largest part of that business, transactions were up significantly year-over-year. And so that's a great opportunity for us to show that we're leveraging the strength between GWS and our transactions team. But maybe just to give you a little bit more color on GWS. We're seeing an expansion of not just geographies and lines of business but, as I mentioned earlier, there's a clear expansion of our customer relationships. And now we have about half of our growth coming from those existing clients, and that is allowing us to expand, obviously, the services that we provide. And that is supported by increasing strong NPS scores around customer satisfaction.</p><p>I think it also goes to show that we have capabilities that are differentiated, and that we are investing in technology that brings unparalleled service to our customers and that includes FacilitySource, and it also includes capabilities like our Data Center Solutions business. So I think those set us apart from the competition. It's resulting in the record client pursuit pipeline that I talked to before as well as that 6 consecutive quarters of increased multiple service contract as a percent of the pursuit pipeline.</p><p>So all in all, we're really pleased with how GWS performed for the quarter, and it's allowing us to become more selective in our pursuits. We're aligning our interests with our clients, and that's allowing us to develop deeper capabilities. And I think long term, that's going to lead to stronger profitability of that segment and really unmatched outcomes that we're providing to our clients that they cannot find elsewhere.</p><p>JASON PRICE WEAVER: Okay. And just finally, I think you touched on it in your prepared remarks, but can you give us some kind of idea into what your forward visibility is on the pipeline for future development disposition?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: I'm sorry, can you repeat that question?</p><p>JASON PRICE WEAVER: I'm just looking for some sort of commentary on what your visibility is for future dispositions in Development Services activity?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Oh, sure. In terms of -- and you're talking about 2019, in particular?</p><p>JASON PRICE WEAVER: Yes. Yes.</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Okay. Yes. No, I think that, that component of our business we do expect to be fourth quarter-weighted. And given the strengths last year, that will certainly be an easier comp than the third quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Jade Rahmani, KBW.</p><p>JADE JOSEPH RAHMANI, DIRECTOR, KEEFE, BRUYETTE, &amp; WOODS, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: In terms of the capital available for investment through the rest of the year, how would you look at prioritizing that?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Yes. And so in terms of the capital we have available, we do believe that we have a very strong pipeline in terms of opportunities. Certainly, we look at M&amp;A, and then we consider our share repurchase program. We'll be disciplined in our approach to both of those. And we've bought back about $45 million of shares this year, and we clearly have some large M&amp;A on our plate to absorb in the second half. But I think it was just important to demonstrate the scale of the capacity that we have and the strength of our balance sheet to be able to be opportunistic to the extent that we find unique opportunities in the market, again, both from an M&amp;A as well as a share repurchase perspective.</p><p>JADE JOSEPH RAHMANI: Turning to market share, do you have an estimate of CBRE's current market share in both -- in each of capital markets and leasing? And how that compared with a year ago?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: We think our market share went up in both. It's very hard to get good numbers. As you know, Jade, there's just not good third-party numbers around the world for the business we're in for either capital markets or for leasing, especially for leasing. But we believe based on our own research, and we have very extensive research and based on our CA data that's available that we took significant market share around the world in capital markets. And we think we took market share around the world in leasing. There's less data available. But it's very, very hard to get good third-party data on what that market share is.</p><p>JADE JOSEPH RAHMANI: In terms of the capital markets outlook, could you talk to maybe give some metrics around the health of the environment? In the past, you've commented on a number of bidders, for example, time lines for deals to close and the potential bid gap that's been commented in the market.</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: So I would just say in terms of the capital markets environment in the Americas, in particular, we did see velocity increase, so the pace of transactions pick up. I don't have specifics to the statistics that you're pointing to from prior quarters. But all in all, we think that we're seeing strong dynamics and trends around investors' appetite within the capital markets business. We did see the average marketing time fall in the second quarter. So that goes to my velocity comment that it's picking up.</p><p>JADE JOSEPH RAHMANI: And on the leasing front, can you comment on what percentage of leasing growth was driven by the tech sector and perhaps also new construction deliveries? I think 2019 is anticipated to be a peak in terms of new office completions.</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Yes. For the last few years, the tech sector has contributed about 20% of our leasing. In the second quarter this year, it was up from that. It was a little over 30%. And it goes to a point we talked about earlier that tech companies, these big tech companies are buying leasing services on an account basis. They are more inclined that way than the traditional big leasing companies. But we also think the second quarter was a bit anomalistic. We don't have any reason to believe that over an extended period of time that, that things are going to shift meaningfully away from where we've been historically or be like the second quarter where tech was particularly strong though in the second quarter.</p><p>JADE JOSEPH RAHMANI: And so that 30% this quarter versus historically 20% that would suggest about 50% of the growth was from tech?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: I don't know that 50% of the growth was from tech. Those statistics don't play out exactly the way you think they should in terms of growth.</p><p>JADE JOSEPH RAHMANI: Okay. In terms of the restructuring, and its impact on margins, can you comment on what you think the main drivers of that improved efficiency are?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Sure. I think the -- one of the key components of the reorg was to remove as much redundancy as possible throughout the management layer of the organization. And so we're seeing that happen, and it's playing out in terms of supporting that stronger operating leverage for the business. In addition, we have put leadership roles in place, like our COO, who are clearly focused and directly focused on cost reductions and making sure that our business is very focused on transparency and accountability across the organization. And so we believe that those specific steps that were carried out through the reorg are having direct impacts on our margins today and will continue.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Mitch Germain, JMP Securities.</p><p>MITCHELL BRADLEY GERMAIN, MD AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Telford, is this a model that you think can be replicated outside of the U.K?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Mitch, when you say replicated, in other words, can we buy businesses like this outside of the U.K?</p><p>MITCHELL BRADLEY GERMAIN: Can you take the Telford business and expand it across other countries and regions?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Well, we'll have to see when we bring that business on board and integrate it. But we believe that business model plays very well to trends across Europe in terms of a movement toward institutionally owned multi-tenant housing, professionally managed where the continent and the U.K. are behind the U.S. in that regard. So it may be an opportunity. But our -- again, we got to wait and get this thing done, and our focus is getting through next week when the shareholders vote, and we get approval from regulatory authorities.</p><p>MITCHELL BRADLEY GERMAIN: Great. And then maybe just circling back to FacilitySource, obviously, a deal that you closed last year, maybe based on what your underwriting was in terms of how it was going to integrate, and I know that you're making a pretty big capital investment. How has the performance been there versus what your expectations were?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Yes. We're seeing really nice performance coming out of that business. It's tracking in line with our underwriting, and we think we're seeing really strong momentum. I spoke about that in my prepared remarks, particularly around the retail segment. So our clients are excited about the expanded capability, and we believe it's helping us win new business. It's helping us provide additional services to our customers, and I think that certainly goes to those key trends that I've reiterated around GWS.</p><p>MITCHELL BRADLEY GERMAIN: Great. Last one for me. Are there any specific -- I guess, back in March when you laid out guidance, you provided some specific assumptions and clearly you're tracking ahead. But maybe just provide some perspective, what specifically is changed versus kind of what your original assumptions were?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Sure. I think that's just an indication or an acknowledgment of the strength we've seen in the business in the first half of the year. We're not updating outlook to the level that we provided in March, but the key drivers of our confidence behind the $0.15 increase, so really the fact that our segments are tracking ahead of our expectations and that we're seeing really strong margin growth in Advisory and GWS. So given the fact that from an Advisory perspective, we're seeing leasing continue to be the standout. We continue to expect to see strength across our segment line.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call back over to Bob Sulentic for closing remarks.</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Well, thanks, everyone, for being with us, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of the third quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference.

Wesley Keith Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division,Associate</p><p>OVERVIEW</p><p>Co. reported 2Q19 core FFO per share of $3.33.</p><p>FINANCIAL DATA</p><p>1. 2Q19 core FFO per share = $3.33.</p><p>PRESENTATION SUMMARY -</p><p>2Q19 Business Review (M.S.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. Results exceeded expectations with core FFO per share growing 6.1% YoverY.</p><p>1. Pleased to raise full-year core FFO guidance by $0.20 at midpoint, which is attributable to strong operations and improving cost of capital and solid execution from Co.'s team.</p><p>2. 2019 is playing out mostly as expected with market rents for Essex metros remaining unchanged at 3.1%.</p><p>3. Generally, tech markets continue to outperform, led by San Francisco and Seattle, while Southern California has lagged expectations.</p><p>1. San Francisco's estimated job growth was revised [upward] from 1.7% to 2.6%, pushing its estimated 2019 rent growth to 3.5%.</p><p>2. Southern California job growth had slow start to the year, and has since experienced a modest acceleration.</p><p>1. June trailing three-month job growth in Southern California was 1.3%, equal to forecast.</p><p>4. Several indicators support Co.'s expectation for continued job growth and housing demand, all of which are consistent with ESS's belief that West Coast vibrant economies remain well positioned for future growth.</p><p>2. Office Development:</p><p>1. Continues to perform at a healthy pace and is required for job growth.</p><p>2. For the nation, under construction office properties represent 2.1% of existing office stock.</p><p>3. Within Co.'s footprint all counties, except Orange and Ventura are producing new office space at greater pace than national avg.</p><p>1. Bay Area leads West Coast in office development with over 16m square feet or 4.9% of stock currently under construction.</p><p>2. In Seattle, nearly 5m square feet of office was under production or 3.3% of stock, not including planned expansion of the Microsoft campus with an estimated 3m square feet of office space.</p><p>4. Tracks job openings at Top 10 public tech companies, all of which are headquartered in Co.'s market.</p><p>1. As of 06/30/19, these job openings were up 19% YoverY, and remain near all-time highs since Co. began tracking data several years ago.</p><p>2. Amazon continues to actively hire in Washington State, where it has approx. 11,500 job openings.</p><p>3. Venture capital financial remains at record levels in Bay Area this past year, with about $60b committed and Co.'s markets accounted for 62% of all US venture capital funding.</p><p>1. San Francisco led all US markets in VC funding the past year with almost $42b invested, followed by Silicon Valley with almost $19b invested; the highest levels recorded over past 20 years.</p><p>4. Unparalleled access to skilled workers and growth capital continue to attract entrepreneurs to West Coast.</p><p>5. Recent IPOs of Uber, Lyft, Slack and Pinterest should catalyze growth given greater access to capital and improved liquidity.</p><p>1. They join other publicly traded tech companies; many of which continued to expand in Bay Area.</p><p>1. Google was actively buying or leasing additional office space in San Francisco and Silicon Valley communities of Mountain View, Sunnyvale and San Jose.</p><p>2. In San Mateo County, Facebook and YouTube expanded in San Bruno, Burlingame and Menlo Park.</p><p>2. Believes that a stronger IPO market will likely drive other long-term benefits to local economies.</p><p>3. By one estimate, several recent IPOs have created 6,000 millionaires, which will ultimately unlock previously in liquid equity positions.</p><p>1. At some point, some of that wealth will likely be redeployed, which will increase consumption and set stage for new start-ups down the road.</p><p>6. Strong labor market, shortages of skilled workers and low unemployment rates continue to push incomes higher.</p><p>1. Weighted avg. unemployment rate was 2.9% as of May.</p><p>1. Median household income grew an avg. of 5.3%.</p><p>7. With market rents growing in 3% range, rental affordability continues to improve in all markets.</p><p>3. Apartment supply:</p><p>1. Delay-adjusted estimate of around 36,000 apartment deliveries in Co.'s markets in 2019 has not changed.</p><p>1. Expects a similar level of deliveries in 2020 albeit with some meaningful regional variations.</p><p>4. Investment Markets:</p><p>1. Outlook has much improved relative to conditions experienced in 2018.</p><p>2. Significantly lower interest rates and strong equity markets have substantially improved cost of capital.</p><p>3. In 2018, Co. was a net seller of apartments using proceeds to reinvest in development, preferred equity and to fund stock repurchases.</p><p>4. Co. is mostly focused on acquisitions and preferred equity investments.</p><p>1. Pleased to announce another accretive acquisition this qtr., which was a high-quality property in a market Co. knows well.</p><p>2. At this point, hopes to exceed high end of acquisition guidance range of $400m.</p><p>3. Overall, market conditions for acquisitions have not changed much this year, despite dramatic reduction in interest rates.</p><p>1. Apartment buyers continue to target value-add opportunities, which results in greater competition for these deals that leads to compression in cap rate spreads between value-add and core properties; even newer properties are being marketed, with a claim of a value-add component.</p><p>2. In this environment, remains focused on disciplined underwriting process with market selection and timing, Co.'s primary concern.</p><p>3. Disposition activity on other hand will likely end up below low end of $300-500m guidance range, given improved cost of capital.</p><p>5. Summary:</p><p>1. Shortages in construction labor force continue to cause development delays in Co.'s pipeline and more broadly.</p><p>2. Combination of long entitlement processes in coastal markets at a time when construction costs are growing significantly faster than NOI compresses development yields.</p><p>1. For these reasons, believes that preferred equity investments in apartment development deals generally offer superior risk-adjusted returns over direct development.</p><p>2Q19 Operational Review (J.B.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. Starting 2H19 with strong momentum, achieving [3.5%] revenue growth in 2Q.</p><p>2. Financial occupancy for same-store portfolio was 96.6%; down:</p><p>1. 10 BP YoverY.</p><p>2. 30 BP QoverQ.</p><p>3. Market rents, an avg. of 3.4%.</p><p>1. Up YoverY, setting Co. in a favorable position as ESS locked down peak market rents.</p><p>4. Turnover 46.4% on a trailing 12-month basis.</p><p>1. Down 3.2% from comparable period ending 2Q18.</p><p>5. Although there are some pockets of weakness in supply interest in local market offering large concessions, West Coast markets overall are performing above original expectation, largely driven by better employment growth in Bay Area.</p><p>1. Thereby, raising same-store gross revenue guidance for full year 25 BP to midpoint of 3.3%.</p><p>6. Third-party economic research estimates for Co.'s market rent growth continues to be inaccurate.</p><p>1. One vendor stated that June 2019 rents were up only 40 BP YoverY; when in reality, they were up 3.8%.</p><p>2. Strategically, Co. will continue to favor achieving market rents over higher occupancy, taking advantage of strong market conditions to lock in higher rents.</p><p>7. Regarding new multifamily supply, pace of deliveries in Co.'s markets remains in line with delay-adjusted forecast Co. introduced last fall.</p><p>1. Maintaining estimate of roughly 36,000 apartment units this year, which is consistent with 2018 volumes.</p><p>2. Estimates remain below third-party projections.</p><p>1. But expects additional construction delays in 2H19 to bring third-party figures down closer to forecast.</p><p>8. Construction remains concentrated in a handful of urban core submarkets led this year by downtowns of Los Angeles and Oakland.</p><p>9. Deliveries remain elevated in Seattle, but strong job growth is supporting rapid absorption of new units.</p><p>1. Pace of new deliveries in Seattle is poised to decelerate in 2020.</p><p>10. Beyond 2020, Co. would highlight that new multifamily permits in Co.'s markets are down 11% YoverY on trailing 12-month basis, suggesting that near-term pace of deliveries represents a plateau followed by gradual deceleration of new supply growth.</p><p>2. Seattle:</p><p>1. Employment growth continues to outpace US and other major East Coast markets posting YoverY growth of 2.9%.</p><p>2. Amazon job openings remain at peak levels, while office absorption stored in 2Q as large deals were delivered and occupied.</p><p>3. Each of Co.'s four submarkets North, South, Seattle CBD and East side performed well, growing revenues between 3.2-4.5%.</p><p>3. Northern California:</p><p>1. Job growth in San Francisco Bay Area averaged 2.5% YoverY, led by San Francisco at 3.7% growth.</p><p>1. Continued expansion in Bay Area is evident in recent IPOs at sustained highs in VC funding.</p><p>2. Started two lease-ups.</p><p>1. Mylo, a 476-unit property in Santa Clara is 22% pre-leased, offering one-month free rent.</p><p>2. Station Park Green - Phase II with 199 units in San Mateo is 24% leased, offering concessions up to six weeks.</p><p>3. Started pre-leasing 500 Folsom with 537 units in downtown San Francisco scheduled for initial occupancy in 3Q19.</p><p>4. YoverY same-store revenue growth was strong on Peninsula submarkets with San Francisco achieving 5.9%, San Mateo achieving 4.4%, followed by San Jose at 3.9% and Fremont with 3.6%.</p><p>5. San Ramon and Oakland CBD came in at 2.4% and 2% growth, respectively, YoverY.</p><p>4. Southern California:</p><p>1. Continues to perform at lower end of Co.'s markets, largely due to lower employment growth.</p><p>2. Region and LA County each achieved 1.3% YoverY job growth; in line with jobs forecast.</p><p>1. Revenue growth was led by:</p><p>1. Woodland Hills with 5.2%.</p><p>2. Long Beach with 4.7%.</p><p>3. West LA at 4.4%.</p><p>4. Tri-Cities with 2.1%.</p><p>2. LA CBD revenues down 2.2%, due to supply impact with downtown lease ups offering 6-8 weeks free rent, plus other incentives, like free parking.</p><p>3. Orange County:</p><p>1. Jobs ticked up 1.2% YoverY.</p><p>2. Revenue growth in North Orange submarket achieved 3.3% growth, while South Orange submarket achieved 1.8% growth YoverY.</p><p>4. San Diego:</p><p>1. YoverY job growth was 1.6%.</p><p>1. 10 BP higher [than US].</p><p>2. Ocean side submarket continues to lead San Diego market in YoverY revenues, achieving 4.8% growth, followed by North City and Chula Vista submarkets with 3.6% and 2.6% growth, respectively.</p><p>3. Currently, portfolio is at 96.2% occupancy and Co.'s availability 30 days out is 5.2%.</p><p>2Q19 Financial Review (A.K.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. Core FFO per share $3.33.</p><p>1. Represents YoverY growth rate of 6.1%.</p><p>2. Result exceeded high end of guidance and represents $0.11 [beat] to midpoint.</p><p>2. Key components of aforementioned outperformance:</p><p>1. $0.03 from same property revenues.</p><p>2. $0.03 from lower interest expense, non-same-store revenue, and other miscellaneous items.</p><p>3. $0.05 from property tax savings and refunds, primarily from lower Seattle millage rates for 2019.</p><p>1. This is contrary to Co.'s experience from past several years, where Seattle property tax increase had been in mid-double-digit range.</p><p>3. Favorable YTD results enabled Co. to increase midpoint of same-property revenues 25 BP, while benefits from tax savings and refunds enable Co. to lower midpoint of same-property expenses 80 BP.</p><p>1. Combination of these revisions results in full-year same-property NOI growth of 3.7% at midpoint.</p><p>1. 65 BP higher than initial outlook.</p><p>2. Near high end of original guidance range.</p><p>4. Raising core FFO per share guidance for second time this year.</p><p>1. Raising full-year core FFO per share $0.20 to $13.28 at midpoint.</p><p>1. Approx. $0.13 of this raise relate to improved NOI expectations.</p><p>2. Remaining $0.07 comes from a combination of lower interest expense, acquisitions and preferred equity investments made to-date.</p><p>5. On preferred equity investments, exceeded high end of guidance of $100m, primarily due to larger deal size in this year's transactions.</p><p>2. Balance Sheet:</p><p>1. In 2H19, Co. has around $100m of debt maturities.</p><p>1. Has ability to prepay $290m of debt, which matures in 2020, without incurring any prepayment penalty.</p><p>2. Will continue to be opportunistic as Co. considers refinancing alternative to optimize cost of capital.</p><p>3. Has approx. $1b available to Co. in $1.2b lines of credit.</p><p>4. Leverage level remains conservative at 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Our next question comes from the line of Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank.</p><p>TRENT NATHAN TRUJILLO, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: So the same-store revenue guidance range was very nice to see. You brought up the low end of the range. So Mike, with the positive market conditions you cited, how much consideration did you give to adjusting the top end of the range?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: I'll start with that and then maybe Angela will have a comment. Obviously, we hit the top end of the range in Northern California, but we were pretty close to the midpoint or a little bit above the midpoint in the other markets, and so we thought there was plenty of room within the range, so we didn't need to move it. We cannot move rents super quickly because we have to turn the leases. And in the second half of the year, we turned fewer leases than we do in the first half of the year, so I think the guidance range is appropriate where it is now. Angela, do you have anything to add?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: We had guided to a tougher first half and a lighter second half originally with the midpoint at 3. And given where the first half came in, certainly, we are comfortable with where our guidance range is at this point. But having said that, keep in mind that the second half now will contemplate heavier supply, and so in that environment, it didn't make sense for us to raise the high end of the guidance range.</p><p>TRENT NATHAN TRUJILLO: Okay. I appreciate the commentary there. John, you mentioned turnover keeps improving on a year-over-year basis? How long is that sustainable and is there a level of turnover at which point you say you'll start implementing larger wage increases?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART, SENIOR EVP OF ASSET MANAGEMENT, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: Well, as far as the rental increases, we are very focused on our customers being fair and -- in their entire experience, which of course, includes what they pay. So we typically will not raise rents above the marketplace. That's effectively set in the marketplace. As far as how low can turnover go, I would love to see it continue to go lower. I think what's driving the lower turnover at this point in time are a combination of factors, one of them being the fact that our assets are well located, of course, they always have been. So that hasn't changed but what does change is the quality of life in many of the metros. The traffic continues to increase and as it increases, it makes our assets better relatively than other options. So that is one angle.</p><p>Another angle is we continue to focus on customer experience at the site, and we do have room to continue to improve that. We will continue to work on making all of our customers have the best experience possible. And finally, affordability overall, in all of our markets continues to improve, as incomes grows significantly faster than rents and so it's putting a lot less pressure on people to move for financial reasons, whether it's further away from their jobs or it's other areas. So I do think there's some continued room to run. I think it works best for both our customers and ourselves to have lower turnover. So we're pretty pleased with it.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It sounds as if we're seeing more attractive acquisition opportunities than we've seen versus the recent past. You mentioned you may exceed the high end of acquisition guidance. So how large is the acquisition pipeline today?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Nick, it's Mike. The acquisition pipeline is - it is pretty decent, I would say that the fact that we're going to exceed the high end of the range is more a function of not having a real aggressive high end of the range given conditions at the beginning of the year, which we had a much higher cost to capital. And as we fast-forward to today, interest rates have declined pretty dramatically, and there's a lot more interest in property. So I think it's more a function of there's enough deals out there and our pipeline is a few hundred million, but there's no guarantee we're going to close all or even some of those deals. But we are much more in the hunt this year. Again, if you go back to last year, we were unable -- to make the numbers work, we were selling property. We're a net seller of property. Selling property at 8th &amp; Hope in downtown L.A., for example, for a sub-4 cap rate and buying stock back, the conditions are so much different. So we are back much more interested in the acquisition market.</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH: And then just maybe on the funding side. Historically, you've been pretty active on issuing or repurchasing shares, it makes sense. Looks like for most of the second quarter you are trading above consensus NAV, so given that acquisition pipeline and kind of, say, uses for net capital, so I think you're issuing the ATM equities in the second quarter?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Angela will have an answer to this, but I'll start. I mean the simple answer is, that we're -- debt to market cap is about 22%. So we just don't need to deleverage the balance sheet. In fact, we don't have any interest at all in deleveraging the balance sheet further. And we feel like we've managed it to where we want to be sort of late in a economic cycle. And so we're perfectly comfortable with where it is now and in fact could increase leverage a little bit. Not that we're necessarily planning to do that, but we feel comfortable doing that. Angela, do you want to add to that?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Sure thing. Nick, in terms of the equity issuance activities, if you look at our acquisitions to date, we really didn't have a need because that was acquired via a down structure and the preferred equity investments, they fund over time inevitably and so the funding need is very small. But generally speaking, in addition to Mike's comment on our leverage level, we do vote to match fund our investments relative to the cost of capital to optimize that yield. And so even though our stock may, at any given point in time, be trading at above consensus NAV, we will still look for ways to make sure that, that funding is the most attractive. And we have, as you know, several alternatives to how we can fund an investment. And so it may or may not be the common equity issuance as the first thing.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.</p><p>AUSTIN TODD WURSCHMIDT, VP, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Mike, you mentioned you view preferred equity today as a more attractive risk-adjusted return versus development, so I'm just curious what it would take for you to restart the development pipeline? Or what spread maybe you'd need between cap rates to justify the risks you see today?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, Austin, it's a good question. And again, the driving dynamic there is that construction costs are growing faster than rents, in general, and with entitlement processes in California stretching out 3 to 5 years in many cases, you end up in a potential for lower yields on development than you otherwise have. I contrast that with the preferred equity where we're coming in just before the start of construction. So that all of that predevelopment period is in the past, and we're coming in starting construction in the next day. And so the risk-reward equation is much different.</p><p>Having said that, we looked at a lot of development transactions, and so it's not for not trying to make them work. We just have been pretty selective given where we are -- our perception where we are in the economic cycle and the risk-reward equation. And to get us interested in direct development, we would like to see between 100 to 150 basis point cap rate premium to stabilize yields, which were A quality property, let's say, around 4% right now. So we'll be looking for that, and again, looking at the risk profile of what the entitlement process looks like, how long it's going to be and some of those other considerations in terms of our direct development appetite.</p><p>AUSTIN TODD WURSCHMIDT: Okay. Appreciate the thoughts there. And then just second for me. You discussed 2020 supply is going to be -- or is projected at this point to be at similar level as 2019, but you did mention there's some variations in where that supply is concentrated. Could you just give us a little more detail of some of the moving parts by region?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Sure, of course. Our research team goes and drives all -- most of these sites, and so we have really good intelligence. And as John mentioned, some of the data vendors have much different numbers for multifamily supply projections, and we think our numbers have proven pretty accurate. So really kudos to the economic research team for that. But -- so as you point out, yes, we have about 36,000 units in 2019 and about the same number in 2020. The big movers are number one, in Orange County, which goes down about 40%. And actually, San Jose goes up about 40%. It's not a tremendous number. Units goes from 2,700 units to 3,800 units. And Oakland will go up about that same percentage, and then we will -- and then Seattle goes down about 1/3 2,900 units. So those are the driving forces and again, it nets out to about 0 increase.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Shirley Wu with Bank of America.</p><p>SHIRLEY WU, RESEARCH ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: So John, earlier in your call you -- and even previously, you mentioned that this year you've been emphasizing more of a rate growth drive rather than occupancy and occupancy actually was down 10 basis points compared to what you would have imagined with the 20 basis points you mentioned earlier this year. So I was wondering what's going on there in terms of the strong demand that you're seeing? And is that going to continue into the rest of the year? Or do you just continue to expect that occupancy to come down to that 20 basis points that you mentioned previously?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Sure. So the simple answer is yes for the year I expect it to tick down 20 basis points to somewhere it was last year but within that a little bit more detail. So yes, as I've mentioned earlier, the supply picture, there's more supply that is coming onto the market in the second half. It's about an increase of about 25%. And it is my expectation because seasonally, demand goes down just a normal aspect of our market. So as the supply increases and demand slightly decreases just because of seasonal factors, I think there'll be an increase in concessions and that will cause us, at the end of the day, to compete harder by either offering concessions at some of the stabilized assets or increasing what we're doing or allowing some things to go vacant longer. At the end of the day, I expect that there'll just be a little bit more pressure. And that's part of the answer as to why we increased guidance where we did, and we're comfortable with it.</p><p>SHIRLEY WU: Great. And moving on to the CapEx side, I noticed that in 2Q it was slightly higher than your usual run rate and I was wondering if that -- if I can get a little bit more color and if that was a onetime thing and how we should expect CapEx to trend for the rest of the year?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Sure. Yes, the original guidance anticipated an increase to -- in the 1,600-unit range and I expect that to be closer to a run rate than where we were. There is numerous factors that have -- that drive this. The same factors that drive the increase in development cost that we talk about on a regular basis: increased labor and materials cost. So that's the big factor and then, of course, some of the newer buildings with the systems and other things that we have that we bought and built, they also typically run higher in CapEx as on a per-unit basis, not a percentage, but a per-unit basis.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.</p><p>RICHARD ALLEN HIGHTOWER, MD &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I've got a two-parter on affordability here. So I heard the stat, Mike that you put out in terms of affordability in rent growth and income growth. I'm wondering if you're actually seeing affordability improve empirically in terms of the new leases that you're signing? If you're noticing that in sort of the screening mechanism? And then separately from that, we've started to see home values and home prices in the Bay Area maybe roll over a little bit, maybe in other West Coast markets as well. Is there any readthrough on affordability related to that or is that sort of a separate issue?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Those are all great questions. It's hard to get down to a very granular level on this affordability issue. Yes, we've been tracking this for the better part of 30 years now. And it's one of those market indicators, they are kind of bigger-picture indicators that we know is really important. And by that, I would say, let me give you a couple of statistics. So between 2010 and 2015, we had 20% higher rent growth versus household income growth. So we had rent growth that dramatically exceeded household income growth, and I think that caused some of the concerns that we've had, and we've been talking about this affordability issue for the last couple of years largely because of that, that statistic. And then from -- if I look at it from 2010 to now that 20% higher rent growth and household incomes is now 13%. So we've actually moved the needle pretty significantly as it relates to that rent-to-income ratio. So I think that is incredibly important and I think it's one of the things that we would put on the top couple of considerations for these markets.</p><p>We have grown rents very substantially over long periods of time. I think between 2012 to 2017 our same-store revenue has gone up by about -- by an average of 7% per year. So that's a lot of growth and as we know, incomes were pretty stagnant coming out of the financial crisis. And so we, again, think that is a really important issue.</p><p>As it relates to home prices, which as you point out, I think they are down 6% in San Jose and up about 3% in San Francisco and everything else -- all of our other metrics are between those 2 numbers. And I guess what I would say is the year before was exactly the opposite, we had exceptional home price growth, and I think there's a lagging indicator here with respect to interest rates. So I don't think you have seen home prices recover given pretty significantly lower interest rates. So I would expect these home price numbers to get better from this point on just given mortgage rates.</p><p>RICHARD ALLEN HIGHTOWER: Okay. I think that's helpful color. My second one here maybe is a follow-on topic. You care to opine at this point in the calendar on the Rental Affordability Act that is, I think, currently gathering signatures as far as the ballot initiative for next year?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. We keep track of it. And for those that don't know what that is, it's essentially the industry is calling it Prop. 10 2.0, and where there's a potential for a ballot proposition that would amend Costa-Hawkins in -- on the 2020 ballot, and there's been a certain amount of money that has being contributed by Michael Weinstein to support a signature-gathering effort. It's, I think, too early to tell exactly where that's going, Rich. We obviously track it pretty carefully, and we kept our entity California's for Responsible Housing alive and well and organized in case of this. So we'll wait and see what happens and because there's also the Assembly Bill 1482, which is the state-wide rent control law, which started out as an anti-gouging type of proposal, and it's currently in the Senate. And it would cap rents at CPI plus 7, at least that's the current proposal. Again, it's in the Senate, it could still be modified from here.</p><p>But I think that, that is pretty indicative of a better balance with respect to the discussion on housing on the need for housing in California, again, going back to the governor's campaign, campaigning on producing 3.5 million homes in California by 2025. That's about 600,000 a year. By way of background, we produced about 80,000 a year for the last 10 years on average. And so he has recognized the need for more housing and at the same time, trying to balance that with the protection of the tenant base as well. So think it's a more balance discussion. And I think that we will have to see where these things come. You're going to see action on AB 1482 long before you see -- get an update on what might happen with respect to Prop. 10 2.0.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR REIT ANALYST, SANDLER O'NEILL + PARTNERS, L.P., RESEARCH DIVISION: Mike, maybe just following up that last question on the whole rent control and discussion on California, are you seeing any seepage of what happened here in New York where the restrictions in -- the regulation that was passed when they renewed rent control are still onerous but it actually discourages landlords and housing. Are you seeing any of that creep into the California political landscape where California wouldn't want to be outmaneuvered by New York? Or is it -- or is Sacramento is sort of being led by Governor Newsom that wants to promote housing and is more cognizant of factors or legislation that would inhibit that?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: It's a good question, Alex, and thank you for that. I guess in New York, my perception is that all happened very suddenly. And there was a proposal and it was passed almost before people could have time to properly react to it and understand the unintended consequences of it. Whereas, I think it's different in California because we've had this dialogue going back to the Prop. 10 discussion a year ago. And in so doing, this dialogue of -- regarding rent control in general has been ongoing. And again, this is why I think the governor, his comments are so important noting -- another thing he noted was that there's a perverse incentive not to produce housing in California for a variety of reasons. And again, he's recognizing the need for balance in that equation. And so I think we have a better discussion here, and I think that it's been fought through at a greater level than probably it has in some of the other states around the countries.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Okay. And then moving to Seattle or actually Bellevue, specifically, with all the investment that Amazon is doing in Bellevue and focusing their office development there, are you guys sort of reassessing how you want to play the Seattle market? Do you think that we would see you guys do more investment in Bellevue, or maybe your existing footprint, you're happy with where it is based on the growth that Amazon is looking at for Bellevue?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: It all depends on yields and risk. We love Bellevue, we love Downtown Seattle. I'd say, in general, we're becoming more suburban focused than urban focused because of a number of issues. There's more supply in the urban core. I'd say actually both with respect to office development, but also with respect to apartment development. And so trying to avoid the cities that are having these large concessions because you got 3, 4, 5 lease-ups competing with one another at the same time. So it's difficult to project forward that far. These concessions literally change on a weekly basis. And so I think our strategy is evolving to, hey, let's just try to avoid the areas that have massive development given that the rent growth in those areas has been suppressed for pretty long periods of time now. So we will continue to monitor and I can't predict whether Bellevue or Seattle is going to -- which one's going to outperform until we're a lot closer to looking at a deal.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON, MD, HEAD OF REAL ESTATE RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: John, you talked about the development pipeline and concessions earlier. When you layer on new supply and stuff that was completed a year ago that might be having it's first renewal, the 5 developments that you either currently have in lease-up or will in the next quarter or so, are any of those of a concern in terms of concessions that you guys think that you're going to need to lease them up? I think you said Mylo was currently 1 month free, and then I think it was Station Green, the first phase was 6 weeks, anything that's going to be outside of that sort of range?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Well, let me give a broad answer there. So when we are a delivered vacant unit, we're greatly incented, and this is really why it's logical, why many of the developers are doing what they're doing as far as free rent. It's not a matter that the market is weak. It's a matter that they're trying to drive a significant amount of absorption fast because your option 1 is vacant unit, option 2 is a lower net effective with a qualified resident and getting cash flow. So we have the same economics there, and of course, it's different when we own the asset. I mean when we have -- for same-store assets right, but we are one of those players on the development. So what we try to do is look for what works best in the marketplace and what the consumers are looking for and react to that. So I expect we'll increase our concessions over time. It's within our plan to do that because it usually happens as we get into the fourth quarter. But we make these decisions literally daily and definitely we do it intensely weekly. So we'll just follow it. But all of our -- you can tell by the pre-leasing performance the markets are strong, and we feel very good about all of our developments where they're at.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON: Any of them facing extreme new supplies, Mike was alluding to before?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: No, we're not in -- at this point, we're not in situations where we have extreme combat.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON: Okay. And then Angela, if I look at the same-store expense growth year-to-date, 2.9%, sort of implies the low 1s for the back half of '19. Is that all on property taxes, or is there something else that's going to drive same-store expenses down to the low 1% range for the back half of 2019?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Yes. You're right. It's actually mostly driven by property taxes. So between the millage rate coming in lower than expected and we, of course, have some refunds that we're recognizing in the second half. Those are the key -- 2 key drivers.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON: Okay. And if I could squeeze one more in. Maybe other than market concentration, what's keeping you guys at a BBB+ from the rating agencies versus an A-, like Avalon and Equity?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Believe it or not, it's really market concentration. That's the key driver. Yes, I think the rating agencies are so focused on the number of states versus the relevance and -- of the actual state. I mean California as we all know has -- is like the third-largest GDP and incredibly diverse and large. Having said that, I think just the fact that it's one state is what's tough for the rating agencies to underwrite.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.</p><p>KARIN ANN FORD, SENIOR REAL ESTATE ANALYST, MUFG SECURITIES AMERICAS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Google announced it was looking to develop about $15 billion of real estate in the Bay Area with lend lease. Sounds like a significant chunk of that is earmarked for residential. Do you see this as a significant medium- to long-term supply threat that could be large enough to potentially affect rent growth -- market rent growth in the region?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, this is Mike. There are -- they're not alone. Microsoft has a program. I think Stanford University has some discussions about mainly student housing, but there are some other proposals of corporations getting involved in housing. It remains difficult to figure out exactly what's going to happen in the short term. I don't think there'll be any actually short-term impact. These are mostly over longer periods of time. And I think a lot of the corporate housing is probably strategically important to them in their hiring given that one of the key reasons not to come to the Bay Area is concern over housing and housing price. So if you can assure someone that's relocating to the Bay Area that they have a home I think that's a major positive in the hiring process. Overall, I don't think that any of this given the cost of housing and the size of these programs, I don't think it's going to have a material impact on the markets, but again, we'll face that down the road a ways.</p><p>KARIN ANN FORD: Got it. And my second question is going back to your development pipeline, you've got an extraordinary amount of lease-up development coming in the Bay Area in the next 6 quarters, including 500 Folsom, and you talked today a lot about the strong environment of those markets. Do you think your yields on those could outperform your underwriting? And can you share where the deals are penciling today?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: I think that we've talked about stabilized yields a little bit and maybe I'll echo those comments. Stabilizing somewhere in the 5.5 range and this is not today. This -- and it won't be next year, but it will be a couple years out. As you can imagine, development deals have, for example, retail components and the retail components are important because you don't want to have -- a lot of people don't want to move into a construction project. So you want all of that construction to be done. So that yield is a few years out. And so I think that for the next year or so you'll see some positive increment, but not dramatic.</p><p>KARIN ANN FORD: And is that 5.5 yield number on trended rents or on rents today?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: No. On stabilized rents.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Baird.</p><p>ANDREW T. BABIN, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: A quick follow-on question on the lease-up properties coming in getting delayed. Did that explicitly cause an increase to the FFO guidance where some of these properties you might have some initial drag obviously taking on new expenses mid-lease-up that might now occur early next year? Is there any kind of dynamic there in '19 versus '20 with those development projects getting pushed up?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Yes. Drew, on the FFO guidance, the delay impact, which ultimately I think you're looking at the higher capitalized interest on our S-14. It's a couple of pennies, let's say</p><p>$0.02. And -- for this year. So what that means is, of course, some of that dilution is going to get pushed next year as we continue the lease-up. But I think the one positive is that this dilution instead of being as concentrated as we thought that would occur this year, it'll be more moderated and it'll just occur over time similar to the impact of supply delivery that if they all come at once, it's obviously much tougher to digest. If they happen more ratably over time, it's much more manageable.</p><p>ANDREW T. BABIN: Okay. And I guess one more topic kind of related to the corporate housing question. Should some of these projects really, the rubber meet the road and some of them get entitled, some of them proceed, would Essex under the right economic conditions ever consider partnering with one of the corporations in some kind of project? And I guess what would you need to see for that to make sense for Essex?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Drew, this is Mike. A lot of these corporate housing entities have -- or proposals have included an RFP-type process, and so there might be some opportunity to work with some of these companies. And there'll be -- they'll be exposed more broadly to the development communities. So it probably isn't going to be just us, and it will be several projects over periods of time. So I'd say too early to tell exactly what it means. And again, we track pretty closely, as you know, the total amount of competing properties that's going to be entering the rental pool down the road. So if we saw the huge impact, I think during the construction period, it gives us time to react as well. So what exactly would those terms be, we work in a joint venture on many development deals and their -- the markets for those terms, depending upon what side you're on, change over time. And we're looking actually at some joint venture development deals as we speak.</p><p>They're complicated enough that I don't think I can reduce them to magnitude. We're going to look more broadly at the yield premiums that -- to acquisitions and measure today with market rents today that I talked about a little while ago. And whether we do it as a joint venture or ourselves, really is a function of how much risk is there upfront in the deal, how much money do we have to spec and how long a period of time do we have to spec it in the predevelopment period before we begin construction and every deal is a bit different.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY, ASSOCIATE, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: John, looking at that slide you put in last quarter, you had one about the permits falling quite a bit. I'm trying to use that slide to have good supply data. I'm wondering if you guys can give us some insight on when you think peak supply will be in your markets. It looks like next year will be comparable, but is it going to be the same thing in 2022 as well -- in 2021?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes. No, this is John. Our expectation is it starts to tick down. So as I mentioned, we're really at a plateau right now, and we expect it slowly starts to tick down going after next year. So yes, to put it that way, we're at peak supply right now.</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY: Okay. Fantastic. And then when we looked at those permits, I mean, they're falling quite a bit. Construction was to start probably the middle of last year. Is that mainly due to the cost that you cite where the rents are not growing fast enough? Or do you think the political uncertainty is also having a big factor in that?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: I think...</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Both. Yes, Both.</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes, Yes, I mean...</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: It's all the above. It's how much risk do you take and what types of yield are you expecting, how you're getting compensated for that risk. And I'd say, maybe adding to that is the project sizes are getting bigger and bigger and the cost per unit is -- has increased pretty dramatically. So you need more equity in a lot of these deals. And as we see this in the preferred equity environment where in that predevelopment period, costs are going up faster than rents and when we come in with preferred equity sometimes these deals are short of equity given cost increases. And that's causing some delays there. So it's all this. But, yes, it all involves the relationship between construction cost and development yields.</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY: Okay. And one final one if I may. Do you have the new and renewal leasing for the quarter and your most -- your loss to lease?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Sure. I can give that to you. So the new leases for the quarter -- second quarter were up 3.4% year-over-year or prior year's quarter and the renewals in Q2 came in at 4.4% year-over-prior year. And loss to lease you asked, we're at 3.5%, which at this point in time because of seasonality, it's going to be the high point, so I'll compare it to last June. So last June, we're at 3.3%. So it's about 20 basis points better than last year. And within that, SoCal has ticked down some, so it's a 2% loss to lease and NorCal and Seattle have gone up. So NorCal is 4.6% and Seattle is up 5%, all average rate is 3.5% for June.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON, RESEARCH ANALYST, SMBC NIKKO SECURITIES INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So I recall many years ago, you guys were kind enough to offer a 10% cap on annual rent increases. And I'm wondering obviously that's a moot point today. And Mike, I'm asking is that situation of excessive rent growth fundamentally over in your opinion in your markets, or is it simply supply and that has to kind of readjust where you could get there, or is there the political side that if you dare to go there, again, that you get -- you reignite sort of the rent control conversation to a higher level?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, Rich, it's a good question. I think where we are in the cycle is probably a key consideration there. You tend to get more rent growth when you go through a recessionary period, there's very little development, and so jobs start growing and you end up with a supply-demand imbalance for housing and you can push rents more aggressively than we can now. Now being constrained primarily by income growth and affordability-type issues. So as it relates to the 10%, you're exactly correct. We internally capped our renewals at 10% for many years while when we had much more robust rent growth. And we would do it, again. I think it's number one, the right thing to do, but I also am always concerned about -- we are always concerned about the impact on local regulators, et cetera. For example, when residents get a very large rent increase, they often go into the City Hall and tell the local officials about these huge rent increases, and we get phone calls and pushback almost immediately. And in fact, in some cases, in connection with CAA and some of the rental groups, we take part in trying to mediate some of these situations. So I think, it's just a good practice to cap renewal rents at 10% and it's something that we've done and we would do again.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON: Okay. Great. And then on your earlier comments on office development, we found interesting as I usually do, but wondering if you guys also track preleasing of that office development, which is really where the rubber meets the road as it relates to future demand for multifamily, there could be some stupid development in there?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Rich, it for sure will -- can change, but eventually, I think those office buildings we would all agree, will be completed. So yes, you're right. In the short term, absorption really matters. In the longer term, the fact that the property exists is probably what matters more. John, do you want to comment?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes, and I'll just add in. The developments on the West Coast overall that Mike was referencing, they're about 75% preleased on average across the market. So huge preleasing going on. That is the nature of most office development these days. They typically have a big portion of their tenants before they break ground. At least in our markets.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: And let me end with one final comment, Rich, and that is we're always concerned that people are going to find California less desirable and some of the tech jobs move to Boston, for example. So again, the fact that big investments are being made in our markets is really important to us. We view that as sort of a leading indicator. What are the tech companies doing. Can -- everyone's concerned about migration out of California. We're concerned about it as well. Again, we try to couple together a number of sort of leading indicators to give us some sense of what decisions are being made by developers and some of the big tech companies.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.</p><p>JOHN JOSEPH PAWLOWSKI, ANALYST, GREEN STREET ADVISORS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Angela, could you remind us what you're expecting for property taxes in Seattle, property tax growth rate to be this year? And are the favorable reassessments do you think it's the beginning of a multi-year trend, the fever finally breaking in Seattle?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Well, on the tax piece, we're expecting the full year to come in at the midpoint around, say, in the high 1%. So say, 1.7%, 1.8-ish somewhere around there. In terms of the trend, boy, that's a tough one. I wish I had that crystal ball. It's interesting because in the past 3 years, our Seattle property tax has gone up between, say, 15%. I think it was 15% for 2 years and 17% for one of those 3 years. And this year, it was a decrease. And so that -- and we actually didn't budget the 15%, but I certainly didn't budget a decrease. So I'm not entirely sure what's going to happen next year. I think we're going to just try to take a best estimate, talk to our consultants and get some advice on that. But if you have a better solution, by all means, please call me.</p><p>JOHN JOSEPH PAWLOWSKI: I guess the shorter question is, was there anything lumpy onetime benefits this year that won't persist in Seattle?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Nothing significant. We have some refunds, but they are -- those numbers are not big enough to drive year-over-year comp.</p><p>JOHN JOSEPH PAWLOWSKI: Okay. And Mike, on the regulatory front in Washington, what are your political contacts saying about 2020 legislative session and rent control chatter gaining steam again in Washington?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: I don't have any recent information on that. So I don't -- I haven't heard of any major movement in Washington at this point in time.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Hardik Goel with Zelman &amp; Associates.</p><p>HARDIK GOEL, VP OF RESEARCH, ZELMAN &amp; ASSOCIATES LLC: Congrats on the strong quarter and the guidance raise. I just had a couple of questions for you. The first one on a comment I think John made. So permits are declining year-over-year across your markets, but the delay environment that's persisted, do you think there's risk that even though supply is plateauing now and it's kind of getting smoothed out with consistent delays that there's still this pipeline of supply that is started but not yet completed or maybe stuck in predevelopment that already has been permitted in past quarters that will continue to dribble out supply even beyond 2020, early 2021 and onwards? And my second one is easier. Sorry, you go ahead, I'll ask it afterwards.</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes. No, just to say, so again, as we've said, we literally drive all the different sites. We take down from a process perspective, we have multiple vendors providing information as to permits that are obtained, sites that are started, et cetera. And then we have a mobile program where our people drive all the sites and upload information into the cloud as to where they're at, what's going on, and we clean up that data quite a bit and reconcile what we get from the vendors to what we see on the streets. So I think we have our hands around what's going on really well, probably better than most. And so that's what's in construction right now. And then the permits we reconciled, the permits to the actual as built and obviously there's typically some leakage going back the other way, things -- more things get permitted than actually get billed for various reasons. But at the end of the day, I think we have our hands around it pretty good. I think we're, at this point in time, supply has plateaued. We'll start to see it tick down, and it would take something else, like increasing rents or something to change the picture. But as Mike has said many times, construction costs are growing faster than rents, so at this point, it looks like we've hit the peak.</p><p>HARDIK GOEL: That's very helpful. For my second one, just -- should be pretty straightforward, I guess. On the Seattle kind of tax savings, how much of that was just the market and it will probably benefit others who own assets there? And how much of that was something that was an Essex push where you have an appeals process or some kind of mechanism where you try to get a favorable appeal or saving?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Yes. That's a good question. It's mostly market-driven. So this is a Seattle millage rate assessment, and so it's assessed across the board. As far as the savings, we go through our refund process every year, and there's some benefit there, but that's not at all a key driver.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.</p><p>HAENDEL EMMANUEL ST. JUSTE, MD OF AMERICAS RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES USA LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mike, I guess I'll start with an oldie but goodie. What's your current view on the Essex footprint. California is not getting easier. Costs, taxes, regulation keep on increasing. Senior peers going to Denver. You'd once been in Portland, the weather is nice, and there's -- seems to be parity in Honolulu. So I'm curious if your view on your footprint here has changed or evolved at all and if so, how?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Well, Haendel, it's a good question, and it's probably the most essential and important question of all of them. And here we go through a process each year of reviewing strategy with our Board. And we kind of start with that very question, and we look at many major metros around the country and try to distill them down into a supply and demand and what it means. And so it's an ongoing question and an ongoing process here at Essex.</p><p>From where we ended up on this in the last year is, we think that the resiliency of the technology world is something that's going to probably be with us for several cycles. And that, along with the supply constrained nature of these markets and the difficulty of building here is going to keep a premium on housing. And there's this virtuous cycle of high cost of housing drives wages higher and which allows rents to go higher, which you see in very few places. And so we concluded and continue to conclude that we are well positioned in the West Coast markets.</p><p>HAENDEL EMMANUEL ST. JUSTE: And then, I guess, back to, I guess, the growth. As you very well know, it's very hard to buy in California. Not much trade and Prop. 13 being a clear headwind. So building is really the only gains for the multifamily guys and for growth in a Golden State. So I guess I'm curious if there's anything in your shadow or future pipeline that's penciling yet or getting close to penciling given the continued rent growth, notwithstanding the rising construction cost you guys have mentioned. And if so, where? And as an add-on to that maybe you can talk about potential interest in doing mixed-use development as well?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, it's a good question, and we do have some land inventory. There's a Phase 4 at Station Park Green, and there are a couple other smaller projects that are behind our current pipeline that we will likely be active on. And as I said earlier, we continue to look for development deals. And the challenge there, as we've stated earlier is that construction costs are growing faster than rents, which means we have to see a fairly quick period between when we're financially committed to when we start construction because that's the period of greatest exposure.</p><p>So it's pretty challenging, I would say. Again, we continue looking, and we have some deals that we are working on. Remains to be seen whether we move forward with them or not. So -- and again, transitioning over to the preferred equity where we don't have that upfront risk because we're not financially committed from when -- during the entitlement period from when the entitlement period starts until when you start construction, we come in at construction, and we eliminate that part of the risk.</p><p>And we've been very active in preferred equity, and we'll continue to do that. As Angela mentioned, we're above the top end of the range this year in terms of commitments there. So it's -- this is kind of a mosaic. We put the pieces together and every deal is unique unto itself, and we try to make decisions that make sense in the broader scheme of things. And it's hard to bring it down to kind of the larger trends because every deal is a little bit unique. So I would say that more of the same, that we will look at development deals whether they have a mixed-use component because obviously there are many deals that have mixed-use components. There are other -- actually other REITs and other landowners that are interested in having a multifamily component. There are no shortage of discussions out there, for sure. And we will look at all of the above and try to make good value decisions and make sure that -- I think the key part is that we're compensated for the risk that we take relative to our other opportunities.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session.

Wesley Keith Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division,VP &amp; Equity Research Analyst</p><p>OVERVIEW</p><p>Co. reported 2Q20 results.</p><p>PRESENTATION SUMMARY -</p><p>2Q20 Review (T.N.)</p><p>1. Overview:</p><p>1. Co. is in middle of largest global healthcare crisis in a century.</p><p>2. Economic downturn is most severe Co. has seen since Great Depression and on heels of longest expansion on record.</p><p>1. Social unrest is at a level Co. hasn't experienced since Vietnam and civil rights movement over 50 years ago.</p><p>2. It's been said but these are indeed unprecedented times.</p><p>3. Aforementioned events aren't just having an unprecedented impact on economic activity, but [determines] wealth distribution across industries in broader population.</p><p>4. For those companies and workers leveraged to virtual economy, they're actually doing quite well and some are even thriving.</p><p>1. For those companies and workers that operate in real economy of bricks and mortar like ADD, Co. is certainly feeling normal effects and then some of downturn.</p><p>2. For those companies and workers in travel, leisure and entertainment sectors among others, they are basically in shutdown.</p><p>5. Aforementioned sectors and others will undoubtedly need to be restructured over next few years.</p><p>1. Many companies will not survive and their employees, it's evenly temporarily furloughed for now and will join ranks of permanently unemployed over next several quarters.</p><p>2. Unfortunately those impacted by these events or most impacted by these events are those in lower paying service jobs and minority populations.</p><p>6. As a result, this downturn carries not just normal economic risk of prior recession, but a profound health, social and political risk that are likely to shake legs and of economic recovery.</p><p>1. All this was a sudden a quick downturn.</p><p>2. Timing and shape of recovery is hard to project and that presents unique challenge in managing Co.'s business and communicating expectations to shareholders.</p><p>7. Having said that, Co. will do its best to be as transparent and direct as possible as it tries to understand and gauge how current environment will play out in business in the months and quarters ahead.</p><p>2. Results:</p><p>1. As expected, 2Q was challenging qtr.</p><p>2. Core FFO growth was down almost 2%, driven by same-store revenue decline of almost 3% or [2.2%] if retail is excluded.</p><p>1. On sequential basis, from 1Q same-store revenue was down 4.5% or 3.9%, excluding retail.</p><p>3. Co. has no development completions or new development starts this qtr. and had no starts in so far YTD.</p><p>4. Raised over $100m in capital this qtr. at an avg. initial cost of 2.8%, with most of that coming from $600m of long 10-year bond deal at rate of around 2.5%.</p><p>5. Co.'s liquidity, balance sheet and credit metrics are very well positioned heading into this downturn.</p><p>6. Same-store residential revenue decline:</p><p>1. Decline was primarily attributable to loss of occupancy in uncollectible lease revenue or bad debt.</p><p>2. Economic occupancy was down 120 BP while bad debt was 200 BP higher than normal.</p><p>3. Higher than normal bad debt is likely to continue, given breadth and depth of downturn coupled with eviction moratorium in many of the markets in which Co. operates.</p><p>4. Experienced higher concessions in qtr. and lower other income as Co. waived various fees this past qtr. for residents, including late payments, common area amenity and credit card convenience fees.</p><p>5. Avg. lease rate for same-store portfolio in 2Q was actually up 1.8% over 2Q19, reflecting better rent growth from leases entered into 2019 through 1Q of this year.</p><p>7. This downturn poses unique risks relative to other recessions.</p><p>8. In addition to household contraction and consolidation that occurs due to job losses in any downturn, pandemic is driving other trends that are impacting rental demand.</p><p>9. These includes:</p><p>1. Work from home flexibility that is shifting somewhere in demand from higher cost and urban infill markets.</p><p>1. Many renters are relocating perhaps only temporarily to lower cost markets or submarkets, leisure areas or even back home with their parents.</p><p>2. Record low mortgage rates and desire for space is accelerating demand for single-family homes.</p><p>1. Many home builders reported strong orders and sales this past qtr. particularly towards back half of qtr. and home ownership rate is on the rise.</p><p>3. Seeing reduced demand from two important segments; corporate and students as most temporary corporate services have been canceled while higher education is adopting remote learning models and limiting on campus activities for the fall.</p><p>10. Aforementioned factors will likely weigh Co.'s performance until public health crisis has abated.</p><p>1. They will likely contribute to more robust recovery once employees begin to return to workplace.</p><p>2Q20 Operational Review (S.B.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. Aforementioned factors impacted leasing volume throughout qtr., which is down roughly 10% YoverY.</p><p>2. Turnover for qtr. fell about 5% to volume of resident notices to leave Co.'s communities exceeded leasing velocity, most materially in May when it experienced about 25% on lease spread for variety of reasons, including corporate apartment operator shutting down operations in certain markets.</p><p>1. As a result Co. move-outs exceeded move-in for qtr.</p><p>2. As of 07/29/20, net lease volume for July is roughly on pace with volume of notices to vacate Co.'s communities, which should help stabilize occupancy as it moves into Aug.</p><p>3. Experienced 120 BP decline in physical occupancy from April to June, with most of it occurring in May due to lease spread volume.</p><p>1. Blended lease rent change was down 40 BP in 2Q, while effective rent change was down 3.1%.</p><p>2. Rent change for July has improved slightly from June, but nature of health crisis and economic environment will dictate ongoing demand for rental housing and pricing power as Co. moves through balance of the year.</p><p>4. Lease &amp; effective rent change:</p><p>1. Northern and Southern California were most challenging region for variety of reasons, while Pacific Northwest performed the best.</p><p>5. Urban submarkets deteriorated more materially during 2Q vs. suburban submarkets.</p><p>1. From an occupancy standpoint, urban submarkets declined by 270 BP from April to June, while suburban submarkets fell by only 50 BP.</p><p>2. From rent change perspective, urban submarkets (inaudible) suburban by roughly 200 BP.</p><p>3. While weakness in urban environments is pretty broad-based across all portfolio, most pronounced in San Francisco, Boston and parts of LA.</p><p>4. Unfortunately demand in urban submarkets is suffering from variety of factors including:</p><p>1. Desire for more affordable price point.</p><p>2. Extended work from home policies across corporate America.</p><p>3. Lack of short-term and corporate demand.</p><p>4. Uncertainty regarding on campus learning at urban University.</p><p>5. General concern of population density.</p><p>2. Development Portfolio:</p><p>1. Construction delays at beginning of pandemic weighed on both deliveries and occupancies during 2Q.</p><p>2. Deliveries and occupancy for 1H20 fell short of Co.'s expectations by roughly 450 and 650 units respectively, which translated into an NOI shortfall of approx. $2m.</p><p>3. Fortunately, following some initial shutdowns at about one-third of Co.'s construction sites for short period of time, all of jobs are currently underway, albeit with slower pace of deliveries expected across certain assets.</p><p>2Q20 Construction &amp; Development (K.O.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. In response to current environment, Co. has chosen not to start any new construction projects so far this year, despite having initially guided in beginning of the year to about $900m in new construction starts for 2020.</p><p>1. Looking ahead, expects lower construction cost will benefit many of Co.'s future plan starts and is prepared to wait for perspective correction on hard costs before breaking ground so that AVB can lock in lower basis on investments.</p><p>2. Although real time construction cost data are difficult to come by, initial indications suggest Co. is beginning to see softer labor market and reduction in overall construction activity, makes their way to subcontractor pricing.</p><p>3. As for development that is currently under construction, Co. is in remarkably strong position from financial point of view.</p><p>1. Development under construction is already 95% match funded with long-term capital, which not only mitigates financial risk of development but also means that Co. has locked in investments for profit on these development by having maximum long-term expected returns on projects with equity and debt price, when Co. was selling these projects.</p><p>4. Continues to enjoy an exceptionally strong capital position today.</p><p>1. Particularly evident when comparing Co.'s key credit metrics today to those from 4Q08 when it enters last recession.</p><p>2. Specifically since late 2008, net debt to EBITDA ratio has improved to 4.9 times from 6.5 times.</p><p>1. Co.'s interest coverage ratio has increased to 6.9 times from 4.5 times.</p><p>2. Co.'s unencumbered NOI percentage has increased to 94% from 77% and credit ratings improved to A3 A- from Baa1 to BBB+.</p><p>5. Strong balance sheet position provides Co. with great flexibility to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may emerge as this downturn unfolds.</p><p>Closing Comments (T.N.)</p><p>1. Summary:</p><p>1. 2Q was challenging qtr., driven by suddenness of pandemic and depth with downturn.</p><p>2. So far, impact on same-store performance has been driven by lower occupancy and elevated bad debt.</p><p>3. Contributions from NOI and new development lease-ups were less than expected due to construction delays and weaker absorption.</p><p>4. Co. has curtailed its new development dramatically and has not started new community so far this year.</p><p>5. Despite strength in for-sale market, Co. does expect construction cost to fall over next few quarters and will incorporate that into capital allocation plan.</p><p>6. Balance sheet is very well positioned in absolute sense and relative to prior downturns, which gives Co. plenty of financial flexibility to address challenges or opportunities as they arise.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Nick Joseph with Citi.</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Appreciate the color and the rationale behind pausing new starts. Just curious how long do you think the delay will be until you actually start to do projects again. And then what signals are you looking at before actually making that decision to proceed?</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM, CIO, AVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.: Hey, Nick. This is Matt. Yes. I mean it is -- we have deals that could start. And we are -- we do have a fairly high degree of conviction that hard costs should start to correct here. So that's -- the main thing we're looking at is kind of where our hard cost is trending, what the subcontractor bid coverage look like.</p><p>There may be one deal that we would start here that's kind of got some exceptional circumstances that's actually in an opportunity zone. And we're looking at starting with some third-party joint venture capital, which is, as you know, is very unusual for us. But for -- kind of for wholly owned balance-sheet-funded starts, that's really what we're watching. It's kind of interplay between potential reduction in hard costs and, frankly, reductions in NOIs on the other side and kind of looking at what the total basis looks like, what costs look like relative to their long-term trend line and what rents and NOIs look like relative to their long-term trend line as well.</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON, CHAIRMAN, CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, AVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.: Yes, Nick. It's hard to know exactly. If you looked at last cycle, [we've lost] about 4 or 5 quarters. Part of my introductory comments around what this economic downturn might look like, it's maybe different from others that we've seen where others may have been sort of -- maybe drifted a bit more into the recession. This was quite sudden. And others were maybe in a quicker bounce back. We think this could be a more drawn-out bounce back and likely to be more and more -- you've heard certainly the Nike Swoosh with more people -- more and more, you're hearing sort of the K-shaped recovery, where it's going to be very uneven depending upon even demographic and the population.</p><p>So just given the public health and economic aspect of this one, it's hard to know for sure. But as we showed on that one slide, we're just starting to see construction costs correcting. Last cycle, they correct on the order of 15%, maybe a little bit more. And it's -- we're probably going to need to see the kind of double-digit corrections before we start to have a little bit more faith that we're buying deals out of the basis that we'll look good sort of next cycle.</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH: I think you announced the $500 million share repurchase program. How do you think about actually executing on that? And where does it currently stack up in terms of the use of proceeds maybe relative to development or any other kind of acquisitions or redevelopment, kind of other options that you have for that capital?</p><p>KEVIN P. O'SHEA, CFO, AVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.: Yes. Hey, Nick. This is Kevin. I'll jump in here, and Tim may want to add a couple of comments. And you're right, as we -- as you saw in the earnings release, we did announce a share repurchase program of $500 million. And really, the genesis behind that is we believe our stock is, as you alluded to, trading at a compelling value, both absolutely and relative to our other investments, including development. And because we have the balance sheet strength and liquidity to pursue a program, we intend to do so. Though as we indicated in our earnings release, we're likely to fund that on a long-term basis with asset sales and potentially some incremental debt, but we do intend to proceed. And probably we'll do so initially on a measured basis until we have clarity on those sources. But I think at this point, that's probably our most attractive investment that we have today.</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes -- no. I -- maybe to just add a little bit, Kevin, I agree. I think you had 2 things working. It's the best -- it's the most attractive investment, and you've got the disparity between what equity's costing and what -- certainly what debt's costing as being supported artificially by the Fed right now as we know.</p><p>And our belief is while there's not a lot of visibility on asset pricing, we're -- we feel pretty strongly that asset prices haven't corrected near what equity prices have corrected. We've seen in the order of 30% on the equity, and probably -- we think probably less than 10% on asset sales. So that informs our conviction as well in terms of what the alternatives are in terms of capital sources.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Rich Hightower with Evercore.</p><p>RICHARD ALLEN HIGHTOWER, MD &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I'm on the second chart on Page 8, just on the blended like-term rent change chart. And just help us understand some of the details there across new and renewals and what you're seeing currently, urban and suburban and maybe some of the weaker markets you mentioned, Boston, San Fran and L.A. Just help us understand some of the -- what goes into the mix there.</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN, COO, AVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.: Yes, Rich. It's Sean. Happy to walk you through it a little bit. I mean as we noted on an effective basis, blended rent change was down about 3% for the quarter. If you look at it on a lease basis, it was down only about 40 basis points. And certainly, based on what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing the greatest weakness in Northern and Southern California. And if you double-click through those regions, probably the softest spots are San Francisco and throughout L.A., particularly in some of the entertainment-oriented economies around L.A., so think about Hollywood, West Hollywood, Burbank, San Fernando Valley, et cetera.</p><p>And then the other markets, we're basically anywhere from sort of 0 to minus 2%. And across the other markets, the softest spots are probably in New York City and throughout the urban submarkets within Boston. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, generally, across the portfolio, what we're seeing in the urban submarkets is rent change is trailing suburban by about a couple of hundred basis points.</p><p>And as you probably noted in the chart, our economic occupancy and physical occupancy are both trailing what we're seeing in the suburban submarkets as well. So certainly, a tougher place to be as it relates to both rent change and occupancy in those environments.</p><p>And as it relates to kind of where things are today, if you look at it in the context of July, effective rent change is down about 3.5%, a little bit better than June. And lease rent change is down about 2%. And in both cases, renewals do remain positive right now, sort of in the 50 to 70 basis point range, slightly lower than what we experienced in Q2 but still positive in July at this point.</p><p>RICHARD ALLEN HIGHTOWER: Okay. Sean, that's helpful. And then just thinking maybe a little more broadly, in some of the bullets highlighted in the prepared comments about the work-from-home shift and the fact that suburban is outperforming urban. And I would also assume, with respect to home purchases, I mean, given the price points in Avalon's markets, maybe you're a little more insulated from that effect than the average apartment landlord out there. So at what point does that sort of mix start to help Avalon in the sense of having a highly concentrated suburban portfolio? When do you think we'll really see that show up in the numbers there as a net positive, you think?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes, Rich. It's Sean. I can provide a couple of comments, and then Tim can chime in. I mean it's really a function of how some of those factors evolve over the next few months here. I mean urban submarkets, we've mentioned several of the factors that are sort of driving it. So I think what I mentioned in my prepared remarks is sort of the nature of the health crisis, and the economic environment will dictate when people start to come back to the urban submarkets and at least some in a more material way.</p><p>And on the suburban side, it's really a function of sort of portfolio mix. And in some places, it certainly is very helpful. There are some submarkets where, even though it's suburban, it's a little bit painful right now. I'll pick one specifically, like Mountain View in Northern California, where Alphabet is headquartered. Given their extended work-from-home policies, it tends to be a weaker submarket even though it's technically considered suburban. So I'm not sure there's a one-size-fits-all answer here as it relates to that. At least, that's my general thoughts at this point in time. But Tim, do you have anything you want to add?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes. I just -- maybe just -- I've mentioned suburban had been outperforming urban before -- prior to the pandemic. And we had been seeing a trend, both on the demand</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>next year, urban supply to outpace suburban by a fair amount in our markets, but also on the demand side, which, last cycle, supply and demand was stronger in the urban submarkets. This cycle, it's probably going to be the opposite, where both -- when you get beyond sort of '21, '22, where you're likely to see stronger demand in some of the suburban submarkets and more supply. And that's partly because millennials are coming of age, there's more economic activity starting to occur in the suburbs, and part of it's affordability. So as you see more economic activity, that ought to drive more rental -- renter demand in the suburbs as well. But -- and we already started to see that trend a little bit before the pandemic, but it's just a longer secular trend that we expect that will continue over the next few years.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.</p><p>JOHN JOSEPH PAWLOWSKI, SENIOR ANALYST, GREEN STREET ADVISORS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Sean, I want to go back to your comment about you see signs of stability in at least occupancy heading into August. Does that comment hold for the current pockets of weakness that you alluded to, L.A., Boston, San Fran?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: In the short run, John, yes. And we are starting to see some student demand come back in some of these urban submarkets based on announcements that have been made to date as it relates to the hybrid learning environments, both on-campus and distance learning, and just anecdotally, getting a lot of feedback from some of the student population that they had enough time at home. And even if they only could be on campus a couple of days a week, they want their apartment back. So whether that holds or not, obviously, it's a function of the health crisis and the decisions that are made across the university systems. But in general, I would say we are seeing it relatively sort of stabilize a little bit.</p><p>That being said, between now and year-end, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the health crisis and the economic environment will dictate whether things kind of shift up or down in terms of demand as we move forward here.</p><p>JOHN JOSEPH PAWLOWSKI: Makes sense. And then the 200 basis point drag from bad debt in the quarter on the residential portfolio with the opening remarks or something to that effect that it remains elevated. Is that a reasonable betting line just the trajectory over these coming months? Or will it get meaningfully worse or meaningfully better? I guess I don't understand -- I don't know how to completely think through markets like in L.A., where this eviction moratorium keeps getting kicked down the road. So just curious, comments around the trajectory of bad debt from here will be helpful.</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes, John. I'm happy to comment, and then Kevin or Tim can chime in as well. I mean at this point in time, it's obviously difficult to predict, given the nature of -- we already have mentioned the health crisis, the macroeconomic environment. Obviously, there have been federal support for people to date in terms of being able to sort of subsidize their incomes, which I think came through this morning in terms of personal income growth. So I think assuming it's a relatively static environment through year-end, you probably expect those sort of collection rates to hold within reason. But to the extent there is significant shift in any one of those variables in a meaningful way, obviously, that could pick it up or down as a result. But I think those are the primary variables we will all be monitoring to try and determine whether we think it's going to tick up and/or down. So...</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR, MD AND HEAD OF UNITED STATES REITS, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just want to go back to some of the big-picture comments, Tim, that you've discussed so far, including some of the comments during the Q&amp;A. And I very much appreciate how difficult it is to figure out the medium to long term. As you're thinking, again your comments about the lower-cost options elsewhere, Southeast, increasing homeownership, I mean can you talk a little bit more how this is impacting, let's say, Avalon's medium- to long-term strategic plans, whether that includes new markets? I guess can you share some thoughts on that?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes. Sure, Jeff. I think we've spoken to this in the past. As many have said, I mean, I think the pandemic is -- they're -- these trends aren't necessarily new. They're -- a lot of them are being accelerated. And you can certainly think about sort of big tech and employers in places like New York and California. They're already diversifying their workforces in other markets whether it's Amazon in D.C. or having bases in Austin or Denver. And so we want to be leveraged really to the innovation and knowledge economy. And so that means kind of going where those workers are going. And to the extent jobs -- employers continue to chase jobs, rather jobs -- sort of the job is chasing the employee rather than the employee is chasing the job, then we want to be in those markets. That was one of the reasons we got into Denver and Southeast Florida.</p><p>I would say one of the things that -- you look at the -- just a fiscal situation of some of the blue states, obviously, are being exacerbated as well. And so I think that probably informs our thinking also and just the overall affordability driving -- in driving some of the populations as some of these markets, we want to be in those sort of spillover markets.</p><p>We think what's happening is good for the innovation economy. So I don't think it's bad necessarily for San Jose and San Francisco and Boston but recognize that some of the -- some of those benefits are going to spill over to some other sort of secondary innovation markets as well. And those would be good markets for us to be in.</p><p>And so we look to do a few things. One is to kind of reallocate or recycle capital -- some capital in New York certainly, and probably in the future, some out of California to both expansion -- our existing expansion markets as well as markets like D.C., Seattle and Boston and then also potentially some new markets that we're not into today.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: And is that -- and I appreciate the comments. I mean I guess, the -- your thoughts on work-from-home and the permanency of work-from-home, does that impact the decision process at all? Or do you feel like that it's just a temporary adjustment right now, but maybe it will be more going forward but not to the extent that some in the media are portraying or some on The Street are portraying?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes. Yes, it's hard to know. And I know that the office guys get that question a lot. I can sort of speak from our own experiences. We would expect we would have more work-from-home activity kind of going forward. But there are certain jobs where there -- that are more kind of individual contributors where they can be efficient working away from the office space, but that is not close to the majority of the jobs in this company or most companies.</p><p>And so we view it as kind of more of a marginal effect that gives people a little bit more flexibility about where to live if they want to work from home. And secondly, they're probably not that focused on career growth. They're probably not going to manage a lot of people working from home at least over the next few years in my view.</p><p>So I would say, does it really affect our view in terms of where we want to be? Probably less so than the fact that big employers like the Googles and Apples of the world are already diversifying their workforces in other markets with satellite operations there. So whether it's a satellite operation or people working from home, they're likely to get out to some of the same markets, I would think.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>RICHARD HILL, HEAD OF U.S. REIT EQUITY &amp; COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE DEBT RESEARCH AND HEAD OF U.S. CMBS, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to follow along those lines of bigger-picture questions and go back to some of your prepared remarks. Specifically, about homeownership, we've seen some similar trends with homeownership, particularly under the age of 35 cohort. Do you think those are just near term given the decline that we've seen in interest rates? Or do you think there's a more secular shift that's going on there?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes, Rich, I can speak to you, and others may have a view. I think part of it may be -- if you just looked at the composition of the millennials, it's a little bit as a -- [that they have gone through the pipe]. So there's a lot more of those that are under 35 in that 30 to 35 cohort than there were 5 years ago. So they're starting to enter into those kind of prime homeownership. Yes, so I think a lot of this is being stimulated by demographics and really being accelerated by what we're seeing in terms of interest rates. We're not seeing it yet with our residents. Reasons for move actually went down to purchase homes. But homeownership is going up nationally, and it has an impact on the overall renter pool that affects all of us as landlords at some level. We may be a little -- we think we're probably less at the sort of the epicenter of it. It's probably mostly coming from single-family rental and other demographics and other markets. But it does have an overall -- it does have an impact on a broader sort of renter pool, if you will.</p><p>RICHARD HILL: Got it. That's helpful. I've been a little bit surprised there hasn't been more focus this earnings season on the election coming up in a couple of months and potentially rent regulation depending upon what parties have power. I'm wondering if that is something that you're focused on. Obviously, the Biden plan has housing as a big focus, and affordability on the other side of COVID-19 is obviously more challenged. How are you thinking about that maybe over the medium to long term?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Richard, it factors in. I mean most of the regulatory risks we face is really at the local and state level, not as much at the national level. I think we'd would probably be a little bit more concerned if there was another nominee that was a</p><p>[Democratic] nominee at the national level. But our markets have always been more regulated than other markets. We are in blue states. It's always -- it's part of what's been the appeal of our markets is sort of the barriers to entries created some supply constraints on new housing, which has helped elevate rents and rent growth over time.</p><p>I think the issue that you're starting to touch on is the key one, which is when it starts to leak into the price controls and rent control, that becomes the issue for us and the type of rent control. Certainly, in New York and parts of California, you have vacancy we control. That's usually pretty manageable in terms of as an owner of apartments. Where you have -- when you lose -- when you have controlled pricing on vacant as they become available, that's the kind of rent control as an industry we have to absolutely avoid and it is -- it will be awful for the housing markets if that occurs.</p><p>So that's something we're going to continue to watch, we're going to continue to fight as an industry because it's -- one, it's not good for us as landlords for sure, but it's not good for the housing market long term. And it's not a way to solve any housing crisis at any local level. It's politically expedient, but it's -- from a policy standpoint, it's absolutely poor policy.</p><p>RICHARD HILL: Understood. And then one more question, if I may. In the past, you've done a really good job thinking about how your development and your land development is really under option and you don't have to move forward with it. So I'm wondering, as you survey the landscape post-COVID-19, are there any land that you have under option, in maybe high barrier or blue states that you might want to not move forward with? And you had mentioned Florida, I think, earlier in your remarks. Are there any other markets where you prefer to maybe focus on the development going forward versus some of the markets that you're in right now?</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM: Yes. Hey, Richard. It's Matt. As it relates to our current development rights pipeline, you're right, we only own 2 of those 28 deals are land owned that we bought from a third party. So we do have a lot of optionality. And it's really deal by deal. There may be deals in there that are not going to work without some type of restructuring. There are other deals that probably will work. And there are some deals where we may say the land is a good price, and we may close on the land and carry it for a while and wait for hard costs to come down.</p><p>So it's a little bit of all of the above. It doesn't really factor into the geographic mix. It's really bottom-up in terms of where we're finding the best opportunities. And so we have a couple of development rights in some of our expansion markets, including 2 in Denver and one in Florida, that are working their way through the system. We have development rights in our legacy markets as well. I don't think we've seen any particular trend yet in terms of kind of an impact to the land market or development economics more so in one market than another, other than where you're seeing, obviously, rents taking the biggest hit so far.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY, VP &amp; EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Another development question for you. I was wondering if you could frame up how the development pipeline that is active is positioned relative to the headwinds you cite on Slide 6. And then I'm basically trying to get a sense of the potential volatility around your 5.7% projected development yields.</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM: Hey, I'm sorry. Is that about the development under way or the development rights on the future starts?</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY: No -- yes. Sorry, the active pipeline. I mean I believe you guys pivoted a few years ago to more of a suburban footprint, but I don't know if they technically qualify, in your view, as more of the infill that you cite as a headwind on Page 6.</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM: Yes. I mean when you look at the 2.4 billion in development under way, you can kind of look at it in terms of -- you're right, the current yield is at 5.7%. Those deals are still -- there's only 5 of those 19, where we've actually done enough leasing that we mark the rents to market yet. And on those 5, actually, the rents are slightly ahead of [pro forma] by about $30.</p><p>So now the yields are a little bit behind because there's been some cost overruns on a couple of deals. Generally speaking, so 5 of the 19 are more or less mark-to-market. The other 14, you could handicap them. A lot of them are in markets that have seen less downward rent pressure so far. It is a predominantly suburban portfolio. In fact, looking at it, I think the only deal in that, that we would consider urban other than Hollywood, which is under construction, would be the one deal in downtown Baltimore right now. And yes...</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY: And then what about with the work-from-home trend? Are you noticing any demand for your larger units, people looking for maybe another room for an office or maybe rooms with a view?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes. Wes, this is Sean. I mean we've been digging into that, and at least based on sort of early returns, I would say it appears as though suburban direct-entry product, which often is a townhome, is doing a little bit better in the current environment. And the data is a little bit mixed. But overall, that appears to be a positive trend for us in terms of that product type across the portfolio.</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM: And I would say, just to add to that, this is Matt, that when you look at our development, as an industry, the average unit size has been trending down really for the last cycle, probably came down 10%. What we've seen, at least in the last year or 2, our development starts, the average unit size has started to move the other direction. A lot of that has been our shift to more suburban assets. But also, even before the pandemic, we were starting to see, just with demographics heading where they were, greater demand for 3-bedroom units, which we didn't use to -- hardly build at all, now almost every project we build has at least about 3 bedrooms in it. And more of the kind of 1-bedroom den and 2-bedroom loft, we're definitely building more of that product than we were 5 years ago.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.</p><p>SUMIT SHARMA, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Sumit Sharma in for Nick. A question about your bad debt expense. And I just want to be clear. Maybe you've stated this earlier, so I apologize in advance. But of the 2.7% of uncollectible rent, I guess how much was part of the bad debt provision or reserve? Some of your peers have talked about reserves of the tune of around 200 basis points or so. And just getting a sense of how much went into reserves, how much is deferred, how much is write-offs and cash bad debts.</p><p>KEVIN P. O'SHEA: Sumit, this is Kevin O'Shea. I'm not -- I'm having difficulty hearing you, but maybe just to give you an overview of what we did with respect to bad debt, and then you can ask questions to the extent that I'm not responding to some of your questions.</p><p>So first of all, our policy is to reserve delinquent base residential rent for 3 months and other delinquent items after 2 months. For residential revenue, we typically take a reserve of about 50 basis points of residential revenue. And we did so in Q2 in our same-store portfolio. In addition, in Q2, we took a further reserve of about 200 basis points or $10.7 million, including for residents who didn't pay anything during the quarter. That resulted in a total reserve for the same-store residential revenue portfolio of about 250 basis points or $13.6 million. So of course, we continue to caution our effort -- our collection efforts, and we're certainly encouraged by recent collection trends, which show collections against unpaid April and May rents improving to about 97.5% from about 93%, 94% at month end. So that's the story in residential revenue. Is that helpful? Is that responsive?</p><p>SUMIT SHARMA: Yes. No, that's great. And apologies for the bad sound quality. Another question, following up a different kind of area. I'm just wondering, in terms of the concession activity, you actually provided a lot of information on urban versus suburban. Trying to understand where -- what kind of unit types are being -- are seeing the biggest concessions, 2 bedrooms, 3 bedrooms. I think a few moments ago, someone was talking about developments and how it's changing with the unit mix. I'm just wondering, from a concession standpoint, where you're seeing the biggest drop in rent or where you have to give the largest amount of concession.</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes, this is Sean. I'll give you some general thoughts on that. So first, as you might imagine, from what we described in our prepared remarks, concessions are generally greater in urban environments as compared to suburban environments. So let's start with that.</p><p>Within urban environments, we tend to see fewer concessions on the more affordable price points, which tend to be the studios and 1-bedrooms in those submarkets as compared to the larger units. Initially, we thought there might be sort of steadier demand for larger units and people looking to work from home with extra space. But I think the affordability issue sort of weighed on that a little bit, and we've seen better performance out of the studios and smaller 1-bedrooms.</p><p>And then the suburban environment, I wouldn't say there is a common theme as it relates to unit type. It's really submarket-driven and the nature of the demographics within that environment. We've got very high-quality towns in suburban Boston with great schools, and 2 and 3 bedrooms are -- have solid demand and ones not quite as much. And if you revert to some submarkets in L.A., the more affordable price points in studios and 1-bedrooms are in better shape as compared to the larger 2- and 3-bedroom units given the shutdown of some of the entertainment studios and such. So it's not a common theme as much as it relates to the suburban unit type as much as the specific suburban geography.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Alex Kalmus with Zelman &amp; Associates.</p><p>ALEX KALMUS, ASSOCIATE, ZELMAN &amp; ASSOCIATES LLC: Looking into bad debt and delinquencies, have you guys run an analysis on your resident base to see what age, income or profession this is mostly centered on?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes. Alex, this is Sean. We'd have to run some data on that. And I think what I would tell you is it's more industry-specific than it is typical demographic make-up in terms of gender, age, things of that sort. It tends to be self-employed, sort of freelance workers, content producers, folks like that, that have been impacted most materially.</p><p>And then some of our Eaves communities, some of the service-based sectors that have been impacted as well, whether it's foodservice, hotels, things of that sort, some of the occupations that Tim alluded to earlier in his opening remarks. So it really is more occupation-driven than anything else.</p><p>ALEX KALMUS: Got it. And just to touch upon the Park Loggia sales, how was the selling on that this quarter? And I noticed the average unit price was a little higher. So I'm assuming some of the higher units got sold. Was there any discount to February levels that you needed to offer to enhance the sale process?</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM: Yes. Hi, Alex. This is Matt. So the closings that we saw in the second quarter were almost completely deals that have been under contract earlier than that. Not entirely, there were a few deals we did in the second quarter that were quick closes, including, I think, one of the penthouse units which -- so the average price that's settled in any given time period is really more a function of just what units happen to settle based on scheduled settlements and so on. So you can't draw a lot of conclusions, I don't think, from that.</p><p>We have 54 units closed right now. We have another 12 under contract. When you add that together, it adds up to a little bit more than 200 million. We have -- there certainly is negotiation, and there's probably more negotiation at the higher price points. And that was a trend even before the crisis hit. So we have not really taken a different approach to pricing post-COVID. There just hasn't been enough traffic and transaction velocity in the market to really even justify it. I'm not sure that if we were to drop prices, we would see a significant change in the volume.</p><p>And we were offering a very compelling value, we believe, before, and it's still a pretty compelling value. And that was validated by the pretty strong sales pace we had before everything shut down in early March. So there is more supply coming. And I would say that there is a little bit more negotiation at the higher price points, but we expected that. So relative to our expectations, nothing's really changed with our pricing yet.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER SANDLER &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: So 2 questions. The first one is do you guys have an idea of how many residents are living in your apartments who are paying rent but aren't actually there? So they've moved away, but they're still paying rent.</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes. Alex, this is Sean. That's a tough number to come up with. So the blunt answer is no, we don't. Unless they voluntarily come to us and say, \"Hey, I'm going to be gone for x period of time. Can you do something for me?\" There's not necessarily a tracking mechanism for that, that would give you any sense of -- any real sense of accuracy there.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Okay. So as your apartment managers are seeing, I guess, maybe mail not being picked up or what have you, there's not a way to sort of track and understand if those people plan on coming back or they're going to exit whenever their term ends?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Not necessarily. I mean people have mail picked up. I mean you think about buildings that are 500 units and they have 1,000 people in them, it's really hard to get a sense for that unless there is something specific related to a mail hold that we're aware of or a package delivery. But I wouldn't say you could count on that as a representative sample that would give you an accurate estimate.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Okay. And then, Kevin, on the development program, you guys were planning on doing meaningful starts this year. You haven't. At what point -- as you deliver but you don't replace the deliveries, at what point do the capital -- the current capitalized costs start to burn off and that starts to -- those expenses start to accrete to the income statement? Like where -- how far would the delays have to go, meaning before we would see the expenses start to appear on the income statement because they could no longer be capitalized?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Hey, Alex. This is Tim. Maybe I'll jump in, and Kevin may have something to offer. I mean certainly, if we have people working in development or construction that are not actively working on a job, whether it's one that's under construction or one that's going through the planning process, they get expensed. They go to the income statement. They don't get capitalized.</p><p>I think you still need to -- while we haven't started anything year-to-date, we still have over $2 billion under construction and $4 billion under the process. So we're still managing a $6 billion pipeline. Now we are trying to rightsize it. If you look at this quarter, it's about 10% lower than the last 4-quarter average of total capitalized overhead. And it's been trending down as we've seen -- we've had some recent departures and retirements over the last 6 to 12 months of some senior folks as we try to really start to sort of rightsize it for the sort of the next cycle and where we're currently at.</p><p>The other thing to remember, well, you probably don't know this, but roughly about half of that group's comp is incentive-based. So if they're not doing things or if they're not doing as much production, there's a sort of automatic adjusted factors in the overhead piece as well. But our objective is really just to be really -- is to be well positioned and rightsized kind of for the early part of the next cycle to be able to flex up if we need to as the opportunities arise if you -- so capitalized overhead this quarter is about $11 million. About $6.5 million of that is development. About</p><p>$3.5 million is construction. And about a little over $1 million of it's redevelopment. If you annualize that, you get about $25 million in development, about $12 million maybe construction. That is a level that supports kind of in the -- I think we would talk about $800 million to $900 million range, sort of plus or minus. And that's what we're still geared for.</p><p>So to the extent we decide over the next 3 or 4 years, it doesn't make sense to be doing that kind of volume. Obviously, head counts will need to be adjusted. But we suspect, over the next couple of years, we're going to be in a position to sort of ramp up that group. We want to make sure we've got the leadership and the right personnel in place. And they're still managing as we go into this recession about $6 billion worth of a total pipeline, which is probably only about 25% off of kind of where its peak level, probably in the $7.5 billion to $8 billion range.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Rob Stevenson with Janney.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON, MD, HEAD OF REAL ESTATE RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: What's the positive impact that you typically see in terms of traffic- and leasing-wise in the May, June, July time period from the influx of new college graduates renting for the first time in your core markets in a normal year? And what have you seen thus far this year? It seems like very few college grads in your core markets have actually rented apartments this year versus a normal year given how early COVID hit and so that might be a big driver.</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes, Rob, Sean. Good question. A couple of thoughts on that, not necessarily specific data since it's a little hard to capture. But in our particular case, I mean we don't have a lot of student-oriented assets. They're pretty select across certain markets, particularly in the urban environments, I would say. But your broader question really probably relates to the percentage of the market that is really made up of the student population that sort of brings the occupancy up in the entire market. That's something, to be honest, we've been trying to get our arms around that. Not quite there yet in terms of what that represents in each one of those submarkets. But there are certain submarkets, like we have a property here in the district that's pretty tied to AU that when they announced their plans to have a hybrid learning model, we did 80 leases in 1 week. So there are submarket stuff like that, that are highly dependent upon it.</p><p>But I think the broader question is one we're still trying to answer, which is sort of collectively what the demand is. From the student population is one segment, and then from the short-term and corporate rental market is the other segment. We think the short-term corporate piece is probably in the 2% to 3% range. And we're trying to understand that in terms of the student population, particularly as universities may shift their on-campus housing options to the extent that they're trying to sort of de-densify some of those communities.</p><p>So it's a little bit of a moving target. It's probably hard to answer right at this exact moment. But certainly, the peak time for that demand is, as you described, as we're moving through the pre-leasing season, that you're going to see sort of basically April through June, like you might see on some of the student housing rates. And you want to be pre-leased in those buildings in the 90%-plus range as you get towards the end of July and before they show up in August. So we're on track for that at some of the buildings, but there are places in and around urban Boston, Berkeley, places like that, where they are falling short because of the uncertainty around the ultimate learning model.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON: Well, I mean, beyond the student stuff, I mean, I was really focused on the 21-, 22-year-olds that just graduated, that have a job with, let's say, an investment bank, a tech company, a consulting firm or whatever, that you normally get in New York, San Francisco, Boston, et cetera, renting for the first time, where they're bringing in an offer letter to you and they're leasing off of that. I mean that influx of students -- of former students, but now people entering the workforce for the first time, I mean, how significant is that typically in these big sort of gateway cities?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes. And that's a -- it's probably a tough one to answer other than the stuff that's related to people that are coming in for a specific kind of program, like a training program or some other kind of corporate program, I guess, 2% to 3% of the market</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>our markets. What you're really talking about is just ongoing demand as people are graduating from universities, moving into the rental market. That's a little tougher to quantify overall at this point in time.</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes. No, Rob, that is part of -- I cited earlier in my remarks about the typical household contraction and consolidation that you see in a downturn. That is part of it, which you're describing to me. Kids that can't get jobs when they get out of college, they stay at home or they go into a house with 6 guys, and there are 6 people instead of getting their own apartment.</p><p>So you'll see -- in past recessions, you've seen occupancies fall by a couple of hundred basis points. You may still be seeing a little bit of new supply. So it's not unusual to see contraction of household demand on the order of a million, 2 million housing units across the country in a normal downturn. And a big portion of that is, I think, exactly what you're focusing on.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON: Okay. And then lastly for me, what are you guys seeing today versus at the beginning of the year in terms of construction costs, both hard and soft? I mean how meaningful has been the delta? And where is the greatest amount of slack today? And is there any of these buckets that are -- that you're seeing more cost pressures either up or down on now given what's happening in single-family or what's happening elsewhere or the falling off of new construction in other sectors?</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM: Yes. Hey, Rob. This is Matt. It's -- we are starting to see it, but it is early. So where we started to see it first is really in some of the smaller-contract CapEx work. So if you think about it, those are the types of jobs that are short in duration. So if you're a subcontractor that's doing a facade restoration project for us or some concrete repair work, that might be a 2- or 3-month or 6-month job. And if they finish one up, they don't necessarily have stuff to replace it. So we are starting to see it there. And in some markets, we've seen mid-single-digit buyout savings on that work, which isn't all that meaningful. But given where we've been coming from, where we've just been seeing construction costs growing much faster than inflation for the last 4 or 5 years, it is a significant change.</p><p>On the new construction, it's probably still too early in almost all markets because everything is under way, and there's a lot under way. It's going to have to get finished first. So again, where you're going to see it first is going to be in early trades, earthwork, pipework, demolition, maybe a little bit concrete. And then regionally, it's going to vary as well. So what we've heard others say is maybe we're starting to see a little bit in South Florida because a big part of what drives that is also -- there's no wood frame construction there for one thing. It's all concrete because of the hurricane codes. And there's a lot of cruise ship restoration work. And hospitality work is not happening. That's been canceled. So the sub base there has more excess capacity. It hasn't really worked its way into most of our markets yet.</p><p>Some commodities are down. Lumber is up. Lumber is up quite a bit right now. So -- and that's probably in response to what's going on in the single-family market and just home renovation market. So there are some cross-currents there, but it generally takes a while. Construction pricing is a lagging indicator. And it's going to take a while for it to work its way through the system in our view.</p><p>OPERATOR: And our final question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON, RESEARCH ANALYST, SMBC NIKKO SECURITIES AMERICA, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So Tim, you mentioned, or maybe somebody else, but the kind of the suddenness of what happened, made a lot of decisions for you, particularly as it relates to development postponement. If memory serves, in the '08, '09 time frame, you did have a sizable write-off related to your development pipeline. And if I'm wrong about that, I apologize, but I'm going on memory.</p><p>I'm curious, though, as you fast-forward to 12 years later today, is there anything about what happened then that you took from a lesson learned and is sort of allowing you to sort of walk the tight rope here without having any sort of disruption like that? I'm just wondering how that experience during the great financial crisis has manifested itself at how you look today. I know you mentioned the difference in balance sheet in your prepared remarks, but I'm just wondering just in terms of how you approach the business, particularly on the development side.</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes. Hey, Rich, Tim. I would say it's largely been in land. And when you say we had -- like we wrote off or had impairments on the order of about $80 million total, and a good portion of that was in land. And I would just say relative to the size of the development rights pipeline, we've had deals where profits have been larger than that in terms of value we created. So I -- we weren't -- I mean the homebuilders are -- were taking impairments in the billions. We took a -- I think we took an impairment of -- on the order of $60 million. This time were just on our land. And so we've been really very disciplined about maintaining optionality. And some of the -- as Matt was talking earlier, some of the deals may not make. And we may have sellers that are unwilling to restructure to the extent restructuring sort of could close the gap. And we could have some future write-offs, I suspect, but it's really out of the pursuit cost, which is pretty cheap capital relative to the size of the pipeline that we control. So I would say the biggest issue is just -- we just don't have land inventory of any significance this cycle compared to the last one.</p><p>KEVIN P. O'SHEA: And the only thing I would add to that, this is Kevin, Rich, is just, obviously, we've discussed many times in recent years, one key lesson we took from that downturn was to be a whole lot more match funded with respect to the development under way in terms of having the long-term capital in place. And so you see that lesson being applied here in a very visible way with respect to the</p><p>$2.5 billion we have under way right now, with 95% already match funded. So that obviously leaves us a lot more foot forward this time around to pursue opportunities that may pop up.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON: Great. And then secondly, a lot of talk in this call about suburbs beating the urban core. You guys are, I think, pardon me if I'm wrong on this one, I think you're 60 -- 2/3 suburban, 1/3 urban, and perhaps, you're still an expensive option in those suburbs. But do you think that, that sort of breakout could ultimately help you out long term here as this sort of situation settles and that people maybe don't go all the way back in, but they come back close enough where it benefits you in your suburban portfolio?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes. Again, Rich, I think I was talking earlier, there already was a trend. We already were sort of starting to tilt the portfolio suburban. And if you look kind of about our history, probably where we created the most value, at least in the development pipeline, is kind of that suburban infill. And I think as millennials get a little bit older, you see more economic activity in suburbs. I think the kind of this kind of urban-light kind of lifestyle, mixed-use kind of infill/suburban areas is probably -- provides -- offers one of the more attractive opportunities that's less dense than an urban environment, also has -- generally is more affordable than what we delivered in our urban areas. So we were already kind of moving in that direction. And maybe this just pushes us a little bit harder. But -- so I think the demand factors that were already in place are just -- are probably just being magnified by what's happened here in the last few months.</p><p>OPERATOR: And with that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Tim Naughton for closing remarks.</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Okay. Well, great. Thank you, Matt. I know all of you have a number of calls you need to be on today. So I just want to thank you for being with us, and enjoy the rest of your time. I look forward to talking to you soon.</p><p>OPERATOR: Once again, that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

Current Environment:</p><p>1. COVID has hurt clients financially by significantly reducing elective procedures and other margin contributors.</p><p>1. Co.'s intense focus on supporting them through pandemic has enabled CERN to strengthen and extend client relationships and actually help plan for their post-COVID recovery.</p><p>2. Recently announced expansion of Banner Health relationship to include Co.'s revenue cycle management solution.</p><p>1. With 28 hospitals in six states, Banner is one of the country's largest health systems.</p><p>3. In addition to clarity, alignment and focus, COVID has produced a real burst of innovation, as teams delivered critical, quick-turn projects.</p><p>1. Lights On Network analytics solution released more than 15 new reports and dashboards in 45 days.</p><p>2. Stood up a new version of cloud-based CareAware solution to support Center for Disease Control on a national scale in just 72 hours.</p><p>3. Developed and deployed new syndromic and surveillance reporting to support clients in a matter of hours.</p><p>4. Flexibility and commitment Co. has shown clients has been inspiring.</p><p>1. Co.'s solutions are helping caregivers respond to crisis and plan for recovery from its impacts.</p><p>5. In many cases, COVID is helping clients to actually reimagine new post-COVID business models to reflect increasing importance of comprehensive data and network strategies.</p><p>6. Flexibility is largely due to Co.'s ability to execute and deliver on transformation efforts.</p><p>1. Made meaningful progress on cost optimization and business simplification initiatives that will drive efficiencies and ultimately make it easier to do business with Co.</p><p>7. 07/30/20 marks an important milestone, the one-year anniversary of agreement with Amazon AWS.</p><p>1. Pandemic has underscored value and relevancy of this relationship.</p><p>2. Recently deployed innovative AWS cloud-based Cerner Command Center.</p><p>1. It's a tool that provides real-time data and predictive analytics that enable health systems to monitor and more effectively manage critical resources, like bed utilization, ICU occupancy and staffing levels.</p><p>2. Launched in Jan., Cerner Command Center is already helping health systems like Northern Light Health, Cook County Health and Hospitals System, and ChristianaCare Health Services.</p><p>3. Considerable interest is coming from other clients in this tool.</p><p>8. COVID Task Force continues to inform clinical, business and operational decision-making.</p><p>1. Task Force regularly interacts with CDC, World Health Organization and other global health agencies to help guide their recommendations.</p><p>2. Health and well-being of associates is a paramount concern as Co.'s workforce provides critical support to its global client base.</p><p>2. Management Update:</p><p>1. Since Co. last spoke, welcomed a new CTO, Jerome Labat.</p><p>3. Highlights:</p><p>1. Doing work to build a more diverse and inclusive culture.</p><p>2. While diversity and inclusion efforts have been underway for many years, recent events have challenged organizations to reexamine their strategies.</p><p>1. As mentioned at recent all-associate Town Hall, leadership team is committed to making even more progress in diversity inclusion programs and policies.</p><p>3. For two consecutive years, Co. has been named a leading diversity employer by Forbes.</p><p>1. Will continue a series of actions that will further advance culture and improve communities where Co. lives and work.</p><p>4. This week, Co. was named a technology partner, an initiative led by non-profit, Testing for America (TFA).</p><p>1. TFA is driving an effort to safely reopen Historically Black Colleges and Universities by developing comprehensive COVID testing and safety plans for students, faculty and administrators.</p><p>2. Will play a key role in safely reading test results from partner labs to HBCUs and other health agencies.</p><p>5. As for financial results, delivered solid 2Q, especially given the unique unexpected circumstances.</p><p>1. Quarterly bookings reflect strength in client relationships.</p><p>1. Strong focus on cost control drove favorable earnings results.</p><p>2. Co. is fortunate to have a resilient business model, engaged associates worldwide, highly-relevant healthcare technology and solid transformation plan that positions CERN to manage through pandemic with less impact than many other companies.</p><p>2Q20 Financials (M.N.)</p><p>1. Overview:</p><p>1. Delivered strong bookings, but revenue came in slightly below expectations, primarily driven by some low-margin items being impacted by pandemic more than Co. expected.</p><p>1. This was offset by expense control.</p><p>2. Delivered earnings at high end of guidance.</p><p>2. Adjusted revenue guidance to reflect lower 2Q, a more current view of COVID impact going forward and anticipated sale of remaining RevWorks services business.</p><p>3. Tightened full-year earnings outlook while maintaining same midpoint.</p><p>4. Overall, pleased with results and outlook, given prior guidance was provided in early stages of an unprecedented environment.</p><p>2. Highlights:</p><p>1. Bookings $1.34b.</p><p>1. Down 6% YoverY, but above high end of guidance range, primarily due to strong levels of managed services bookings in qtr.</p><p>2. Ended qtr. with revenue backlog of $13.66b.</p><p>1. Down 9% from a year ago, primarily due to termination of RevWorks outsourcing agreement discussed last year and lower level of bookings in 1H20.</p><p>2. Backlog revenue combined with other contracted revenue that is excluded from ASC 606 backlog definition still provides visibility [to] more than 85% of expected revenue over next 12 months.</p><p>3. Revenue $1.33b.</p><p>1. Down 7% YoverY, driven primarily by 4Q19 exit of RevWorks outsourcing contract and pandemic impact.</p><p>2. $10m below guidance range with COVID impact contributing to lower levels of technology resale and reimbursed travel.</p><p>3. Had less third-party services, licensed software and transaction processing revenue.</p><p>1. These are primarily lower margin revenue streams, so the impact on earnings was limited, and Co. was able to offset it with expense control.</p><p>3. Business Model &amp; YoverY Growth:</p><p>1. Licensed software revenue $152m.</p><p>1. Down [23%] from record high of $197m in 2Q19.</p><p>2. While Co. expected license software would be down this qtr., it did come in a bit lower than expected as strong growth in SaaS offerings was offset by a decline in traditional license software.</p><p>2. Technology resale $42m.</p><p>1. Down 31% YoverY, primarily driven by a few anticipated new business deals pushing out of qtr. amidst pandemic.</p><p>3. Subscription revenue $92m; grew 3%.</p><p>1. Slightly below expectations due to lower transaction processing revenue, which is volume based and was impacted by significantly lower level of ambulatory visits.</p><p>4. Professional services revenue $461m; down 5%.</p><p>1. Largely in line with expectations with decline driven by the impact the pandemic had on project activity, lower third-party services and termination of large RevWorks agreement.</p><p>2. While Co. expects implementation activity to grow in 2H20, total services are expected to decline due to termination of large RevWorks agreement, the sale of non-core assets in Germany and Spain, which closed at beginning of 3Q20 and sale of rest of RevWorks services business, which is expected to close during 3Q20.</p><p>1. All of this activity has been factored into guidance.</p><p>5. Managed services $307m; up 3%.</p><p>1. In line with expectations.</p><p>6. Support and maintenance of $274m was down 1% YoverY and essentially flat QoverQ, which remains in expectation range and continues to reflect impact of attrition and reduced hardware maintenance revenue.</p><p>7. Reimbursed travel just $2m.</p><p>1. Down 93% due to travel restrictions that went into place toward 1Q20-end.</p><p>2. Had anticipated travel would be down in 2Q20, but ongoing restrictions related to COVID-19 impacted Co.'s ability to travel even more than anticipated.</p><p>4. Revenue By Geography:</p><p>1. Domestic revenue $1.17b.</p><p>1. Down 8% YoverY.</p><p>2. Non-US revenue $162m.</p><p>1. Down 2% YoverY.</p><p>5. GM:</p><p>1. 2Q20, 84.1%.</p><p>1. Up:</p><p>1. More than 200 BP from 1Q20's 82%.</p><p>2. Nearly 300 BP from 81.2% [YoverY].</p><p>2. Aforementioned is a reflection of overall mix of revenue in qtr., with largest revenue declines primarily coming from low-margin technology resale, third-party services and reimbursed travel.</p><p>6. Key Metrics:</p><p>1. For spending, operating margin and net earnings, Co. provides both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results.</p><p>1. Adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, acquisition related adjustments, organizational restructuring and other expenses, COVID-19 related expenses and other adjustments that are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in earnings release.</p><p>2. OpEx:</p><p>1. GAAP $971m.</p><p>1. Down 6% vs. 2Q19's $1.03b.</p><p>2. Adjusted, down 4% YoverY, primarily resulting from continued cost optimization efforts.</p><p>3. Had some areas where COVID drove lower expenses, like unreimbursed, travel, entertainment and associated medical expenses.</p><p>3. Line items for 2Q:</p><p>1. Sales and client service expenses decreased 3% YoverY, driven by lower personnel and non-personnel expense.</p><p>2. Software development expense decreased 2% YoverY, with essentially flat gross R&amp;D and 9% increase in amortization that was offset by increased capitalized software.</p><p>4. G&amp;A expense down 7%, driven by decline in personnel and non-personnel expenses.</p><p>7. Operating Margins:</p><p>1. GAAP 11% vs. 2Q19's 9.2%.</p><p>2. Adjusted operating margin 18.4%.</p><p>1. Up from 2Q19's 18%, reflecting improved revenue mix and impact of cost optimization efforts.</p><p>3. Remains on track with planned cost optimization efforts and additional measures implemented to mitigate crisis impact.</p><p>1. Thereby, continues to expect full-year adjusted operating margin to be around 20%.</p><p>1. This will be approx. 150 BP of full-year margin expansion, which Co. views as impressive given circumstances.</p><p>2. For 4Q20, still expects operating margin to be 50-100 BP below original 22.5% target, reflecting reality that even with going beyond original optimization targets, it won't fully offset COVID-19 impact by year-end.</p><p>1. This would still reflect strong margin expansion of approx. 150 BP vs. 4Q19.</p><p>3. Believes framework for ongoing margin expansion shared at Investor Day remains valid, and expects to continue improving margins beyond this year as Co. implements additional optimization efforts and aims to realize a longer-term opportunity to benefit from platform modernization.</p><p>8. Net Earnings &amp; EPS:</p><p>1. GAAP net earnings $135m or $0.44 per diluted share.</p><p>1. Up from 2Q19's $0.39.</p><p>2. Adjusted net earnings $193m.</p><p>3. Adjusted diluted EPS $0.63 vs. 2Q19's $0.66.</p><p>4. Both GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 21%.</p><p>1. For remainder of 2020, continues to expect GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 20-22%.</p><p>9. Balance Sheet:</p><p>1. Remains in solid position.</p><p>2. Ended 2Q20 with $441m of cash and short-term investments, while debt remained at $1.34b.</p><p>1. Given relatively low leverage, believes Co. remains well-positioned to access additional capital as needed to support growth and capital allocation strategy.</p><p>3. Receivables:</p><p>1. Last qtr., previewed that Co. anticipated some impact on collections from COVID in near-to-intermediate term.</p><p>1. Experienced some of that impact in 2Q20 as total receivables ended qtr. at $1.18b, up $33m QoverQ.</p><p>4. DSO 81.</p><p>1. Up from 1Q20's 74 days and 2Q19's 78.</p><p>5. Expects some continued impact on collections, but Co. views it as more of a timing issue than collectability issue and does not currently expect it to materially impact operations.</p><p>6. Operating cash flow was $259m, and CapEx was seasonally higher at $117m, while capitalized software was $78m.</p><p>1. Free cash flow $64m.</p><p>2. For 2H20, expects higher operating cash flow and lower CapEx to drive stronger free cash flow.</p><p>10. Capital Allocation:</p><p>1. As mentioned last qtr., due to uncertain nature of current environment and significant level of repurchases in 1Q20, paused repurchase activity in 2Q20.</p><p>1. Still has $1.03b remaining under current authorization.</p><p>1. Will continue to evaluate Co.'s program, which may be impacted by amount of funding used for other purposes, like acquisitions or investments.</p><p>2. Dividend program:</p><p>1. Paid dividend of $0.18 per share or $55m.</p><p>2. Sustained strong financial position should enable to continue dividend program subject to Board approval.</p><p>11. Announcement:</p><p>1. From early June that R1 RCM, Inc. will acquire RevWorks services business.</p><p>1. This divestiture is consistent with portfolio management activities Co. has discussed.</p><p>2. As part of the transaction, Co. will extend R1's revenue cycle capabilities to clients and new prospects, as part of an integrated offering.</p><p>3. RevWorks services business represents approx. $80m of annual revenue.</p><p>1. This is a profitable revenue stream, but Co. does not expect transaction to have a material impact on CERN's earnings.</p><p>2. Transaction is expected to close in 3Q20, and Co. has factored in approx. $30m less revenue into full-year guidance to reflect this timing.</p><p>12. Guidance:</p><p>1. While pandemic continues to progress, it remains difficult to precisely quantify extent to which it will affect business operations and financial results for rest of the year.</p><p>2. As Co. was able to demonstrate in 2Q20, business is generally resilient with significant recurring elements.</p><p>3. Believes that largest impact from pandemic occurred in 2Q20 and that project and sales activity will improve in 2H20, assuming pandemic impact begins to subside during this period.</p><p>4. Following guidance essentially reflects minor tweaks to prior expectations based on what Co. has learned during early stages of pandemic.</p><p>5. While Co. continues to believe it is helpful to investors to provide current view of expected results for future, guidance remains subject to a higher than normal amount of risk given Co. is operating in unfamiliar territory, especially with recent surges in COVID cases.</p><p>6. Revenue:</p><p>1. 3Q20, $1.35-1.40b.</p><p>1. 3Q19 included a little more than $80m of revenue from RevWorks and global divested businesses, of which approx. [$7m] is not in 3Q20 in revenue.</p><p>2. $1.375b midpoint of this range reflects roughly flat growth from 3Q19 after adjusting for divestitures.</p><p>3. 3Q range reflects a slightly larger pandemic impact than originally anticipated and factors in pending sale of remainder of RevWorks services business that is expected to close in 3Q, which Co. expects to reduce revenue about $10m in 3Q20 and $20m in 4Q20.</p><p>2. 2020, $5.45-5.55b.</p><p>1. 2019 included approx. $330m of revenue from divested RevWorks and global businesses, of which approx. $220m is not in 2020 revenue.</p><p>2. $5.5b midpoint reflects roughly flat growth from 2019 after adjusting for divestitures.</p><p>3. This new range is down from prior guidance range as Co. has factored in sale of remainder of RevWorks business, impact of lower revenue in 2Q, and updated outlook for 2H20 to reflect current view of impact of pandemic.</p><p>4. Full-year guidance already reflected exit of large RevWorks outsourcing contract in 4Q19 and global divestiture.</p><p>5. As indicated, adjusting for all portfolio management activities now captured in guidance would result in roughly flat organic growth.</p><p>6. Recognizes that there are a lot of moving parts, but Co. believes the actions CERN is taking to position it for solid growth when pandemic impact subsides and divested revenue is out of comparable periods.</p><p>7. Adjusted diluted EPS :</p><p>1. 3Q20, $0.70-0.74.</p><p>1. Midpoint of this range represents 9% growth over 3Q19.</p><p>2. 2020, $2.80-2.88.</p><p>1. Reflects a narrowing from prior range of $2.78-2.90, while maintaining a midpoint of $2.84 and expected growth of 6% over 2019.</p><p>3. 3Q20 and 2020 expected EPS growth reflects Co.'s ability to offset impact of lower revenues from COVID and lost earnings from divested businesses through cost optimization initiatives to-date.</p><p>8. Bookings revenue:</p><p>1. 3Q20, $1.35-1.55b.</p><p>1. Midpoint of this range represents a nice sequential increase over 2Q20, reflecting expectation that activity will ramp moving through the year.</p><p>2. Overall, views this guidance as solid with lower expected revenue being offset by additional expense control, leading to expectations for solid earnings growth in challenging environment.</p><p>9. Pleased with solid results given the circumstances.</p><p>1. Focused on continuing to execute throughout 2H20.</p><p>2Q20 Additional Details (J.P.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. Delivered solid bookings given circumstances, exceeding high-end of guidance range.</p><p>1. While this did not translate to revenue upside given mix of bookings, it does feed backlog and create visibility going forward.</p><p>2. This mix is evident in higher level of long-term bookings at 32% of total vs. 22% a year ago, reflecting strength in managed services.</p><p>2. While pandemic impacted volume of new footprints, Co. was competitive where decisions were made, winning several new CommunityWorks footprints.</p><p>3. Seeing activity with larger systems, including noteworthy win against primary competitor at Wisconsin-based Marshfield Clinic.</p><p>4. Had solid bookings across Strategic Growth businesses, reflecting relevance of these solutions as hospitals cope with pandemic and continue with their long-term strategies.</p><p>5. Continues advancing revenue cycle footprints with another strong bookings qtr.</p><p>1. This was highlighted earlier in the month as Co. announced a continued expansion of strategic relationship with Banner Health adding revenue cycle solutions.</p><p>2. Another positive related to revenue cycle is relationship recently announced with R1 as part of the expected divestiture of RevWorks services business.</p><p>1. This puts clients in good hands from a revenue cycle services standpoint, while allowing Co. to focus on continued advancement of solutions.</p><p>6. Working with R1 to bring an integrated offering combining R1's tools and services capabilities with solutions, and Co. believes will further strengthen revenue cycle value proposition.</p><p>2. Federal Update:</p><p>1. Like a vast majority of clients and healthcare in general, DOD and VA have been on frontlines of combatting COVID-19.</p><p>1. While this has required Co. to adapt to virtual interactions, less intrusive user engagements and limited on-site activities, CERN continued to make significant progress on programs.</p><p>2. On 04/18/20, Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization program office, DOD, and VA launched a joint health information exchange, enabling a seamless, secure exchange of health information among each department and their expanded network of community partners.</p><p>1. Since the launch, more than 2,000 hospitals, 8,000 pharmacies, 33,000 clinics, 1,000 labs, 800 federally qualified health centers and 300 nursing homes across country have access to VA and DOD patient information.</p><p>2. Later this year, DOD and VA expect to connect to CommonWell Health Alliance, which will add an additional 15,000 providers to their network.</p><p>3. Working with VA and DoD to update go-live schedules for pandemic impact.</p><p>1. While revised go-live dates have not been announced for VA, continues to move forward with VA Centralized Scheduling Solution go-live and first VA program go-live.</p><p>4. On DOD side, as part of Leidos Partnership for Defense Health, making significant progress working virtually to advance program and have activations scheduled in coming months, including US Coast Guard pilot site.</p><p>3. Marketplace Observations:</p><p>1. As discussed last qtr., while pandemic has created some disruption to business activity in near-term, pleased that a clear message Co. is hearing from clients is they want to continue and in many cases accelerate their strategic plans, and CERN is essential part of those strategic plans.</p><p>1. Continued working closely with clients as they manage the challenges of response and recovery.</p><p>2. [To-date], pandemic impact is playing out close to how Co. anticipated it would when CERN talked last qtr.</p><p>3. Had very little activity early in qtr., then activity increased towards 2Q20-end.</p><p>1. Closely monitoring financial and operational impact of pandemic, including recent surge in cases.</p><p>1. At this point, believes outlook is achievable.</p><p>4. Overall, Co. and clients have adapted to different ways of doing business.</p><p>1. Modified sales and service delivery approach, and clients have been receptive.</p><p>2. Shifted to virtual interactions for most contracting activity, demos, open houses, and road-mapping sessions.</p><p>5. On [project] side, professional services organization performed well in mitigating pandemic impact.</p><p>1. As mentioned on last call, shifted to doing as much work as possible remotely in early stages of pandemic.</p><p>1. Clients were supportive, and Co. quickly adapted to this approach, as traditional onsite events are inclusive of go-lives were done completely virtual.</p><p>2. As re-opening occurred, Co. has shifted, where possible and feasible, to a hybrid model combining limited onsite presence with virtual capability.</p><p>1. This approach is proving to be effective, and given ongoing travel restrictions; Co. plans to continue this approach for foreseeable future.</p><p>3. Expects Co.'s onsite presence will increase from current levels; believes hybrid model will continue, resulting in overall less travel than before pandemic.</p><p>1. This will be more efficient and cost effective for Co. and clients.</p><p>6. Believes well positioned to deliver against forecast in 2H20.</p><p>2Q20 COVID-19 Updates (D.T.)</p><p>1. Details:</p><p>1. Current pandemic continues to showcase very best in frontline caregivers.</p><p>1. At same time, it illuminates lack of an integrated system of health and care focused on person.</p><p>2. Still lacks a unified Health Network Architecture.</p><p>3. These systems and data gaps decrease access to care, increase complexity of care and complicate delivery of what was described by team on 07/28/20 as essential need for One Patient Experience.</p><p>1. As entrepreneurs, Co. is excited about the opportunities to solve these challenges.</p><p>2. Product and larger platform vision operates at three levels.</p><p>1. Person.</p><p>2. Enterprise.</p><p>3. Health network.</p><p>3. Co. always begin with person.</p><p>1. Only one thing is common across any healthcare process, the individual.</p><p>2. Focus is on whole person, and they are always shifting role as a patient, as a member, caregiver for an extended family or increasingly as a consumer.</p><p>3. Solutions must supply a person-centric experience that have potential to change behavior and, over time, healthcare itself.</p><p>4. Consumer business delivered solid 2Q20.</p><p>5. Book revenue was a particular bright spot, nearly doubling in 1H20 vs. same period in 2019.</p><p>1. This growth signals that digital front door strategy is working.</p><p>6. Key partnerships with industry leaders, like telehealth efforts with Amwell, provider matching with Kyruus and self-monitoring with GetWell Loop, all have solid momentum within unified consumer framework.</p><p>4. As Co. elevates from person, next systems-level focus is Enterprise, the tier where Cerner Millennium EMR and CareAware solutions are deployed in one-third of US healthcare and key global geographies worldwide.</p><p>1. It is here where Co. automates critical provider workflows and where CERN differentiates with its ability to drive decision-making within last-mile workflow of provider.</p><p>2. Made important progress unifying access management solutions in revenue cycle business with consumer solutions.</p><p>1. These front-end patient engagement and access capabilities move Co. closer to touchless registration experience the current pandemic requires.</p><p>2. Looking beyond COVID, Co. will ensure person, provider and payer, all have right information to deliver a better experience at a lower total cost.</p><p>3. CareAware solution suite continued to see solid demand in 2Q20.</p><p>1. Providers are looking to CareAware communications capabilities and Health System Operations solutions as critical for COVID surge response and durable revenue recovery.</p><p>2. Business is on pace for over 30% growth for 2020.</p><p>5. As providers look to tackle operational and financial challenges of COVID, it is pushing them to think not just at Enterprise level, but at larger health network level as well.</p><p>1. Success requires them to manage a patient, member or consumer across multiple organizations, regardless of core EMR.</p><p>2. EMR-agnostic HealtheIntent platform was architected to enable this essential work across diverse stakeholders and payment models.</p><p>1. In 2Q20, HealtheIntent saw new footprints at organizations ranging from University of Southern California to Marshfield Clinic to Western Health in Australia.</p><p>2. It delivered important displacements at organizations like Aultman Health.</p><p>3. This market begins to define what a total solution offering must look like and also beginning recognize Co. and it's increasing capabilities to deliver it.</p><p>6. Person, enterprise and health network are architectural building blocks that will drive Co. forward in decade ahead.</p><p>2. Others:</p><p>1. Believes data business holds potential to be the next Co.</p><p>2. Release of Information business is on path to exceed aggressive 2020 revenue target, growing at [over 100%] off a small base.</p><p>3. Team has meaningfully advanced Cerner Learning Health Network, hitting their full-year goal of 40 participating provider organizations by 06/30/20.</p><p>1. In strong demonstration of real-world potential of this data, academic researchers have launched 42 active projects leveraging free COVID de-identified data cohort to tackle challenges ranging from racial and ethnic determinants to advancements of new COVID therapeutics.</p><p>4. Looking beyond COVID crisis, sees important secular forces of change playing out.</p><p>1. Has always understood that today's future is tomorrow's present, and that the best way to predict the future is to lead it.</p><p>5. Some contend the solutions for client needs will come from big tech.</p><p>1. Others argue Silicon Valley start-ups will bring next wave of change.</p><p>2. None of them have depth of knowledge of healthcare and IT.</p><p>3. None of them have same ability to impact last-mile provider workflow.</p><p>4. None of them have combination of entrepreneurial scale.</p><p>6. Co.'s value proposition has never been more relevant or more needed than it is in 2020.</p><p>1. Current crisis is mobilizing a new generation of Co.'s leaders to advance it.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Sean Dodge with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>THOMAS MICHAEL KELLIHER, ASSOCIATE, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Tom Kelliher on for Sean. Going on, on the VA implementation, can you give a little more color on what types of projects are still active? And how long this can sort of background work continue before the on-site work becomes essential? I'm still assuming that some of this work can be done simultaneously rather than sequential as sort of a catch-up when these travel restrictions are completely lifted.</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK, EXECUTIVE VP AND CHIEF CLIENT &amp; SERVICES OFFICER, CERNER CORPORATION: Yes, this is John. I'll address a couple of those issues. So the background work can continue and is continuing, and we're preparing for the first go-live and subsequent go-lives as well. And we're already making plans to be able to go on site. So we're working on everything from testing protocols and other things so that we're able to go-live. The exact dates of those, while not public, have been proposed, and we should be hearing something sometime in the near future more publicly about when those go-lives occur.</p><p>But I'm actually very pleased with how we're making progress in this sort of hybrid environment of virtual and limited on site. And we continue to progress as we would in any other project, given the types of restrictions we have, particularly around travel. But I see that moving forward, and we've already made plans to when we can go on site, how we'll activate and continue on.</p><p>THOMAS MICHAEL KELLIHER: Excellent. And then just another one real quick, and you'll spend a lot on R&amp;D., and kind of in the past, it sounded like there's some opportunities to rationalize or refocus some of the spend. How much of this has been done? And kind of what do you think the right amount is going forward from here?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, CERNER CORPORATION: Yes, this is Marc. We're an innovation company, so our widget, our strength is to invest in R&amp;D. So most of our work hasn't been necessarily focused on reducing R&amp;D. A lot of it's been focused on how can we maintain current levels of R&amp;D without increasing it, but deliver significantly more innovation from that spend. Certainly, the hiring of Jerome as our CTO is a great step in those -- in that direction.</p><p>We continue to work on the processes and how we develop, and certainly, with the modernization efforts that we're doing relative to our platform. The current spend level that we have, I think, is something we want to maintain. But I think for us, the goal is to figure out how we can get an even bigger bang for the buck and how we can get to market more quickly with our solutions. So we -- over time, if that doesn't grow relative to the rest of the revenue, we'll get some margin expansion opportunities. But I don't see us drastically cutting our innovation and the money we spend on R&amp;D.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.</p><p>ELIZABETH HAMMELL ANDERSON, ASSOCIATE, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: You talked a bunch about the demand environment as you're seeing it. But as you're looking forward, are you seeing any differentiation between places where COVID has sort of had a recent uptick versus not? Or are there any differences in terms of -- to think about in terms of like size of customer who are sort of able to look more longer term at this point versus not? Or would you say that your demand environment is fairly even all around?</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: This is John. If I understand the question correctly, I think it wouldn't come as a big surprise that where there's COVID surges and where there's not, there's differing -- different priorities in terms of what our clients are working on in the near term and those surge activities that have been occurring in different parts of the country in different parts of the world.</p><p>Now as a general statement, and I mentioned it in my side of the comments is, is that this is not stopping health care in its tracks. The initiatives that were going on, the strategies that are the broad health care environment we're embarking on, they're still incredibly relevant, if not, more relevant in the new world.</p><p>So the strategies that have been placed out in most clients, and regardless of where they are, frankly, in the U.S. or around the world, they want to continue those strategies and, in many cases, advance them more quickly. They are a big part of the recovery. So yes, there will be individual shifts as surges occur in different spots. But broadly, people remain focused and they want to advance their strategies.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG, PRESIDENT, CERNER CORPORATION: Yes. I'd just say one more thing, which is rather than geography, if we were to think about it relative to business model and mix, obviously, organizations that have provider-sponsored plans and are taking first-dollar risk, clearly, have had differentiated performance relative to their peers. And I think that's one of the reasons why we're excited about the capabilities that we've built off HealtheIntent, the partnership with Lumeris, we think strategies around risk will have a tailwind around them as we kind of get to that after COVID window and people start thinking about business model strategy go-forward.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Don, this is Marc. What about the Cures Act? Are we seeing a benefit from that client base?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think there's a set of things that are having uniform impact on kind of the financial health of our clients, and they start with the fact that the stimulus dollars have had big and impacts for those organizations. And I think most organizations would anticipate that there'll be additional stimulus dollars coming forward given the essential role that they played the last 90-plus days. And then I think beyond that, obviously, very focused, to John's point, on a durable revenue recovery, elective surgery recovery. And their hotspot dynamics do a role relative to the realities of what that does or doesn't look like.</p><p>ELIZABETH HAMMELL ANDERSON: That's very helpful. And then just in terms of your -- as a follow-up question, just in terms of your some of your recent revenues cycle management wins at Banner and elsewhere, can you talk about what people were particularly interested in, in terms of solutions that you guys can provide, either sort of new additions or the integration with the core network or whatever the case may be? That would be helpful.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Yes, it's a great question. So one of the things which clearly is top of mind right now for every health care organization is how they think about front-end access management. So strategies around how you engage the consumer, make it easy for them to think through registration and scheduling, help them think about that on a virtual basis increasingly. So I talk about touchless registration. That's the framework that I'm discussing. So the front end is a major area of focus and emphasis. And to John's point, it's one of the things that we're excited about around the R1 relationship. They have some capabilities like tonic for intake that we think will have big, big impact there. So that's a real focal point today.</p><p>And then, obviously, from a Banner perspective, beyond the front end, they're really looking for that opportunity for that integrated front, middle and back and our ability to deploy that. And we, to Marc's point, plan on delivering that from a solutions perspective, and in some cases, complemented by the capabilities of R1 as we think about the blend of technologies and services required to drive the financial metrics of those organizations.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.</p><p>ADAM CHASE NOBLE, EQUITY RESEARCH ASSOCIATE OF HEALTHCARE, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Adam Noble in for Kevin. I just want to talk about some of the kind of virtual go-lives or hybrid go-lives that you talked about. To what extent do you think those will really become the norm in the future? And beyond reimbursed travel, how could more virtual go-lives impact your revenue and margins for those implementations -- for that implementation?</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: Adam, this is John. I'll answer that in a general context as it relates to the go forward. And I mentioned a little bit in our -- in my comments, is that an absolute virtual, purely virtual go-live, they've actually gone pretty well. But the more complex a go-live is, the more difficult it is to do some of that stuff. So I believe that moving forward that we are going to bring this BMS hybrid model, where we don't bring as many people on-site and that we're able to use our virtual capabilities, our remote capabilities, our centralized capabilities to support these go-lives with fewer people on-site.</p><p>And they worked really well. The ones that we've done, both in a virtual, purely virtual that we did early in the quarter, they went very well. The ones that we've done in a hybrid model, they've been working very well as well.</p><p>In the context of the cost is -- travel is always a big part of the cost, both for our clients as we scope these projects out. And being able to limit that will not only be more cost-effective for our clients, but frankly, it should allow them to purchase more capability as well.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. This is Marc. When you think about it, when we travel an associate, they're traveling a half day out and half day back. So they can, in essence, build 4 day's worth of time. If they're doing work virtually, we can get a full 5 day's worth. So that's a 25% increase in their productivity. So if we continue to leverage the virtual nature, once again, to John's point, there are things we have to go on-site for. But if we're doing 85% to 90% of the work remotely as opposed to the 60% we were doing, that's all at a much higher efficiency, and therefore, overall lower cost and higher margin. So those are the things that, at least in that business for me, are somewhat the exciting opportunities from a virtual world.</p><p>ADAM CHASE NOBLE: Great. And as a follow-up question, could you remind me what the revenue contribution of any that you guys get from your Amwell telehealth partnership? And given the major surge of telehealth demand, have you considered restructuring that relationship or finding more direct ways to participate in the telehealth market, similar to some of your EMR competitors?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: This is Don. So I think, one, we think about virtual health more broadly than just our partnership with Amwell. So we're really thinking about, to John's construct, what is the mix of virtual and physical activity that's going to make up strategies around the person, the enterprise and the health network. So we have big strategies and investments in that space, and we think it will be a meaningful contributor to top line.</p><p>In terms of the Amwell partnership, as I indicated, at the network level, we feel very good about that partnership and the capabilities that we've been able to take to the market around it. But I think we have a broader view of what the opportunity looks like around virtual. And we think some of those opportunities will be in higher-acuity settings like e-hospital and the e-ICU where our CareAware platform becomes particularly differentiating.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.</p><p>ANNE ELIZABETH SAMUEL, ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Annie on for Lisa. Just one on the VA. Given some of the delays at the VA, do you see that impacting the timing of your target for a return to 5% to 8% growth?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes, this is Marc. Clearly, 2020, as we've talked about, is a reset year for the top line, right? We've just basically over the last kind of 6 quarters divested $330 million worth of revenue. So we're really re-basing the organization, focusing on the things that we think have high-growth potential and can drive operating margins. So I think from an overall revenue, to point to any particular business, we continue to be on track, relatively. I mean, we saw that as a fairly important part of our growth, and that is delivering as very close to what our expectations were, the ones that we shared with investors. So I think that continues to contribute.</p><p>But when you look at getting to the kind of the organic growth rates we've talked about, you've got to kind of -- we got to get through 2020. We've got to kind of rebase and reset our revenue. But all the things that Don is talking about, the focus that COVID is creating on the capabilities we have in our client base, some of the strategic growth initiatives that really complement that, I think we are well set up to continue growing once we get kind of the comparables wash through from these divestitures, which have all been done -- been a focus for us through the first half of the year, really getting those things taken care of.</p><p>Ideally, we're going to be able to spend the second half of the year looking for opportunities. We still like the opportunities of looking for potential acquisitions that we think can really leverage and drive forward some of our initiatives, particularly in this strategic growth area. And that will obviously contribute to some of the inorganic elements of growth.</p><p>But I think, overall, we're kind of asking investors, hey, let us get through 2020 and let's get the -- get you a good exit revenue number and then we'll lay out the growth strategies from there. But we should be consistent with what we've talked about because we don't see anything in the business or in the environment that changes our top line growth strategies, or expectations or the operating margin growth opportunities we've seen.</p><p>ANNE ELIZABETH SAMUEL: That's really helpful. And then maybe to your point on the strategic growth, are you finding that the disruption in the marketplace is opening up any potential opportunities for M&amp;A or new partnerships?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: It's a great question. So I talked about some of the areas inside the strategic growth side of the business that have real traction and trend. I think in particular, we've been very excited about the communication and hospital operation capabilities off of CareAware, very excited about the dialogue that's playing out around our consumer capabilities and consumer framework and see some interesting other pockets of growth and areas ranging from behavioral health to what we're doing in the workforce health place, all of which have been catalyzed by dynamics around COVID. So that's the first thing I would say.</p><p>The second thing I would say is build by partner strategies are a dimension of how all of those organizations think about going to market. And interestingly, we think that Cerner as a destination location for partnership has really been accelerated over the last 90 days. These earlier-stage companies don't have the same access to provider clients who are focused on COVID, and they're looking for partnership opportunities with Cerner as a means by which to create access to provider client base.</p><p>And then obviously, as Marc suggested, we're going to opportunistically think about acquisition opportunities contextual for those strategies. And if they can be catalytic and help us move further faster, those are things that we're going to look at in terms of deployment of capital, not only in the second half of the year, but going into 2021.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>RIVKA REGINA GOLDWASSER, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: So clearly, a lot of uncertainty around COVID. But maybe you can help us with just giving a little bit more color on what are the underlying assumptions for trajectory of COVID that are embedded in the low end of the revenue guidance range?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes, this is Marc. I think that as we look out across our client base and we look at our -- do our fairly rigorous forecasting activities that we do on a quarterly basis, that gives us a view of what we think the business is going to do. It includes backlog, it includes projects that we think we're going to be able to go work on, it includes all of those elements relative to the timing. So</p><p>I don't know that there's anything -- certainly, we would -- don't have built into our expectations that there's going to be a second wave of COVID that's going to shut everybody down. And that basically, they're going to go back into the mode of responding and not being able -- not be in a recovery mode that most of our clients are in now. With the Cures Act and with the reinvigoration of some of the elective procedures, they're a little bit back on track to some extent at this point.</p><p>So I don't know that there's any specific COVID -- we're not doing percentage points. We're not doing those types of activities. It is -- if there's something that's material that impacts our clients' ability to focus on the projects and the things that we're bringing to bear, yes, that could impact us. And that's one of the things we're talking about when we tell you that this is an environment that's got a lot of change.</p><p>The thing we do have is 85% of our revenue plus comes out of our backlog or highly recurring revenue. So for us, we've decided we're going to give guidance because we think we have a decent view of the business. Once again, COVID puts a bigger risk range to that, and -- but we think it's important that we can give people a view of what that looks like from a guidance perspective.</p><p>So I don't know that there's anything specific. And really, when you look at our revenue, there's very little this specific to certain health care volumes. So the real impact of the increase in COVID is the focus of our clients and being able to move forward on things that are in our forecast and that we are expecting to land.</p><p>So that's -- I don't know that can be any more precise because we're not tracking and say, if this case is go to this number, then our revenue is going to go to this number. It's just not the tight coupling that you might be expecting.</p><p>RIVKA REGINA GOLDWASSER: No, but it's helpful because I think the point is that it's about the second wave.</p><p>And then just in terms of clarification. You talked about 32% of contracts coming from long term. Is this just kind of like the nature of the current hospital spending environment where they're less focused on near-term projects, it's just that it's increased versus the strategic focus, right, on moving away from these long-term contracts? So is 32% just -- is a reflection of current environment? Or is this more of kind of like steady state that we should expect going forward as well?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. Just from a percentage, really, the 32% in is a little bit higher than the year ago quarter. But 30% is pretty consistent if you look across everything, but the year ago quarter. You would see it in the upper 20s or around 30%. So I don't think it happens. And John, if you want to comment on just these longer-term bookings, they include an expansion of most of the relationships.</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: My comment would be that the longer term and expansion are very complementary. That almost without exception, that when you do an expansion, it's inclusive of new solutions, it's inclusive of new capabilities as well as the extension of the current capabilities. So it's not one or the other, they're very complementary.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Steve Halper with Cantor Fitzgerald.</p><p>STEVEN PAUL HALPER, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a quick housekeeping question on the cash flow statement. That was an acquisition for $35 million. Could you just tell us what that was?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. No. We had -- it was a cybersecurity company that we acquired. We see that as an opportunity. We already offer those services to our professional services organization. But we think in the current environment, security has always been a big focus, and us, being able to bring on resources that have context in that, particularly context outside of our client base where we can extend that service capability beyond our existing clients with something that was attractive to us.</p><p>So pretty small, therefore, not -- other than be on the cash flow statement. It's not really something that we'd talked about a lot. But it's enhancing our capabilities in the cybersecurity space.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America Securities.</p><p>MICHAEL AARON CHERNY, DIRECTOR, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Thanks so much for the details so far. Maybe to pull at that string a little bit more from a future basis. I don't know if it was John or Don, you mentioned some of the dynamics regarding capital deployment going forward. Is there anything about COVID and the response that your customers are doing to COVID that potentially opens up various different avenues in terms of the type of acquisitions you might want to pursue in order to build out your service capabilities while also driving that incremental growth that's part of the long-term plan?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: That's a great question. I guess I would say -- kind of tethering to my earlier comments, I'd sort of start by saying all of the areas that we've made, capital allocation and bets in the strategic growth space are things that we like. And we felt like we're supported by macro trends that were playing out prior to COVID. So most of them, I would say, have seen acceleration as part of kind of pulling forward those secular trends that were already playing out.</p><p>So we loved the BH space before. We think it's going to be an area of growing crisis and focus going forward. The employer space was probably one that we were tooking -- took a real hard look at in terms of how to think about and focus that business. Again, that's an area where that relationship between employer and employee has never been more relevant and where that dialogue has never been more real time. So interesting dynamics there.</p><p>And then certainly, back over on the provider side of the business, interesting traction and trend around the acute assets from a CareAware perspective. The healthy intent space, we think, is interesting. This probably isn't the time when I'm going to stand up a provider-sponsored plan. I'm trying to work through a pandemic and crisis setting. But we think that's one on a 3-year basis that looks pretty interesting to providers as they really step back and say, what's it look like to take more control over my top line revenue and my go-forward business strategy.</p><p>So I think each of them have individual dimensions around them, but I think in the main, because they were tethered to larger macro trends that were playing out, we feel like most of what's playing out there has been accelerated.</p><p>And then finally, just to kind of reiterate what I said earlier, absolutely, if there's an opportunity for us to accelerate those strategies through acquisition in an area like cyber, then we're going to look to do that. And we've got a set of business leaders in space that are absolutely capable of integrating those acquisitions and using them to scale their larger growth strategies.</p><p>MICHAEL AARON CHERNY: And just as a quick follow-up to that. Marc, you mentioned the capital availability you have. Obviously, the balance sheet has long been one that's been very clean. Is there any thought or any openness to more exploring utilization of the balance sheet in the event that something more sizable, whether it's an internal investment or potential acquisition, would come along?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Sure. No, I mean we've -- part of our strategy was to have dry powder available, right? So we do have a strong balance sheet. We've traditionally done kind of smaller tuck-in acquisitions. Lumeris is a larger investment that we made, similar to what Don was talking about, is an area that we see as growth, provider-sponsored plans. But I think from -- we are well situated, given our balance sheet, to be able to start looking at some things that might be more sizable. As most of you know, doing any M&amp;A that size transaction moderately increases the difficulty. So doing things that can have a big impact on our growth and certainly help leverage some of our existing thoughts.</p><p>So I think the things that Don was talking about, I think he -- certainly, one of the additional things he would probably certainly put on that list would be the data space. Because once again, we're looking for things that we can acquire -- the issue -- for Millennium, we don't want -- we're going to innovate on Millennium. We're going to create our own modernization. But where we can invest is primarily in the things in Don's area, in the strategic growth.</p><p>And Don, I don't know if you want to talk -- hit the data topic just a little bit to give some ideas as kind of...</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Yes. No, it's another good example, I think, of where it has been interesting in terms of reinforcing a thesis. So if you look at the release of information side of that business, from an organic perspective, how to do virtual and touchless release of information for legal and life insurance, workmen's comp, it's got a lot of traction and trend around it.</p><p>I think more interestingly, from -- to Marc's point, from a learning health network perspective, the team setting up a structure around that with other 40 participating organizations in the first half of the year, I mean, very impressive against that full year goal achieved at the midyear. And what that tells me is that these organizations are thinking about data and analytics, contextual for what's buying out with COVID. Many of them see interesting opportunities to advance research strategies around it to participate in research economics. And those are things that aren't going to be unique or point in time to COVID. They're things that are going to absolutely accelerate on a multi-quarter basis. And if we could do an acquisition in that space and use it as a way to catalyze the move forward, we would.</p><p>OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Jeff Garro with William Blair &amp; Company.</p><p>JEFFREY ROBERT GARRO, RESEARCH ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: A couple of quick ones for me. Managed services were mentioned a couple of times as a positive bookings area in the quarter. So I'm curious what's driving demand for what I would expect is mostly hosting, and how we should view that as a positive long-term indicator for platform modernization.</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: So in terms of managed services, it is -- there is hosting involved in that, but there's other things involved it as well as we surround most of our solutions with some type of managed services. So in many ways, I view expansion and extension of managed services directly related to expansion and extension of solutions. So for me, it's an incredibly positive thing. We need to run, care for and support all solutions we put out there.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: And this is Marc. To the extent that the element is hosting, it's definitely a positive indication of when we're moving to the cloud, right? Because, in essence, our hosted solutions are private cloud for those clients who are using it. So they're used to having someone else handle all of that and do the work and be able to depend on that infrastructure at a very high level of reliability. And we have that reputation in the industry, well earned. So that's -- so it is definitely a positive as we go forward to more of a cloud-based opportunity in the future.</p><p>JEFFREY ROBERT GARRO: Great. That makes sense. And the second one for me, probably for John. Just curious if there's any change in client receptivity to SaaS offerings versus licensed software that would require larger capital expenditures given the current environment for providers.</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: Yes. I won't speak to the capital side, but I will speak to the receptiveness side. I think that there is a lot of interest in SaaS offerings. It's sort of a pay-as-you-go type of model. And what clients are really interested in is just being a very specific and intentional for what they use and how they use it. So yes, I think the SaaS business model or the SaaS offering, which we do offer many of our solutions in that model, is attractive and allows people to consume what they use.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. I'd just remind people that half of our license revenue today is Saas so...</p><p>OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.</p><p>ERIC R. PERCHER, RESEARCH ANALYST, NEPHRON RESEARCH LLC: Marc, did you give a number for COVID impact similar to the $30 million? I believe you had projected something around $95 million last quarter.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: I do not recall if I did.</p><p>ALLAN KELLS, VP, IR, CERNER CORPORATION: Eric, this is Allan. There's really -- it's difficult to give a precise number, but I think our point is, is that we essentially flowed through for the rest of the year a similar impact and looked at our forecast a little bit differently for things like reimbursed travel that was less than half of what we had projected and adjusted for that. So for the most part, I'd say, other than taking out the sale of the rest of our RevWorks business, the rest of the change is largely COVID, inclusive of the amount we missed Q2 by relative to our guidance.</p><p>ERIC R. PERCHER: Got you. That's helpful. We can back into that. And then, Marc, the areas of weakness you've seen, it doesn't feel like anything that would necessarily tell us any changes in the way backlog or bookings convert into revenue. But as you've thought it through the risks to plan, how do you think about what might be meaningful in terms of changing the book-to-bill?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. I think that certainly, as we move forward and kind of resettle 2020, keep in mind that any historical bookings have -- many of them have a chunk of RevWorks sales in them, right? So those are things we're not doing now. So you're going to have a little bit of a challenge with comparability of bookings in terms of the booking ratio. But clearly, once we -- kind of we work our way through 2020, we're going to have to be growing bookings at or above the rate of which we're growing revenues. I mean that's just -- that's a given.</p><p>And I think you're taking away the appropriate point is the adjustments we're making here to are the things that are a little bit more tactical, a little bit more quarter-up type of bookings rather than some of the 12-month sales cycle type of things that we have.</p><p>And based on our pipeline, based on what we're seeing, the opportunities are still there. Clients are as excited or more excited about what's the what they can get from us and what that does to help them deliver care than we've seen. I mean, it continues to be an active environment. Clearly, our caution is that COVID is going to impact things, and we're trying to give you our best view. But our view is based on backlog, based on the hard mechanics of doing a pretty rigorous forecast.</p><p>Once again, can't foresee everything. Clearly, in Q2, we didn't see that tech resale will go significantly lower. And certainly, we didn't see that reimbursed travel was going to fall off a cliff completely as it did. So still, things that are being impacted. Even the federal business is going to be impacted at some point by the COVID. But based on our current view of what we expect to deliver, we're on track for that. So our plan is based on our best view, and our guidance is based on our plan. So that's the best we can kind of provide at this time.</p><p>ERIC R. PERCHER: That's helpful, particularly the federal commentary. Thank you.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Why don't we take one more question?</p><p>OPERATOR: And that question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.</p><p>GEORGE ROBERT HILL, MD &amp; EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Thanks for sneaking me in under the wire. I'll let Marc and Don kind of tag team this one. I guess one of the macro themes of the COVID environment has been telemedicine. I guess, from a telemedicine perspective, can you talk about the demand that you're seeing from your clients? I guess, is this something that you guys feel like you have to own?</p><p>And maybe talk about the build versus buy approach to it? I know you guys have the relationship with Amwell and just I guess, kind of talk about how -- I remember when we used to fly out to Kansas City, when we could still all fly, we would do the pop health visits and talk about centralized patient monitoring and centers initiatives there. Just trying to think about, I guess, how you guys are bridging, what was the prior view of that business to what is the future view of that business as it relates to telemedicine post COVID? I know that was complicated.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: No, that's a good question, George. Maybe I'll start, and if Marc wants to amplify on it, he can. But first and foremost, I think this concept of a virtual health system or system of health is one that's been sort of central to the thinking of the company for a long time. You're right, we've had strategies, both in low-acuity settings that we've experimented with over the years, we've had strategies tethered to intensivist dynamics around virtual Inet and other strategies in the space. So I think we have a pretty informed view, in my opinion, about what it takes to deliver on the provider supply side and what the expectations around clients are going to look like.</p><p>Having said that, you've got accommodative, administrative environment relative to tele, a major shift in reimbursement, shifts in licensure. Those things are all playing out. And I think organizations are experimenting with a lot of different strategies. So it would be very typical for John and I to have conversations with a client and for them to have multiple telehealth strategies that they're pursuing in the current environment.</p><p>At the end of the day, what we think that ends up netting out to, George, is, a, better sophistication around these organizations around what the combination of virtual and physical needs to look like. Most importantly, contextual for the regulatory and the reimbursement model. We think that certain areas of this space, particularly higher-acuity areas in the enterprise setting and at the network level, sensitive areas like BH, end up being areas where we can particularly create niche capability with the margin profile that we're looking for.</p><p>And then I think importantly, just to tether to something that John said earlier, we're going to think about it from a total solution perspective. So the accommodative environment that we have around things like cyber and security right now, that pendulum will swing back. And so it will create interesting opportunities for us to think about, areas like cybersecurity, where we've made big investments contextual for strategies like tele as we see increased sensitivity to what the go-forward strategies need to look like in a different regulatory and administrative environment.</p><p>So we think we have multiple strategies afoot. We think those strategies are going to have interesting top line and bottom line dynamics to it. And it's not as binary as build or buy, I think we're going to do a mix of things to create something that's going to have tangible impact on the top line.</p><p>DAVID BRENT SHAFER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, CERNER CORPORATION: Well, I want to thank everyone for their time this afternoon. Once again, please be safe and take care of yourself and your families, and good afternoon.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Positions Co. for continued growth going forward.</p><p>2Q20 Financials (E.R.)</p><p>1. Note:</p><p>1. Will periodically refer to non-GAAP measures like EBITDA etc.</p><p>2. Financials:</p><p>1. Total revenue grew 15%.</p><p>1. Oasis contributed approx. little bit less than 9% to this growth.</p><p>2. Expenses $649m.</p><p>1. Increased 18%.</p><p>2. Similar to last qtr., increases in compensation-related costs, PEO direct insurance costs and amortization of intangible assets, contributed to total expense growth.</p><p>3. Total expense growth was primarily driven by Oasis acquisition.</p><p>3. Operating income $342m.</p><p>1. Increased 11%.</p><p>2. Operating margin 34.5%.</p><p>3. EBITDA increased 16%.</p><p>1. EBITDA margin, approx. 40%; increased slightly YoverY.</p><p>4. Operating margin declined due to amortization of intangibles associated with Oasis acquisition.</p><p>4. Other expense, net, $5m includes interest expense of approx. $8m related to long-term borrowings.</p><p>1. Borrowed $800m bonds to fund a portion of Oasis purchase price.</p><p>5. Effective tax rate 23.2%.</p><p>1. 2Q19 23.8%.</p><p>6. Net income $259m.</p><p>1. Increased 10%.</p><p>2. Adjusted net income $254m.</p><p>1. Increased 8%.</p><p>7. Diluted EPS $0.72.</p><p>1. Up 11%.</p><p>2. Adjusted diluted EPS $0.70.</p><p>1. Increased 8%.</p><p>3. Received a little over $0.01 of benefit from stock-based comp payments during 2Q, which is included for GAAP, but Co. excluded it for adjusted diluted EPS.</p><p>3. Other Financials:</p><p>1. Total service revenue $971m.</p><p>1. Grew 15%.</p><p>2. Management Solutions revenue $727m.</p><p>1. Increased 6%.</p><p>3. PEO and Insurance Services $244m.</p><p>1. Increased 57%.</p><p>2. Management Solutions revenue grew 6%.</p><p>1. Exceeded expectations.</p><p>2. Included contribution from Oasis of slightly less than 1%.</p><p>3. Remaining growth was primarily driven by increases in client bases across many of Co.'s services, along with growth in revenue per client.</p><p>1. Revenue per client improved due to higher price realization and increased penetration of Co.'s suite of solutions, particularly time and attendance, retirement services, and HR outsourcing.</p><p>2. This has been a focus of Co.'s efforts over last several years.</p><p>3. Growth in revenue per client has seen a pretty steady increase.</p><p>4. Retirement services revenue benefited from increase in asset fee revenue earned on asset value of participant funds.</p><p>3. PEO and Insurance Services revenue grew 57%, largely due to Oasis acquisition, which contributed 47% to this growth.</p><p>1. Increase reflects growth in clients and client worksite employees across Co.'s existing PEO business.</p><p>2. Insurance Services revenue benefited from increase in number of health and benefit applicants, partially offset by impact of softness in workers' compensation premiums as Co. has been discussing all year.</p><p>4. Interest on funds held for clients $20m.</p><p>1. Increased 9%, primarily due to higher realized gain, avg. investment balances and interest rates.</p><p>2. Funds held for clients avg. investment balances were impacted by wage inflation.</p><p>3. Increases within Co.'s base were offset by changes in client base mix and timing of collections and remittances.</p><p>4. Investment Portfolio:</p><p>1. Investing in high credit quality securities.</p><p>2. Long-term portfolio:</p><p>1. Avg. yield 2.1%.</p><p>2. Avg. duration 3.1 years.</p><p>3. Combined portfolios earned avg. rate of return of 2%.</p><p>1. Up from 2Q19's 1.9%.</p><p>5. YTD:</p><p>1. Revenues:</p><p>1. Total $2b.</p><p>1. Up 15%.</p><p>2. Service $1.9b.</p><p>1.

Up 10%.</p><p>4. Net income and diluted EPS each increased 9% to $523m and $1.45 per share respectively.</p><p>1. Adjusted net income $511m.</p><p>1. Increased 7%.</p><p>2. Adjusted diluted EPS $1.42.</p><p>1. Increased 8%.</p><p>6. 2Q20-end Financial Position:</p><p>1. Cash, restricted cash, total corporate investments, $708m.</p><p>2. Funds held for clients $3.7b.</p><p>1. As of 05/31/19, $3.8b.</p><p>2. Vary widely on day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7b for 2Q.</p><p>3. Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $39m.</p><p>1. As of 05/31/19, $20m.</p><p>4. Total stockholders' equity, as of 11/30/19, $2.6b, reflecting $444m in dividends paid and $172m of shares repurchased during 1H20.</p><p>5. ROE for past 12 months, 42%.</p><p>6. 1H20:</p><p>1. Cash flows from operations $565m.</p><p>1. Increased 14% YoverY, primarily driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments.</p><p>2. Increase in non-cash adjustments was primarily due to higher amortization expense, largely driven by intangible assets acquired through Oasis acquisition.</p><p>7. 2020 Guidance:</p><p>1. Outlook is based on current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes, though Co. has reflected impact of three interest rate cuts that have already occurred this FY.</p><p>2. Provided update to guidance.</p><p>3. Management Solutions revenue:</p><p>1. Has been trending positively.</p><p>2. To grow in the range of 5.0-5.5%.</p><p>1. Raised from previous guidance of approx. 5% growth.</p><p>3. Doing well in almost all of the buckets that comprise that revenue stream.</p><p>4. PEO and Insurance Services:</p><p>1. To grow in the range of 25-30%.</p><p>2. Got off to a slow start with Oasis, slower than Co. anticipated.</p><p>1. Still maintains strong long-term outlook.</p><p>2. Continues to execute on plans to integrate PEO business.</p><p>5. Interest on funds held for clients:</p><p>1. To grow approx. 4%, modified from a range of 4-8%, Co. started the year.</p><p>1. This simply reflects the most recent federal fund rate cuts.</p><p>6. Diluted EPS growth has been increased to range of 9-10% growth.</p><p>1. Raised from guidance of approx. 9%.</p><p>7. Other guidance remains unchanged.</p><p>1. Total revenue, 10-11%.</p><p>2. Operating income, as percent of total revenue, approx. 36%.</p><p>3. EBITDA margin, approx. 41%.</p><p>4. Effective income tax rate, 24.0-24.5%.</p><p>5. Net income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are all expected to grow at approx. 9%.</p><p>8. 2H20 Outlook:</p><p>1. PEO and Insurance revenues are now anticipated to grow in range of 25-30%.</p><p>1. While 2Q20 results were within range provided, 56-60%, Co. has taken a more conservative approach for 2H20, given current trends.</p><p>1. Particularly, Co. has continued to experience lower workers' compensation insurance rate that have moderated its Insurance Services growth.</p><p>2. Anticipates this trend will likely ease as Co. enters next FY.</p><p>2. Seeing modestly lower at-risk insurance attachment in PEO.</p><p>1. This change reflects impacts from slower start from Oasis acquisition.</p><p>2. Anticipates growth for 3Q PEO and Insurance will be approx. 10%.</p><p>2. Management Solutions guidance was increased to range of 5.0-5.5% growth from previous guidance of approx. 5%, due to favorable trends seen in 1H20.</p><p>1. This incorporates higher-than-anticipated growth achieved in 2Q and assumes 3Q will come in at full-year range.</p><p>3. [Immaterial impact of Oasis revenue reclass (4Q19)]:</p><p>1. As-adjusted numbers represent the base on which Co. applies growth rates it is guiding to in Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance revenues.</p><p>1. Looking at analysts models, two-thirds do it that way and one-third have split between 3Q and 4Q.</p><p>2. By looking at that number, analysts can adjust their models correctly.</p><p>4. Operating margins, which for full-year are anticipated to be approx. 36%, do vary quarterly.</p><p>1. Margins for 2Q exceeded previous guidance range of 33-34%.</p><p>1. This beat was impacted by delays in hiring related to tight labor market.</p><p>2. Still anticipates margins of approx. 38% for 2H20.</p><p>2. Expects to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing in 2H20, while still achieving target of a full-year operating margin of approx. 36%.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays.</p><p>RAMSEY CLARK EL-ASSAL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to ask about the trend and the lower workers' comp insurance rates, and I just was trying to get an idea of your visibility to how those rates trend. How do you -- what gives you confidence about those rates over time going into next year? I think you indicated sort of becoming more favorable. What type of reads do you gain on that rate?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA, SENIOR VP, CFO &amp; TREASURER, PAYCHEX, INC.: Well, I'd say a couple things. One is that because we had an insurance agency and our pricing policies on a virtually daily basis, we get a sense -- a pretty clear sense of where that pricing is trending. That's one part. The second is it's influenced by what state Workers' Compensation Board, where they're setting pricing, and we know we have a pretty good sense of what states are contemplating or have contemplated changes in workers' compensation insurance. So I think the combination of those, and then the final thing is we're looking at the mix of revenue quarter-by-quarter, and we know that we started the year with a strong compare, and it starts to ease as we get into the back half year a little bit.</p><p>RAMSEY CLARK EL-ASSAL: Got it. Okay. And then could you talk about your retention trends and the degree to which those trends are, I would imagine, moving in the right direction, giving you confidence in terms of raising the management solutions segment guidance for the year?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, PAYCHEX, INC.: Yes. We're continuing to see pretty much near-record levels on retention across both small and midsized clients. We're seeing very good retention numbers, and so they've been very solid. And you know how conservative we are, as we look forward, we still think they're going to -- we're going to maintain that going forward. So we feel that the value of the products, obviously, and along with the needs of the clients during this -- particularly this kind of tight labor market, I think are really keeping the retention. And we're not seeing out of businesses really increase either. So all -- both from an environment and from our performance, I think are both keeping our retention numbers at record levels.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p><p>KEVIN DAMIEN MCVEIGH, MD, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Seems like the organic growth, particularly in managed services, is settling in at higher levels despite much tough comps. Can you just frame out like how much of that is retention? Because -- and Marty, I know you mentioned kind of maintaining those levels. Is it possible you kind of set a new level based on more the SaaS offering as opposed to the traditional service? So maybe just the sensitivity on SaaS for service, and what that can do to the retention over the course of time?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think it certainly does. I think we're appealing to the clients the way they want to be served, as I mentioned earlier, and their employees. The employees are playing a pretty strong role these days, more than, I think, ever in the past. As you see the mobile app, 70% of the usage of the mobile app is the employee of the client. And so they're having a bigger impact on retention, and we started talking about that a couple of years ago.</p><p>So I think that, that does have an opportunity. The issue, though, is still when you see improvement, particularly on the small client bases, there are so many businesses that go out of business every year, and we've been in this a long time, and it hasn't changed that dramatically. So what I think where you do have room for improvement is certainly from a service value standpoint. I think the need for clients' small businesses, midsized businesses to have software-as-a-service, to have mobile apps, to have self-service available to their employees, all those things are making them more valuable and stickier, I would say, to a client.</p><p>So we certainly see some -- we're optimistic, but we still also know that so many businesses start-up and go out of business on the small end.</p><p>KEVIN DAMIEN MCVEIGH: And then just to follow up on that, Marty, real quick. If it's -- if you're bumping up at that 82% level, any sense of how much of that is failures versus maybe other parts that are driving the attrition?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: I think if you put all together, kind of no employees, out of business, bought or acquired, it's typically been 50%-plus a little bit. So that accounts for about half of it, and a little bit more even sometimes, and then the other pieces are price and it's still just as competitive as it's always been, hasn't really increased. But that number has been pretty consistent and then service value kind of stuff. So I'd say 50% to 60%, if you rolled all those things together, are kind of out-of-control type of thing.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of James Berkley with Wolfe Research.</p><p>JAMES ROBERT BERKLEY, RESEARCH ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH, LLC: So just a quick question on the PEO side. Would it be possible just to break out in more detail, just kind of that segment, PEO and insurance separately? How bookings have been trending on the PEO side? And maybe how much of the guidance drop was attributable to Oasis, which you expect to turn around?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Well, let me start, and I'll have Efrain jump in. I think what we've seen there is, one, we have our -- we think the market is still very strong for PEO in particular. So the demand continues to be strong. You're still seeing a very tight labor market, so they're looking for help in recruiting and retaining employees. They're looking for benefit packages that will retain employees and HR, kind of mobile app and strength to not only recruit but retain in that mid-market -- small-ended market. The other thing is that the integration of Oasis certainly has impacted this somewhat. We got off to a slower start. We mentioned it in the first quarter last year. We really began the active integration around June, so about 6 months ago. And once we started aligning underwriting procedures, sales comp models, service processes and those things, it kind of slowed our sales cadence down at Oasis, and it was definitely impacted by underwriting. We've always been very tight on the underwriting side. We wanted the processes to be very tight, and so that gave a slower ramp-up to the sales, and then we had to ramp up the sales headcount, and that was a little slower than we expected. Now we're at that full -- near that full ramp-up of the sales headcount, and also, we got through a couple of insurance renewals. It's always important to kind of see where we're coming out for the first time with a major integration like that with insurance renewals, and we came through fine. But that and the underwriting, I think certainly, it impacted some existing clients. Now that all -- we're that -- we're through that, we have a much better sense of the first year of Oasis and where we're going to come out for this first fiscal year -- the remainder of the first fiscal year. We think the market is very strong. Our organic PEO business, non-acquisition, was very strong year-to-date. And so we feel still very strong about it. We just got off to a slower start than we thought, and that's going to impact the full year's performance.</p><p>JAMES ROBERT BERKLEY: I guess asked another way, if it's okay, would -- if you didn't do the Oasis acquisition, would have organic PEO growth been in line with expectations? Like would that have been unchanged?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: I think it would have been pretty much unchanged. I mean when you look -- because we feel very -- we're actually performing -- sales have been stronger than we expected in our organic PEO business. And so yes, I think it would have been stronger. I mean this is -- we really feel like this is kind of around first part of the integration, and although we've had the company -- we purchased the company in December, we kind of let the fiscal year play out. We had a number of things we were organizing around, running some synergies than in our beginning of our fiscal year, we kind of put new processes in place. And frankly it had a little bit stronger impact than we thought in slowing things down from a sales and even retention perspective. Now we've kind of got that turned around, and we just wanted to make sure we're conservative kind of on the rest of the year and how that'll come out. But we feel very good about the market, and yes, it would have been stronger. If you just look at without the integration, we certainly would have been above, I think, our expectations on PEO-only side.</p><p>JAMES ROBERT BERKLEY: That's great to hear. And obviously doing really well on the merchant -- I mean on the management solutions side as well. And so just last question on that point. Just given the tight labor market, any thoughts -- incremental thoughts on kind of where we are in the economic cycle? How you think about things like labor participation rate, how much slack there might be left in that? And room for you guys to run on the small business side?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think we're still feeling pretty strongly about how the market is -- how the market outlook is. The optimism still, it bounces around a little bit, business optimism, but what we're seeing is the wage increases are the highest, as I said, since 2011, from small businesses under 50 employees. This is what's in that watch. And the hours worked are up also for the highest in like 3 years. So we look at that as demand for the employees. So the business is -- the toughest thing for small, in particular, small, but midsize businesses right now is, I can't find the people to finish -- to get the work done for the demand I have. That, to me, points to a pretty strong economy still, and that's how it feels to us. When hours worked are up and the wages are up, it's because, hey, I've got the demand and -- from client -- from customers that want that. So I think that's very good. The tariffs and the trade issues, we've seen impact roughly 1/3, maybe 25% to 1/3 of small businesses. Most of those are much more regional, and so they're not going to be impacted by that. The 1/3 -- 25% or 1/3 that are impacted by tariffs and so forth have had a harder time, but most small businesses are not impacted by that.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT, SENIOR MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Good to see the strength in bookings in the quarter. Could you perhaps dimension the rate of growth that you've seen, Marty, both in the small business managed solutions market and also mid-market? And then you called out strength from a macro standpoint. Any additional color about which solutions are getting the most traction, where you think you might be gaining market share?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think one, retirement continues to be very strong, and I think the SECURE Act, I think most of you probably know, got through the House yesterday and it's headed for the Senate. If that gets approved, that's giving tax credits for new retirement plans. And I think that would continue to be a boost for small businesses starting retirement plans. And we continue to be just very solid on retirement services, both what we would call large market and small market, generally are doing very well. Time and attendance, when you think about the overtime changes that have been recently made in providing overtime to more, it's hitting more employees of our clients. Time and attendance continues to be very strong double-digit growth as well. And we're -- we try to stay -- we've really stayed, I think, ahead of even the market from a technology standpoint. So it's not just the old punch cards, it's finger scan, which has now gone to eye scan, which has gone to face scan, and now wearables, we'll be introducing very soon that you can punch in and punch out on your on your watch. And these are all things that are being demanded by clients. So I think time and attendance, retirement, certainly HR overall, and the technology that goes with that, meaning I want to see data analytics that help me as a small or midsized business compared to other businesses. We have that database that other clients -- our other businesses don't have. We can use data from 600,000-plus clients that say, hey, here's what your turnover looks like compared to others, here's what your wages look like. So I think data analytics in HR and all of those things all are pretty strong. And so overall, we see pretty good growth. Now we're heading into -- we're in the selling season, so it's too early. We really need third quarter to kind of give us that look on sales. But so far, year-to-date sales have been good, and particularly in the mid-market, we feel very strong about the pickup that the products have done in the marketplace.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>STEVEN MATTHEW WALD, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: So just maybe going through the pieces of the revenue guide. I know you guys didn't change the overall revenue guidance. But if I look at your adjusted numbers, I believe, Efrain, we talked about this after last quarter, the 2 different adjustments you made there and sort of map out those pieces of your segment guidance. Sort of getting to a 9% to 11% range, at the bottom and top end of those pieces added together, is that generally how we should be thinking about it? It sort of seems like at the midpoint, you'd be at the low end of your prior 10% to 11% guidance, that's not changed.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. I don't think you're far off, Steven. I think that, that's fair.</p><p>STEVEN MATTHEW WALD: Okay. Cool. I just wanted to make sure I understood that. And then -- because I know this caused some questions last quarter. The Oasis components, I know that you reclassified a piece of it last quarter as to how to think about it. But I think in the press release, you said it added about 1% to the management solution. So should we think about it as Oasis minus $7 million to $8 million is all in the PEO and the rest goes into management solutions?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. I'd have to -- I'm doing mental math really quickly. I think it's a little bit lower, maybe $6 million to $7 million, but I'm not looking at the detail, but I don't think that's far off.</p><p>STEVEN MATTHEW WALD: Okay. Yes. Just wanted to make sure I was clear on those things.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.</p><p>ANDREW OWEN NICHOLAS, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just wanted to talk a little bit about technology in the PEO business. I was wondering if you could talk maybe about your plans for Oasis, and maybe even HROI from a tech perspective. Are both businesses still running on a third-party software? Or are there plans to transition to an internal proprietary software in the near to medium term? And then maybe relatedly, I was just wondering if you could maybe speak to big tech capabilities of your PEO business relative to the competition?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think the capabilities -- well, first of all, yes, they're both on third party and license software. And so far, that seems to be going very well. So we're watching that closely, but we're not looking to necessarily move to any quick integration or client conversion to disrupt the base or anything like that.</p><p>So we think that the third-party software is doing fine, and in fact, gets upgraded pretty consistently, and so we feel good about that. The integration, we're tying it in as much as possible to our products as well.</p><p>So I think the technology that we're focused on with the HROI and Oasis is how to tie it into our -- for our retirement integration, into our retirement, time and attendance and so forth, so that they can benefit most from those products, and that's going well. And so we'll determine over time whether it makes sense to get them to our PEO in-house product or not. I think you never want to necessarily move clients through a conversion if you don't have to and if that's taking care of it, we're still continuing to watch that. It's not a focus right now. Our technology on the PEOs that we feel is very competitive. We can see, as I said, the demand is good in the street, and we're selling well, particularly on the organic side, if you look kind of non-acquisition and integration, we're doing very well on the organic PEO, and in fact, are ahead of sales. So I think our product is performing very well competitively in the marketplace.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Just to add a little bit more color there, Andrew. So our -- we run on both the Flex platform for our PEO business and we also run on a third-party software, which many of you know what it is. But it's a customized instance of that software. So there have been a lot of upgrades and adjustments -- enhancements made to that system. And I think the challenge, as Marty mentioned, is with those customizations and enhancements over time, we want to figure out what the right decision is in terms of bringing all one -- on our internal platform, and that will take a little time to sort out.</p><p>ANDREW OWEN NICHOLAS: Makes sense. That's very helpful. And then maybe sticking with the PEO space. Just wondering if you could update us on your appetite for M&amp;A there. And maybe more broadly, how you would characterize pricing in this space? And last thing there would be, does some of the slower-than-expected start with Oasis tied to kind of integration issues change that appetite at all?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. Let me start at the end and go back. I think, yes, with any integration, when you update -- and they -- and remember, Oasis has had a number of companies as well, and so we had to go across the number of companies that they had acquired as well. We wanted to be sure that we felt comfortable with all the underwriting processes, the sales comp models, getting tighter process on service. When we pull all that stuff together, you have some consternation that goes on and some slower ramp-up of hiring of the sales folks, et cetera. And we really think that was tied to just getting things all aligned, and we really didn't push those things until about June into the summer, and so that put us a little bit behind this year as far as starting out. So think it was really geared around that.</p><p>M&amp;A, still very interested. Certainly always looking at what opportunities are there. From a -- when you talk about pricing, if it's pricing of the M&amp;A, the valuations are still, I think, pretty high, but it all depends. There's so many PEOs, it's such a fragmented environment, but there's a lot of opportunity, I think, out there, and we're just trying to make sure that we get the right valuations. From a pricing -- from the market standpoint, I think we're extremely competitive. I don't think the competition in that market has changed very much, and I think we're very competitive, and we're seeing that by being above sales -- our sales forecast in the first part of the year with our organic PEO. So where there's no distractions or anything at the beginning of the first half of the year, we've seen very good sales results from our organic PEO.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG, MD IN US EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to ask a follow-up, just on Oasis. Just so we have the numbers right. I think originally, the expectation was for Oasis to generate $335 million to</p><p>$375 million in revenue this year. Can you just help us get a sense of what the new range would look like, obviously just given the integration challenges that you talked about?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: I think, Jason, we're still in that range, but we're certainly towards the lower end of that range.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Okay. Got it. And then just on the sales force side of Oasis. I mean, I guess as you went through the integration process, was there any unexpected uptick in voluntary turnover among Oasis salespeople?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes, Jason, I think we lost a few. It was a very -- we started making changes to underwriting process and sales comp and things like that at the beginning. It's pretty minor number. But we lost a few, because at the same time you had some PE firms buying up a couple of other small companies that were trying to attract sales reps. So I think we lost a few. I wouldn't say it was -- it was not a big number, and then that put us a little behind ramping up the sales force to the number that we wanted, which we're back at now. So that's a bit of what we encountered at the beginning.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Okay. And then just a final clarification, Efrain. Just on the EPS side, I know, because there's a couple of EPSs out there. So diluted EPS, you did uptick, but your adjusted EPS growth expectations are unchanged, correct? And I think that's the number you focus on more.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: That's correct. Because -- yes, that's reflecting -- well, we focused on both, Jason, but that's reflecting taxes. I mean look, I get the question frequently, why do you guys call that out? I think in an effort to be transparent about what we think is underlying operating performance and what's underlying financial performance. Underlying operating performance, we exclude the impact of stock comp. Not everyone does, we do. And then financial performance is what it is. So that's what we're trying to be clear on.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG, SENIOR ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: The ancillary services. Can you give us an update on penetration from the services like time attendance and retirement services? How much more room is there to go?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Tien-Tsin, sorry for the mispronunciation, but for some reason, at the beginning of the question, we didn't -- you didn't come in.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: You cut out. Yes.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: So we didn't hear the full question. So to answer it, if you -- could you repeat it? You mind repeating it?</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Yes. No, happy to. Hopefully, this is a little better. Just the penetration rate of some of the ancillary services? Like time and attendance, retirement services, I think both were called out as being positive. Where are you in that?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. We're definitely picking up. We don't give detailed penetration rates on those, but we definitely are picking up penetration across the baseline time and attendance, retirement continues to go up. The other thing on retirement that has been very helpful to us is in the mobile app, we've not -- we have released probably 6 months ago, where you could sign up on the mobile app, I think I've talked about it before, as opposed to all of the paper that employees of our clients would go through. So the participation rate is up and that's now retaining more 401(k) clients that otherwise would have dropped out because they didn't have the correct participation of their employee base. So we're -- not only are the sales stronger, but the retention of 401(k) and retirement is stronger as well. Health and benefit insurance up -- ticking up a bit as well. Of course, we're still strong on the insurance side, and we've linked the PEO to our agency. Being a top-20 agency we have -- if you don't qualify for underwriting in the PEO, we take you over to the insurance agency to write you. We have a very unique offering at that point by the ability to do that. So I think all have picked up pretty strongly. Those are certainly the best that I can think of right off hand right now.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. So Tien-Tsin, we fully update those at year-end. But I think just to underscore what Marty said, we're trending above where we ended last year. And if you look at it from a revenue standpoint and break out the revenue on each of those areas that we called out time and attendance, HR and retirement services, those are trending above where management solutions as a whole is growing. So we're experiencing good results. And by the way, just want to make sure that it's clear. That is our strategy. Our strategy is to approach a client and sell them on the full bundle, which is why we present the revenue in the way we do.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Right. Yes. No, it's been clear you want to drive up revenue per. So I get that. So just as a quick follow-up then. And I know, Marty, you mentioned -- I remember last quarter you talked about improving enrollment on 401(k), what have you. So sensitivity to AUM and asset value, given some of the move up here, I'm curious is there an update or any rule of thumb we can use? Because the equity market has been strong, it sounds like that that's helping you quite a bit here, maybe.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. That's a good question. So it's really assets under administration, Tien-Tsin. We'll have to come back. It's not a huge number, so we wouldn't anticipate a significant change. But in the back half of the year, as we get into -- thinking a little bit about next year, we'll talk about it. Right now, I don't think it would be a significant -- unless it was something dramatic in the market, wouldn't be significant, in the order of pennies in terms of EPS, but we'll update as we go through the year.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.</p><p>BRYAN CONNELL KEANE, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes, to me, it sounds like the Oasis, a little bit of an integration challenges, more onetime in nature. So I'm trying to think about what the normalized organic growth rate for Oasis might be post 1 year out?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. So when we bought them, people asked me this, they were growing kind of mid- to upper-single digits organically. That's where they were. They -- we expect that we will be able to bump that growth rate with additional salespeople. Obviously, as Marty mentioned, we're off to a slow start there. But our expectation is we can get it growing above those rates in the future. We've got to get through this year, get through the disruption of this year.</p><p>BRYAN CONNELL KEANE: Yes. Guessing that the growth rate this year will be a little bit below their historical average as a result?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. It will.</p><p>BRYAN CONNELL KEANE: Yes. And then 1 follow-up I had on the revenue per client increase. It also sounded like you're getting a little bit of higher price realization. Just trying to figure, is that normal higher prices? Or is that something that you're seeing a little bit different, a little bit more pricing power than usual?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: I think we've had a little bit more pricing power this year than other years. I think that we do a lot of work on the analytics side to understand how to price each client. I think we've done a good job on the pricing side to do that. So you hope every year, there's opportunities to do it. Obviously, we hope to hold that kind of pricing power, but every year brings another set of challenges. And it also depends on competition. So while I think the level of competitive intensity remains high, it certainly has dramatically increased. And one thing we haven't talked about, Bryan, which I think is important is we're having a really good year to begin the year in our mid-market business, which also helps management solutions. So a continuation of those trends in the back half of the year going into next year then has a solid, I was going to say buoyant effect. That's a little bit too strong, but a positive effect on management solutions revenue.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: I think the investments are really paying off that we've made in the product and the technology on the HR side, the mobile app, those things are paying off. And as Efrain said, mid-market is really coming on strong. We've had a couple of years where it wasn't as strong as we would have liked, but we're feeling this year -- well, certainly, we're seeing this year, the first half of the year, and now -- we can tell you more after this quarter, but it feels really solid about the performance there on the sales side and retention side.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.</p><p>KARTIK MEHTA, EXECUTIVE MD, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, PRINCIPAL &amp; EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, NORTHCOAST RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Efrain, just to maybe get a little bit more color on the pricing comments you made for the payroll business. I'm wondering, from a competition standpoint, have you seen a change, are your competitors getting less aggressive? Or is this strictly a Paychex issue where you're able to raise prices? And maybe the competition for new business is still the same?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: I think it's primarily internal. I think we have -- I think our algorithms internally get better and better every year. And I think we understand what clients are okay with certain price increases and what clients are not. I think you have to be very -- do it with a great -- a lot of care. If you raise prices carelessly, you end up creating shopping behavior. I think the other part is that there are -- I think the strength of our model permits us to understand because of the level of customer intimacy we have, permits us to understand what segments of the client base we can get better pricing out of. So I think it's more internal than it is external, but I think it's important in that equation that the rest of the market is not acting irrationally from a price standpoint.</p><p>KARTIK MEHTA: And then, Marty, just on the PEO M&amp;A question, I know you said obviously, valuations are everywhere. But just from a Paychex standpoint, you said Oasis, you want to get this integration done, maybe it didn't go as smoothly in the beginning as you wanted. Has that slowed down, maybe M&amp;A? Would you wait a little while and get Oasis running to the point you want before you acquire another PEO? Or do you think you're in a position where, if an asset came up, you'd be -- you're ready to acquire it?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: No. I think, Kartik, we're very much in position, and we really feel like Oasis is in good shape now. It was really this kind of first half of the year that was most of the integration, kind of just a lot of changes that we had to make that always cause some slowdown. But I think, no, we're very much ready. And in fact, looking at a number of things today that are out there and available. And no, I think from a management leadership standpoint and our organization. Now we're very much ready. Remember how large -- Oasis was the largest private PEO in the country. So you knew you were going to have some integration there that we had to do more, but as far as everything else from HROI to all the acquisitions we've done, we've had a very solid track record from integrating and then hitting or beating the numbers that we expected from those acquisitions.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS, PARTNER, MOFFETTNATHANSON LLC: First one for me is on the rollout of the Pay-on-Demand product. You called out, I think that you just launched one of them in in the prepared remarks. But if I recall correctly, I think you're launching 2, right, one that's more targeted toward employers and one targeted at employees? Can you just give us a little more color on the exact timing and the monetization models for those 2 products?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. Sure, Lisa. The one we rolled out this month, a few weeks ago, was the one for employees. That was the basically Pay-on-Demand. And as I mentioned, it's an expanded, we think options better than most have out there. This is -- you can not only select when you want the money but not only -- and not only put it in your bank account, but you can put it on a pay card if you want. You can put it in your Amazon account, you can put it in your PayPal account. We think this has the broadest selection of options and flexibility that we've seen in the marketplace and we get a percentage. Obviously, we're doing that with a third party, and we get a percentage of that back into the business. And we think, for the most part, though, that the monetization of that is really in the retention of the clients and their employees that we're adding another thing to get to employees that's going to want them to stay with Paychex, stay with the mobile app, stay with the pay flexibility, et cetera, which is going to be good for the clients in a very tight labor market. In the real-time payments, which is really more geared toward the clients, as you mentioned, that's geared toward the end of the first quarter of the calendar year, as it consistently has. It's right on track, and we feel that we'll be one of the first to offer real-time payments. There will be a charge for that, as we've mentioned in the past. We're still working through all of that in looking at the marketplace and so forth. But as we get closer to rolling that out, on schedule, then we'll -- we can talk about the monetization of it.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Terrific. And then second one for me. Maybe, Marty, can you comment on how the new -- it looks like this, the AB5 law impacting gig workers in California is going to go into effect. Can you comment just on how you see that type of law impacting Paychex? And what -- how you'd handicap your expectation that, that spreads across the country?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think -- it's funny, 2 years ago, the gig economy was very big and expected to kind of take over employment, and then it really has kind of quieted down to a certain degree. I think those laws and similar ones will come up. I think it's the flexibility that we want to give employees. I think it'll be picked up by states, like you said, like California and New York, places like that first. I think we'll be ready to handle that. And I think, frankly, having a mobile app, having Pay-on-Demand, having flexible retirement plans things like that, we're very well -- we're pretty well geared for that, and we're continuing to look at our product set to see how we can do things more -- even more around an employee versus an employer, which has obviously been our model for many years. So I'd say it's still early stages, but it's still pretty early on the gig economy too, that seem to be the -- it was going to be the wherewithal -- it was going to be everything a few years ago, but it's quieted down. I think we're able to handle some of that now, and we're continuing to look at our product set with our Head of Product to see what else we can do to make it easy and to be able to comply with any new employment laws that come out.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Okay. Great. Yes, and I guess just to like completely clarify. I think this law impacts like workers that'll be classified as like W-2 full-time employees versus ones that are classified as contractors. But you currently essentially cover or process payroll for both of those, right? I mean, does this...</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Yes. Yes. So it's sort of a neutral effect?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. Correct. Neutral effect right now. Yes, that we -- I was thinking more of a wider look at that issue of the whole gig economy, and there's a real opportunity there. But you're right, yes, we cover both of those now, whether they're contractors, 1099s or W-2s, either way.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN, DIRECTOR, COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Wanted to ask on margins, so the maintained margin guide following a good first half here, is there a ramp in the investments absorbing this somewhat in the second half? Or maybe is it a function of just getting Oasis back on the path you expected? Or is it more broad than that? If you can just go into some of the moving pieces?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: I think, Bryan, when you look at first half versus back -- I'm sorry, second half versus first half, the key thing that occurs is that in Q4, you have your highest margin quarter. So you have expenses that are -- that don't ramp anymore because now you've anniversaried Oasis. And so expense growth is more moderate, but then revenue is higher, particularly in the third quarter where margins typically are going -- approaching or above 40%. So I think that's what drives it. That quarter is unique in terms of the amount of revenue that it has, and then the fourth quarter also has a high revenue and expenses aren't ramping along with the revenue in driving margins higher.</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN: Okay. I wanted to follow up then also on the on-demand pay product. Can you just talk about some of the early adoption levels on the employee side? And how should we think about the funding mechanisms of these pay products and any potential impacts to the full portfolio?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: No, it's all done through third parties. So there won't be any impacts on our float. We're not taking any of the risk on it or anything else. We're just getting a percentage of the fees that are paid. And it's very early -- Bryan, it's very early in the adoption. I mean we've heard certainly the demand for it, but it just -- we rolled it out a few weeks ago. So it's really too early to say. But there seems to be a great demand for it. And again, I think this is the most full-featured from our full flexibility from an opportunity. So we're anxious to see how it goes. I'd be able to give you a better read after the next quarter.</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN: Okay. That's fair. And Efrain, just a last one on Oasis. You lapped acquisition over, I guess part of the third quarter. Anything to call out in the expected contribution of Oasis to 3Q? Anything seasonal in that mix between the 2 segments to note here?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Nothing that's not contemplated in the guidance. Yes, nothing significant.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies.</p><p>SAMAD SALEEM SAMANA, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So the company has mentioned mid-market strength multiple times in the call this morning. I was curious if maybe you can give us an idea of what the average number of employees for new deals in the quarter look like? Just to see if it's -- how much it's impacting the mix versus the historical average closer to about 16 employees? And then I have 1 follow-up question.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: It definitely is much larger than that. So it would pull that mix up. We don't normally give that number out, Samad. But I mean it's much -- it's -- I would say look, somewhere between probably 50 to 150, give you a wide range, but the average is somewhere under 100 kind of thing on a client ID perspective. So it's much larger than that 15 or 16. That's what pulls that up.</p><p>SAMAD SALEEM SAMANA: Yes. I guess I was wondering more about what the overall average then would have been for this quarter? Just to kind of get a sense of how much it's pulling up the overall average?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: It's -- right now, it's pretty consistent. So I don't think it's moving it enough. I think we -- I don't know if we really give that out other than annual, if that. But it has some -- I think it would have some adjustment, but not much, pretty consistent.</p><p>SAMAD SALEEM SAMANA: Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up, as I think about the sales headcount investments that you're making. Is there -- other than the products that you guys have rolled out, as I think about the mid-market, are you also hiring reps that are more geared toward selling to that 50 to 150 employee type of customer? And should we see, as we think about the ramping investments in the back half, should we continue to see that trend in terms of the type of salesperson you're hiring as well?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes, I think we definitely are. We're promoting some from within and from a career path standpoint, and we're always excited about that. And by the way, that market goes anywhere -- I don't want to get you the sense that, that's only to what that market is. That market goes anywhere from 20 -- frankly, 20 or 30 employees these days to 1,000. But I would say it's primarily in that 20 to 500 space, but it goes pretty broad. Yes, we're hiring people with more experience, some from competitors, some from other industries and then promoting some as well from internally, and we'll continue to invest in that. We're pretty much up to full -- up to full hires where we are now, but we're always looking for good people and I think success is helping us, from that standpoint, recruit as well. That always helps.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>JEFFREY MARC SILBER, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: I know the call has been going long. I just had a quick follow-up actually for Efrain. I know you don't give a fiscal '21 guidance. But at least in terms of tax rate, is the tax rate that we're using or you're guiding for this year, is that something we should use for next year as well?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes, Jeff, look, I'm going to say right now, I don't see significant things that would change it. State taxes and stock comp expense move it, but it's probably not a bad proxy right now.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL GROSSMAN, MD, STIFEL, NICOLAUS &amp; COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: So each of the PEOs reported some issue in the most recent quarter, and while each was different, there was typically some element of health insurance involved. So can you provide some context to -- in contrast to what you're experiencing and what may or may not be happening industry wide?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I guess I'd say, I don't think -- when we look at it, if you looked at retention in particular, and now we're through a couple of renewals, I would say it was a pretty fair -- I think there's always a combination of underwriting and tightening up where we want our performance to be from a medical loss ratio, and we're pretty conservative and careful on that and what we're -- and our underwriting standards. And so I think that had some impact on retention. But I don't think we had any necessarily abnormal impact on the rates that we got themselves. I think we got pretty fair renewals overall from the carriers, and then we have our own self-insured plan. I think we're performing pretty well there, and I don't think the carriers gave us anything that was that difficult. I think we just -- we have a little bit tighter underwriting standard that we wanted to put in place or, I guess, tighter than what -- at least what it was, and that had some impact on some clients. On the other hand, David, the nice thing about us is we can take some of them over then to the insurance agency and write them through the carriers as opposed to taking the underwrite -- or the -- some of the risk on ourselves. So I don't think -- I think in contrast, I don't think we saw anything. I don't feel like we saw really anything that abnormal from the carriers in the renewals themselves, which bodes -- to me and for us, I think bodes well for the future. There was no abnormality there that should continue or anything.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL GROSSMAN: Got it. And then just going over into the mid-market, and I know that has come up several times. But if you just had to isolate one thing that's changed most that may have impacted the momentum in that business, what do you think that is? And do you think you're gaining share? Or you just think you're doing a better job of retaining your clients as they migrate into that kind of mid-market category?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think the one thing is definitely the technology investment. I mean look, we had a solid sales force and great sales leadership there and operational and service performance. And -- but I think the biggest change has been the technology investment over many years now, but it's really come to fruition the last few years, in particular, as everything has come together, the mobile app, the HR administration, the data analytics, the artificial intelligence work, everything that has come together now. We have a fully integrated solution for a mid-market that is very simple to use. And we're -- I think that has really shown in the sales performance, particularly this year, but we could start it the last half of last year and then the first half of this year, the sales performance is better and the retention as well. But I really think it's the technology on top of good sales and operations leadership and performance. And by -- and just to tell you, I think we are taking some share. But I -- you do know -- as you know, that is a growing market for all players, and we just haven't gotten as much of our fair share in the last few years, in my opinion, as we should have, and we had to get the technology really to all pull together. We kept introducing good products, but now we pulled it together. And we also now have moved to say, hey, if you want a product integration, if you want something, if you have the best HR, time and attendance that you think is better than ours, we'll build the product integration for you as well, or we have the product integration already through APIs. And so I think all of that has really helped, but I think the technology would be the #1 biggest thing.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL GROSSMAN: Right. And just can you help size it for us? Or just give us some context so that we can think about how impactful it can be to the overall growth rate?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: What do you mean, in terms of revenue, David?</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL GROSSMAN: Yes. Yes.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. So mid-market revenue, if you look at it in terms of total payroll revenue. And we give you payroll, so I'm not giving you a number you can't figure out. It's been running about 25% or so of our overall payroll revenue. So you can figure out management solutions, you know what percentage is management solutions. You can get a sense of that bucket within management solutions. So if it accelerates, it's helpful. And I think that where it is helpful, and I think there was a discussion earlier about this. If you see continued trends, then over time, you see average client size go up, and that's positive. But also you have more opportunity to attach ancillaries when you get those clients.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a few follow-ups. First, just on the PEO side. When you talked about the carriers and what you're doing in terms of your own self-insurance on the health care cost, what rate of increase are you typically seeing as you go into next year for a like-for-like type plan?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. I think, Mark, I would say, no one's giving you the exact increase. I would say it's pretty competitive with the market, in some cases, a little bit below. So part of -- following up on what Marty was saying, because we try to manage the book very conservatively, we ensure that we manage those losses tightly so that we can go out to market with rates that are competitive in the market.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Right. I appreciate that. And then with</p><p>(inaudible) I'm not sure if you're hearing that.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. You cut out a little bit there, Mark. Go ahead.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: With regards to the percentage of the clients that you're -- what percentage of your PEO clients actually are taking your insurance where you're self-insured for it?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. So I'll flip it around. We don't give the exact clients. But if you look at PEO revenue, PEO revenue includes at-risk revenue of 35% to 40% of that revenue, and you can get to that because we give you a breakout [front row] as with any cost. So that gives you a sense. We don't break it out by specific client.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Got it. And then with regards to the mid-market, you're obviously doing really well there. Can -- in terms of the new sales, is there any change, Marty, in terms of the composition of who you're getting those new clients from? Or how we should think about that with regards to -- there's still some -- a surprising number of companies out there with really old legacy systems versus some that have transitioned to newer systems. What's the composition look like in terms of the new sales that you're getting?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think it's been a combination of taking some from competitors. And I would say I think it's probably this year, I would guess, it's run 50-50 on old legacy systems going to -- moving into a new platform, a software-as-a-service platform of ours and really moving up the technology, and then probably the other half is more something they didn't like from a competitive standpoint. So I think we're taking some from market share and then some from -- as the market expands itself, and it's probably roughly around half and half, I'd say, at least this year-to-date kind of thing. Because you know, that market, it does continue to expand and it's growing across -- it's -- the market itself is growing of those who just see the need, particularly in this tight labor market to have something that's going to help them hire and onboard with all of that, doing it paperlessly, then retaining them with integrated benefits and a mobile app and retirement plans, and so they're seeing a need that they have to go up that it's -- it definitely is more critical to them in a tight labor market to move onto a more modern system. And I think ours is appealing to a number of those prospects.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Okay, fully appreciate that. And then 2 longer-term questions. One would basically be, you started off the whole presentation basically by talking about some of the effectiveness that you're seeing in terms of your sales and marketing efforts coming through and sales, SG&amp;A actually ended up declining as a percentage of revenue despite the strong sales growth. So I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the longer-term implications for the increased efficacy with regards to your sales efforts and what you're seeing there. That's the first question. And then the second question is basically, how we should think about the effective yield for next year through the float balance and the duration?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Okay. Let me take the first one and then Efrain will take the next one.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. Yes. That's fine.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: I think, Mark, the interesting thing is, it's a sales and marketing kind of combined look and you're seeing, as we've talked about, I think before, a shift more toward marketing. Many times today, most people are buying or making their decision, they're 70% or 75% of the way through the decision before they ever talk to anyone, and they're looking for much more online approach. They're being marketed to online, the way you market to them, the way you get leads the way you nurture leads and then the way you sell. And we're trialing a number of things that will make us even more efficient from that standpoint, where you're spending marketing dollars because a lot of the marketing is really the sales now. We certainly still have a lot of field reps that we count on that are building relationships and getting referrals in the field and talking to clients, but particularly the smallest clients who are starting up businesses are going online and looking to look, buy -- demo and buy -- and even buy online, and we're preparing for all of that. So I think we're looking for efficiency, but even more so, what's the best way to market and sell to a prospect or an existing client that's in business and try to be as efficient as we can. But it's really looking at how is that shifting from web to -- from live person to web, telephonic to e-commerce and positioning ourselves well for the future on that. And I think I think we have a pretty good handle on it, and we're trialing a number of things now that seem to be successful.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Great. Mark, on the yield question, I'd say that the yield, we go out this year, this meaning the fiscal year is probably the yield that we have -- we will plan for next year, given that, apparently, the Fed has decided that it wants to hold. We do have a little bit of play there in terms of float balances, which have been increasing slowly. And we do have a little bit of play with duration. So but for planning assumptions, that's what I would assume.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Just to be clear, the yield year on is basically the year -- is basically what we should plan on for next year, not the average for this year?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. I think it's going to be slightly lower. But I'm just saying the back -- the yield we have in the back half of the year is probably -- is the yield we go into next year with. So I can't -- and we have a little bit of play with duration. You saw this year -- this quarter duration was 3.1. We can extend it further, but it'll depend a little bit on the -- or it'll depend on the shape of the yield curve, how far we want to go out.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have time for one final question, and that question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill with Autonomous Research.</p><p>MATTHEW CASEY O'NEILL, PARTNER OF PAYMENTS AND FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: I know it's a long call. Most of the things have been asked and answered. I was just curious, has there been any noticeable evolution in the kind of lead-gen sources, maybe moving a little bit all away from the CPA channels and more towards the online channels? And sort of as a follow-up, if that's true, is that something that drives kind of more price-sensitive customers or not really any change on that side of it?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: No. I think, Matt, it definitely has moved some. I mean we still rely a lot on being out in the field and building those CPA relationships. They're good partners with us as well as current clients, but definitely, as I said, a lot of -- today, everybody is doing their research online. Even if you're giving a referral, in the old days, you'd just call us. And today, you're going online, you're searching our website. Our investments have been in the website and in being able to demo the product, whether it's -- you can demo it right on your mobile app, if you download the mobile app. And so it has been about how do you get those leads, and we put a lot of investment in that from a marketing standpoint as well as how do you then nurture those leads, if they're not ready. That's different than it used to be. That's a whole nurturing piece that we have put in place for the last few years now about how to get information to clients and make sure when they're ready, they come to us. And then we're moving to more of an -- even in e-commerce, where you can buy online, particularly with SurePayroll or other options you can buy online. That also lowers some costs, it increases marketing costs, but sales costs come down and balance a lot of that out as you're selling either online or through telephonic means, you're giving them more tools telephonically to help demo a product to a client and then sell it to them. So we're definitely seeing that change, and I think that will shift cost from marketing -- or from sales to marketing, they become all kind of one pot of cost that you look at to be the most efficient. But it really is about how do you best sell to clients, and they are definitely searching, demoing and even thinking about or buying online, and we're into that already, and we're looking -- we might -- we'll find ways to expand that as well.</p><p>Operator, so I think that's the last question, correct?</p><p>OPERATOR: Yes. That's correct.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it'll be archived for approximately 30 days.

Highlights:</p><p>1. As Co. moved through qtr., began to see signs of improvement in the advertising market.</p><p>2. After challenging April in which core advertising for Broadcast and Other segments declined 43% YoverY, June improved to 26% decline, resulting in 2Q core advertising performance for those segments to be down 36% and in middle of guidance range.</p><p>1. Co.'s decision to give 2Q guidance on May call was driven by commitment to be as transparent as possible, while acknowledging limitations that giving guidance for entire year was impractical due to wide range of variance that could result from uncertainties in timing, pace and magnitude of recovery.</p><p>2. While Co. is still faced with many of those same challenges and changing dynamics around effects of pandemic, making forecasting more difficult than usual, it has decided to once again provide guidance for upcoming qtr.</p><p>3. Co. is starting to enter peak political season, which is still expected to be a record political year and will help mitigate weakness in core advertising space.</p><p>3. Professional sports leagues have resumed their schedules, although they are shortened.</p><p>1. It is clear that viewers are excited as well with ratings for first day of MLB season up 32% on RSNs vs. last year's opening day viewership.</p><p>2. Contracts with sports teams already contemplate scenarios where there may be shortfalls and number of live games delivered to Co.</p><p>1. In such cases, Co. is entitled to remuneration from teams for any games falling short of guarantees that are defined in contracts.</p><p>3. Co. has distributors to whom it guarantees minimum games of live games in contracts with SBGI.</p><p>4. Contrary to reports out in public at this time, Co. does not expect rebates from teams to be greater than what it pays out to distributors, given differences in way rebates are calculated in team vs. distributor contracts and other variances in contracts.</p><p>4. Sports business:</p><p>1. There are a lot of exciting things going on behind scenes of SBGI.</p><p>2. As announced several weeks ago, hired Steve Rosenberg, a highly accomplished broadcast and programming executive as President of Local Sports.</p><p>3. Steve, along with Billy Chambers, who is Local Sports COO and CFO, will report into Rob Weisbord and help fill void left by upcoming departure of Jeff Krolik, who is retiring as Head of RSN business at Aug.-end.</p><p>4. Steve Rosenberg:</p><p>1. One of his first priorities will be to use his programming expertise to help elevate non-game programming on RSNs and stadium network.</p><p>2. Majority of programming hours on these networks does not involve live games.</p><p>3. There is significant opportunity to improve viewership and revenue-generating capabilities in these time periods.</p><p>5. Scott Shapiro has taken additional role of Chief Strategy Officer of Sports, and will focus on some of Co.'s larger growth opportunities, like those associated with legalized sports spend.</p><p>6. Has other exciting developments in sports business coming up as well with a number of significant growth opportunities on horizon.</p><p>1. As consumer viewing habits continue to evolve, Co. is committed to giving them exceptional experience when and where they choose to watch SBGI.</p><p>2. Co. is expecting sports app that is in development will give viewers an experience unlike anything they've encountered in past with enhanced graphics and sound, and ability to interact with content in numerous ways, including with advertisers and free-to-play games.</p><p>3. Spent a lot of time meeting with many of major players in sports betting, and expects to be able to more fully detail its plans in this area later this year.</p><p>7. As exclusive provider of local sports content for more than half of MLB, NBA and NHL teams, believes Co. is in unique position to monetize significant sports betting opportunity that exists.</p><p>5. NEXTGEN TV launches in multiple markets, including Las Vegas, Nashville, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City and Portland, Oregon, with another 10 or so SBGI markets targeted by year-end.</p><p>1. Its impact will be felt far beyond traditional broadcasting applications.</p><p>2. NEXTGEN TV will deliver significant enhancement to television broadcast quality, but that just scratches surface.</p><p>3. New platform gives broadcasters significant flexibility in using their broadcast spectrum.</p><p>6. In July, came to terms with Comcast to renew distribution rights for all of Co.'s businesses, including broadcast stations, Tennis Channel, RSNs, and a full launch of Marquee in time for Cubs's first game of season.</p><p>1. The narrative that has been on the street regarding fears around completing deal with Comcast, or that terms would be unfavorable to SBGI, or that broadcast stations will be dragged down by RSNs was just incorrect.</p><p>2. Co. was confident that it would reach agreement with Comcast that was positive for Co., and it is happy with outcome in all regards.</p><p>3. Deal includes launch of Marquee, and expanded viewing coverage of new RSN beyond where Cubs RSN was previously carried.</p><p>4. This is something Comcast doesn't do for its own RSN in Chicago area and didn't even in past when RSN included Cubs.</p><p>5. This was accomplished without giving up carriage of other assets in portfolio and while still achieving what Co. believes are favorable rates throughout portfolio.</p><p>6. With completion of Comcast agreement, now locked up almost 85% of RSNs total subscribers for at least two years and beyond.</p><p>7. Agreed to multi-year renewal for eight stations with ViacomCBS.</p><p>8. On sports side, agreement principle with one team expired at end of last season.</p><p>9. In June, announced Co. would be launching new headline news service in early 2021, focused on breaking new stories as they develop and sourcing them from comprehensive local news resources.</p><p>1. In its initial phase, news service is expected to be launched on approx. 50 of CW and MYTV network affiliates, and will be broadcast from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM each weekday, and on free ad-supported app store.</p><p>10. Community:</p><p>1. Awarded annual broadcast diversity scholarship to 10 talented students who are pursuing a career in broadcast industry.</p><p>2. In July, launched new campaign with American Red Cross for urgently-needed blood donations, utilizing news production resources to create messaging and awareness of urgent need and to encourage viewers to donate blood.</p><p>1. Campaign's Day of Commitment was held on June 30, with campaign continuing through mid-Aug.</p><p>11. Capital structure:</p><p>1. Believes Co.'s securities are significantly undervalued.</p><p>2. Belief is reflected in Co.'s actions, including continued repurchase of equity during qtr.</p><p>3. Since Feb. 2020, and through to date, repurchased approx. 19m shares, representing 21% of total shares outstanding as of beginning of year.</p><p>4. While proposed exchange of Diamond's unsecured notes resulted in lower participation than Co.'s expected, believes lender's decision not to exchange indicates their belief in long-term positive value of Diamond.</p><p>5. Continues to engage with financial institutions on ways to optimize capital structure to delever and lower cost of capital.</p><p>2Q20 Financials (L.R.)</p><p>1. Note:</p><p>1. Inclusion of sports segment this year, which was not in last year's first eight-month numbers, is responsible for many of larger changes in actual results vs. same period last year.</p><p>2. Therefore, in many cases, Co. will be speaking about results vs. prior year pro forma, which is a much more meaningful comparison and assumes Co. owns RSNs in those periods.</p><p>2. Distributor and Team Rebates, and Sports Rights Amortization:</p><p>1. Pursuant to GAAP, Co. is required to accrue total estimated rebate amount owed to distributors across 2Q20-4Q20, which will reduce distribution revenue in each qtr.</p><p>1. Cash outlay to distributors is not expected to occur until after 2020.</p><p>2. On team side, rebate associated with overpayment for fewer games to be played in season, is expected to be realized in part in 3Q20 with majority in 4Q20 as lower sports rights payments.</p><p>3. Therefore, adjusted EBITDA for year is expected to reflect both team rebates to Co. and Co.'s rebates to distributors.</p><p>4. Expects rebates from teams to be greater than what Co. pays out to distributors.</p><p>5. There will be a timing as it pertains to cash flow with Co. realizing benefit of lower sports rights payments this year in advance of distributor rebates being made after 2020.</p><p>2. Sports rights amortization, which is included in media and programming production expense line and which is non-cash and not factored into calculation of adjusted EBITDA, gets recognized over applicable sports season.</p><p>1. In 2Q, there were no professional games played and therefore, sports rights amortization was minimal.</p><p>2. Expects sports rights amortization for 3Q to increase nearing high level of sports games currently scheduled in period.</p><p>3. For 4Q, sports rights amortization is expected to be much lower with baseball's regular season likely completed, and with NBA and NHL games for 2021 season likely starting later in qtr. than normal.</p><p>3. Results:</p><p>1. Consolidated media revenue up $539m due to inclusion of Local Sports segment, which was not in 2Q19 results.</p><p>1. On pro forma basis, total media revenues of $1.260b, down vs. 2Q19 media revenues of $1.710b due to a number of factors, which Co. has previously discussed, most notably, weakness in advertising market due to pandemic, absence of live sports, associated accrual for distributor rebates and absence of DISH carriage fees.</p><p>2. Media revenues came in below guidance range Co. gave on last earnings call by $119m, due to $124m of distributor rebates Co. accrued during qtr., which was not included in guidance last qtr. because at that time, it didn't know how many games the leagues were going to schedule.</p><p>1. Excluding accrued rebate, revenue would have been within guidance range.</p><p>3. Media revenues $669m for Broadcast and Other segments (excludes RSNs); within guidance range with advertising and distribution revenues coming in as expected.</p><p>1. Advertising market improved as Co. moved through qtr.</p><p>2. June ended with Broadcast and Other segments declining 26% YoverY, which was significant improvement over 43% drop in April.</p><p>3. July has seen improvement continuing, finishing down 20% for month.</p><p>4. Even as political ramps up in 3Q and is expected to displace other advertising categories, Co. still expects to finish 3Q down 15-22% in core advertising, which is improvement over 2Q performance.</p><p>2. Subscriber churn across all segments was 7% YoverY; slightly higher than trend over past few quarters, but understandable given impact of COVID on economy and number of people that are unemployed in country.</p><p>3. Consolidated media OpEx $569m; down 50% on pro forma basis vs. 2Q19's $1.139b, and that's due to absence of live games, lower sports rights amortization and proactive cost controls.</p><p>1. Focus on managing expenses during qtr. drove $11m positive variance to guidance.</p><p>4. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased 31% to $254m, due to inclusion of Local Sports segment.</p><p>1. On pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA declined $391m, driven by $330m decline at Local Sports segment and $61m decline at Broadcast and Other segments.</p><p>2. Sports segment adjusted EBITDA $110m; down from 2Q19's pro forma $440m, and that's due to distributor rebate accrual, absence of DISH, which was in 2Q19 numbers, and impact of COVID on number of games.</p><p>3. Unlike GAAP results for sports segment which included minimal amortization due to no live sports being played, Local Sports adjusted EBITDA reflected continuation of sports payments made during qtr.</p><p>4. Sports segment results during qtr. reflect approval for rebates to distributors, but no benefit from expected rebates from teams, which are expected in 2H20.</p><p>5. Excluding accrued rebate, Co. beat total co. adjusted EBITDA on additional cost controls at Broadcast and Other segments.</p><p>5. Consolidated adjusted free cash flow, excluding non-recurring legal ligation COVID transaction and regulatory items of $9m, was $46m; $79m below lower end of guidance.</p><p>1. Excluding rebate accrual, exceeded guidance slightly.</p><p>2. 1H20 adjusted free cash flow $156m.</p><p>3. Using estimated share count through 08/04/20 of approx. 79m shares outstanding, that reflects additional shares that Co. bought back here in 3Q, that results in free cash flow per share of $2.11 in 1H20.</p><p>6. Diluted EPS on 81m weighted avg. common shares at June 30 was $3.12, or $3.21 when adjusted for non-recurring items.</p><p>7. Liquidity position in both credit silos is strong, with neither silo's revolver drawn, and both silos having ample cash on hand.</p><p>1. Launched exchange for all of outstanding Diamond's 6.625% senior notes, $66m of aggregate principal amount or approx. 4% of outstanding issue was exchanged for $31m of new 12.750% notes and cash payments of approx. $10m.</p><p>2. In total, transaction reduced debt by $35m.</p><p>3. While Co. would have liked to have exchanged more of bonds, feedback it received was that noteholders agreed with Co. that bonds are undervalued and so chose to hold on for future upside.</p><p>8. Repurchased over 5m shares of common stock at avg. price of just over $16 per share.</p><p>1. For 3Q-to-date, repurchased over 4m additional shares.</p><p>2. Since start of year, 21% of total shares outstanding and 29% of float have been bought back.</p><p>9. Continued to execute on plan to reduce costs with savings for short term and longer term.</p><p>1. Continued to scrutinize all spending, delaying or eliminating non-essential expenses, including open positions, media and promotional spend, T&amp;E and CapEx, in addition to variable expenses to come with fewer games and lower revenues.</p><p>2. Continues to look for additional opportunities.</p><p>3. Confident that Co. can handle prolonged period of weakness by executing opportunities identified, and additional steps it could take, if necessary.</p><p>10. Broadcast and Other segments media revenues down 7% YoverY, as advertising revenue was significantly impacted by pandemic.</p><p>1. 36% decline in core advertising revenue was partially offset by higher political revenue and increase in distribution revenue.</p><p>2. Broadcast segment's revenue benefited from $25m in management incentive fees paid by Local Sports segment that was not in 2Q19 results and gets eliminated in consolidation.</p><p>3. Came in at middle of revenue guidance range, and $12m over high-end of adjusted EBITDA guidance.</p><p>11. Sports segment media revenues $616m; down 38% vs. pro forma results of $992m in 2Q19.</p><p>1. Much of decline was expected and was due primarily to absence of DISH, lack of advertising revenues related to postponement of games, subscriber churn and accrual distributor rebate.</p><p>2. Excluding accrued rebate, Co. was close to guidance.</p><p>12. Media expenses $106m; 84% decline to 2Q19's pro forma $659m.</p><p>1. Primarily result of minimal sports rights amortization being booked in qtr. due to no professional games being played.</p><p>2. As compared to guidance, media expenses were slightly higher due to slightly higher-than-expected production programming expenses.</p><p>13. Local Sports adjusted EBITDA $110m; below pro forma results of $440m in 2Q19, and below guidance of $190-202m, due to distributor rebate accrual.</p><p>1. If excluding rebate accrual, Co. would have beat Local Sports adjusted EBITDA guidance.</p><p>14. Distributor rebate accrual:</p><p>1. If backing that out, Co. either met or exceeded all of 2Q guidance.</p><p>4. 2Q20-End Balance Sheet:</p><p>1. Consolidated cash $622m; includes $171m at STG and $436m at Diamond.</p><p>2. Total debt $12.399b.</p><p>3. Net leverage ratio for consolidated SBGI, 6.4x.</p><p>4. Sinclair Television Group's first lien indebtedness ratio on trailing eight quarters was 2.6x, on covenant of [4.5%], and 4.5x on net leverage basis through bonds.</p><p>5. Diamond's first lien indebtedness ratio on a trailing four quarters was 6.5x, on covenant of [6.25%], which only springs if revolver is drawn over 35%.</p><p>6. On total net leverage basis through bonds, Diamond was levered 8.5x.</p><p>5. 3Q20 Guidance:</p><p>1. There is still much uncertainty around resilience of economy and COVID's impact.</p><p>1. Guidance will, therefore, be limited to 3Q.</p><p>2. Any change to expected plans in sports leagues could cause reported Local Sports results to deviate meaningfully from guidance.</p><p>3. Broadcast and Other segments:</p><p>1. Media revenue $777-805m.</p><p>1. Up approx. 6-10% from last year's pro forma $733m.</p><p>2. Driven by higher political and distribution revenue, partially offset by projected 15-22% decline in core advertising.</p><p>2. Adjusted EBITDA $187-211m, vs. $216m pro forma last year.</p><p>4. Sports segment:</p><p>1. Media revenue $718-727m.</p><p>1. Down 15-16% to last year's pro forma $858m.</p><p>2. Projections include impact from distributor rebate accrual.</p><p>2. Adjusted EBITDA $402-410m, vs. $425m pro forma last year, with decline primarily due to distributor rebate accrual, absence of DISH carriage fees and subscriber churn, offset by lower rights payments to teams.</p><p>5. There is sizable increase in GAAP media expenses in 3Q.</p><p>1. Due to MLB, NBA and NHL sports rights amortization being expensed in qtr., reflecting when games will be played.</p><p>2. While this increases expenses on GAAP basis, it is non-cash item that does not impact adjusted EBITDA, which is based on sports rights payments, not rights amortization.</p><p>3. Sports rights payments reflect offsetting benefit from teams on the fewer games with some of that partially reflected in 3Q and majority in 4Q.</p><p>6. Consolidated Co.:</p><p>1. Media revenues $1.460-1.497b.</p><p>2. Adjusted EBITDA $589-621m.</p><p>3. Adjusted free cash flow $374-411m.</p><p>4. Based on current share count of approx. 74m shares, free cash flow per share approx. $5.05-5.55.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Aaron Watts of Deutsche Bank.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: I have a few questions I wanted to run through quickly. I guess, first, on the television station group. Encouraged to see the improvement month-to-month in core advertising. Are you seeing any fits and starts on that in your market that are seeing some ebbs and flows of COVID cases? And also, are the bookings coming in a lot later relative to where you've kind of trended historically or at least in the prior year?</p><p>ROBERT D. WEISBORD, PRESIDENT OF BROADCAST &amp; CHIEF ADVERTISING REVENUE OFFICER, SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC.: Yes, I'll handle that. This is Rob. We are not seeing the fits and starts. It's been pretty consistent. You're correct. It's being booked a little bit later. They're holding on to it to see how the COVID is affecting the different DMAs that we're in. However, we've been encouraged through our virtual trainings, virtual sales presentations that we've been able to communicate in this new norm and being able to handle it, and that's why you're seeing the positivity and the pace moving forward.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: Okay. And in terms of bookings coming in later or early?</p><p>ROBERT D. WEISBORD: No, the bookings are coming in later. Growing more month-to-month than they are quarterly, semiannually or annually.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: Okay. Got it. And then as best as you have clarity on today, can you give us the latest on the stability of the underlying sub base for your station group and the RSNs? And has your near term, medium-term outlook for cord-cutting changed at all based on what you're seeing right now?</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC.: Yes. So I'll take that one. So Aaron, as we -- as I mentioned, we saw across all the platforms, subscriber churn year-over-year, down about 7%. Again, that's really coming from one primary MVPD. But we have -- what you're going to see in our guidance for Q3 is that we have pretty much mirrored that level of churn, and that's really based on some of the public commentary from the distributors themselves here recently as well as just really not having a lot of visibility as to what's going to happen with the churn. As we talked about, there's 2 schools of thought that are out there. One is that people currently may churn just because of the status of their employment and the economy. But on the other hand, right, you do have government assistance for those people. You also have the fact that, again, the TV is really the only form of entertainment that's out there right now. And especially right now with the games, people not being able to go to the games in order to watch their favorite team, local team, they would have to see those on the RSN. So 2 divergent views there. I really don't know where it ends up. So to be conservative, we have forecasted our Q3 to mirror the Q2 levels.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a couple of questions from me on the Diamond Sports side. With the Comcast renewal now inked. I assume you have a pretty large percentage of your distribution locked up over the next few years. Is that a fair statement? Do you have a percentage that you could give us of kind of what is locked in now? And for how long?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC.: So 85% of the RSN subscribers are locked in for 2 years or more.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: Perfect. And Lucy, I just want to make sure I was clear on your comments, and I appreciate all the color around kind of the rebates and the refunds from the teams. If I'm just specifically thinking about cash in, cash out, to be clear, when do you expect kind of cash in from the teams in terms of the rebates there? And I think you said the cash out to the MVPDs will happen next year. Am I hearing that right or thinking about that right?</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Yes. So contractually, with the distributors, the -- because of the measurement periods, the cash out would occur after 2020. Each contract is different so I'm not going to get into the whens after that. But the rebates and the overpayments for -- to the teams, all occurs this year, some in Q3, but the majority really in Q4 once we get through the full season.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: And in the end, those cash in, cash out obviously, differences in timing, but you're saying that those should be relatively equal or even the rebates from the teams to you should be greater than what you have to pay out to the MVPDs?</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Yes. So what I'm saying is the amount that we get in will be greater than the amount that we pay out, and that's really because of the variability, the differences in how the minimum games are all calculated from one contract to the next.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: Okay. Perfect. And last one for me...</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Aaron, just to be clear because, again, there are -- there's a lot of misinformation on the street as it relates to this with people modeling that Diamond is going to pay more than what they get in. And as Chris said, those are just not correct. We expect to get in more than what we will pay out because of the differences in the calculations.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: Okay. Perfect. I'm glad. Last one for me. And again, appreciate the time. You repaid your revolver outstanding balance. It sounds like you're comfortable with liquidity. How do you think about that liquidity now going forward as you look at where your bonds are currently trading? I don't think I heard anything about more bond buybacks this quarter. I know you also still have preferred stock outstanding. How do you kind of weigh the order of importance of attacking those different opportunities? And that's it.</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Sure, Aaron. So look, so we have -- our first and foremost, right, is the priority to continue to grow Diamond, right, whether it's through acquisitions, investments for the growth opportunities. But we are also committed to strengthening the capital table, lowering our cost of capital and deleveraging, right? So as we previously have discussed on other calls, and we will continue to look for ways, right, to deploy the cash and to capital -- optimize the capital structure. So look, everything is on the table right now. We're evaluating a lot of things. So it could be anything from redeeming the preferred, additional debt exchanges, receivable financings, designating subs is unrestricted as well as looking at new acquisition opportunities and again, investing for all the growth opportunities, which is the reason why we bought Diamond. So all of those things are being evaluated and on the table.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is coming from Dan Kurnos of Benchmark Company.</p><p>DANIEL LOUIS KURNOS, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, THE BENCHMARK COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just so we're, I guess, maybe all clear in terms of some more granularity just around Comcast and Marquee. Just -- Lucy, thanks for the color around subs, it helps all part of the equation. Just trying to understand sort of the timing of when -- Marquee, was it all just when the Comcast deal was done? I'm just trying to sort of understand the distribution delta from 2Q to 3Q on the RSN side? Or if there's some other rebate, increased rebate nuance that we might be missing?</p><p>And then on the core side, maybe, Rob, you could just give us some more color just on sort of category improvement and sort of where you're seeing the particular pockets of strength? And what gives you the confidence that we kind of continue to sequentially improve throughout the year?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Okay, Dan, I'll speak to Comcast, and Rob will speak to the core question. In terms of changes, not much changed with Comcast at all. They continue to carry all the RSNs. They previously carried all of the Tennis Channel, our broadcast stations, the only real change was Marquee, and they picked up marquee the moment they signed the agreement. And as I noted in the prepared remarks, Marquee ended up getting into new geographies that the cuts were not previously distributed on. So we're very happy with that outcome.</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: And Dan, let me just answer your question on the dollars. So with the -- so there, we do have the distributor rebate accrued in Q3. As we said, that will hit Q2, Q3 and Q4. So you are seeing that delta. As well as, remember, the RSN contract doesn't actually come up until the end of the quarter. That's when it expires. So you would not see the Comcast impact in the Q3 numbers.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: And just a side note there, so you understand, even though the RSN contract was renewed early and it doesn't actually expire until the end of September. That's because we did this all as one deal and everything will be coterminous on the other side.</p><p>DANIEL LOUIS KURNOS: Rob, before you answer, just, Chris, just on that, does that -- the TV side then is pushed back to the RSN start date now? Because I think that's a bit of nuance that might be missed there.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: No. Actually, the TV side is going forward to the RSN expiration.</p><p>DANIEL LOUIS KURNOS: Okay. And then, Rob, your comments on core?</p><p>ROBERT D. WEISBORD: Sure. Yes. On the strength, we continue to see services perform well. We have pharmaceutical that has joined the strength, and we're seeing the education category pick up as well. We expect in the back half, towards the end of third quarter going in the fourth quarter to see auto getting healthier than what we've seen it. They've had a supply chain issue. We expect that to be fixed as the plants have been reopened. And the '21s, we'll be hitting the dealerships.</p><p>So again, we've become less reliant on the auto business to drive our revenue. And as in the past, I'll reiterate that we've gone from ourselves being [generalist to] specialists, and that continues to lead to a better performances.</p><p>DANIEL LOUIS KURNOS: Got it. That's helpful. And Chris, I apologize if I missed this. Did you give us an update on where you're at with the DTC?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: No, we haven't -- that was not in my remarks. There's a lot of work going on in DTC right now, it's definitely going to be an important part of the future for the RSNs for tennis and also for broadcast. And it's too early right now to give specific guidance, but we are busy adding that feature to our new digital reboot, which will come out next year, and it will be complementary to the MVPD product that we have today.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is coming from Davis Hebert of Wells Fargo.</p><p>JAMES DAVIS HEBERT, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR HIGH YIELD ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I want to ask on the current accruals and the rebates, I understand, I think, the cash flow piece. How firm are those rebate levels, I mean, to the extent MLB stops and starts or maybe further under-delivers on those live games?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. So the numbers could obviously change if the number of games change. And it's really just a mathematical calculation. And the sort of hedged nature of our contracts would continue to apply as the games continue to shrink.</p><p>JAMES DAVIS HEBERT: Okay. But would it be fair to say that if there are -- if you delivered -- under delivered, it's not going to be material to what you've already accrued for?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: It shouldn't be material to our actual EBITDA at the end of the day, but it could certainly increase the amount of rebates from the teams and the amount of rebates to the MVPDs.</p><p>JAMES DAVIS HEBERT: Okay. Understood. And then on the team payment side, is all that getting taken care of this year? Or have you had negotiations with the teams to perhaps, smooth that out over a longer period of time? Or are there other negotiations going on?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: It should all happen this year to the extent some teams have issues from a cash flow perspective, we'll have to see. We have no indication of that so far. And what we've been doing is essentially withholding current payments right now to chip away the balance.</p><p>JAMES DAVIS HEBERT: Okay. And then, Lucy, you mentioned a lot of different liability management possibilities. I wondered, would a tender offer, perhaps, be in the conversations in capture discount in Diamond sports bonds, just thinking you'll be sitting on a decent amount of cash at the political, maybe that's an open win versus an exchange. But just curious your thoughts on something like that.</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Well, so the political revenues are really belong to STG. And again, we've said in the past that each silo would be self-funded. So STG's political has really gone to shareholder returns, whether it's the dividend or the share repurchases. And Diamond's cash flow is there to fund Diamond. So we would not look to pull STG's cash over to Diamond for that. But again, when you're talking as much debt as diamond has outstanding, anything we do, I think you should expect would be a bigger type transaction.</p><p>JAMES DAVIS HEBERT: Okay. And then my last question is, I believe you had a year to rebrand the RSMs. I'm just curious, the timing on that or if you got to reprieve with the COVID-19 situation.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: We have [still] more than a year on that. And the new name will be announced and released early next year.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo.</p><p>STEVEN LEE CAHALL, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So maybe if we've learned one thing about the RSN business. It's just that the earnings power may be a little lower. And so the debt level that you originally decided was appropriate, might be a little too high. And Davis asked and, we've talked a little bit about ways to renegotiate that debt level down. Just a really big overhang on what's otherwise a really good TV broadcast business. So if you kind of step back, how do you really think about just steps that you can take to remove that overhang from the debt on the RSN business so that you can capture more of the fair value in the TV business?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Well, as we mentioned, we're busy looking at several alternatives for -- to delever Diamond that we think there are many options there. And as I've stated many times that we see these entities as independent and self-funding. So we don't see any reason for value or cash to be going from one silo to the other. And really, we are looking at our valuation, and should be done on some of the parts basis.</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Yes. And Steve, look, what I would add is, I think what people are missing is the investment thesis of why we bought the RSNs in the first place, right? So as we look ahead, right, you've got it -- including all the growth opportunities and the synergies, which, again, is the reason we bought the RSNs. We love the business. It is a good business. Are we -- is leverage here in the near term more elevated? Yes. I think that's probably though for just about any company that's out there in the U.S. today as a result of COVID. So we have some elevated leverage. It will take us a little bit longer to get down to our target leverage, but we are focused on getting down to the target leverage. But part of how we're going to do that is through all the growth opportunities, again, whether it's the production programming synergies, cross-promotion, cross-programming digital opportunities, legalized sports betting, rebranding and selling all of our digital impression, so much there that we haven't even started to mine with Diamond.</p><p>STEVEN LEE CAHALL: Great. And then maybe just on the retrans side, you've done some recent station renewals with Viacom, CBS and with Comcast, as you pointed out, do you feel like you have the ability to maybe give us either a qualitative or quantitative outlook on net retrans growth for 2020?</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: So as you know, we do not have full year guidance on the table. So at this point, we're not ready to put that out there. As I said, there's a lot of variability in what's happening in the pay TV universe, so -- which is a factor that would go into that. So at this point, no full year guidance.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is coming from John Janedis of Wolfe Research.</p><p>JOHN JANEDIS, MD &amp; SENIOR MEDIA ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH, LLC: I'll be brief. One is a follow-up on the ad side, (inaudible) ways of COVID across the portfolio. What impact are you seeing or do you expect to see on back-to-school spending? And is that typically a swing factor come into that at [later] day? I think you separately given the where we are on the political side. Increasingly, we end up seeing -- we do see a democratic sweep in the fall. How does that change the regulatory landscape and any purpose for your businesses?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: (inaudible)</p><p>ROBERT D. WEISBORD: Okay. Go ahead. Sorry.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: No, no, I was just going to say, hopefully, you heard that, John was a little muffled. But Rob, why don't you handle the back-to-school question, and I will handle the regulatory.</p><p>ROBERT D. WEISBORD: Back-to-school typically is not a large revenue driver for the company. But with COVID going on and the hybrid learnings of some markets going back, some hybrid, some school from home. We're in the midst of launching several creative non-traditional programs to generate revenue that we typically wouldn't be thinking of.</p><p>So in that space, we expect to be able to scale several concepts across our platform. So we do think we'll be able to capture revenue that we probably haven't had in the past in regards to back-to-school.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Okay. So in terms of your question around the election and the regulatory environment, I think it's worthy to note that broadcasting has significant support on both sides of the aisle. You saw that with letters from both, a very large amount of both Democrats and Republicans, supporting local media and promoting its survival is vital to the communities we serve. So we feel, as an industry in good shape with bipartisan support. So we're not concerned about a change in administration and the notion of reregulating broadcasting would be akin to picking on the little guy. I do think some of the bigger companies like [big tech] will have more regulations in the future. But our industry is so small and fragmented, it just -- it wouldn't make sense.</p><p>JOHN JANEDIS: Got it, Chris. If I could sneak in one more. Just a follow-up on Comcast. And maybe a bit more broadly, look, as you said, the market's been negative RSNs. Can you give us an update on how you're doing the landscape? Obviously, you talked about 85% of the subs being locked in, but have distributors in those negotiations -- have they taken a harder look at that business? Any change in tiering up or anything else to highlight?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Sure. So we have seen in all of our negotiations, essentially, status quo environment in terms of terms, tiering, pricing, all the various elements that go into a distribution agreement. So really -- and we've now cycled through all the major and small MVPDs. And say, for one, Dish, we found what we expected, which is that this is very valuable content to the distributors, it drives subscriptions. And we have achieved what we set out to achieve with them, which was status quo renewals.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Ripley, President and CEO, for closing comments.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Thank you. I would like to conclude by thanking all of our employees, customers and stakeholders for their patience during this unprecedented time. We are comfortable that the actions we are taking are not only helping us manage the challenges in the short term, but are also positioning the company for continued to test in the future.</p><p>Thank you for participating on our earnings call this morning. If anyone has any additional questions, please feel free to contact us.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event.

Residents of Caribbean and southern US were recently impacted by the dangerous and deadly effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate.</p><p>2. Hurricane Irma was the largest hurricane event Florida Power &amp; Light has ever faced.</p><p>3. Powerful storm impacted all 35 counties and 27,000 square miles of FPL's service territory, causing more than 4.4m customers to lose power.</p><p>4. In preparation for hurricane, FPL assembled and pre-positioned the largest restoration workforce in U.S. history, which grew to approx. 28,000 at its peak.</p><p>1. This preparation and coordinated response combined with the hardening and automation investments that FPL has made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid enabled the company to restore service to over 2m customers in one day and to complete the restoration of all 4.4m customers in 10 days.</p><p>5. Efforts of NEE team resulted in the fastest restoration of the largest amount of people by any one utility in US history.</p><p>6. Mutual aid in times of disaster is one of the hallmarks of Co.'s industry and this storm was no exception.</p><p>1. Co. is deeply grateful for the assistance provided by industry partners.</p><p>2. Hurricane Irma Restoration:</p><p>1. Based upon a methodology developed by National Center for Atmospheric Research, Hurricane Irma had an approx. 50% higher damage potential than Hurricane Wilma, and resulted in over 90% of FPL customers losing power vs. 75% for Hurricane Wilma.</p><p>2. Notwithstanding the fact that Hurricane Irma was a much stronger storm impacting a larger portion of FPL's service territory, there was approx. 80% reduction to pole damage and an 80% improvement in the time to energize all substations following the storm vs. Hurricane Wilma.</p><p>3. After day one, FPL had 50% of its customers restored, also an 80% improvement vs. Wilma restoration efforts.</p><p>1. In fact, 95% of customers impacted by Irma were restored in one week and while the avg. customer outage from Hurricane Wilma lasted for over five days.</p><p>2. Avg. outage for customers affected by Hurricane Irma was roughly two days; 60% improvement.</p><p>4. Total GDP within service territory averages over $1b per day.</p><p>1. By reducing avg. customer outage by more than three days vs. Wilma, believes the avoided economic loss to the state has more than paid for the $3b in hardening investments Co. have made since 2006.</p><p>5. Given the size and scale of this hurricane, the Florida Public Service Commission has opened a docket to solicit customer comments and to take evidence on the statewide utility response to Irma, including an analysis of the impact prior hardening activities had on restoration efforts.</p><p>6. Believes that the improvement in FPL's storm restoration efforts shows that ongoing transmission and distribution investments, together with preparation and coordinated response are providing significant value to customers.</p><p>7. In an effort to mitigate a significant bill impact for customers related to the cost recovery for Hurricane Irma, currently expects to propose a surcharge equivalent to $4 on a 1,000 kilowatt hour residential bill beginning in March 2018, which equates to a step-up of $0.64 from the surcharge related to Hurricane Matthew that rolls off at that time.</p><p>1. Subject to review and prudence determination of final storm costs by Florida Public Service Commission, which are preliminarily estimated to be approx. $1.3b.</p><p>2. Expects this surcharge to increase by roughly $1.50, to approx. $5.50 per month, in 2019 and stay at that level until the storm costs are fully recovered, which is expected by 2020-end.</p><p>3. Highlights:</p><p>1. Delivered solid results and building upon strong progress made in 1H17 remains well positioned to achieve overall objectives for 2017.</p><p>2. Adjusted WPS increased by $0.11 or 6.3% against prior-year qtr., primarily reflecting contributions from new investments at Florida Power &amp; Light and Energy Resources.</p><p>1. YTD grown adjusted EPS by 9.2% vs. 3Q16.</p><p>3. Executed well on major initiatives, including continuing to capitalize on one of best renewable development periods in Co.'s history.</p><p>4. Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL):</p><p>1. EPS increased $0.08 from 3Q16.</p><p>2. Strong growth was driven by continued investment in the business to maintain best-in-class customer value proposition of:</p><p>1. Clean energy.</p><p>2. Low bills.</p><p>3. High reliability.</p><p>4. Outstanding customer service.</p><p>3. Earned regulatory ROE of approx. 11.5% and avg. regulatory capital employed grew roughly 9.8% over 3Q16.</p><p>4. All of major capital initiatives remain on track, including 1,750-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and construction of the eight 74.5-megawatt solar energy centers that are currently being built under the solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA, mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement.</p><p>5. Pleased that the Florida Public Service Commission approved the settlement agreement with the Office of Public Counsel for the early phase out of St. John's River Power Park, helping to further reduce costs for FPL customers and lower emissions for Florida residents.</p><p>5. Energy Resources:</p><p>1. Adjusted EPS increased by roughly 3% YoverY as contributions from new investments more than offset a negative contribution from Co.'s existing assets as a result of poor fleet-wide wind resource.</p><p>1. Lowest on record for the months of July through Sept. over the past 30 years.</p><p>2. Development organization has added 760 megawatts of long-term contracted projects to backlog, including the largest announced combined solar plus storage project in US.</p><p>1. This continued cost and efficiency improvements in wind and solar technology support compelling renewable economics that remain the primary driver of ongoing customer origination activity.</p><p>3. Continued to advance wind repowering program as well, adding 514 megawatts to repowering backlog for 2018 delivery.</p><p>4. Commissioned more than 300 megawatts of repowering projects and closed the first tax equity financing for wind repowering portfolio.</p><p>5. Pleased to receive the FERC Certificate for MVP and looking forward to advancing construction activities to support 2018-end commercial operation date.</p><p>6. Overall, with three strong quarters complete in 2017, pleased with the progress Co. is making at NEE and are well positioned to achieve the full-year financial expectations that was previously discussed.</p><p>4. FPL:</p><p>1. Net income of $566m, or $1.19 per share.</p><p>1. Up $51m and $0.08 per share YoverY.</p><p>2. Regulatory capital employed increased by approx. 9.8% over 3Q16 and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of 9.9%.</p><p>3. CapEx approx. $1b.</p><p>1. Continues to expect full-year capital investments to total between $5.0-5.4b.</p><p>4. Reported ROE for regulatory purposes approx. 11.5% for 12 months Sept. 2017-end.</p><p>1. Under current rate agreement, records reserve amortization entries to achieve predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period.</p><p>5. Reversed $124m of reserve amortization after offsetting the impacts of Hurricane Irma, leaving Co. with a balance of roughly $1.15b, which can be utilized over the remainder of settlement agreement.</p><p>1. Continues to expect the flexibility provided by the utilization of reserve amortization, coupled with weather normalized sales forecast and current CapEx and O&amp;M expectations, to support target regulatory ROE of 11.5% for the full-year 2017, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6-11.6% under current settlement agreement.</p><p>6. Each of ongoing capital deployment initiatives continues to progress well as Co. focuses on delivering best-in-class customer value proposition.</p><p>7. Construction on the approx. 1,750-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and under budget.</p><p>1. Eight solar sites, totaling nearly 600 megawatts of combined capacity are currently being built across FPL's service territory and are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost-effective energy to FPL customers later this year and in early 2018.</p><p>2. Continues to advance the development of the additional 1,600 megawatts of solar projects that are planned for beyond 2018 and have currently secured potential sites that could support more than 5 gigawatts of FPL's ongoing solar expansion.</p><p>8. In Sept., Florida Public Service Commission approved the settlement agreement between FPL and Office of Public Counsel, the consumer advocate in Florida, regarding FPL's proposal for the early shutdown of the St. Johns River Power Park, an approx. 1,300-megawatt coal-fired plant jointly owned with JEA.</p><p>1. Early retirement of the plant, which is expected in Jan. 2018, is projected to provide total savings to FPL customers of $183m and prevent nearly 5.6m tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, adding to the customer savings and emission reductions of Co.'s Cedar Bay and Indiantown transactions.</p><p>9. Earlier this month, filed a determination of need with FPSC for roughly 1,200-megawatt, highly efficient, clean burning natural gas Dania Beach Clean Energy Center.</p><p>1. Project, which has a total expected capital investment of approx. $900m, is a modernization of Co.'s existing Lauderdale Plant and is expected to begin operation by mid-2022.</p><p>10. Consistent with Co.'s focus on low bills, estimates that the facility will generate more than $335m in net cost savings for FPL customers over its operational life.</p><p>11. Pleased that earlier in the week, the City of Vero Beach City Council approved FPL's purchase of substantially all of the assets of municipal electric system for approx. $185m.</p><p>1. Continuing to work on the remaining necessary approvals and hope to be in a position to close the transaction in late 2018.</p><p>2. If successful, looking forward to Vero Beach's roughly 34,000 customers benefiting from FPL's best-in-class customer value proposition, including rates that are among the lowest in the state.</p><p>5. FPL - Florida's Economy:</p><p>1. Despite the effects of Hurricane Irma, Florida economy remains strong.</p><p>2. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate 3.8% in Sept.</p><p>1. Down more than 1% from year earlier and lowest in over 10 years.</p><p>3. As an indicator of new construction, new building permits remain at healthy levels.</p><p>4. Most recent reading of Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 5.3% from prior year, while mortgage delinquency rates continue to decline.</p><p>5. Florida's economy continues to grow, with the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence near post-recession highs.</p><p>6. FPL's avg. number of customers increased by roughly 62,000, or 1.3%, YoverY.</p><p>7. For 3Q, estimates that warmer weather had a positive YoverY impact on usage per customer of approx. 1.6%.</p><p>1. Hurricane Irma had a negative impact of approx. 3.5%.</p><p>8. After taking these factors into account, sales decreased 3% on a weather-normalized basis.</p><p>1. Reflected continued customer growth, more than offset by an estimated decline in usage per customer of 1.7%.</p><p>9. With increased uncertainty in Co.'s estimate of weather-normalized usage per customer as a result of Hurricane Irma, Co. is unable to draw any firm conclusions about long-term trends in underlying usage.</p><p>1. Will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage going forward.</p><p>10. As a reminder, modest changes in usage per customer are not likely to have a material effect on earnings over the course of the settlement agreement.</p><p>1. Will adjust the level of reserve amortization utilization to offset any effect, which would allow Co. to maintain its target regulatory ROE.</p><p>11. Despite the effects of hurricane, the underlying Florida economy remains strong, supporting ongoing customer growth and, primarily due to weather warmer than expected temperatures, Co. has utilized less reserve amortization than expected through first three quarters.</p><p>1. Assuming normal weather and operating conditions, currently expects 2017-end with a reserve amortization balance of more than $1.1b that can be utilized over the remainder of settlement agreement.</p><p>12. Capital initiatives to further enhance are already best-in-class customer value proposition are also progressing well.</p><p>1. These smart capital investments are expected to deliver a regulatory capital employed CAGR of roughly 8% per year from 2017-2020.</p><p>13. Pleased with FPL's YTD execution and will continue to maintain Co.'s relentless focus on:</p><p>1. Delivering low bills.</p><p>2. High reliability.</p><p>3. Clean energy.</p><p>4. Outstanding customer service.</p><p>6. Energy Resources:</p><p>1. Reported:</p><p>1. GAAP earnings $292m.</p><p>2. Adjusted EPS $0.62.</p><p>2. Contribution to adjusted EPS increased by $0.02 from 3Q16.</p><p>1. New investments contributed $0.12 per share, primarily reflecting continued growth in contracted renewables program.</p><p>3. Fleet-wide wind resource was the lowest on record over the past 30 years at 87% of long-term avg. vs. 101% in 3Q16.</p><p>1. Weaker wind resource in 3Q was the primary driver of negative $0.03 contribution from existing generation assets relative to prior-year comparable qtr.</p><p>2. All other impacts reduced results by $0.07 per share, including the effects of increased interest expense.</p><p>4. Signed contracts for 760 megawatts of new projects since last call.</p><p>1. In addition to 566 megawatts of wind for 2018 delivery, Co. successfully originated:</p><p>1. 164 megawatts of solar for delivery between 2018-2020.</p><p>2. 30 megawatt battery storage project that will be paired with one of the solar PPAs.</p><p>2. This project is the largest combined solar and storage facility in US announced to date.</p><p>1. Strong qtr. of origination activity is consistent with recent trends and reflective of continued strong customer demand driven largely by wind and solar economics.</p><p>5. Combination of low cost wind or solar energy paired with low cost battery storage solution provides a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a firm generation resource.</p><p>1. Today, Co. is able to offer this firm wind or solar resource for a lower cost than the operating costs of traditional, inefficient generation resources.</p><p>2. With continued equipment cost declines and efficiency gains as the tax incentives phase down early in the next decade Co. expects new firm wind and firm solar, without incentives, to be cheaper than the operating costs of coal, nuclear and less fuel efficient oil and gas-fired generation units, creating significant opportunities for renewables growth going forward.</p><p>6. Wind repowering efforts also continue to progress.</p><p>1. Added 514 megawatts to Co.'s repowering backlog, including approx. 241 megawatts of contracted projects that have new PPA extensions in place.</p><p>2. Wind repowering backlog now stands at over 2,300 megawatts, all for 2017 and 2018 delivery.</p><p>7. During 3Q, Energy Resources successfully commissioned an additional 308 megawatts of wind repowering projects.</p><p>1. Also closed, first tax equity financing related to wind repowering, raising roughly $243m on a portfolio of 327 megawatts of projects.</p><p>8. Continues to expect to invest a total of between $2.5-3.0b for repowering's through 2020.</p><p>1. Progress Co. has made this qtr. reflects the continued strong outlook for renewables development and it believes that by leveraging Energy Resources' competitive advantages it is well positioned to capture a meaningful share of the wind and solar markets going forward.</p><p>9. Beyond renewables, Co. continues to make good progress on the Mountain Valley Pipeline.</p><p>10. Earlier this month, received FERC certificate for MVP.</p><p>1. Working to complete final development activities and expect to begin advancing construction efforts to support Dec. 2018 in service date.</p><p>11. NEE's expected investment is approx. $1.1b.</p><p>7. NEE Results:</p><p>1. 3Q17:</p><p>1. GAAP net income attributable to NEE was $847m, or $1.79 per share.</p><p>2. Adjusted:</p><p>1. Earnings $875m.</p><p>2. EPS $1.85.</p><p>3. Adjusted earnings from Corporate &amp; Other segment increased $0.01 per share vs. 3Q16.</p><p>4. Earlier this month, Co.'s transmission team was selected by New York Independent System Operator to develop a 20-mile, 345 kV transmission line and accompanying facilities located near Buffalo, NY.</p><p>1. Project is NYISO's first competitive transmission award under its Public Policy Transmission Planning Process and will help the state to maximize the flow of energy from lower-cost, renewable generation.</p><p>2. Project is required to be in service by June 2022 and Co.'s investment is expected to total roughly $180m.</p><p>5. Pleased with this recent success and, although a very competitive business, looks to build on that success with other opportunities going forward.</p><p>2. 2017:</p><p>1. Adjusted EPS $6.35-6.85.</p><p>2. Currently expect lower growth in 4Q as Co. is pursuing several refinancing initiatives to capitalize on favorable market conditions that could drive up to roughly $150m of NPV savings on a cash basis, but will result in a reduction in net income when they close later this year.</p><p>3. Example:</p><p>1. Announced the refinancing of $750m of Capital Holdings hybrid securities.</p><p>2. This transaction produces more than $50m of NPV savings on cash basis, will result in a net income reduction of approx. $13m in 4Q.</p><p>4. Continues to believe Co. is well positioned to achieve full-year results at or near the upper-end of previously disclosed 6-8% adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate expectations, off 2016 base.</p><p>5. Cash flow from operations to grow above adjusted EPS growth rate, after adjusting for impacts from certain FPL clause recoveries, storm costs and recoveries, and the Indiantown acquisition.</p><p>6. Adjusted EPS for:</p><p>1. 2018 $6.80-7.30.</p><p>2. 2020 $7.85-8.45.</p><p>3. Implying CAGR off 2016 base of 6-8%.</p><p>7. With the overall strength and diversity of growth prospects at both FPL and Energy Resources, Co. will be disappointed if it is not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of 6-8% range through 2020.</p><p>8. Expects to grow Co.'s dividends per share 12-14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08.</p><p>1. All of expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.</p><p>9. Although it is still premature to draw any firm conclusions, Co. wanted to provide an update on the potential impacts of recent tax reform proposal on long-term adjusted EPS expectations.</p><p>10. Has modeled this scenario making certain assumptions based on the framework that was released on Sept. 27 by the Trump Administration, the House Committee on Ways and Means, and the Senate Committee on Finance.</p><p>1. Off of Co.'s 2020 baseline, would expect this scenario to be approx. $0.20-0.30 per share accretive.</p><p>2. Continues to be actively engaged in the tax reform discussion and will provide further updates as the ultimate direction of and progress on tax reform becomes clearer.</p><p>3. Summary:</p><p>1. NEE remains on track to meet its 2017 expectations and one remain as enthusiastic as ever about future growth prospects.</p><p>2. At FPL, ongoing focus is on:</p><p>1. Operational cost effectiveness.</p><p>2. Productivity and making smart long-term investments to further improve quality, reliability and efficiency of everything it does.</p><p>3. At Energy Resources, continues to make terrific progress on Co.'s development program and remains optimistic about its renewables growth prospects as a result of improving equipment costs and efficiencies and ongoing advancements in energy storage.</p><p>4. Continues to believe that Co. has one of the best opportunity sets in industry and that it is well positioned to continue to deliver on growth expectations going forward.</p><p>8. NEP:</p><p>1. On 10/25/17, NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $39.25 per common unit, continuing Co.'s track record of growing distributions at the top end of 12-15% per year growth range.</p><p>2. Pleased to announce that following approval by the Conflicts Committee of the NextEra Energy Partners Board, NEP has reached an agreement to acquire four additional assets from Energy Resources, adding to what Co. view as an already best-in-class portfolio, with an avg. 18-year contract life and counterparty credit rating of A3 following the acquisition.</p><p>1. These assets are expected to further enhance the quality and diversity of NEP's existing portfolio and to complete the growth necessary to achieve Co.'s previously outlined year-end 2017 adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution run-rate expectations.</p><p>3. Expects the transaction, which is anticipated to be funded with the issuance of $550m of previously announced convertible preferred units and cash on hand, to yield double-digit return to NEP's unit holders and to be accretive to LP distributions.</p><p>4. Building upon the changes Co. has pursued this year to further improve NEP's investor value proposition, including:</p><p>1. Governance enhancements.</p><p>2. Modified IDR structure.</p><p>3. Stand-alone credit ratings in the mid-to high-BB category.</p><p>4. Agreement to issue $550m of convertible preferred units.</p><p>5. NEP demonstrated its ability to access additional low cost sources of capital this qtr. with the issuances of:</p><p>1. $300m of three-year convertible debt.</p><p>2. Total of $1.1b of seven-and 10-year senior unsecured notes at historically low yields.</p><p>6. On 10/25/17, also announcing that Co. has upsized and extended NEP's revolving credit facility to further enhance NEP's financial flexibility and strengthen its standalone prospects going forward.</p><p>7. Consistent with Co.'s long-term growth prospects; introducing 12/31/18 run rate expectations reflecting roughly 22% and 17% growth, respectively from comparable year-end 2017 run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD mid-points.</p><p>8. Pleased with YTD execution at NEP and are well positioned to meet Co.'s 2017 and longer term expectations.</p><p>9. Results:</p><p>1. 3Q17:</p><p>1. Adjusted EBITDA $178m and cash available for distribution $47m.</p><p>1. Up approx. 2% and down roughly 8% from 3Q16.</p><p>2. Poor wind resource had a meaningful impact on NEP's assets.</p><p>3. Fleet-wide wind resource 82%.</p><p>1. Lowest 3Q on record over the last 30 years vs. 95% for 3Q16.</p><p>4. Although still early in 4Q, wind resource has begun to return to more normal levels in Oct.</p><p>5. On YTD basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by 15% and 10%.</p><p>1. These results are net of IDR fees, which Co. treat as an OpEx.</p><p>6. NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $39.25 per common unit, or $1.57 per common unit on an annualized basis.</p><p>1. Up approx. 15% from a year earlier.</p><p>2. 2017:</p><p>1. Completed multiple financing transactions this qtr. further demonstrating its ability to access a variety of capital sources.</p><p>2. In early Sept. NEP issued $300m of convertible notes due in 2020 at 1.50% coupon.</p><p>3. Notes have the potential to convert into equity at a 25% premium to 09/06/17 closing price of $42.29.</p><p>1. Consistent with desire to achieve the top end of NEP's growth expectations, conversion rate has been structured to allow an approximate 15% annualized growth rate and distributions per unit without an adjustment to the conversion rate.</p><p>2. Concurrent with debt issuance, NEP purchased a capped call that provides economic and dilution protection up to 50% premium to 09/06/17 closing price.</p><p>4. In Sept., NEP also issued $550m of seven-and 10-year senior unsecured notes to refinance approx. $1.1b in existing secured holding co. debt that had maturities in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>5. Believes the strong demand for the offering, which was more than five and one half times oversubscribed, is indicative of NEP's superior value proposition supported by diversified cash flows from long-term contracts with strong creditworthy counterparties.</p><p>6. Transactions priced at historical lows, including:</p><p>1. Lowest spread and coupon for Ba1/BB US dollar offering on seven-year tranche.</p><p>2. Lowest coupon for Ba1/BB USD offering on 10-year tranche.</p><p>7. On 10/25/17, also announcing amendments to existing revolving credit facility.</p><p>8. In addition to lower borrowing rates, the facility will be:</p><p>1. Upsized from $250-750m.</p><p>2. Maturity will be extended from July 2019 to Oct. 2022.</p><p>9. Believes that the strong demand from 20 banks to participate in the amended credit facility is reflective of ore strengths that separate NEP from other infrastructure alternatives.</p><p>10. Expects to target total Holdco leverage to project distributions of 3-4 times at 2017-end.</p><p>1. Consistent with NEP's credit ratings, total Holdco leverage to project distributions of 4-5 times over longer term.</p><p>11. Believe these leverage targets are supported by NEP's amortizing project debt and long-term contracted portfolio, and are consistent with Co.'s experience in financing clean energy assets.</p><p>1. As a result of this financing flexibility, aside from any modest issuances under after-market program or issuances upon the conversion of NEP's convertible securities, Co. continues to expect NextEra Energy Partners will not need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest.</p><p>12. NEP governance enhancements, which will give [LP] unit holders, among other rights, the ability to elect a majority of NEP Board beginning at the shareholder meeting to be held later this year; implemented during the qtr.</p><p>10. Additional Details:</p><p>1. Continues to execute on plan to expand NEP's portfolio with the agreement to acquire four additional assets from Energy Resources.</p><p>1. This portfolio is a geographically diverse mix of wind and solar projects, collectively consisting of approx. 691 megawatts, including the acquisition of a 25.9% indirect interest in Desert Sunlight Solar Energy Center.</p><p>2. Portfolio has cash available for distribution weighted remaining contract life of 22 years.</p><p>3. Transaction is expected to close by year-end, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and represents another step toward growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with previously stated expectations of 12-15% per year through at least 2022.</p><p>2. NEP expects to acquire the portfolio for total consideration of approx. $812m, subject to working capital and other adjustments, plus the assumption of approx. $459m in liabilities related to tax equity financing and considers approx. $268m of existing non-recourse project debt related to Desert Sunlight project.</p><p>3. Acquisition is expected to contribute:</p><p>1. Adjusted EBITDA of approx. $185-205m.</p><p>2. Cash available for distribution of approx. $79-89m.</p><p>3. Each on a five-year avg. annual run rate basis beginning 12/31/17.</p><p>4. Purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded through the issuance of $550m of previously announced convertible preferred units.</p><p>1. With the balance funded with cash on hand as a result of NEP's recent convertible debt financing.</p><p>11. NEP Expectations:</p><p>1. Following the acquisition of this portfolio from Energy Resources, expects NEP assets to support the previously announced 12/17/17 run rate expectations.</p><p>2. Reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2017.</p><p>1. Adjusted EBITDA $875-975m.</p><p>2. CAFD $310-340m.</p><p>3. Expects today's announced acquisition to close later in 4Q, do not expect the portfolio to provide a meaningful contribution to 4Q17 adjusted EBITDA or cash available for distribution.</p><p>4. As mentioned earlier, consistent with previously announced long-term growth prospects.</p><p>5. Today, introducing 12/31/18 run rate expectations for:</p><p>1. Adjusted EBITDA $1.05-1.20b.</p><p>2. CAFD $360-400m.</p><p>3. Reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2018.</p><p>6. Expectations are subject to normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees, as Co. treat these as OpEx.</p><p>7. From a base of 4Q16 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.41, continues to see 12-15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2022.</p><p>8. With the acquisitions announced today, expects the annualized rate of 4Q17 distribution, meaning the 4Q distribution that is payable in Feb. 2018, to be at the top end of previously disclosed range of $1.58-1.62 per common unit.</p><p>9. Cannot draw any firm conclusions about the impacts of tax reform on NEP.</p><p>1. Expects that in most reasonable scenarios NEP's US federal income tax shield, which is currently greater than 15 years, and NEP's earnings and profits balance, which is currently expected to remain negative for at least the next eight years, will not be materially affected.</p><p>10. Pleased with the progress NEP has made over 2017 and is well positioned to achieve full-year financial expectations.</p><p>12. Summary:</p><p>1. Has successfully executed on growth strategy for the year.</p><p>2. Believes NEP continues to provide a best-in-class investor value proposition.</p><p>3. As previously outlined, NEP has the flexibility to grow in three ways:</p><p>1. Acquiring assets from Energy Resources.</p><p>2. Organically.</p><p>3. Acquiring assets from other third parties.</p><p>4. NEP also has a cost of capital and access to capital advantage, with substantial flexibility to finance its long-term growth as was further demonstrated by the transactions completed this qtr.</p><p>1. These advantages, together with the stability of NEP's cash flows backed by the portfolio's long-term avg. contract life and strong counterparty credit profile, amortizing debt, tax position, enhanced governance rights and long-term growth expectations through at least 2022; all support NEP's favorable position relative to other [yieldcos] and MLPs.</p><p>5. NextEra Energy Partners continues to make excellent progress against its strategic and growth initiatives and Co. remains as enthusiastic as ever about NEP's long-term prospects.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We'll go to Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley.</p><p>STEPHEN CALDER BYRD, MD AND HEAD OF NORTH AMERICAN RESEARCH FOR THE POWER AND UTILITIES AND CLEAN ENERGY, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to check in on your excess balance sheet capacity and just generally, your balance sheet strength. You've been putting up additional wins in the renewables business, and it looks like there's also upside at the utility. When we think about using that excess balance sheet capacity, do you see significant organic opportunities at the different business units? Or do you think you're likely to still have excess balance sheet capacity through the end of the decade?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM, CFO AND EVP OF FINANCE, NEXTERA ENERGY, INC.: Okay. So first of all, the excess balance sheet capacity is about $3 billion to $5 billion through 2020. And when you look at the financial plan that we have laid out through 2020 at the investor conference, the CapEx that we already have planned for the FPL business and the Energy Resources business does not take into account that $3 billion to $5 billion of excess balance sheet capacity.</p><p>So what do we do with it? We have a few options. I think our preferred option would be to find incremental capital investment opportunities that drive long-term value for shareholders and that also help to create growth post 2020, which we view as being strong, given all the potential growth platform opportunities that we have in the next decade, given where we see renewables and also given all the opportunities that FPL has on Eric's side of the business.</p><p>STEPHEN CALDER BYRD: Understood. And just shifting gears to storage. You made some interesting remarks about storage. And I guess, we're hearing that storage solicitations are now a regular part of a lot of renewable procurements. I was just curious, your opinion as to whether we're currently in the right ZIP code that you think many customers will opt for storage linked with renewables or do you think that's a few years down the road? What's your sense of the likely customer appetite over the next couple of years for storage linked with renewables and PPAs?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. Storage is very real now. And I think -- and as evidenced by the project we announced today with the 30 megawatts tied to an existing solar project, making it the largest combined solar plus storage project in the U.S. But when you look at where storage economics are, storage costs continue to come down significantly, efficiency continues to improve at a rate where we can now combine storage with solar and really beat the pricing, the existing variable costs just to operate a nuclear or coal plant, and be pretty darn competitive even with combined cycle gas facilities.</p><p>And what's the result of that? Because of that, on almost every solar procurement that we are bidding on today, counterparties are asking us not only for solar bid, but also for a combined solar plus storage bid. They clearly understand the benefits that are created by the firm dispatchability of the combined products.</p><p>So the short answer is, we're already here and things should only continue to improve as we go forward and as tax incentives phase down in the next decade, and you can combine storage, which will be even lower cost, even more efficient, with an even lower cost and more efficient solar panel and balance of system cost, we see that as a very viable product going forward, and we also are continuing to look for opportunities to combine solar with wind or storage with wind. And with that, I don't know if Armando has anything that he would like to add.</p><p>ARMANDO PIMENTEL, CEO OF NEXTERA ENERGY RESOURCES LLC AND PRESIDENT OF NEXTERA ENERGY RESOURCES LLC, NEXTERA ENERGY, INC.: Steven, real quick, recall that at the investor conference, what we laid out was the roughly $700 million of CapEx opportunities in the storage market through 2020. We continue to think that's a good number. That doesn't mean that customers aren't significantly interested in what's going on and proactively asking for bids. And even as the cost estimate comes down, we continue to believe that this is going to be a significant opportunity early part of the next decade.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Steve Fleishman, Wolfe Research.</p><p>STEVEN ISAAC FLEISHMAN, MD &amp; SENIOR UTILITIES ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH, LLC: Just one question on the NEP financing for the new drops. Could you just repeat kind of the financing plan that you laid out for the new drops announced today?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes, absolutely, Steve. So for the new drops, remember, right around the time of the investor conference, we completed the $550 million convertible preferred offering at a 4.5% coupon, lowest coupon ever for a convertible offering. That will comprise the lion's share of the $812 million equity price for that acquisition. The balance will come from cash on hand. Now cash on hand is really coming from the convertible debt offering that we closed on in September at a 1.5% coupon, with the up 25% and then the cap [capped] call on top of that given a second [arm of] consideration of up 50%.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Greg Gordon, Evercore Partners.</p><p>GREGORY HARMON GORDON, SENIOR MD, HEAD OF POWER &amp; UTILITIES RESEARCH AND FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI, RESEARCH DIVISION: The first is you've reclassified a significant chunk of your wind assets from merchant to contracted, and there's a footnote that describes why. But can you go into some more detail as to what the underlying assumptions are that -- with regard to profitability of those assets and why they've shifted.</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. It's really pretty simple. So those are repowering assets that were formerly ERCOT merchant assets. And the way the economics works is that roughly 90% of the gross margin comes from the production tax credits.</p><p>So you can think of the PTC as essentially being a contractual hedge. So every megawatt-hour that we're generating, we're getting paid $24 on that megawatt-hour for 90% of the gross margin. And so given that, and also the fact that some of those projects will carry financial hedges going forward, the more appropriate classification over the next 10 years during the PTC period is as a contracted asset.</p><p>GREGORY HARMON GORDON: Well that makes a pretty underlying strong statement about the incremental IRR you're getting on the repowerings if the vast majority of your return at the hurdle rate is coming just from getting the PTCs without worrying about a substantial energy margin. Is that the right way to think about it?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Well, yes, I mean, remember too -- I mean, it's about half the CapEx and because of -- it's half the CapEx, you're getting the driver from the PTCs and then energy is the upside. That's why we've said the unlevered IRRs are a few ticks up from what we would get on a newbuild wind project.</p><p>GREGORY HARMON GORDON: Fantastic. My second question is, if you would humor us, can you delineate what the basic assumptions you were assuming are on your baseline tax case?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. I mean, it's really what came out on September 27. So you can think of it as a 20% corporate tax rate, 100% immediate expensing, and then we've made an assumption on what the interest limitation is that I'm probably not going to share on this call.</p><p>GREGORY HARMON GORDON: Fair enough. But the industry EI has been lobbying on behalf of the industry to try and achieve an offramp or an exemption on interest deductibility and bonus depreciation, correct?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: It -- well, I'll let Jim take it.</p><p><person><nameText>JAMES L. ROBO, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, CEO, PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY, NEXTERA ENERGY, INC.: So Greg, listen, I just think on tax reform, it's very fluid right now. Obviously, the industry has been weighing in, I've been spending a lot of time on it, and we don't even have a bill out of House Ways and Means yet. So I think it's too early, really, to say anything about where any of this stands other than you can rest assured, I'm highly engaged on this.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go to Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>MICHAEL JAY LAPIDES, VP, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Guys, couple of questions. One, probably for Armando, which is, can you talk about, when you think about your renewable pipeline, how much of that is the counterparty of -- traditional regulated utility versus how much of it is a corporate entity, whether a big tech company or someone else?</p><p>ARMANDO PIMENTEL: So Michael, right now, for us, I'd say, 90% of what we're doing is probably the more traditional customers, and those could be the rate-regulated utilities or the munis and co-ops. And I'd say, 5% to 10% are the latter, which you asked about for the corporate entities, what we call C&amp;I companies. We continue to see more C&amp;I companies out there. And actually, we are engaging in that business more proactively today than we have in the past. So I would expect, for us, that 5% to 10% to go up.</p><p>MICHAEL JAY LAPIDES: Got it. And then, guys, how are you thinking about the Section 201 case and some of the recent developments and what that could do if any to solar-related demand? Really, for 2018 solar demands, but even for the next few years?</p><p><person><nameText>JAMES L. ROBO</nameText></person>: So Michael, this is Jim. Obviously, this is something we're watching very closely. I think I spoke on this issue in September. We're fine in '17 and '18 because we prebought our panels when we saw this going on. '19 is probably the year we're most concerned about. That's probably where there is potentially a pinch point, depending on where the ITC comes out and where the administration comes out on this.</p><p>Post '19, I think there's going to be -- the market's going to -- the market will have time to react to whatever happens, and I think we'll get back to normal business in 2020 and beyond. But '19 is our focus, and we're working quite hard in a number of fronts. And it's something that we're watching closely, and we're highly engaged on it and the whole team is highly engaged on it across the board.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p><p>JULIEN PATRICK DUMOULIN-SMITH, DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF THE US POWER, UTILITIES, &amp; ALTERNATIVE ENERGY EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Let me start real quickly on the 201 issue there if I can. What are you expecting when you talk about 2019 and really beyond that in terms of market reaction? I mean, what's your kind of playbook as far as you see this playing out right now? And then secondly, what is your expectation in terms of the positioning of parties and thinking about how this could actually play out over the next few months? Is a settlement possible, et cetera, to make this a little bit more palatable?</p><p><person><nameText>JAMES L. ROBO</nameText></person>: So Julien, it's Jim again. I just think it's too early to tell what's going to happen here. And I think, honestly, there's a pretty broad range of potential outcomes on this, and I wouldn't care to speculate on what's going to happen. I think we'll see. We're -- and what we're doing is frankly scenario planning across a variety of different outcomes and making sure that we're going to be prepared in case of any potential outcome.</p><p>JULIEN PATRICK DUMOULIN-SMITH: Excellent. Well -- and looking beyond the current 2020 period, you guys have done a fantastic job in the repowering side thus far. I'm curious, how are you thinking about repowering opportunities under kind of a sub-100% PTC, call it, 80%, 60%? I mean, you've been pretty forward looking before across the industry, and this seems like an opportunity to pivot. Are you engaging with parties on that front? I mean, do you have an expectation for an ability to use those PTCs that are expired 2000 -- say, '12, '13 and '14 vintage projects as they come off in the early part of the next decade and repower those?</p><p>ARMANDO PIMENTEL: Armando...</p><p>JULIEN PATRICK DUMOULIN-SMITH: So I'm just thinking in the longer term.</p><p>ARMANDO PIMENTEL: Yes. Look, most of what -- not most, just about everything of what we're doing today is to make sure that we can grab the -- as many of these repowering opportunities through 2020, having safe harbored a good part of that equipment in order to get the 100% Production Tax Credits. There's already been one entity out there, which I'm sure you've seen, that has announced the project where they would be getting 80% Production Tax Credits and that the economics work for them under that scenario.</p><p>Our expectation is that when the Production Tax Credit goes down to 80%, that there are actually going to be some repowering opportunities that are going to work, maybe not necessarily for the reasons that some might believe. When we're looking at repowering opportunities, one of the things that we're looking at is, how close is the old asset, if you will, to the end of its PTC life, right? And if it's 9 or 10 years into its life, 100 -- taking the asset down and repowering it and putting it up and getting 100% PTCs for 10 years might work. But if it's at the end of 2020, if it's only gone through 7 years, let's say, you wouldn't necessarily want to repower the asset at that point and lose 3 years of the old PTCs.</p><p>But if you wait another year, now you're 8 years or 9 years, it may actually make sense to give up 1 year of the old PTCs and get 10 years of the 80% PTCs. So that scenario planning is something that we are spending a little bit of time right now. We certainly have a lot of assets that would be subject to that. But I do believe that there are going to be repowering opportunities that work with 80% PTCs.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Paul Ridzon, KeyBanc.</p><p>PAUL THOMAS RIDZON, VP AND EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: John, I think on the second quarter call, you said look for most of the second half growth to hit the fourth quarter. I'm just trying to calibrate. We saw a 6.5% growth in the third quarter here. Did some of that growth shift quarters? And then just how do I think about the sub-par wind resource you had in the quarter? How does that figure into the numbers?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. So by the time of the second quarter call, we were pretty well into July, which was, well, not a terrific wind resource month. Things -- we were concerned about the trend for the rest of the quarter. For August and September, August ended up kind of following suit with July, and we're a little bit surprised because September rebounded a little bit more than we had expected. I think that September ended up being about 95% of normal. And now we've seen October has truly rebounded so far this month. That was part of it.</p><p>We had a little bit better performance out of other miscellaneous parts of the business, none worth pointing out individually that, when added up, put us in a little bit better position than what we were expecting for the quarter, including some origination activity that we had on the business.</p><p>PAUL THOMAS RIDZON: Should we think about that incremental positive as essentially being offset in the fourth quarter by the refinancings that you talked about?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. And so the fourth quarter -- that's why I think I made the comment that growth will be down a little bit in the fourth quarter. We have really been focused on liability management. When you look at our portfolio -- one of the things I made a comment on at the investor conference is, if you look at our financing portfolio, we have one of the longest average tenors combined with one of the lowest average interest rates of any of our peers. And that's because we constantly look at the portfolio for refinancing activity opportunities. And that -- those are the opportunities we're looking to execute on in the fourth quarter.</p><p>The remarks were that the MPV could be as high as $150 million. Obviously, those come with some prepayment penalties that do have some book impacts associated with them, but we're just trying to continue our trend of being very mindful that we're in an attractive low interest rate environment and looking at the balance sheet as we always do, to be opportunistic, and that's what you can expect would be reflected in the fourth quarter results.</p><p>PAUL THOMAS RIDZON: And you don't treat those kind of onetime -- make holes or anything as unusual items?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: No. We flow them through.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Shar Pourreza, Guggenheim Partners.</p><p>SHAHRIAR POURREZA, MD AND HEAD OF NORTH AMERICAN POWER, GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a quick follow up on the battery storage comments, John. Did Dania filings that you filed for show that the asset was materially more economical than battery storage and solar, even in the 2022 time frame? So I'm curious on sort of how that fits in with your viewpoint that batteries plus solar could be economical with the CCGT?</p><p>And then just a follow-up on Dania, is -- looking at FP&amp;L's gas assets, there are other plants that fit the similar economics as sort of the plant that you're converting. So I'm kind of curious if the Dania plant's a one-off. And do you see any opportunities thus far?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. I think we'll just tackle the Dania piece first. The Dania piece first is, one, you got to consider its location. I mean, it's in South Florida, it has a transmission advantage given its location. If you look at the economics on the reduced O&amp;M on improving the fuel efficiency of that facility, given its location, that's why that one works.</p><p>We continue to look for other opportunities. We have the 50-megawatt battery storage pilot program in Florida where we will look to do a lot of the same things we've done on the Energy Resources side, including the project we announced today where we can actually combine our storage capability with newbuild solar in Florida.</p><p>And that -- those opportunities will come about not only through the 8 facilities we're currently building within the 1,600 post 2018. Where exactly that will end up will depend on where they're located in the overall economics of those facilities. But it's a terrific opportunity for Florida to take advantage of the same opportunities that our regulated customer base outside of Florida are looking for.</p><p><person><nameText>JAMES L. ROBO</nameText></person>: And Shar, this is Jim. I just -- one other thing on storage and renewable competitiveness is we see storage and renewables being -- really competing very well against inefficient, old operating nuclear and coal plants where you look at those -- you look at the economics of those sites, they're anywhere from $0.04 to</p><p>$0.05 on a cash, cash cost per kilowatt basis to operate. These new CCGTs, particularly in a constrained place like Dania Beach, are very, very cost-effective and super fuel-efficient. And typically, you wouldn't see renewables and storage competing with that just yet.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Chris Turnure, JPMorgan.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JAMES TURNURE, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Given -- you guys probably have maybe 6 or so months to go to kind of finish out the '17 to '18 bucket of renewable backlog, could you just give us an update on how you might fall out within that 4-gigawatt range? Are you coming up on the bottom now? Will any of it kind of spill into 2019? In terms of your maybe original expectations, has anything changed in the last 3 to 6 months?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. So first, we're already there on solar. Not only there on solar for '17 and '18. We're pretty darn close to a range for '19 and '20. And we'll look to continue to add to that obviously going forward. And then on the wind side, given the 760-megawatt total portfolio today, the wind additions that were part of that, we're within striking distance on wind. And I'll let Armando fill in the details with kind of his viewpoint.</p><p>ARMANDO PIMENTEL: So for wind, and this has been the case for a long time, right, the -- when folks are looking for wind, they're looking out much shorter -- at a much shorter time period. One of the things that I'm honestly most happy about so far in the cycle is we have almost 900 megawatts of wind signed up all ready for 2019 and</p><p>'20.</p><p>But when you're focused on '17 and '18 and particularly, on wind, there's the current -- there's the -- just the recent history that we announced today of signing 560 megawatts of 2018 wind. And I can tell you that we are working on a pretty decent backlog for additional 2018 wind right now.</p><p>Whether that happens or not, it depends. Customers understand that if they wait a little longer, that the prices could be a little cheaper. And so you're always fighting that. But I was very pleasantly surprised with the 566 megawatts we signed for 2018 this past quarter. And my expectation is that, that number in 2018 will continue to go up just as it has in the past, just because wind has a shorter time frame.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JAMES TURNURE: Is it fair to say that just kind of the higher half or the upper half of the range is still achievable for '17 to '18?</p><p>ARMANDO PIMENTEL: It's -- I think honesty, all of the numbers in that range are achievable. And if all I wanted to do was to meet the higher end of the range on wind for '17 and '18, I'm -- we could probably do that. But that's not necessarily always the right thing to do, right?</p><p>I mean, you may be talking customers into building something in 2019 and 2020 because it's better economics for us honestly than it could be for 2018. So every situation is different. Again, I'm happy at this point that we've signed almost 900 megawatts for '19 and '20 and that we still have a pretty decent backlog of '18 opportunities that we have been shortlisted on.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JAMES TURNURE: Okay, that's helpful color. And then maybe, John or Jim, given the stock performance has been a strong as it has year-to-date, just kind of maybe going back to an earlier question on cash return versus dividend or incremental investment opportunities versus buybacks, does the stock performance kind of lower the hurdle to deploy capital into other investments or to return cash to shareholders through a bigger dividend increase maybe than previously expected?</p><p><person><nameText>JAMES L. ROBO</nameText></person>: So Chris, this is Jim. Listen, we remain very disciplined in how we evaluate all our incremental opportunities. We're looking hard at a lot of different things to continue to deploy that excess balance sheet capacity very profitably for us going forward and that's going to be our focus.</p><p>But as always, we're not going to do dumb stuff either. We're going to be very disciplined about it. And we'll -- on the dividend, we'll be -- we just had a discussion with the board about the dividend in October. We'll have another one in December, and we'll be coming out with our post-2018 dividend policy in February once we -- once the board finalizes where they're going to come out on that. So more to come on the dividend.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Thank you for your participation.

Showcased continued strong momentum around Co.'s platform capabilities including the third evolution, which is Application Framework.</p><p>3. Had over 30 companies like Microsoft, ServiceNow and Proofpoint, and leading highly innovative startups like Phantom, which Splunk just acquired, preview their applications.</p><p>4. Application Framework marries security innovation and ease of consumption, which is a compelling value proposition for a customer base, and is helping to drive purchases of foundational elements of Security Operating Platform in the network, on endpoints and in cloud.</p><p>6. Network:</p><p>1. Introduction of PAN-OS 8.1, in addition to new hardware [delivered over past 15 months] including most recent PA-3200 series, PA-5280 and ruggedized PA-220, allows Co. to reach new customers while driving expansion sales and opening new use cases in existing customers.</p><p>7.

But it does seem like you guys got a really solid replacement in Nikesh, and welcome onboard. I guess, a high-level question on the performance in the quarter. 31% product growth is something we haven't seen from Palo Alto in a while. But even more so, it's something we're not really seeing across the board in terms of your peers who seem to be struggling to sort of sustain any really type of growth in their core markets. Can you talk to us a little bit about sort of what's kind of creating that separation between you and your peers and how durable you think that is on a going-forward basis and to what degree the messaging around security operating platform is playing into that separation?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.: Sure. Thanks, Keith, and thanks for the kind words. I appreciate that. The -- well, as you can see, the product growth is very strong. Platform growth is very strong. And I think it's really important for us to understand inside the company, outside the company as well, the whole concept of security operating platform is resonating very well. As we've talked about before with the 3 evolutions, with the Application Framework being the third one right now, the customers that we speak with, the prospects we speak with almost unanimously across the board really resonate with that. It's an answer to a significant, significant problem about how do you get more automation and how do you get less complexity in their environments. They like it a lot. Now they realize as well that in order to do that or achieve the most value from that, it will become increasingly important that they, in essence, standardize on Palo Alto Networks in all the positions for data centers and enforcement points, which is in the network, on the endpoint and in the cloud. And of course, we need to every single day of the week be the very best at all those positions as well on a -- I'll call them a stand-alone basis, which we're very confident. And you can see that from the release of the hardware, the operating system releases, the new version of Traps, the Evident acquisition, things we're doing at every one of the positions to make sure we win head to head across. But I would say that it seems that to me, and I think the team here who spends a lot of time with customers, the concept of the Application Framework, the third evolution and getting consistency across the entire platform is working very well and driving purchases of all the underlying aspects.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Got it. And if I could sneak in one follow-up. Nikesh, although definitely has a great record as a leader, not a traditional security pick. Maybe Mark, as your new position as Vice Chairman of the Board, if you could give us some visibility into how the -- how the board got comfort in sort of having a nontraditional security leader be leading up what is still a very much a security-focused company.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Sure. And security will continue to be our focus, so let me be clear about that, and thanks for the question. The -- yes, as I was talking with the board over the last several quarters about succession planning -- it's been amazing to run the company for the past 7 years or so. I said we would want to make a change at the right time. There's no hurry for this. I was basically saying if we find the right person at the right time, we would do it. That had us thinking, of course, about what does the future look like. When we look at the company, we have 5,000-plus security professionals in the company. They're best in the world, starting with Nir and Lee and other folks in the team. We have some of the best operating executives in Ren\\xE9 and Mark Anderson and folks who are very committed to the company, which is fantastic. So security is something we know genetically and from a DNA perspective. So we start to think about where the company's going to look like in 5 years from today. I would garner to say that it's more of the security operating platform I just laid out. It's got a lot to do with massive datasets with analytics, with the infrastructure required to support those, the cloud, SaaS. It's very clear that security is heading in that direction and that we're forcing it in that direction as a company. So that really informed our pick for the succession planning, which should be a great, accomplished business leader, somebody who's a culturally great fit and somebody who also has experience ideally with large-scale platforms that have those kind of characteristics. There's not a lot of those platforms in the world. There's not a lot of people who have that kind of experience. We're fortunate to find Nikesh and spend the last few months with him to make sure that we had alignment across all those variables I just laid out. So that was really the thought process, Keith.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.</p><p>PHILIP ALAN WINSLOW, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mark, my congrats again for your move-up to Vice Chairman. I have known you since back at VeriSign. You not only been a super impressive executive, but a real gentleman. So it's been fun, and congrats on your new role.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Thank you, Phil. I'll try to continue to be a gentleman. Yes.</p><p>PHILIP ALAN WINSLOW: Pulled it off well. All right. Yes, just a question on the quarter. Obviously, you noted several competitive displacements and wins sort of across the portfolio. When you think about just the competitive environment out there, particularly from a pricing perspective, there's been a lot of conversation about that, just sort of what have you seen out there? Any changes that you'd highlight sort of across the platform?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, sure. Let me take that first, and I think Mark probably have some good commentary as well. He spends a massive amount of time in the field with the customers. What we're seeing from a pricing perspective is no change in the sense of it's a very competitive market. The competition has always been competitive in pricing. I think they increasingly go to the price card out of desperation in a lot of cases. And what we've seen in our business is being able to sell value first, the security operating platform as being very unique. Nobody can match that. And the third, in doing that and perhaps interestingly, as we have done a very nice job discipline-wise by having discounting improve -- quarter-over-quarter improved again sequentially and year-over-year. So in the face of all that strong competitive pricing pressure, we continue to [sell] the value of the platform. Mark?</p><p>MARK F. ANDERSON, PRESIDENT, PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.: Phil, it's Mark Anderson here. So with the last 18 months of product announcements, the hundreds of features that we brought into the platforms that we've -- the hardware platforms that we've replaced, I think price performance-wise, we've got very compelling offers there. But I think most importantly, when customers get a sense for where we're taking security with the third evolution, the Application Framework, I think the kind of future proof nature of us being able to help them distill security innovation into consumable form factors on the Palo Alto Networks kit, I think, is a very compelling proposition. And I think that's something that every customer I talk to takes into consideration when they're making a decision for paying 2 or 3x for Palo Alto Networks what our desperate competitors are charging for their stuff.</p><p>PHILIP ALAN WINSLOW: Got it. And just actually a follow-up on the App Framework for my next question here. Wondering if you could give us sort of, I guess, a grade of sort of where you stand so far in the development. And what milestone should we, from the outside looking in, point toward for sort of success there?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. It's a great question, Phil. So first, let me start with where it is. The Application Framework is very real today. We announced it about a year ago, and over the course of the last year have made a lot of progress on a number of things. One is making sure that from an App Framework perspective, the third parties can create apps easily into the framework. The second thing was the development release, and so far very successful launch of the Logging Service, which allows all the data to be collected there. We just had Ignite User Conference last week, and we had over 4,000 folks there and there was 30 companies who were previewing their applications, which was fantastic right there in the demo floor. We really, really liked that the customers saw not only their applications, but also workflow between the applications as well. And we highlighted a number of them on stage just to give a sense of that. We also announced that the Application Framework could be production-ready in August. So very soon, we'll be able to actually use that with customers. So lots of good traction. I would say and people have asked me this before, how do you think about it in the future, let's say, the definitions of success in the Application Framework, which you're driving towards, would be a lot of applications in that framework. And I think somebody said onetime that a real platform is successful when there's more value driven across the top of the platform than the platform itself. So we would expect that over time, customers will get a lot of value from the applications running on top of the framework.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>MATTHEW GEORGE HEDBERG, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I'll offer my congrats to you, Mark, as well. It's certainly been great working with you over the years. And Nikesh, congratulations on the role, excited to see what you bring to the company. Maybe I'll start with Nikesh. Obviously, you mentioned that it's Day minus 2. But your ability to scale businesses at Google was certainly impressive. You mentioned there are some similarities. I'm curious when you did your due diligence, what are some of those similarities you came away with? And any insights in how you think Palo Alto is well positioned to thrive in a public cloud environment?</p><p><person><nameText>NIKESH ARORA, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN AND CEO, PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.: Thank you, Matt, for asking the question and thank you for your congratulations. As I said, it's Day minus 2, so anything I say is subject to change. So I think the early impressions are, I think there's no question in anybody's mind that we're still early in the cloud revolution, and in the next few decades, we will see almost every company out there having to make that transition. And I think Palo Alto Networks' mission on sort of preserving our digital life and keeping it safe is going to -- in line with that cloud transition. As we go to that transition, huge amounts of datasets are going to be created, people are going to have to keep track a lot of data, we have to apply a lot of AI, machine learning. And just this notion that Mark talked about of sort of migrating or transitioning to an Application Framework where we can bring a best-of-breed and help people to sort of participate with Palo Alto Networks being sort of the one who brings this solution to the end customer is extremely empowering and extremely powerful. I think that's sort of my early impression that being able to take the company along that path with the team that is working on those product areas is going to be fundamentally exciting.</p><p>MATTHEW GEORGE HEDBERG: That's great. And then maybe as a follow-up. We continue to hear good things about GlobalProtect. And Mark, you called it out in your prepared remarks, a nice win there. Could you talk a little bit more about the competitive landscape there? Are there some even -- some legacy competitors that you're seeing there? And I guess, just a better sense on pricing for GlobalProtect would be helpful.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, sure. And Matt, we do -- as you know, we have GlobalProtect -- I mean, GlobalProtect cloud service as well, and it's all part of the platform, of course. And over time, what you've seen us do is ensure that customers can use our security operating platform with the appropriate form factor for the appropriate use case, right? So we have hardware in some cases, big hardware, small hardware. We have agents on the endpoint. We have virtual machines in the cloud, API hooks for SaaS applications. And with GlobalProtect cloud service, you have the ability for what we would traditionally call network security to just point it at the cloud and have the full-on next-gen firewall capabilities as well. That's important for branch offices, mobile users and places where you want to reduce your MPLS costs, and customers are reacting very well at that. From a pricing perspective, we're competitive price-wise. As we are with everything in our platform, we can be because we think it's best on a head-to-head basis. And also the value of it being consistent across the platform helps as well, and we've seen really good early success with GlobalProtect cloud service.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.</p><p>ANDREW JAMES NOWINSKI, PRINCIPAL &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY COMPANIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulation, Nikesh, on your appointment. And Mark, it's been a real pleasure working with you over the years. Just a question on -- maybe on virtual firewalls. There's always been a view in the market that the move to the cloud is somewhat bad for security. Can you just give us any color on the demand trends you're seeing on the Virtual firewall side and how they're maybe driving some larger deals?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, sure. It's a really good question. And as Nikesh mentioned a little earlier, the move to the cloud is inevitable. When you look at the amount of IT spend and how much of it is in the cloud today, it's actually pretty small. So I think we're in the early innings of this. And we've seen in our business, again back to the right form factor for the right use case, that the VM-Series is going very well at the inline portion for protection and protecting offerings in the cloud. And that's going very well. That's been, we think, additive to the business so far. We'd expect that to be the case into the future because we see existing customers not only buying VM-Series, but most everything else in the platform along the way, which is fantastic. And we would expect that, that part of our business is going to continue to grow as people continue to -- as well.</p><p>ANDREW JAMES NOWINSKI: Okay, got it. And then I know it's -- the platform and automation, as you said, were driving a lot of the product revenue growth this quarter. But could you maybe give us just an update on where you think we're at with regard to a refresh cycle given the new 3200 Series out in February and you had the 5200 last year? A lot of new appliances in the market, just wondering how much of that's contributing just specifically from the refresh cycle.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. Great question. As you can see from the about 51,000 customers we're serving today, the size of the customer base continues to grow very nicely over time quarter-over-quarter, so the cohorts keep growing over time. As we've said in the past, as these cohorts get bigger and as in the latter years the refresh cycle becomes an increasingly large contributor to the business, we'd expect that would continue into the future. And by giving customers new capability sets not only in the hardware, but also the operating system, and reasons to refresh if they're already a customer or come to us if they're not are very important. The drivers in the hardware side of our business, I think, really fall into 3 categories. The first and I think the most prevalent today is the expansion opportunity with so many customers who are -- where you can see the lifetime value creation goes up very significantly, we think that's the biggest driver. We also have net new customer acquisitions. It's very high. As you can see again from the quarter, that certainly helps. And then the third is refresh, which is performing very well for us. We think that's going to continue to be the case and will continue to grow as a contributor over time.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Jonathan Ho with William Blair.</p><p>JONATHAN FRANK HO, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: Let me echo my congratulations as well. I just wanted to start out with the Application Framework and maybe some of the commonalities that you're seeing with some of the new customers that have signed up and maybe how you think about that from a revenue opportunity as well.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. Jonathan, great question. I described this since we started with the Application Framework as what we inevitably would see as a push-pull on the right. And the push aspect of it is going to be, over time, how much value these applications deliver on the top of the Application Framework. And perhaps someday, we would monetize this. We don't have a plan to do that right now. We think our main focus there should be just growing a very healthy ecosystem of developers, and then we'll see how that transpires over time. The flip of it with the pull, I think, is very evident already for us, which is customers really resonate with the ability to reduce the complexity of their footprint in their -- in all of the network, including cloud and also the simplicity of working with less vendors through a platform, right? And that is driving purchases of all the foundational aspects, which we view as not only fantastic security capabilities themselves, but also data collectors and enforcement positions. So that's in the network, that's on the cloud, it's on the endpoint, and all those are growing very nicely for us.</p><p>JONATHAN FRANK HO: Got it. And then relative to Traps 5.0 and the Secdo acquisition, can you talk a little bit about what new capabilities you're adding here and maybe what challenges you're addressing with that acquisition?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Sure, yes. I think there's 2 ways to think about that, Jonathan. The first and the most probably evident one is that Secdo brings EDR capabilities to Traps. That's an important capability to customers, definitely, one. So our ability to have that is important. We believe that the way that Secdo does EDR is very unique with some very unique thread-level capabilities and visualizations. You'll see that come back into Traps early in the calendar fiscal '19 -- I'm sorry, early calendar '19, and that's what we're going to do with that capability. In addition to that, and I don't know if you were at Ignite or had somebody there, but we also talked about taking the Secdo EDR capability and applying it across the entire platform, so not just endpoints, but also network and cloud as well. This concept we call XDR, meaning across the entire platform, so that you can get the best EDR capabilities everywhere from a security perspective not just on endpoints. We think that's going to be an unmatched capability simply because of the size of the deployments we have in all the data locations.</p><p>OPERATOR: Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs has our next question.</p><p>GABRIELA BORGES, EQUITY ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations to the team. Maybe for Mark Anderson and maybe Kathy as well. The last time we saw 30%-plus-type product growth were back in 2016, and that was subsequently followed by a little bit of a slowdown. So the question is how you're thinking about managing through tougher comps at a high level going into next year. And a follow-up for Kathy. Just on the incremental investments that you discussed in the prepared remarks in the acquisitions, just a little more on what you're investing in.</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO, CFO &amp; EXECUTIVE VP, PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.: Thanks for the question. Yes, we're very excited about our product growth this quarter, obviously, very strong number. The platform, as Mark mentioned, is resonating with customers, and the security operating platform is experiencing a lot of interest from customers, both push and the pull side, as Mark mentioned. So we're really happy with the performance of products. We think that we still have a lot of market share opportunity, and we've been growing into that share year after year after year. So we think there's still a lot of opportunity for us to grow, and that growth can be sustainable for years to come. In terms of incremental investments that we're making, we're obviously integrating the newly acquired technology in the case of Secdo into our platform, so that's coming off of the market. And we're working on that integration now. For Evident and Secdo alike, we are working on operationalizing, making sure that we have a great go-to-market plan for both of those product offerings and just overall making sure that we have the right marketing messages, integration and operational plan for those services.</p><p>MARK F. ANDERSON: Gabriela, it's Mark A. here. So I think a couple of things. Our field sales team is really quite disciplined in going after business, both with expansion opportunities with existing customers as well as propositions for new customers, especially ones that are embarking on their own digital transformation journey. I think we provide a consultative type of approach, but it's really a subject matter expert with regards to security in that journey. And it gives us the opportunity to show them how important being able to future proof their investments with, again, access to the Application Framework, like I mentioned earlier. I think also, just hardware cycles come and go. But I think by and large, customers are telling us that our approach to security to provide consistent security everywhere at the endpoint, in the cloud and on-prem in customers perimeters is really differentiated from what our competitors are doing, either by providing an architecture that is just unrivaled out there.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital.</p><p>SAKET KALIA, SENIOR ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats to both of you on your new opportunities. Maybe for you, Mark, I believe several other parts of the Application Framework are going to be generally available here starting in August. Maybe related to Jonathan's questions, can you give us any broad brushes on how the pricing here might work and what you're seeing initially from customers on accepting that different consumption model?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Saket, that's very good question. And yes, probably the best thing to just clarify when we say the Application Framework is production-ready come April, what that means is that third-party applications will be available through the framework. From a pricing perspective, today, the relationship or -- that is between the application provider -- I'm sorry, I said April, I meant August. 10 people give me notes to correct that. In August, I'm sorry. The relationship from a pricing perspective will be through the customer right with the application provider themselves. So that's what it will look like on the beginning, meaning we don't have an intent right now to try to monetize that. From our perspective perhaps over time, like you said, when we're driving a lot of value, we'll be in the position to do that. What we're definitely seeing right now in the business, though, is the pull aspect, which is because of the compelling nature of the idea of being able to actually have a lot of innovation in the market but not have to deploy form factor after form factor to collect data to get one more feature, customers like that a lot. And I think they will standardize on Palo Alto Networks. I think they are standardizing on Palo Alto Networks, and the network increasing, the endpoints and the cloud as well, so that's a driver of our business. I think it's been a driver for the last year. There's lots of other drivers as well, but I think that's a driver that's happening, and I think we're going to see that continue into the future.</p><p>SAKET KALIA: That's helpful. Maybe for my follow-up for you, Kathy. You talked to the impact of that Evident and Secdo we're having here from the EPS perspective in the fourth quarter. Can you give us any broad brushes on any billings or revenue impact it might have either in the quarter or maybe on an annual basis?</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO: Yes. On the quarter, the billings and revenue impact was immaterial. Going forward, obviously, we're working on our plans and our go-to-market plans, and we're certainly hoping that we have good revenue and billings performance from both of them. We see a lot of opportunity with both of those products given the demand for cloud, security, and as well the EDR capabilities are going to be a great addition to our endpoint service offering.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI.</p><p>KENNETH RICHARD TALANIAN, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI, RESEARCH DIVISION: Nikesh, I realized it's early, but could you provide some of your initial thoughts on M&amp;A and general thoughts for the potential for consolidation within the security sector?</p><p><person><nameText>NIKESH ARORA</nameText></person>: Thank you, Kenneth for the question. I think it's inappropriate for me to have thoughts on M&amp;A until I fully understand the entire product offering of Palo Alto Networks, which I do to some extent, but I'm going to spend a lot of time in the early part understanding the company, our priorities and make sure that we continue to execute on the rhythm and pace that Mark has set and what you guys have gotten used to because that's got like a stake on the table that I need to make sure I maintain. And then we'll hopefully, over the future quarters, have more substantive conversation with a lot of you about where we see the opportunity and if we need to do anything or not.</p><p>KENNETH RICHARD TALANIAN: Great. And I guess, as a follow-up, just to circle back around GlobalProtect cloud. Is the primary use case there branch office applications? Or are you seeing broader interest in using the solutions instead of hardware?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. We're seeing a few use cases, primarily, again, early on, one is branch, also second is mobile users as well. So I think both of those are drivers. We expect those to continue to be drivers in the future.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.</p><p>WALTER H PRITCHARD, MD AND U.S. SOFTWARE ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mark, as well congrats on finding a successor here that looks to fill your shoes at least mostly. On -- a few questions for Kathy. One, just on -- as we think about going into Q1, I know you're not providing guidance for next year. But seasonality has been a bit moving around as the business has evolved. And I'm wondering what you could tell us about how you think about the shape of the year into next year with Q1. And then just had one follow-up question on the subscription side.</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO: Sure. Thanks, Walter. Yes, we have definitely seen seasonality become a bigger factor in our business, and we are seeing pretty normal seasonality patterns with our strongest quarters sequentially in terms of sequential growth being Q2s and Q4s. And that continues to be the case, and I would expect that to continue into Q1.</p><p>WALTER H PRITCHARD: Great. And then on the subscription side, I'm wondering, you have 2 pieces there. One, I think is pretty easy for us to model with the -- attaching to appliances. You're seeing a continuation, it looks like, in 3-year attach there. And then on the unattached side, you just have a number of new products, some acquired, some products you had for some time. Can you help us understand how the subscription side is splitting out and maybe relative growth rates between the attached and nonattached?</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO: Sure. The nonattached business we mentioned at Analyst Day was on a $240 million run rate, growing very fast, growing at about 85% year-over-year. And so while it remains about -- getting close to about 10% of our overall business, still a relatively small portion of our business, but growing much faster than the rest of the business because it's newer and obviously a smaller portion of our business. And so just in terms of law of large numbers, growing much faster. We're obviously adding more and more subscription offerings that are nonattached, and you'll see that in the Application Framework as well. And so we do expect that the nonattached business will continue to become a bigger part of our business and will continue to grow very fast. The rest of the business is also growing very well. As you saw, our services billings growth rate was over 30% this quarter. And so the rest of the business continues to grow very fast. And the attached business, because it's -- nonattached business, because it's a relatively small portion, doesn't influence the overall growth rate to a significant degree at this point.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. If I could just make one other point. Kathy said at the end of Q2, we've given out the billings contribution run rate at about $240 million, growing very quickly. As you can see, that continues to go up over time. And I think probably the interesting thing about that is with that approaching 10% of the billings run rate, which is good, it's against a very large base as well. And that base is continuing to grow very well. So if you think about the network security business and particularly the SaaS security services associated with it, that's a large business growing very well in itself, right? So the level of contribution takes time for the nonattached to grow simply because it's being matched against a large -- very fast growing business as well.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.</p><p>SHAUL EYAL, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO. INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Nikesh, welcome onboard. Mark, we still have you onboard literally, so not saying goodbye here. One for Mark, one for Nikesh. Mark, on Europe, another strong quarter, up 35% year-over-year. Talk to us a little bit about the different dynamics you're seeing in Europe than there was in the U.S., maybe how this GDPR in that context play into the equation.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, sure. So I'll take the beginning. I'll hand it over to Mark. He just came back from over there a little while ago. GDPR, this is a big picture, is driving a lot of interest in how do you use what we term state-of-the-art capabilities, particularly GDPR has a requirement -- or avoiding liability that folks using state-of-the-art capabilities for cybersecurity. Of course, there's no definition to that, which is probably the right thing to do for regulators. But it raises a lot of questions for customers, which are positive for us, which is how would you do that, that state-of-the-art capabilities. And we think everything that we provide, plus the platform, fits very uniquely here. Mark, I know you just...</p><p>MARK F. ANDERSON: Yes. I think you nailed it, Mark. I think, for us, legislation like GDPR just heightens awareness of customers to do something different than what they've been doing for the last 2 decades. And I think I would highlight that and also highlight the fact that government over there, the EU as well as each of the individual countries in the EU, have never been more open to working with thought leaders like Palo Alto Networks to do things like share threat intelligence, have bilateral threat sharing agreements. So I think our relevance in Europe, because of maybe a little more conservative group of countries, has really ramped in the last 4, 5 quarters, and you've seen that in the performance. We get invited to the (inaudible) a lot more.</p><p>SHAUL EYAL: Nikesh, you're coming from SoftBank, invested heavily in security in recent years, I think the big $100 million check for cyber reason just about, I think, less than 18 months ago. Google appears to be eyeing security from afar, who knows what they might be doing down the road. It seems that security software requires a bit of a different DNA. I think Mark also, I think, phrased that point. And second, before you plunge into the security software arena, if you could share with us your thoughts as to how security is being observed by the big tech company, the Google, the Amazon, the Microsoft. They haven't done a lot so much, so it could be a great opportunity on your end. So maybe just the second -- the world is becoming crazy for you with Palo Alto. Just share with us maybe how the big tech behemoths view security.</p><p><person><nameText>NIKESH ARORA</nameText></person>: I think it's fair to say I had the privilege of working with the Google enterprise team, which is part of (inaudible) when I was at Google. And for the first time, as you see in the history of innovation, cloud came to the consumer first in a big way and is now slowly making it to the back of the enterprise. And Google's realized that, Microsoft's realized that, Amazon realized that. So they're all charging ahead with trying to address the cloud opportunity into the enterprises. I think that's great. Having said that, given that they're all, to some degree, offering proprietary solutions to people where you can have one or the other, there's an important need for independent security team to look at it and see how we can take these massive amounts of data across multiple cloud offerings, provide a solution around it comprehensively to the end customer and have somebody who they can trust to be the arbiter between all these different offerings that they have. So I think that's the big opportunity out there. Given that we're all going towards the cloud, given that these huge amounts of datasets are going to be created, we need to make sure we understand their aspirations and set our aspirations vis-\\xE0-vis them and provide the solution to the end customer. I think that's where the opportunity is.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Michael Turits with Raymond James.</p><p>MICHAEL TURITS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; INFRASTRUCTURE SOFTWARE ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES &amp; ASSOCIATES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Mark, thanks for everything in many years. Nikesh, welcome. I'll come back to the M&amp;A question and then I have a follow-up for Kathy. On M&amp;A, and let's just maybe say strategically products in general, Mark, there's still some very large areas of security that you're not in, email, DLT, identity. How are you thinking about those given the fact that you have done so much in terms of expanding in the last quarter or so?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. Great question, Michael. When we look at security, we think in terms of outcomes, meaning that if you're the CIO or the CISO for an enterprise, if you put technologies aside for a second, they have to solve for various outcomes. And in those -- there might be 8 or 10 of those depending on how broadly you define those, and they're not technical when you think about them. The outcome that we're solving for customers is to stop all known threats and ideally stop all unknown threats or at least detect them very quickly and limit the damage, right? And that's a very, very large outcome statement and very important. That lives alongside other outcomes, like making sure you can withstand a massive denial of service attack, for example. And we've been particularly focused over the years in ensuring that whatever outcomes we choose to solve for, for customers, that we bring something unique to the table in a highly competitive way. Now those outcomes blend over time as well, and that's why we've done a lot of very strong partnerships in the identity space, for example, something you just mentioned; on the messaging security space with Proofpoint, something you just mentioned as well, so that we can make sure that the customer using the best capabilities from the vendors who are solving these outcomes doesn't have to be the back-end systems integrator themselves for that. And they really appreciate that. But bringing that holistic picture to the table and solving those outcomes for customers is very important.</p><p>MICHAEL TURITS: Great. And then for Kathy, thanks for detailing the impact on expenses and cash flow, the acquisitions in this quarter. How do those acquisitions -- and those have been particularly, again, very strong investment. How do those acquisitions impact margin expansion next year? You've talked in the framework about 150 to 250 basis points. Are we on track to that even with these acquisitions?</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO: Yes. We have talked about organic operating margin expansion of 150 basis points to 250 basis points. The Q4 guidance that we've given is that we plan to invest between $10 million to $12 million, and that equates to $0.08 to $0.10 per share on our recent acquisitions, outside of the organic operating margin expansion that we are working towards for the full fiscal year.</p><p>MICHAEL TURITS: Okay. No early thoughts on next year, though?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, it's pretty early.</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO: Yes. We're still working on our planning, obviously. But we have been obviously committed to that framework, and growth and profitability remain very important to the company.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our final question will come from Rob Owens with KeyBanc Capital Markets.</p><p>ROBBIE DAVID OWENS, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: With regard to products revenue and the 5 quarters of acceleration that you've seen -- I suppose, I guess, where your competitors are, and we've actually seen meaningful deceleration. Can you talk about your win rates and whether or not you think those are ticking up? Or is your success more a function of ASPs at this point? And then number two, Mark Anderson mentioned hardware cycles come and hardware cycles go, which begs the question, do we think one's coming? Or do we think we're going at this point? And were one to come, how could that possibly be reflected in customer acquisition and those numbers you're showing there?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Maybe you can take them in reverse, and I'll do the cycle...</p><p>MARK F. ANDERSON: Yes, sure. Go ahead. Yes.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Everybody is saying Mark here. So I think on the cycle one, Rob, over time, if you take a snapshot back of 10, 15 years long period of time, you see the cycles in 4 or 7 years, it's a little hard to nail that down of buying patterns here. What I think what Mark was saying is that regardless of what cycle they're in, Palo Alto Networks continues to outperform everybody in the market. You can see that in -- all through the last 10 years as a matter of fact and including very recently the last 4 quarters as well. Our job, we think, is to make sure that we have the most competitive offering in the market, and we'll always be taking market share. And we're very confident we'll be able to do that.</p><p>MARK F. ANDERSON: Just big picture, Rob, we've got low double-digit market share or we prosecute low double-digit market share in about a $20 billion total addressable market. So I think both in terms of new customer opportunities, if customers want to -- if they're going to make a change for security, they're going to look to the thought leader. And for existing customer expansion, we're just starting to hit the veins of significant customer sizes from the cohorts that we saw big customer growth in the last 5 or 6 years. So I think both give us tremendous opportunities to grow the business, and I think that's what gives us the confidence that's embedded into our guide.</p><p>ROBBIE DAVID OWENS: Then the long competitive win rate lines.</p><p>MARK F. ANDERSON: Competitive win rates, I said it earlier, I think I feel bad sometimes for our competitors because they're trying to sell either stitched together acquisitions that look like Frankenstein's monster or they're trying to sell point products against an architecture. And I think we've developed this platform over the last dozen years organically, primarily with some small technology tuck-ins that really drive the automation that's needed in the digital age.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. And we've seen win rates be very consistently high, Rob, against all competitors.</p><p>Okay, I think that was our last question. I'd like to close off, I want to thank everybody here, all the employees of Palo Alto Networks, our customers and our partners for the privilege of working with you. For me, it's been a really amazing experience. I want to thank everybody for their time this morning for the call. We look forward to seeing a lot of you in the upcoming future. Take care.</p><p>OPERATOR: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Matthew Lemenager on for Rob. I do appreciate the comments around the ICANN registry agreement negotiation. So as we look forward, could you remind us, once the public comment period would open up, what does the time line look like after that? I believe you have to give a 6-month notification period before you can make any formal changes in pricing. So I assume that entire review period with ICANN would be complete by kind of April 2020, which can be time frame that it's going to need to be completed by. But can you just remind us what the time line looks like after the public comment period opens?</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS, FOUNDER, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, VERISIGN, INC.: Sure, Matt. Yes, let me explain how -- what we expect in the public comment period with the caveat that this is an ICANN process so I can't speak with certainty and I don't speak for ICANN, but I can tell you what the expectation is and what they typically do. As I mentioned, we will expect them to shortly publish these documents for a comment period. ICANN's comment periods are typically about 40 days. There's typically a short period where they review the comments. And then after that, it's normally expected that some action would be taken an approval on, on that process. Again, it's ICANN process. I can't tell you with certainty, but that's typically what they do and that's basically an expectation based on what they've done in the past.</p><p>In terms of any price increases, we don't guide to pricing. We need to finalize this ICANN process first. So I can't offer you any details on that, but hopefully that answered your question.</p><p>MATTHEW STEVEN LEMENAGER: Yes, that's helpful. And then I think another one on kind of the newer initiatives, I suppose. Is there any update to .web and the process there?</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: Yes. Actually, there is some new information since we spoke to you last quarter on .web. Just for the benefit, I guess, of everybody else on the call, for context, there's an option for .web. And one of the losing bidders, a company called Afilias, a competitor of ours, filed what is a form of an arbitration proceeding called an IRP in November of 2018 that's against ICANN. And as a reminder, ICANN filed a response to the complaint. We're not a party to that arbitration, but we have filed a request asking to participate in that arbitration as an interested party, which is allowed by ICANN's rules. So the update is that since last quarter, kind of a significant update, I guess, is that an arbitration panel has been appointed, convened, that actually held a hearing just very recently, a couple of weeks ago, on our request to participate. That hearing was held, and we expect a ruling on that issue of our participation before the end of the year.</p><p>MATTHEW STEVEN LEMENAGER: Okay. Got it. And then lastly, just on the sales and marketing expense. It was down 28% year-over-year. I think it's a couple of quarters in a row that's declined. I mean do you -- is there any expectation -- would that go -- just trying to think about how to, I don't know, call that out into 2020. It seems like -- would that level off at some point if we kind of do .web and put marketing dollars behind that? Or anything, I guess, maybe that you could give color around the sales and marketing expense?</p><p>GEORGE E. KILGUSS, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, VERISIGN, INC.: Yes. Sure, Matt. This is George. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the big change in expense year-over-year really is a result of the sale of our VSS business. As it relates to sales and marketing, there was -- most of that expense came out of sales and marketing year-over-year, so that's primarily the year-over-year decline. As far as where sales and marketing is going in the future, we'll provide -- we don't provide guidance on the individual segments, but we will give you an idea of our expectation for next year on our call in February.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.</p><p>STERLING AUTY, SENIOR ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Let's start with the renewal rate in the quarter down year-over-year. Can you give us some context or color? Is there any particular region or factor that led to that decline?</p><p>GEORGE E. KILGUSS: Sure, Sterling. This is George. Regarding renewal rates, our Q3 preliminary renewal rate is expected to be down about 1.2% or 73.6% year-over-year when you consider the 2 major components of our renewal rates. Our previous renewed rate has held consistent in the mid-80% range both year-over-year and sequentially. However, we've seen a slight decrease in our first-time renewal rate in the quarter. And while there's a variety of factors that can influence that, it -- for us, it's really been a geographic mix in the quarter, as we previously mentioned. China registrars, first-time renewal rate as well as what we call the emerging markets at historically lower first-time renewal rates than, let's say, more mature markets like the U.S. and Europe. And as China has continued to grow for us in 2018 and again in 2019, it's really this change in geographic mix which is causing a little bit of downward pressure on the first-time renewal rate.</p><p>STERLING AUTY: So that makes sense. So maybe a follow-up is, the 9.9 million new names processed in the quarter, can you give us maybe a little bit more granularity as to what the geographic makeup of that looks like and how that has trended over the last year?</p><p>GEORGE E. KILGUSS: Well, if you point to the 9.9 million gross adds, and that's a good stat for us. I mean gross adds were up 3.5% year-over-year in the third quarter, which actually was a record gross add third quarter for us. So continued good demand for the product in the third quarter here.</p><p>As far as the regions of gross adds, they tend to change quarter-to-quarter depending on where registrars are fulfilling demand. But again, China has done well for us in the third quarter. Third quarter, we saw EMEA do pretty well for us, and Asia Pacific was doing pretty well for us as well in the third quarter.</p><p>STERLING AUTY: Got it. Moving over to the negotiation with ICANN. I think there's a number of investors that just felt like, well, why isn't this just a slam dunk, quick, put in Item 35 and you're done. I think from some of the commentary you've made in the earnings calls, it does seem to be more of a negotiation, and negotiation usually means both sides want something. There has been some question that I get from investors as to whether the ICANN fee would go up or what other elements we might actually see. Is there any just high-level color that you can give even prior to seeing the public comment documents?</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: So your question is specifically about when in terms of the publication for public comment? I'm not sure. You kind of lost me right at end there. I'm just not sure exactly what the question is.</p><p>STERLING AUTY: Yes. To be very specific, the question is, since it's a negotiation, should we expect that not only would we see changes to pricing coming into the registry agreement from Item 35, but will there be other changes to the registry agreement since it is a negotiation?</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: Well, there's -- so I think -- no, I said that we can't provide any details, but I can reiterate and tell you that there's an obligation to move the changes from the Cooperative Agreement, which is the pricing, and we're satisfied with that process. And that is the Amendment 35 pricing.</p><p>There's also an obligation resulting from the 2016 extension to provide the security and stability. So I can tell you that in that process, we're satisfied as well with that process, with the discussions that we've had, including security and stability. And that -- in that process, any obligations or expenses that arise from it, that's also an area where we're satisfied with the progress and also the Amendment 35 pricing, obviously. So hopefully that answers your question.</p><p>STERLING AUTY: Yes, that makes sense. And then last question, George, just back -- as we think about the new guidance for the 3.2% to 3.7% growth in the domain overall, should we think that this would be a continuation of the trend in the renewal rate that gets us to that level for the full year? Or is there any other factors that kind of weighed on it?</p><p>GEORGE E. KILGUSS: I mean, Sterling, as we all know, there is seasonality we have in fourth quarter, i.e., there are quite a few holidays in the fourth quarter in the U.S. and abroad. And so it's obviously a combination of adds and renewal rates, but our guidance fully reflects our expectations for the full year performance.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will take our last question from Nick Jones with Citi.</p><p>NICHOLAS FREEMAN JONES, ASSISTANT VP &amp; SENIOR ASSOCIATE, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I guess thinking a little bit longer term, is there any discernible differences in kind of the number of people who are parking domains today than maybe were during the last recession? And is there kind of any difference in the business today or the profile of the registrants that you could add some color around that are different today?</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: I think that's a very tough question to get into any specifics on. But generally, I can tell you that this business has shifted steadily over the years. You probably remember a few years ago when Google was making changes to its search algorithm and affected the way that people monetized domains, that affected registrar buying habits. Geography can play a role as well. People buy domains for different purposes in different geographies. So it's -- there are many purposes, obviously, from branding yourself and building businesses. People buy domains for defensive registration purposes. There are lots of different reasons to buy them. They vary over time. Other external factors that influence them, geography. So it's kind of hard to generalize. I can't think of any standout change or shift that I can point to that indicates any specific change or aspect of our business. As George said, this was a record Q3 with 9.9 million gross adds and so demand is good for the product. Whatever the mix may be, that's a subject for publication of some data in the future. We might look at that. It's a good question, but it's really hard to sort of give you a detailed, sort of granular answer to that. There's just so much activity and so many different reasons that people buy domains and so many different types of monetization as well.</p><p>GEORGE E. KILGUSS: Yes. And as a reminder, Nick, we're a thick registry so we really -- excuse me, a thin registry, so we don't...</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: You don't say the registrant. Registrants don't provide that. So we don't have quite as much information, but we certainly study these trends and it's -- there's a diverse set of reasons that people buy domains.</p><p>NICHOLAS FREEMAN JONES: Okay. Got it. Appreciate it. One more. With kind of an upcoming political cycle and the growing scrutiny on kind of big tech, is there any kind of increased regulatory risk to VeriSign as you guys try to implement Amendment 35 as we get into 2020? Or how should we think about that?</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: We've read what you read about that. That's all we know. I read everything lately. We've read what you've read.</p><p>OPERATOR: That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley for final comments.</p><p>DAVID ATCHLEY, VP &amp; CORPORATE TREASURER, VERISIGN, INC.: Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.</p><p>OPERATOR: That does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division,Senior Analyst</p><p>OVERVIEW</p><p>Co. reported 3Q20 net revenues of $4.8b.</p><p>FINANCIAL DATA</p><p>1. 3Q20 net revenues = $4.8b.</p><p>2. 3Q20 YoverY net revenue decline = 17%.</p><p>3. 3Q20 YoverY net revenue decline in constant dollars = 16%.</p><p>4. 3Q20 non-GAAP, non-OpEx = $118m.</p><p>5. 3Q20-end cash, cash equivalents and investment securities on hand = over $17b.</p><p>6. YTD share repurchase = 36m shares for $6.5b at avg. price of approx. $180.</p><p>7. 3Q20 share repurchase = 5.2m shares for almost $900m at avg. price of $180.47.</p><p>PRESENTATION SUMMARY -</p><p>3Q20 Review (A.K.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. Past few months certainly continued to be challenging.</p><p>1. Focus has and will always remain on well-being of employees, clients and communities in which Co. operates.</p><p>2. Even with significant impacts to economies worldwide, many aspects of Co.'s business have proven to be resilient.</p><p>1. Continues to invest to propel Co.'s growth well into future; in consumer payments, new flows and value-added services.</p><p>3. Net revenues $4.8b.</p><p>1. Down 17% or 16% in constant dollars.</p><p>4. All business drivers were significantly impacted by pandemic.</p><p>1. Payments volume declined 10% globally or 9% excluding China.</p><p>2. Cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe which drives international transaction revenues, declined 47% on constant dollar basis, driven primarily by lack of travels.</p><p>1. Including Intra-Europe, volume down 37%.</p><p>5. Processed 30.7b transactions or over 337m per day on Co.'s network.</p><p>1. Down 13% YoverY.</p><p>6. In each case, business drivers improved each month throughout qtr. meaningfully for payments volume and processed transactions, and only marginally for cross-border volume.</p><p>7. New flows:</p><p>1. Visa Direct grew global transactions in [mid-60s] YoverY, and value-added services revenue grew in mid-teens YoverY.</p><p>8. Effectively managed expenses, which declined 5%.</p><p>1. This was achieved without affecting investments in primary growth initiatives.</p><p>9. Non-GAAP EPS declined 23%.</p><p>10. While COVID-19 certainly impacted performance, there are many trends that are accelerating demand for consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, which will help business as Co. looks ahead.</p><p>2. Consumer Payments:</p><p>1. Even with all success Co. has had in electronifying payments, there is still $18b transacted in cash and check globally.</p><p>2. In today's environment, people are sensitive to touching surfaces, including cash and check.</p><p>1. Co. is seeing this manifested interest in usage and tap-to-pay, which Co. knows helps to digitize cash at low-ticket level and has historically increased transactions by avg. of 20% over time in mature markets globally.</p><p>3. From 2Q-3Q, Co. had nearly 50 countries improved tap-to-pay penetration by more than 5 percentage points, and over 10 countries increased by 10 percentage points or more.</p><p>4. Co. has helped more than 55 countries to increase tap-to-pay limits, reducing share of transactions that require consumer contact by more than 40% in several of those countries.</p><p>5. In US, added more than 80m contactless cards in first six months of calendar year 2020 as number of financial institution partners accelerated their issuance schedules.</p><p>6. Tap-to-pay is likely to accelerate post-COVID, especially as consumers start going back to office, where they tend to conduct smaller transactions for their commute paying for public transit fares and buying food and drinks.</p><p>7. Another positive trend has been shift to e-commerce.</p><p>1. This works in Co.'s favor because its share of digital commerce, where cash is not an option, is approx. three times greater than physical point of sale.</p><p>2. In US, Visa credentials active in e-commerce, excluding travel, were over 12% higher in June than in Jan.</p><p>3. Total spend per active credential increased during that time by over 6%, which is notable considering new adopters typically spend less than those used to shopping online.</p><p>1. When isolating active credentials who tend to be more significantly engaged in e-commerce, spend per active credential increased by over 25%.</p><p>8. Aforementioned trends are not unique to US.</p><p>1. During this period, in UK active e-commerce credentials increased 16%, while spend per active credential increased 3%.</p><p>9. In Brazil, active e-commerce credentials increased 11%, while spend per active credential increased 12%.</p><p>10. In markets where e-commerce is not as developed, they are examples of dramatic changes in adoption.</p><p>1. Argentina experienced active e-commerce card growth of over 100%, and Romania 70%.</p><p>3. New Flows:</p><p>1. Continued focus on addressing $185t opportunity.</p><p>1. In B2B, opportunity is across card-based, AP and AR and cross-border payments.</p><p>2. While B2B volume is down during this work-from-home and limited travel period, continuing to build out capabilities and relationships to fuel future growth.</p><p>2. Recently established global partnership with UK fintech Conferma Pay, which enables companies to provision virtual Visa commercial cards to employees digital wallets, enabling tap-to-pay and simplifying expense reimbursement.</p><p>3. For large ticket cross-border B2B solution (Visa B2B Connect) continues to build network out.</p><p>1. Many banks are in implementation phase.</p><p>2. When they are all live by year-end, Co. will be processing cross-border transactions in half of 80 markets, where its B2B Connect capability is available.</p><p>4. In US, P2P is up almost 80%.</p><p>5. In Latin America, saw progress with P2P apps in Peru, where there was nearly 400% increase in transactions vs. 2Q.</p><p>6. Excited to announce global partnership with PayPal, including its Venmo, Braintree, Xoom, iZettle and Hyperwallet brands.</p><p>1. This is extension of long-standing regional partnership with PayPal.</p><p>2. This new global agreement will allow PayPal and all of its brands to offer fast Visa Direct-enabled domestic and cross-border payments, and expand PayPal's real-time transfer capabilities globally.</p><p>7. In gig-economy food and grocery delivery category, saw nearly 50% growth in transactions from pre-COVID levels and has continued to add new program launches like Instacart for shopper earnings payouts in Canada.</p><p>8. G2C, government-to-consumer, use cases are gaining momentum employing Visa Direct and prepaid cards.</p><p>1. In US, Treasury distributed nearly 4m economic impact payments via Visa prepaid cards.</p><p>9. Worked with CaixaBank in Spain on three projects, issuing 330,000 prepaid Visa cards with government-allocated funds to support vulnerable families across region.</p><p>10. In France, Natixis partnered with Co. to issue 15,000 cards as thank you to frontline hospital workers financed by government.</p><p>4. Value-Added Services:</p><p>1. Saw more clients turn to Co. for help.</p><p>2. As e-commerce has expanded and new sellers are looking to offer omni-commerce payment capabilities that are safe and secure, Co.'s CyberSource and fraud and risk capabilities have seen growth.</p><p>1. Recent win in Saudi Arabia with Al Rajhi Bank; largest acquiring bank in country will leverage CyberSource to enable e-commerce payments platform for all Saudi Arabian government services through centralized interface with country's Ministry of Finance.</p><p>2. Buying online, picking up in-store has become popular among consumers, and is key way for sellers to operate in this environment.</p><p>1. This use case does bring higher potential for fraud.</p><p>2. One home improvement partner chose Decision Manager, Co.'s CyberSource fraud offering to quickly review online orders for fraud risk and meet customer expectations for two-hour pickup.</p><p>3. This resulted in massive increase in Decision Manager transactions in May alone at this merchant.</p><p>3. Across all CyberSource risk products, saw nearly 50% YoverY growth in transactions.</p><p>4. Interest has grown in authentication products.</p><p>1. CardinalCommerce, which provides network agnostic product for sellers and issuers to leverage 3-D Secure standard have seen accelerated growth in transactions YoverY.</p><p>2. 3-D Secure is making steady progress in Europe, where ecosystem is ramping up in advance of secure customer authentication mandate beginning in Dec. for most of Europe.</p><p>3. Continues to work with ecosystem participants as deadline approaches, given that some are not ready for deadline.</p><p>4. [EMVC] 3-D Secure transactions has grown over 100% sequentially.</p><p>5. Data and consulting continue to be valuable to clients as they navigate this environment.</p><p>1. Clients utilized consulting services at accelerated rate with almost 60% more projects completed YoverY.</p><p>2. Co. plays critical role in providing data analysis to help clients manage their business through pandemic.</p><p>1. Client activity on Visa Analytics Platform increased 60% sequentially.</p><p>5. New Deals:</p><p>1. Made good progress.</p><p>2. Momentum in Europe continues.</p><p>1. Renewed with one of the largest banks in Nordics, Nordea, to grow debit portfolios across region.</p><p>2. Expanded partnership with Permanent TSB; large issuer in Ireland with over 800,000 cards in (inaudible), making Visa the primary card in most wallets in Ireland.</p><p>3. Recently extended partnership with UBS in Switzerland to debit.</p><p>3. Co. is winning processing.</p><p>1. In Spain, secured significant deal to expand processing capabilities for domestic transactions.</p><p>2. Banco Caminos will migrate their issuing and acquiring volumes from their local processor to Visa.</p><p>4. Europe was certainly not exception in developing and renewing partnerships.</p><p>5. In Singapore, renewed partnership with second largest debit issuer OCBC Bank to remain preferred debit card issued to OCBC Bank's personal savings and current account customers.</p><p>6. In Korea, recently secured renewal with South Korea's biggest issuer, Shinhan Card.</p><p>7. Renewed credit and debit partnership with Banco de Bogota, Co.'s largest issuer client in Colombia.</p><p>8. Recently won and started issuance with Kaspi Bank, one of the largest retail banks in Kazakhstan.</p><p>1. Bank is moving 100% to Visa over next few years.</p><p>9. Co-brand:</p><p>1. Leadership position in co-brand continued.</p><p>1. This qtr. Co. renewed and expanded strategic partnership with Best Buy, including extended My Best Buy co-brand relationship.</p><p>2. Ford and V collaborate on Ford's new FordPass Rewards.</p><p>1. Visa card available to their 4m FordPass Rewards members and other Ford customers.</p><p>3. Another recent co-brand win was with Verizon to launch of Visa credit card that provide savings on Verizon's industry-leading products and services, along with benefits for every day and essential purposes.</p><p>4. Signed co-brand deal with Tiki, one of the leading e-commerce platforms in Vietnam.</p><p>10. Fintechs:</p><p>1. Key component to building issuance and acceptance is with fintechs.</p><p>1. This qtr., secured many wallet and neobank wins globally.</p><p>2. Careem, biggest ride-hailing app in Middle East and Africa, will offer driver payouts with Visa Direct and credentials to over their 35m user base.</p><p>3. Hong Kong's digital transit card, Octopus, will accept Visa wallet top-ups, allowing commuters to pay for transport and pay in 35,000 retail outlets.</p><p>4. In Saudi Arabia, signed strategic partnership [Halal], rising challenger bank that has potential to penetrate an unbanked population of up to 7m people.</p><p>5. Neobank, Vivid Money, announced its official launch in Germany, offering Visa debit cards in all-in-one mobile application, including innovative savings and cash back solution.</p><p>6. In US, US-based Chime, with over 8m accounts, launched access to new Visa-secured credit card, which allows consumers to build credit, while spending on everyday purchases like groceries and monthly subscriptions.</p><p>11. Partnerships are fundamentals to Co.'s business model.</p><p>1. Aforementioned renewals and new deals will certainly help drive growth into future.</p><p>6. Race Situation:</p><p>1. For four centuries black and African/American women and men have experienced many forms of social injustice and discrimination.</p><p>1. It is offensive, it is frustrating and unacceptable; it must stop.</p><p>2. At Co., it is committed to do its part.</p><p>1. Recently announced next steps in Co.'s journey to drive inclusion and diversity across V.</p><p>2. Announced number of actions, including (Technical Difficulty).</p><p>3Q20 Financials (V.P.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. (Technical Difficulty) significantly accelerated secular shift to e-commerce.</p><p>2. Card-not-present spend, excluding travel, has grown over 25% every week since mid-April, which is two times pre-COVID growth rate.</p><p>3. Card-present spending improved steadily through qtr. as reopenings went into effect from declining almost 50% in early April to declining in high-single digits by late June.</p><p>1. There has been little improvement since.</p><p>2. It is too early to tell what all underlying causes of this recent stabilization are.</p><p>3. Recovery trajectories for card-present volume are relatively similar across states.</p><p>4. US spend by category:</p><p>1. Excluding Visa Direct, performance can be summarized in three groups based on COVID impact, and recovery Co. has seen to-date.</p><p>2. Each group represents roughly a third of US payments volume.</p><p>1. First group includes categories like food and drug stores, home improvement and retail goods; these categories have consistently grown at or above pre-COVID growth rates, in high teens or even higher every week since mid-April.</p><p>2. Second group includes categories that experienced spend declines between 10-50% in April, and then all recover to growth by June-end; these segments include automotive, retail services, department and apparel stores, healthcare, education, government and business supplies.</p><p>3. Third group includes categories that are hardest hit by this pandemic, travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants; these categories declined over 50% in April and are still declining YoverY, although each improved by between 20-45 points during qtr.</p><p>3. Travel remains most impacted category; still down over 50%.</p><p>4. Fuel gallons purchased are growing again with spend is down more than 15% in July, driven by lower prices.</p><p>5. Within restaurant category, card-present spend is still declining, whilst card-not-present spend continues to grow significantly with quick service restaurants outperforming.</p><p>2. International Payments Volume:</p><p>1. Declined over 12% in constant dollars.</p><p>2. Similar to US, debit significantly outperformed credit with debit down only 3% and credit down 20%.</p><p>3. Card-present spend improved through qtr. as countries reopened.</p><p>4. Card-not-present, excluding travel spend, remained elevated.</p><p>5. Performance across categories was broadly similar to US.</p><p>6. Co.'s best-performing region continues to be CEMEA, which declined 5% in constant dollars.</p><p>1. Within CEMEA, Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia had positive growth, fueled by rapid recovery after April declines and client wins.</p><p>7. Europe payments volume declined 10% in constant dollars.</p><p>1. Central and South Eastern Europe, which include Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary recovered rapidly to post positive growth.</p><p>2. UK returned to growth in June, driven by consistently strong card-not-present growth.</p><p>3. Italy is almost back to prior-year levels in June, following one of the strictest lockdowns within Europe.</p><p>4. Canada, declined 15%.</p><p>5. Latin America declined 13% in constant dollars.</p><p>6. Brazil spend decline early in qtr. was one of the shallowest; recovery has also been slow.</p><p>1. Brazil is now back near 2019 levels of domestic spending, fueled by strong card-not-present growth.</p><p>8. Asia-Pacific payments volume declined 16% in constant dollars.</p><p>1. Reopening of Asian economies has been gradual with multiple phases depending on country.</p><p>2. Two of the least impacted countries were Korea and New Zealand, both of which were close to flat.</p><p>3. Domestic spending in Japan and Australia was back to 2019 levels by late June.</p><p>4. India remains one of the most impacted markets globally.</p><p>9. Processed transactions declined 13%.</p><p>1. Although this lagged volume growth due to mix shift, trajectory of processed transactions recovery is similar, improving from 24% decline in April to 4% decline in June.</p><p>1. Growth in July through 21 is flat.</p><p>2. Domestically, mix of spend has shifted from lower-ticket to higher-ticket categories.</p><p>10. Cross-border transactions are holding up better than volumes, due to mix shift from high-ticket travel-related spending to lower-ticket non-travel e-commerce.</p><p>1. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding volume within Europe, declined 47%.</p><p>2. Volumes declined 51% in April and improved marginally in May to decline 45%.</p><p>1. There has been little improvement since.</p><p>2. For month of June and in July though 21, rate of decline has stayed at 44%.</p><p>3. Constant dollar cross-border volume, including volume within Europe, declined 37%.</p><p>4. Cross-border volume, excluding volume within Europe, drives Co.'s international fees.</p><p>5. Cross-border spend decline is driven by travel.</p><p>1. Travel-related spend, which includes card-present and card-not-present in travel categories, represented roughly two-thirds of pre-COVID cross-border volume, excluding volume within Europe.</p><p>2. Travel-related spend declined 78%, and was still declining over 70% at June-end.</p><p>6. To have recovery in cross-border travel, one has to have reopening of borders.</p><p>1. At this point, border remain largely closed.</p><p>2. World Tourism Organization reported at June-end that out of 217 countries, 189 or 87% had completely or partially closed their borders to foreign visitors.</p><p>3. Of remaining 28 countries, 10 had completely or partially suspended flights.</p><p>4. Several other countries like UK required quarantines and rest had imposed visa restrictions or demand medical certificates.</p><p>7. While no one corridor drives large portion of volumes, some of Co.'s most important corridors remain closed.</p><p>1. Borders have to reopen before Co. can get sense of what cross-border recovery trajectory might be.</p><p>2. In few corridors where cross-border travel is now possible, saw some significant recoveries.</p><p>3. Americans are traveling again to Mexico and Caribbean; since April low, these corridors have seen cross-border card-present volume recovered by 30-40 points.</p><p>4. Travel, to and from Switzerland, to France and Germany is almost back to normal.</p><p>5. Russian travel to neighboring countries has picked up.</p><p>6. Travel from Europe to UAE is gaining momentum.</p><p>7. Vast majority of cross-border travel spend is on personal cards and not for business travel.</p><p>8. Consumer travel demand for visits to friends, relatives and for vacations is more likely to remain intact post-COVID, perhaps even enhanced.</p><p>9. Consumer travel recovery is likely to start with people going to countries within their geographic zone of comfort; this is already evident as Co. looks at short-haul cross-border travel, which it define as less than 3,000 miles.</p><p>10. Short-haul air travel is recovering faster than longer-haul corridors.</p><p>11. Drive-through hotels are doing better, as are leisure hotels vs. business hotels.</p><p>8. Growth in cross-border e-commerce spend, excluding travel, has been consistently in high-teens to low-20s since mid-April.</p><p>1. Strong growth is fueled by retail spending, which is growing about 30% since mid-April and drove majority of non-travel e-commerce spend.</p><p>9. In most countries, saw that once consumer decides to buy something online rather than go to local store, there is higher likelihood the purchase becomes cross-border with little regard of where item is shipped from.</p><p>10. Strength in retail is offset by declines in entertainment, education and government, some of which are tied of travel and represent meaningful portion of card-not-present non-travel spend.</p><p>1. Aforementioned are excludes volume within Europe.</p><p>11. Within EU, borders have largely reopened.</p><p>1. Intra-Europe cross-border card-present spend is up 40 points from trough in April through three weeks in July; another indication of the possible trajectory of cross-border recovery when borders do reopen.</p><p>3. Results:</p><p>1. Net revenues declined 17% or 16% in constant dollars.</p><p>1. Service revenues were flat YoverY.</p><p>1. Reflects last qtr.'s volumes.</p><p>2. Data processing revenues declined 5%, supported by strong value-added services growth and acquisition-related revenue.</p><p>3. International transaction revenues decreased 44%; in line with decline in cross-border volumes, excluding volume within Europe.</p><p>4. Other revenues declined 8% YoverY, due to value-added services impacted by pandemic.</p><p>1. Value-added services impacted by pandemic include lower use of travel-related card benefits, lower marketing-related services for clients as many slowed marketing activities and fees Co. waived on certain services, which surged at outset of pandemic.</p><p>5. Had Co. reported service fees without lag, service fees would have declined 11% and reported net revenues would have dropped additional 4.5 points to approx. 21.5%.</p><p>1. These no service fees will impact reported revenues next qtr.</p><p>4. Note:</p><p>1. Value-added services revenues captured in P&amp;L:</p><p>1. Total value-added services revenue grew in mid-teens, including acquisitions.</p><p>1. Approx. two-third of value-added services revenues are included in data processing, as many of them are transaction-based revenue streams.</p><p>2. These value-added services grew in mid-teens, driven by strength in US debit and prepaid issuer processing, CyberSource and authentication and fraud services.</p><p>3. Remaining value-added services revenue is split roughly evenly between service fees and other revenue.</p><p>2. Value-added services and service fees grew in mid-teens.</p><p>1. Value-added services recorded in other revenues grew in mid-single digit due to acquisitions, increased use of data products and consulting, offset by declines in usage of card benefits and marketing services.</p><p>3. Client incentives declined 2% YoverY, and 23.8% of gross revenue.</p><p>1. As indicated before, vast majority of incentives are tied to payments volumes.</p><p>2. Incentives declined less than gross revenue, pushing up incentives as percent of gross revenue.</p><p>4. Incentives are generally tied to total payments volumes and only selectively to cross-border volumes, as declines in cross-border volumes have been deeper than total payments volumes and cross-border volumes have higher yields, incentive declines lag gross revenue declines.</p><p>5. Heavy renewal activity like Co. had in FY19 causes incentives to grow faster than gross revenue.</p><p>1. Thereby, decline in incentives lags gross revenue on way down.</p><p>6. Offsetting aforementioned factors to some degree is service fee lag.</p><p>1. Service fee lag mitigated gross revenue decline reported; this will impact negatively next qtr.</p><p>5. Other Financials:</p><p>1. GAAP and non-GAAP OpEx declined 5% as Co. was able to execute additional cost management initiatives, particularly in areas of marketing, and G&amp;A.</p><p>1. These expense reductions were achieved, while sustaining investments in longer-term growth initiatives.</p><p>2. Acting early and decisively has helped Co. to reduce expenses fast.</p><p>2. Non-GAAP, non-OpEx was $118m.</p><p>3. Interest income was lower, due to sharp drop in interest rates.</p><p>4. Interest expense was higher from $4b debt issued.</p><p>5. Non-GAAP tax rate 19%.</p><p>6. 4Q20 Perspectives:</p><p>1. Forecasting revenues remains challenge in this environment.</p><p>1. It is difficult to predict when borders will reopen, and what trajectory of cross-border travel recovery will be post reopenings.</p><p>2. Domestic volumes have bounced back nicely in most countries.</p><p>1. Inevitably, rate of recovery will slow.</p><p>3. Other uncertainties include impact of recent spike in infections, and economic impact of stimulus payments tapering off or ending altogether worldwide.</p><p>4. Had Co. reported service revenues without lag, 3Q net revenue would have declined additional 4.5 points.</p><p>1. This will cause 4Q reported net revenue growth to be lower than 3Q, absent change in trend on key business drivers.</p><p>5. Continued recovery in domestic payments volumes and transactions will improve data processing revenue trend, but not reported service revenue.</p><p>1. This will be partially offset by higher incentives, related to increasing volumes.</p><p>2. As such, most important variable that would improve 4Q net revenue growth rate is cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe.</p><p>6. If cross-border recovery remains sluggish through 4Q, revenue mix shift away from cross-border will persist.</p><p>1. Adding in impact of service fee lag, incentives as percent of gross revenues are likely to increase by 2-3 points over 3Q levels.</p><p>1.

Hopefully, you can hear me, I guess.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU, VICE CHAIRMAN &amp; CFO, VISA INC.: Yes, we can.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: So I'm going to hit a topic you did not cover on the call. Al, question for you about big tech. The big tech companies are now facing elevated regulatory pressure, obviously very present right now in the U.S., also in Europe, related to some of their competitive practices. Can you comment on how this regulatory scrutiny you see affecting, one, those firms' initiatives in payments? Like in particular, are there anything -- any practices that they're doing that you at Visa or Visa would view should be scrutinized? And then also, do you view this sort of regulatory scrutiny on big tech as a plus for the payments ecosystem and for Visa or as potentially a negative?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, VISA INC.: Well, Lisa, as you might imagine, we have relationships with all of the companies that you would consider big techs. Some are a bit more extensive than others, but we certainly have relationships with all of them. I certainly can't comment and wouldn't comment on regulatory scrutiny that they are experiencing. But if it involves payments and we can be helpful to them or helpful to the government in either advocating or explaining what's going on, we will jump into that. There was a case with a payment initiative that we had going with Facebook in Brazil in the last month where we did just that, as an example.</p><p>I think that these big techs are -- certainly have attracted lots and lots of users and have developed relationships with them. And some of those relationships are going to require money movement or payments capability. And we certainly want to be there and be the partner to work with them on those particular things. And we'll leave it to them to figure out and deal with any of the regulatory issues that they're facing. And we're a phone call away if we can be helpful. But I think, in most cases, it's kind of up to them to resolve them.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Matt O'Neill from Goldman Sachs.</p><p>MATTHEW CASEY O'NEILL, RESEARCH ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I was hoping you could provide some anecdotal views on what I think is probably the next leg of the sort of secular catalyst here, the sort of silver lining of this pandemic, if there is one, which is obviously the e-com growth has been robust. But how are the bank partners and merchant partners sort of thinking about the move back into brick-and-mortar commerce in what will inevitably be a significantly greater demand for contactless payments?</p><p>And then if I could just have a quick unrelated follow-up. I was just wondering if there's any update on the Plaid acquisition and any comments around the lawsuit there.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Well, interestingly enough, as you probably could see in some of our charts, as card-not-present has -- I'm sorry, as card-not-present has started to work its way back, it lagged obviously, card-not-present, it was impacted much more greatly by the pandemic. Card-not-present volumes have held up, so we're not seeing any declines there. And I think that what all issuers and anybody who's rooting for economies around the world to come back would love to see a situation where both card-not-present and card-present both bounce back, and that bricks-and-mortar commerce on main streets and communities around the world continue to grow.</p><p>I think the case for contactless, Matt, has been made. We have seen consumers and governments and merchants voting through their actions, and contactless has had -- or tap to pay had tremendous momentum kind of going into COVID. And if anything, COVID had accelerated the momentum of tap to pay even in the United States, which we know has been further behind, but as I cited, we've added 80,000 -- or I'm sorry, our issuers have added 80 million credentials that are tap to pay-enabled in the first 6 months of the year. Something like 80% of the merchant volume is -- that is occurring in the face-to-face world is occurring at terminals that are enabled for tap to pay. So I think it's going to just continue to grow everywhere around the world. And I believe that the COVID situation will help accelerate the growth here in the United States at a perhaps faster pace than it might have happened otherwise.</p><p>As for Plaid...</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Al, I might add a couple of things. One, crisis fosters innovation as you know. And if anything, this has made more and more merchants focus on omnichannel commerce, which CyberSource is very much in the middle of. And increasingly, merchants are getting better and better at serving customers seamlessly across bricks-and-mortar as well as e-commerce. It has also made a lot of categories that never used e-commerce become a lot better at e-commerce. And that's -- you've seen that in a lot of everyday spend categories. You've seen that with restaurants.</p><p>And more broadly across retail, people have come up with more innovative ways like curbside delivery has been perfected in many ways. And that, we think, is going to be here with us, which is really a way where you order online, but you may pick up physically. So you have one more delivery option, you can get it delivered after a day or 2 delay, or you can get it right away by going and picking it up.</p><p>So there's a lot going on. And I think the most important point that Al made was that even as we've seen card-present improve from minus 50 to minus high single digits, card-not-present has stayed very robust, continuing to grow at those mid-20s levels for quite a while now. So lots of changes underway.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Matt, let me address your Plaid question. It's still pending regulatory approval. And we certainly are expecting to close by the end of the calendar year and are doing everything we can to comply with any request from the regulators that are looking at it. We are as excited about the Plaid acquisition today as we were back in January when we made the announcement. And we really believe we got the asset we wanted. And all of the various benefits that we have articulated in prior calls, we believe, are still there. Everything from the depth of their integration with fintechs, the fact that they are most attracted to a lot of fintechs, that they're positioned in terms of how far along they are, we believe they have the best team. And we see it as the best way to integrate into Visa. So we're -- we remain very excited about Plaid and hopeful to close by the end of the year.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER, MD &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH, LLC: Just a couple of quick ones, first on the fourth quarter, fiscal fourth quarter comments. Just to clarify, I think you guys are saying that the -- just the lag effect of services versus prior quarter volume would impact that line by 4 points. But I guess we're just wondering if the -- just given the trends we're seeing on transactions processed flattening out, shouldn't those trends be enough to offset that when it comes to growth in fiscal Q4?</p><p>And then, Al, just bigger picture, when we think about the services, all these other value-added services you guys are doing well with, I mean, do you see these sticking around post-COVID in terms of the demand you're seeing for analytics and potentially the card-not-present service fees or CyberSource?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: So why don't I let Vasant answer the first piece, and I'll come back and address the second piece?</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Sure. So if you look at the various lines on the revenue line, service fees, as you indicated and as we told you in the comments, are known already. They're going to report service fees based on our volumes in the third quarter. And the volumes in the third quarter was hopefully the low point. And as we said, had we not done a lag, our service fees would have been down 11%, and total net revenue would have been down, as you said, in that 4, 4.5% range. So that is going to happen. That's a known fact. And even if volumes improve on the domestic front and transactions improve, the service fee number isn't going to change next quarter. So that's locked in. So when volumes do improve, which we expect will be the case on domestic volumes and transactions, transactions revenues will definitely go up.</p><p>Value-added services revenues will definitely go up. But the other thing that goes up is the contra-revenue line, incentives. Incentives will go up to reflect the higher volumes because we don't book incentives with a lag. Incentives will go up, but the benefit of that revenue from the higher incentives, we won't get on the services line -- service fee line, we will get it on -- we will definitely get it on the processing line.</p><p>So there's something of an offset there. I just want you to be aware of that. But the biggest variable is going to be cross-border. If there's a change in trend in cross-border and it improves, then that would be the single biggest reason to expect Q4 trends to be better than Q3, recognizing that you've got pressure going in the other direction from the service fee lag.</p><p>So there's some complexity created by these things because of the turbulent times we're in. We've tried to help you with it. And hopefully we can help you some more, if you like, answer more questions later on.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: And Darrin, on your second question, I'm very bullish on what's going to happen with value-added services in a post-COVID world. First of all, 2/3 of our value-added service is a platform-type services, CyberSource, issuer processing, risk and fraud. The need for those is going to continue. And if anything, the volumes and transactions that will run through those will go up.</p><p>Where we've seen some declines are in travel-related card benefits, which is going to get better as travel comes back. We've also waived some fees because of the pandemic. And once we're past the pandemic, we won't waive those fees as readily, so that volume will go up. Travel-related benefits will go up, as I said, as travel comes back. So I see value-added services being very well positioned coming out of COVID and feel very good about the contribution they'll make and how they'll continue to diversify our revenue profile over time.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Yes. I think the other things to add there, 3 of our largest value-added services, we think, are going to sustain their growth, which has already accelerated. Our issuer processing business, which is directed towards debit. Debit has become the engine for cash conversion right now. Debit growth rates, as you saw, are 25% in the first 3 weeks of July. So as long as debit growth rates are at an accelerated level, the issuer processing business will clearly have high growth rates.</p><p>CyberSource always benefits from the shift to e-commerce. And now with their focus on omnicommerce, CyberSource clearly is benefiting from the shift.</p><p>And then finally, our risk and fraud services certainly benefit as things move more to e-commerce, which is where fraud is an area that we can really help a lot on. So they're reasons to believe that higher growth rates can sustain post-COVID.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna.</p><p>JAMES ERIC FRIEDMAN, SENIOR ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP, LLLP, RESEARCH DIVISION: Al, in your prepared remarks, you shared some P2P growth characteristics. You were going kind of quick there. I -- that disclosure was new, at least to me. But I was wondering if you could repeat what you said and also, at the same time, share some use cases about how you're seeing the P2P applications develop.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Well, what I said in my remarks was that P2P is up almost 80% in third quarter, and in Latin America -- that was in the United States, I'm sorry, up 80% in the third quarter. And in Latin America, there we saw progress with 2 different apps -- P2P apps in Peru where we saw a nearly 400% increase in transactions in Q3 over the prior quarter Q2.</p><p>We've got this tremendous track record of working with P2P providers. And as we said in the past, we were heavily skewed toward the United States and Russia. But we're -- and where we have relationships with most of the big P2P providers, Square Cash, Venmo, Zelle, et cetera. I think that now we're seeing our P2P capability through our Visa Direct platform becomes something that people are looking to us for as P2P applications are developing in other countries around the world.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Since we had some issues earlier, we'll run longer. So we'll probably go for at least 10 minutes past the hour.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer from Autonomous Research.</p><p>CRAIG JARED MAURER, PARTNER, PAYMENTS AND FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: I was hoping, Vasant, you could comment on if we see cross-border -- the cross-border recovery continue to stagnate into next year and domestic volume continue to pick up, intra-Europe cross-border continue to pick up, where should we be thinking about incentives as a percentage of gross revenue going. What's the risk to next year in terms of upside from that percentage?</p><p>And then perhaps, Al, maybe a comment or 2 on the renewal of the Durbin Amendment version 2 or 3, whatever we're at, at this point, and EPI in Europe.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Yes. In times like these, I think it's not easy to make long-term projections clearly. In terms of cross-border and its recovery, yes, it's possible, I suppose, that it remains sluggish. It all depends on borders reopening. Wherever borders have been opened or the restrictions have not been significant, we've seen some pretty quick recoveries. So to the extent that there are borders reopening, it may not be globally, but there could be corridors opening up as we're already hearing, Australia, New Zealand, you've seen that it's mostly open across the EU. It's starting to open in other geographies within regions. So it's not black and white, I think, in terms of the cross-border recovery. You could see some changes in travel patterns because of how countries open up. But if cross-border remains depressed, certainly the mix won't help us. And that will cause the percentage of incentives to gross revenue to stay higher than what you might call -- what it would might have been normalized mix of earnings -- of revenues.</p><p>The other factor that's influencing it is probably most acute in the fourth quarter, which is the service fee lag. Normally, our service fees from one quarter to another don't have such significant swings because our business tends to be quite stable, so that service fee lag effect will moderate. So I think the best way to describe it is it will probably normalize from the levels you see in the fourth quarter. It will certainly normalize because of service fee stabilizing. It will probably normalize some because the cross-border business will recover in corridors, but we'll wait and see how fast cross-border normalizes.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Let me address your other 2 questions you asked about Durbin. Visa is fully compliant with all the requirements of the Durbin Amendment. And we don't have any rules or requirements or other restrictions that inhibit a merchant's ability to select their routing decisions, make the routing decision of their choice. And merchants are free and often do route to various unaffiliated networks enabled on a debit card. So that would -- I think we're in good shape as it relates to Durbin.</p><p>EPI, we have a history of dealing with either regions or groups of countries or countries developing their own scheme or intra-market network. It's something that we're very, very used to dealing with. We do know though that developing a network is not an inexpensive thing to do, and it's not a onetime investment. You have to continue to push and invest and innovate and be creative to stay ahead as it relates to all the elements of security, fraud prevention, risk, authentication, et cetera.</p><p>And so we will continue to monitor and engage constructively with regulators and banks in Europe on EPI. But on the other hand, we're going to continue to invest heavily behind our various networks to make them as good as they could possibly be. And we will be continuing to focus on making sure that our clients know the benefits that they can obtain by doing business with us and running on our networks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG, SENIOR ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just want to ask on the spread in U.S. debit and credit, I know you went through it a couple of times, Vasant. But it's wider than what we saw in '08, '09. So is there a way to try and quantify how much of the debit outperformance we can attribute to secular versus stimulus benefits?</p><p>And curious also, I just want to make sure, any impact on yield differences between the 2 products. I don't think so, but just wanted to make sure.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Yes. There are some modest yield differences depending on parts of the world and so on. I don't think you should view that as a huge factor.</p><p>In terms of the reasons that might stick as we go ahead, I think we went through 6 -- 5 reasons. One, the economic impact payments and unemployment benefits being distributed on Visa prepaid cards, clearly, that's linked to the crisis and probably is not something that will continue. Affluent customers putting off some discretionary items like travel, entertainment and restaurants, which has hit credit in particular, that probably normalizes over time, so that, you can attribute to COVID. The propensity for people to spend money -- spend the money they have versus money from -- borrowed money, that is something you do see in times of uncertainty. And then some of the economic incentive impact payments going into checking accounts clearly has helped debit.</p><p>But there's a few others that are clearly sticking. The fact that Visa Direct is still going very strong, that has been helping debit for a long time, and we'll continue to do that. The fact that debit has become the mechanism for cash conversion to digital in everyday spend categories and in just about -- in most categories, which have seen a big increase in e-commerce, has benefited debit, I think some of that sticks.</p><p>So I think the best way to describe it is that the acceleration of cash conversion has disproportionately helped debit, and that is most likely going to stick.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: And Tien-Tsin, it's Al. I would only add that I think the -- if I look back, same observation you do about the 2008/2009 time frame. But e-commerce is just much, much bigger, and it just appears that people who are doing card-not-present e-com nontravel are using their debit cards much more than their credit cards.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT, SENIOR MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Could you parse out some of the drivers of the 36% decline in international transaction revenue yield? I imagine a lot of that's just the big drop in cross-border travel. But if you could help us think through the drivers in terms of how much might be inter-European versus debit? And how should we think about international transaction revenue yield going forward?</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Yes. So I think it's very important to continue to point people to the decline of cross-border volumes excluding intra-Europe volumes. The decline was roughly -- was 47% in cross-border constant dollar volumes excluding intra-Europe. So the revenue decline is roughly, as you can see, in line with that. The reason being that -- and if you look at total cross-border volume, that includes intra-Europe, intra-Europe looks more like a domestic transaction. In fact, in our international revenue line, the contribution from intra-Europe transactions is very small. The international revenue line is driven almost entirely by volume excluding intra-Europe.</p><p>Now there's a few other things there that can have an impact. Exchange rate shifts can. Changes in currency volatility can. So that explains -- and then some small changes in mix in terms of which corridors are doing better than others because of some yield differences across corridors.</p><p>But that explains the 44% decline in revenues versus the 47% decline in volumes ex intra-Europe. But as you can see, watching that volume line ex intra-Europe is the best indicator, and that's what you should focus on.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, could you just comment on the 10% growth in processing transaction yield year-over-year and thoughts going forward?</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Right. There's 2 factors driving it. One is that cross-border transactions have held up a little better than cross-border volume. So the mix has helped a bit because cross-border transactions for processing have a higher yield.</p><p>And the second is we have value-added services and some acquisitions in that line. And as you heard, value-added services are growing in the mid-teens in that line. So those 2 things have helped data processing yields go up.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird.</p><p>DAVID JOHN KONING, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: And I guess following up on that last question, you said that the ex intra-Europe volume down 47%, but 44% revenue decline. Is that gap going to change much? I know FX volatility probably helped a little bit in Q3 to make revenue a little better than the volume decline. But are there any other kind of yield factors in there other than FX volatility to think about?</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: The variables that can make a difference there, first of all, the 44% to 47% is a relatively small delta. There'll always be some differences between the 2. They won't match each other precisely.</p><p>But you're right, currency volatility is one factor. Another factor would be mix. Certain corridors can have better yields than others. So if the recovery of cross-border favors higher-yielding corridors, you can have something of a difference. But other than that, it should track pretty closely to volumes ex intra-Europe volumes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our last question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT, SENIOR RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN</p><p>&amp; CO., LLC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Al, can you expand upon your recent conversations with regulators and governments? Now on one hand, some merchants are lobbying for lower fees in this crisis, and I understand that's not a new phenomenon. But then there are very real benefits of digital payments, especially in this current environment. So just -- can you just talk about how your conversations with regulators and governments are evolving in this crisis?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Look, I think like many people, governments are finding themselves in uncharted territory here. And they're all well intentioned, trying to figure out the right things to do.</p><p>Our biggest piece of advice to governments as it relates to core payments is to do no harm at the moment. I mean right now, I think the less amount of moving parts as we're fighting through this pandemic is the best answer for everybody. This is not a time for any kind of changes.</p><p>Governments are also increasingly talking to us in terms of looking for information that we have in terms of trends because they're trying to understand what's happening in their economies. And in many ways, we could get them real-time picture of what's going on, faster than they can get it themselves.</p><p>And the last thing I would say is that there's a lot of interest in the form of governments to become more role models in terms of what they want to see in their countries from a digital adoption point of view. And so as they are -- have genned up stimulus programs, unemployment programs, thank-you programs and all kinds of other things, they're looking to Visa to help advise them on how they could distribute funds digitally as opposed to cutting checks.</p><p>So I think my view at the moment is that governments have -- are being very, very thoughtful and reasonable in terms of what they're saying, and they're also being good listeners. And so we're going to continue to do our job to provide them with whatever information they need and to provide them with whatever advice and counsel we can provide to be helpful to them, both in their role as governments and setters of laws as well as in their role as potential clients for various Visa services.</p><p>Before we close out, one of the things I gather that did not -- when we had a little blackout with -- in terms of the transmission was I did before I closed make a comment about the race situation in the country and around the world. And I'd like to just cite that again.</p><p>For 4 centuries, Black and African-American women and men have experienced incredible forms of social injustice and discrimination. And it's offensive, it's frustrating and it's unacceptable, and it has to stop.</p><p>At Visa, we've committed to do our part. We recently announced the next steps in our journey to drive inclusion and diversity across our company. We announced a number of actions, including the establishment of a Visa scholars and jobs program. But very importantly, last week, we announced that we're committing to increase the number of underrepresented U.S. vice presidents and above by 50% in the next 3 years and increase the number of underrepresented U.S. colleagues within Visa overall by 50% in the next 5 years.</p><p>We want to do our part to eradicate the social injustice in the world. It's way past time that, that has to be the case.</p><p>With that, thank you to everybody. Mike, did you want to...</p><p>MIKE MILOTICH, SVP OF IR, VISA INC.: Yes. Thank you, Al.</p><p>So yes, once again, I apologize for the technical challenges. We will make sure that the replay that's on our website as well as the transcript reflect everything. And if you have additional questions, of course feel free and reach out to us here, on the Investor Relations team, and we're happy to help you.

Earlier this year, started with second leg of Simplification program.</p><p>2. Will lead to even higher quality of service for customers and improve time-to-market.</p><p>8. On track with key priorities set out at Capital Markets Day last year.</p><p>3. Accelerate Up &amp; Cross-Sell in Bundles:</p><p>1. Convergence strategy in consumer is paying off.</p><p>1. Sees continued growth in fixed mobile bundles.</p><p>2. Had 74,000 fixed-mobile net adds over qtr., reaching penetration of 37% of households.</p><p>2. Postpaid customer base:</p><p>1. Added 122,000 mobile customers to fixed mobile base, reaching 43% of postpaid customers for all brands.</p><p>1. At 56%, KPN brand is already well ahead.</p><p>3. Sees continued growth of convergent offering as Co. recently started to cross-sell high-value fixed brand, XS4ALL with KPN Mobile.</p><p>4. At Telfort, focus is fully on convergence.</p><p>5. As Co. [gave EUR5 discount on complete offering, growing convergence first comes at cost].</p><p>1. Longer term, there are benefits outweighing this initial expense.</p><p>6. Sees much higher customer satisfaction, lower churn and as such Co. is able to reduce marketing expenses considerably.</p><p>1. With this, fixed mobile convergence remains important pillar in Co.'s strategy from customer proposition perspective and operational and network perspective.</p><p>4. Mobile:</p><p>1. Disciplined approach towards convergence and emphasis on value per customer resulted in growing committed ARPU level.</p><p>2. Postpaid net adds entirely driven by KPN brand, reflecting competitive environment in lower end of market.</p><p>3. Sees customers moving towards higher data allowances and more expensive handsets and as such see higher bundle value for customers.</p><p>1. Despite higher SAC/SRC per sub, this translates into higher customer lifetime value.</p><p>1. This is key performance metric, allowing Co. to track current financial performance and performance it expects to deliver over near future.</p><p>5. Growth in TV:</p><p>1. TV platform delivers best customer experience as reported by largest Dutch consumer organization.</p><p>2. Due to high-quality digital infrastructure in Netherlands, high broadband speeds are rule rather than exception.</p><p>1. Speed is not key differentiator in fixed landscape where TV is.</p><p>3. Three items of paramount importance.</p><p>1. Stability and image quality of non-linear TV services.</p><p>2. Watch everywhere, seamless integration on all devices.</p><p>3. Has personalized content easily and widely accessible for everyone.</p><p>4. One key aspect in delivering aforementioned items is high-quality content delivery network.</p><p>1. Saw widely-used content at more than 100 Metro Core locations throughout country, thereby offloading core entrants per network.</p><p>2. Has selective range of exclusive content that mainly focus on content aggregation through smart partnerships.</p><p>1. Ensures customers have access to rich content package, including music, sports, movies and entertainment.</p><p>3. Confident that high-quality interactive TV platform and recognition by customers will further drive personalized and on-demand TV consumption.</p><p>6. Business Segment Transformation:</p><p>1. Through history of connectivity, built strong relationships with majority of Dutch businesses.</p><p>1. For many of them, Co. is vital partner in their digital transformation.</p><p>2. In midst of migrating customers to integrated solutions and new technologies across all business segments.</p><p>1. Migration brings Co. strengthened and deepened customer relationships and presents Co. with up and cross-sell opportunities in longer term.</p><p>1. Today, this has significant impact on revenue trends.</p><p>3. Saw all major revenue buckets performed in line with previous quarters, except for customized solutions.</p><p>1. Traditionally, there was positive impact on revenues from customized work in 4Q, but shift to more standardized solutions have [shaved off seasonal peak].</p><p>4. 2016 business revenues down 7.6%.</p><p>1. Small improvement in trend vs. 2015 when revenue was down 8.6%.</p><p>5. SME:</p><p>1. Saw migrations to integrated service KPN1 accelerating to 27,000 additional multi play seats; more than twice the number of additions in [3Q].</p><p>2. Mobile base remained relatively stable throughout year.</p><p>3. When looking at revenue breakdown from product view, sees customers migrating from SME mobile-only services to SME multi play and to large enterprises and corporate integrated services.</p><p>4. Sees continued price pressure in mobile market.</p><p>5. In business mobile, has clear focus on value driven by high-quality network and service.</p><p>1. Will not necessarily chase every tender in market available.</p><p>6. Large enterprises &amp; corporate segment:</p><p>1. Sees impact of migrations.</p><p>2. Revenues from network and IT services declined 11% YonY as customers are rationalizing and migrating away from legacy network services to new technologies.</p><p>1. Migrated from legacy VPN network to fully cloud-controlled software defined network.</p><p>3. Flexible and scalable solution Co. offers can be adjusted to customer requirements.</p><p>4. Following migration, customer will pay for actual network capacity use, instead of flat fee.</p><p>1. For Co., this presents opportunity to increase share of wallet for such customer.</p><p>5. Sees shift to more standardized solutions.</p><p>6. Sees sharp growth in KPN1 seats in large enterprise segment.</p><p>7. Comforted by decent pickup in order intake with large orders from several Dutch leading organizations.</p><p>7. Business:</p><p>1. Further strengthening market position along three main routes.</p><p>1. Further strengthening infrastructure by deploying similar hybrid access strategy as Co. uses in consumer.</p><p>2. Launched own managed hybrid cloud service; wants to be trusted partner with carrier and cloud-neutral colocation services.</p><p>3. Expanding scale and capabilities in growth areas by selective acquisitions like DearBytes acquisition, which strengthens Co.'s market-leading security proposition.</p><p>2. Financial performance illustrates impact of migrations away from traditional services; positive impact of up and cross-sell through integrated solutions takes time.</p><p>3. With clients moving to more standardized products, has opportunity to significantly reduce portfolio and simplify organization.</p><p>4. Reduced indirect costs 5.1% in 2016.</p><p>1. Further reducing cost base in business will be one main focus point in 2017.</p><p>1. Already implemented necessary actions to execute on this.</p><p>5. Sees Simplification efforts lead to improving quality at lower cost level.</p><p>6. NPS in business segment improved to minus 3 vs. minus 10 last year.</p><p>2016 Financials (J.K.J.)</p><p>1. 4Q16 Results:</p><p>1. Progress Co. is making to simplify operating model and expand network, which is one main driver for expense reduction.</p><p>2. Revenue trends improved further during 4Q16 with adjusted revenues for Netherlands down 1.9% YonY vs. minus 2.4% for full-year 2016.</p><p>3. Business remains challenging, but sees strong development in consumer driven by clear focus on convergence and high value customers.</p><p>4. Wholesale revenues benefited mainly from take-up of VULA services in fixed and increased data usage in mobile.</p><p>5. Regardless of lower revenues, posted solid growth in adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>6. Cost of goods and services improved nicely due to lower SAC/SRC resulting from relatively low-end of contract base.</p><p>7. Personnel expense lower YonY mainly due to strong reduction of external personnel.</p><p>8. IT/TI expenses increased marginally YonY due to customer-driven investments from higher order intake in business.</p><p>9. Other OpEx was lower mainly due to less marketing and communication, reduced housing expenses and lower costs related to billing and collection.</p><p>2. Results:</p><p>1. Sees reductions across all cost buckets, which is more than compensating for 2.4% decline in revenues.</p><p>1. Personnel expenses down 4.9%, IT/TI costs 2.6% lower and other OpEx decreased 13% YonY.</p><p>1. Simplification program brings cost savings and higher quality of service.</p><p>2. More efficient IT platforms enable Co. to enrich and unify customer experience, while Co. can turn off legacy systems and reduce personnel.</p><p>1. Improved billing system and simplified invoices have led to increased customer satisfaction and lower churn.</p><p>1. Debt enables Co. to reduce marketing expenses.</p><p>3. As Co. starts second wave of Simplification program, sees sufficient scope for further quality improvements in processes.</p><p>1. These should lead to further reduced spend level.</p><p>3. Operating Model Change:</p><p>1. First wave of Simplification program persisted of creating digital and uniform omni-channel (inaudible) system for consumer segment, allowing Co. to decommission legacy systems.</p><p>2. In fixed, decommissioned 20 IT systems; in mobile, consolidating 40 different IT systems.</p><p>1. Significant simplification of IT brings Co. substantially faster time-to-market, while saving money.</p><p>3. Second wave of program consists of similar IT integration for business segment.</p><p>4. Will start to simplify network interaction layer.</p><p>1. Expects further quality improvements for customers.</p><p>5. At first, must account for additional investments and restructuring charges.</p><p>6. Ended first wave of Simplification program ahead of target.</p><p>7. Realized EUR460m in run-rate savings at year end, which is well above original target of EUR300m.</p><p>1. Second wave is continuing seamlessly and will realize annual run rate savings of at least EUR300m by 2019-end.</p><p>4. Network:</p><p>1. Has been virtualizing legacy networks and has removed around 45% of installed base of 2010.</p><p>2. In coming years, will complete all IP transformation by modernizing Co.'s remaining legacy networks like PSTN and all [transformation techniques like SDH].</p><p>3. Consolidating transport and IP core networks.</p><p>4. Already integrating backbone network for fixed and mobile access.</p><p>1. Only final part of network is either fixed or mobile.</p><p>2. Result is all-integrated and largely fiberized network to-the-home, to-the-curb, to the business park or to-the-mobile site.</p><p>5. Decentralizing content at 161 Metro Core locations.</p><p>1. As customers are shifting to more personalized and on-demand TV consumption, this leads to strong growth of traffic volumes in core network.</p><p>1. With content delivery network storing data closer to customer, will result in enhanced customer experience through higher video quality and faster responsiveness.</p><p>6. Change network to prepare for fertilization:</p><p>1. Network fertilization will bring lots of benefits.</p><p>2. As operator, fertilization will enable Co. to run multiple services on same generic hardware.</p><p>1. Capacity will be used and handled much more efficiently at lower costs.</p><p>3. Furthermore, it will be easier to scale network to cope with rapid traffic growth.</p><p>5. Access Network:</p><p>1. Currently, almost 80% of Dutch households have fiber connection to-the-home or to-the-curb.</p><p>2. Approx. half of Co.'s customers are within roughly 300 meters over street cabinets, while roughly 80% is within 600 meters.</p><p>1.

Thank you. I've got three questions, please, on the business market. The first one is, since you are losing a bit of market share in mobile in business, I just wanted to get your view there who is taking share, what's happening.</p><p>The second question is on the slight deterioration we saw in Q4 from customized solutions. I just wanted to ask you what's happening exactly there and is it a one-off or should we expect more of that to -- in 2017?</p><p>And my last question, obviously related to a big profit warning from one of your peer in enterprise blaming the public sector. I just wanted to get your view on the public sector in the Netherlands. Is it declining faster than the private corporate markets or is it declining more than 8% year on year? Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND CEO, KONINKLIJKE KPN NV: Okay. Frank will take the first and third question and Jan Kees the second one. Frank, will you start?</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST, CCO, KONINKLIJKE KPN NV: Yes. Good afternoon. On the market share, mobile, what we see obviously is there's quite some price pressure in the market there. Secondly, we move quite a few into multi-play propositions from single-player wireless. The -- and as I said, the price pressure in the market, you see some shift.</p><p>On the public sector, what -- that was the third question. On the public sector, we see that the revenues have been stable in 2016. And actually we haven't seen much movement there, nor do we expect it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. Are you losing market share in business or mobile or is the market share flat and it's just pricing pressure?</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: It's predominantly pricing pressure on the moment, where you see that some of the competitors are going in with very low pricing, which puts everything under pressure, predominantly in the large enterprise and corporate segment.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Jan Kees, will you take the second question about deterioration of customized solutions in the fourth quarter.</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER, CFO, KONINKLIJKE KPN NV: Yes. So for several years already we see that -- well, traditionally, in Q4 we always have, even also now this quarter, a positive impact in Q4 on revenue coming from customized solutions because that has a pattern that tends to be larger to revenue in Q4 customized solutions. However, there is a trend, which you also saw in Q4 2015 already, that is less customized solutions and more a shift to standardized products.</p><p>So overall, we see a shift from customized solutions to standardized products. So whilst there is still a slight positive impact of customized solutions in absolute terms in the fourth quarter comparing Q4 2016 to Q4 2015, we have a negative impact because customized solutions are less, and more standardized solutions, and standardized solutions have a more gradual pattern throughout the year. But also in Q4 2015 you already also saw that same impact compared to Q4 2014.</p><p>So it's a trend, a trend which we'll also see probably in Q4 2017, a more gradual approach throughout the year because there's more an uptake of standardized solutions and less customized solutions.</p><p>JOSH MILLS, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Hi there. It's Josh Mills at Goldman Sachs. I've got two questions, the first to follow up on the B2B point. So compared to your guidance at the Capital Markets Day for stabilization in B2B revenues, how are the trends that you're seeing at the moment comparing to your initial expectations?</p><p>And second to that, when you as a management team look at that guidance and forecast that stabilization, are the metrics that you focus more on related to the large enterprise order book, which clearly we don't have as much information on, or is it something you can really model out with the multi-play improvements that we can see?</p><p>The second point, second question rather, would be on cost cutting. So your three-year simplification guidance of EUR300 million implies that there is a lower cost opportunity now than there was three years ago. Is that fair to say? Are there other opportunities? And how confident are you in being able to exceed that EUR300 million target?</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Will you take the first question about the trend?</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: Yes. So in March 2016 at the Capital Markets Day we said in a three-to-five-year time, the medium term, we expect revenue inflection in business, in business-to-business market. Plotting the current trends, that could be easily -- well, according to our expectations because we see underlying also corrected, for example the customized solutions, as I just mentioned. Underlying, we see an improving of the trend, so there's less decline also in 2016 in business compared to 2015.</p><p>So the -- and also, very importantly, everything that we are doing in business in converged multi-play and also our growth in multi-play, in Q4 we see two times as much multi-play net adds in KPN One than in Q3, for example. So that's a doubling of the number of KPN One customers. We see demand in cloud and securities also -- security taking up.</p><p>So -- and also looking at the examples, but also looking at the revenue trend, it's safe to say that this is compatible with our earlier given indication of revenue inflection of three to five years, yes, counting from March 2016.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Jan Kees, will you take --?</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: Frank.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Frank. Yes, sorry.</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: No problem. Yes, if you look at the metrics, obviously, we're steering very closely on lines. Jan Kees mentioned already the seats we have in the SME market. In the large enterprise and corporate market, you look at the order intake and at the funnel. Order intake was up 14% in -- last year. Clearly, we have some really aggressive targets for the salesforce for this coming years -- for this coming year.</p><p>And secondly, what you do is you look at the funnel, so on a weekly basis I review the funnel with the team. You look at the quality of the funnel, you look at what's in there. Is it telco business, IT business? Is the right focus there? You look at the lead times on the funnel. And from that -- obviously, that feeds the order intake, and from that you gain confidence that the guidance we've given in the Capital Markets Day is certainly possible.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Joost, will you take the question about the EUR300 million?</p><p>JOOST FARWERCK, COO, KONINKLIJKE KPN NV: Yes. So three years ago we started our first wave in the simplification program. We guided, three years ago, a spend reduction of EUR300 million. During the process, we accelerated the simplification and spend reduction, so we moved up finally this [close] the spend reduction of EUR450 million and we ended the year above that on EUR460 million. So now, we are facing the next three years in simplification. Again, we launched a start of spend reduction of EUR300 million at least. And of course, we aim to again accelerate this program and if we can find more benefits, we will for sure grab them.</p><p>But we start like we started three years ago with the ambition of a new program, or not a new program but the next wave in a program. Again, we go for EUR300 million and every now and then we give you an update.</p><p>POLO TANG, ANALYST, UBS: Hi. It's Polo Tang from UBS. I just have three different questions. The first one is just in terms of your equity free cash flow guidance for this year. You've guided towards growing equity free cash flow but is there any reason why you didn't give a range? And are you comfortable that you can meet consensus expectations of around about EUR740 million for this year?</p><p>The second question is really about the competitive environment mainly in consumer. Can you maybe give some color in terms of what you're seeing in terms of both fixed and mobile? And can you comment in terms of T-Mobile? They appear to be a bit aggressive in terms of their unlimited data offer.</p><p>And my final question is really just in terms of how we should think about the levers of growth for the consumer business, because your KPIs in terms of broadband net adds, mobile net adds have been a bit softer in recent quarters. So is the level of growth mainly in terms of ARPU and pricing or should we think about it as both volume in terms of net adds and pricing?</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Jan K, so you start with answering the question on the free cash flow guidance.</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: Yes, we are very confident about growing free cash flow, feel very strong about it. We see, of course, about EUR100 million less interest spend, we see CapEx coming down approximately EUR50 million net. Even with the initial startup phase of the new simplification program and CapEx spend to that.</p><p>Also in 2016, we had a tax benefit cash, whilst in 2017 we expect to pay around EUR25 million EUR30 million cash tax. But taking all that into account we still are very confident in growing free cash flow. And we do not feel uncomfortable for any consensus that I've seen on free cash flow.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Frank, will you take the second and third question?</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: Yes. So the second question was on the competitive environment in fixed and mobile. They're both slightly different I may add. In fixed what we obviously have done the last year is we've put a good price increase through in the market of EUR2.50. And despite that, we've seen growth in both broadband and ITV customers. At the same time, we also refrained from heavy discounting in the last year.</p><p>Unfortunately, the competitors didn't quite follow. We saw that Ziggo for example, did not put a serious price increase through. And they have been very aggressive in the below the line promotions. If you were a TV customer, they would add a broadband line for EUR10 for example. They have a below the line offer to six-months discount in order to get to some of their numbers. We wanted to refrain from that.</p><p>At the same time, we've seen Vodafone being extremely aggressive and they had an offer out there for 12 months for EUR21, And clearly that takes away a little bit of the bottom end of the market from that perspective. And we've been really trying to focus on the converged. We've tried to focus on high value. And even the commercial focus for Telfort, for example, was mainly driven around getting fixed and mobile customers in that base.</p><p>If you look at the [MPS] and you look at the satisfaction in both Telfort access for all as well as KPN that is clearly working. Also, the churn is very low at below 5%.</p><p>If you look at the mobile market most of the battle still is in the bottom end, so you're talking about EUR10 a month for a gig, some are offering that for even less. And the strategy we have, which I think has showed to be very good is to play with the four brands we have, or in mobile the three brands we have, and make sure that we have a value play in there.</p><p>We did 92,000 net adds over the year of which 157,000 were KPN subs. And what we do in the KPN subs is we try to steer the customers towards higher bundles with higher values. And that is working very well.</p><p>Also, because we see that two things happening there it locks them in -- well it makes it easier for them to make that step to become also a fixed customer. The second thing we see is that a lot of fixed customers are now bringing in second and third SIMs into their fixed mobile offering. So I think we are very well positioned in the mobile market as well.</p><p>If you look at T-Mobile, I think which was your last comment if you look at T-Mobile unlimited package, yes, at the end of the day that is for a SIM-only at a very high price point of EUR35. We see that the majority of our customers and the majority of our net adds are in the five and one gig bundles. If you are a Compleet, customer you get automatic doubling of your data so you go to two and 10. The average usage at the moment, although it's increasing, I think it's increased 50% versus last year, but the average usage is about 2.1 gig. I think there is plenty of room to grow for people.</p><p>And I think the interesting thing is in the Netherlands is that, and that's what our research confirms, is that people don't want to pay for something they don't use. So it's paying EUR35 for something you're never going to use in a long time I think is something we don't necessarily have the offer right now, our largest bundle is 10 gig. And that is very competitively priced. And if you're, again if you're a Compleet customer that's 20 gig.</p><p>So I think we are very well positioned there in that market with the current data bundles we offer. Back in September, we both included EU roaming into the offer and we made sure that all our offerings were handset credit legislation proof.</p><p>That was a long answer but --.</p><p>KEVAL KHIROYA, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks. Keval Khiroya from Deutsche Bank. Could I ask a question on the IT NTI OpEx base? So in Q3 we saw quite a sharp production given the IT simplification. But in Q4, as you mentioned, you saw a bit of an increase in that cost line. Can you talk a little bit about what drove that given I thought you would have seen further savings there? And how should we think about this line going into 2017? Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Jan Kees?</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: Yes, so underlying we still see a declining trend also in the ITTI costs that's going forward, that's moving forward also in -- going in 2017 we see the same. But there is also now somewhat more cost made related to revenue for large customers that we started in Q4 so there's some cost related to -- revenue cost related in Q4. But underlying looking at the cost of running the Company, we see also a decline in Q4.</p><p>FREDERIC BOULAN, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Good afternoon. Frederic Boulan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. A quick question on your CapEx outlook. So if I look at your guidance for 2017 of EUR1.15 billion still puts you pretty high versus your mid-term outlook you presented in March of 15%, 17%. So could you explain a little bit the path for CapEx in the next three/four years? In particular, around your tech choices on the high-speed broadband. You talked about it a little bit but it seems there's a bit more fiber coming up in the mix. So where should we see that CapEx line developing in the next years? Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Joost, will you take this question?</p><p>JOOST FARWERCK: Yes, so indeed we invested heavily compared to others over the previous years. As you know, we invested in the transition of our core networks. Like Eelco and Jan Kees already highlighted, we built the core network and the decentralized content delivery network. We did a lot in access networks, covering 80% of the Netherlands on fiber either to the home or to the curb, 80% of our mobile sites are on fiber. So that's a lot of investment. And for the coming years this CapEx will go down.</p><p>Having said that, we will still invest in the quality and transition of our company. So first in the simplification we are focusing on rebuilding our operating support systems and customer process support systems on the B2B side. That's hand-in-hand with cost reductions, but we have to invest in the simplification over there.</p><p>Of course, we will always very carefully look at monetizing our access networks. So now we build this new network every mobile site is on the radar screen and every street cabinet is more or less on the radar screen to see where we can further upgrade, where to invest with respect to the value in the country.</p><p>Of course, there is customer CapEx related to the new business we want to do on the B2B and consumer side. So, all in all, we see the trend of CapEx moving down, having said that, we will keep on investing in the growth and the simplification of our company.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Given Joost's explanation we are confident that we will meet the guidance we had given at the Capital Markets Day of a 15% to 17% range for CapEx over sales in the medium-term. So that's -- well given what we know today and given what we have put in place for our long-term CapEx planning still our guidance.</p><p>GUY PEDDY, ANALYST, MACQUARIE: Hi. It's Guy Peddy from Macquarie. One quick question going back to the business segment, in your -- Eelco, when you stood up you mentioned that in the consumer side actually TV was a point of differential in your product offering. Do you have any points of differential in the business segment? Because my fear is, I've been following KPN for nearly two decades now for my sins; the Dutch market is always competitive. I'm always fearful that when you use the word standardization the next word you're going to use is commoditization i.e. we don't get any pricing power. So can you give us what you're feeling is so we don't end up in that constant spiral down.</p><p>And secondly, on your cash flow outlook that you've just suggested there you're already delivering about 11% free cash flow margin on your revenues, which is very high. So to grow that, bearing in mind you're not going to grow any revenues next year, by definition you're look at continually to improving your free cash flow margin. But I think from a big picture perspective to grow free cash flow margin from an 11% number does seem a real challenge in the mid-term, because that just implies you're going to make super-normal returns. Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: I'll take the first question. Yes, the KPN One product for large enterprise and SME, which gives us the opportunity to offer integrated services fixed, mobile, broadband, voice, and IT services, cloud services, workplaces. And we believe that we will see a similar impact in the business market of this product as we have seen of the integrated product in the consumer market.</p><p>And also, looking at, well, first results of KPN One, the customers we have connected already in the beginning of the KPN One, we see really higher ARPUs on a month-to-month base given this easily cross and up-sell opportunity we have. So we are really confident that this will be one of the pillars of our transition in the business market.</p><p>Jan K, so you take the free cash flow question?</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: Yes. Again, looking at the moving parts in free cash flow, it's very important to note that [we will] break down interest cost, interest spent again EUR100 million lower this year. CapEx comes down approximately at least EUR50 million this year.</p><p>Tax, whilst compared to last year that was because we had a tax benefit in 2016, the delta is still not positive but still we have sizeable DTA of almost EUR1.1 billion. So for the next coming years we do not pay cash taxes or very, very few in the region of -- probably somewhere EUR25 million EUR30 million or something like that so few cash taxes out.</p><p>And then EBITDA margin also starts to improve, as we also indicated on the Capital Markets Day that we see at least 300 basis points in a few years' time EBITDA margins to improve.</p><p>So with an improving EBITDA margin now also seeing proof points, interest spend, CapEx coming down and also coming down even further for the medium-term, as already indicated by Joost and Eelco, towards the 15% to 17% ballpark figure over sales, we are confident that we can grow free cash flow and thus also, yes, free cash flow margin if you want to look at it that way, absolutely.</p><p>LUIGI MINERVA, ANALYST, HSBC: Good afternoon. It's Luigi Minerva from HSBC. One question about the consumer EBITDA performance, which was, I think, particularly good in this quarter. If you can give us a bit more color on what has driven it and whether we can extrapolate that performance.</p><p>And second question is more a medium-term one on network virtualization what that implies in terms of CapEx and whether you believe that increasing the software component in your network takes you to a stage where you risk giving up some control on your network towards the big tech companies like, say Google just to mention a name. Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Frank, will you take the first question about the consumer EBITDA and Joost, you about the network virtualization, any potential impact.</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: Yes, on the consumer EBITDA basically that is a result of the higher base -- of the base growth and the higher base including the price increases we've put through, so we've created value there. But at the same time, we've been very disciplined on costs. There was a little bit less SAC costs because of lower end of contract base, but also our market costs and payroll costs were lower in the last quarter due to some of the actions we've taken earlier in the year and that has helped improve the performance there.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Joost on the network virtualization.</p><p>JOOST FARWERCK: Yes. So in the medium term indeed we are moving and we are currently building this by the way to a more software defined network approach, and we are virtualizing network functions. So that means that we run our network more from a centralized point of view from a software point of view instead of moving in hardware all the time.</p><p>So your question was are you more dependent on vendors when you move to a virtualized network. I would say the opposite is true. Today the traditional way of upgrading your network is moving more hardware in the country. And there's always one or two vendors at the next supporting you there. While moving to a more virtualized environment, as we are constructing today, gives us the opportunity to move it -- to run it in firstly in a far more efficient way. And secondly, we have the options between more partners than we have today and that's what we are currently making decisions on and doing proof of concepts in the field.</p><p>ULRICH RATHE, ANALYST, JEFFERIES: Ulrich Rathe, Jefferies. I have two questions, actually two and half. The first one is on the B2B order intake. That looks rather encouraging. I'm just wondering would you be able to share book to bill. Is that still below 1? Also what percentage of revenues is actually caught by orders? I suppose there are some buckets that don't come through orders but come in other ways.</p><p>And also is there an element in this order intake uplift from this shift that you talked about from SME to large enterprise? I think you talked about some revenue shifts there because of the way your products work. That was my first question.</p><p>And the second question is more a clarification on the VAT issues going back and forth in terms of you and your trends in the consumer business. Do you have any visibility what might happen in 2017 or even just in the first quarter? Is there more of that sort of stuff coming based on the conversations you are having with the tax authorities?</p><p>And then my last one, any news on the MTR process? Is that coming through this year? And do you have any sense of where that might end up and what it might cost you if any? Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Okay, Frank, will you take the first question, Jan Kees, the second one and, Joost, the third one.</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: Yes, so the order intake is encouraging as you said so we are quite pleased with that. Obviously, order intake is for revenues contracted for the next two to three years and is obviously mainly for the LE and corporate market. In SME it is predominantly the [KPN One] machine, which we have turned on and moving customers towards.</p><p>If you look at the split between telco and IT obviously, we are very focused on driving more IT revenue. Certainly, the new order intake the focus is very much on IT whereas at the same time clearly, we want to maintain existing customers and maintain their telephony, the fixed so we renew that business as well.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Jan Kees on VAT?</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: Yes, as to the VAT benefit that changed throughout recent years the through the tax administration, tax regulations. So of course, there's always uncertainty attached to that. For this quarter, we expect the same approach as we have seen in recent quarters, also -- so also to record the benefit. But there are ongoing discussions with the tax authority about this, and there is always discussion about -- because it is very complex situation. But for now, we are recording the benefit, also looking forward in this first quarter.</p><p>How this can change in the future? Well, I know because of my background as former Finance Minister there is nothing as uncertain as taxation, so that's difficult to assess. But for now looking at what's more likely than not we record the benefit also in this quarter.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Joost, progress on the MTR.</p><p>JOOST FARWERCK: On MTR and FTR by the way in the Netherlands our regulator drafted a decision be implemented May 1 this year. We are now in a so-called consultation phase. That means that we and the other players in the markets can get feedback on what we think about the process and how this decision is built up.</p><p>So we have -- we are working on that answer and we will send it to our regulator this week and then we will discuss the outcome of what we think they think. But it's their ambition to implement it late this year.</p><p>And maybe to add to that, the impact of the decision was already in our plans for a long time. So we anticipated on the outcome of the decision of our regulator for the coming years.</p><p>USMAN GHAZI, ANALYST, BERENBERG: Hi. It's Usman from Berenberg. I had three questions please. The first question was just on mobile pricing again. We recently noticed Vodafone with pretty aggressive 50% off promotions, at least on their website I don't know what it's like in the offline channels but on the website, you see 50% off handsets, 50% off SIM-only. Are you seeing them becoming more aggressive or reacting to T-Mobile at all?</p><p>The next question was just on business mobile. Is this something new where you've seen competition pick up in the fourth quarter in business mobile for pricing or is this just ongoing trend that you've been seeing?</p><p>My third question was on the SAC and SRCs I think you made a comment that part of the benefit in the COGS that you saw in Q4 was because SAC and SRCs were lower in absolute terms. I know that you were in the middle of a big renewal volume cycle in 2016. This is that kind of -- has that peaked? Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Frank will take the first two questions and Jan Kees the third one about the SAC (inaudible).</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: On the mobile pricing I think there's a couple of things happening, that's why the market is moving. Per January 1 was new legislation, which is the handset credit model. Basically, with the handset credit model there's a couple of things you need to do in order to ensure that you have the right proposition, which is legal. We implemented those in September because we wanted to be ahead of the market. And I think the other ones are now starting to follow.</p><p>But the handset -- the credit model basically what it does is that you need to give -- you need to be -- it gives transparency to the customer. You need to ensure that the cost of the device is given to the customer without any interest. And you can't cross-subsidize anymore. So you can't cross-subsidize with a lot of SAC the devices. So the alternative there is to move your pricing on the actual bundle a little bit.</p><p>The second thing, which is happening in the legislation there is that any credits above EUR250 need to be registered at the Credit Registration Bureau. For a customer, that can have negative impact because it will limit their borrowing power for mortgages and anything else because it now becomes part of your overall credit profile.</p><p>So there's a couple of things I think happening. First of all, we believe that less people will take more expensive devices and less people will be willing to borrow more than EUR250. So they either need to pay more upfront or they will keep their devices longer and not go into an automatic cycle of replacement every two years.</p><p>So I think there's a couple of different things in that dynamic, which are going to change. And what you will see is that because you can't cross-subsidize devices anymore, operators will have to change the pricing in their bundles.</p><p>However, in the legislation or what you need to make sure is that your SIM-only pricing on the bundle is equal to your pricing when you link it to a handset. And that again, the transparency will have a few of the operators I think thinking and scrambling. We have been ready for this since September, so the effects of this are fully incorporated in the fourth quarter and I think we are in a very strong position to benefit there.</p><p>Your second question was around the mobile pricing in the business market. I don't think we've seen any unusual trends peaking in the fourth quarter. I think it's just that it's an ongoing repricing in the mobile -- I the business market specially in large enterprise and corporate. SME I don't think we see the effects as much; it's just that we had quite a few of the contracts coming up in the fourth quarter.</p><p>And I think there were one or two questions.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Yes, Jan Kees.</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: So, yes, the absolute level of SRC declined because we were at the bottom of a cycle of retention. So that's why we have less retention costs. So the end of contract cycle was lower in Q4 2016 compared to Q4 2015. That explains the absolute lower levels of SAC/SRC.</p><p>However, it's good to note that we do have in Q4 we have noted a higher SAC/SRC level per sub. But that also has a silver lining because that is a result of the higher value we took in. We took in 33,000 net adds on KPN brand minus 14,000 on our [challenging] brands so net plus 19,000 net adds.</p><p>But an important shift in customer lifetime value and even ARPU level, so if you're looking at ARPU, the committed ARPU has grown by EUR1 per month. So that's actually a good thing. That is the explanation of a higher SAC/SRC per sub. But because of the end of contract cycle, the total level is down compared to Q4 2015.</p><p>WOUTER STAMMEIJER, SENIOR IR OFFICER, KONINKLIJKE KPN NV: Any more questions? No. Okay, then we would like to thank you very much for coming and have a good day and evening.

Starting with the expenses, I think the margin guidance was a nice surprise relative to what you've said before. Could you walk through the puts and takes a little bit more, how should we think about what's driving the upside?</p><p>Is it the way you've ended in terms of being soft on hiring this year? What about legal expenses that might be coming down post the settlement? And maybe any color on variable compensation, how we should be expecting there for the year. Thank you.</p><p>LINDA HUBER, EVP AND CFO, MOODY'S CORP: Hey, Alex. Glad you're happy, and I have a couple of points to make about that. We did do better in 2016 due to some pretty rigorous expense control measures that we took back in February of last year. So we did better at the conclusion of 2016 even than we had expected.</p><p>Those controls will continue going into 2017. So we feel pretty good about guiding to approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion.</p><p>Some of that does come from saving some legal costs, but the majority is what we're doing in terms of hiring. We have slowed the pace of hiring for the corporation.</p><p>MA continues to move a little bit faster than the rating agency and shared services. Looking at 2016, over 2015, MIS is actually down in headcount, and shared services is approximately flat. All those things have helped us, just with good general housekeeping and some discipline.</p><p>In terms of incentive compensation, let me find the right page here and we'll talk about that. As what sometimes happens, we noticed that in the fourth quarter, because our performance was a good deal stronger in 2016, Alex. The quarters had gone in 2016 for incentive compensation about $32 million, $35 million, $42 million, and then, as sometimes happens, the fourth quarter was $59.6 million in incentive compensation.</p><p>For 2017, probably the right thing to model there is somewhere between $40 million and $45 million per quarter of incentive compensation. And does that hit most of what you wanted?</p><p>ALEX KRAMM: I think that got everything. Secondly, similar on cash flow, I guess, how should we be thinking about the settlement, and how you will actually end up paying for that, and the timing of all of that? If you can run through the buybacks, are those going to be more third quarter or fourth quarter?</p><p>How about, are you going to draw on the revolver or the commercial paper program? What's the interest rate we should be thinking about? I don't think you guided on interest expense.</p><p>Just think about, you have a lot of cash overseas. You generate decent cash here, but maybe not enough, so how should we be thinking about that?</p><p>Lastly, related to that, you how do you think about leverage in general? If you need to raise a little bit more debt for this, I think you're hitting some of your initial targets, are those targets changing? How do you think about being a rated Company yourself?</p><p>Anything we should be thinking about here. Thank you.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Okay. Alex, that's about all the questions.</p><p>Let me try to start with the DOJ settlement. So the happy news is we're done. Or we're just about done.</p><p>The payments have been made. Those were largely completed. And the way we did that was cash on hand, US cash on hand.</p><p>You'll recall back in 2016, we reduced share repurchase guidance from $1 billion to $750 million. And then also, for those who have within paying close attention, we have re-entered the commercial paper market. We have about $600 million of commercial paper outstanding right now, about an average maturity of 60 days, and we're paying about 1.2% on that commercial paper.</p><p>So we're very happy with the receptivity of the commercial paper markets, and that's how we have financed the payment of the settlement. So again, that's done. Going forward, we've guided to</p><p>$500 million of share repurchase for the rest of the year.</p><p>That's subject to many things, as we've discussed already, but some of it is how cash flow comes in for the year for the Company. So we'll see. As we announced, the settlement -- one of the other rating agencies that looked at us did provide a little bit more leverage room for us under its measure, which is now 1.5 to 2 times, rather than the 1.5 times that you had seen before.</p><p>However, with very much like our rating category that we have right now, and we don't like to run right up to the edge of our leverage level. We feel that we have some dry powder, we're happy about that. We have at least $500 million of dry powder, something like that, as we look at what we might want to do for 2017.</p><p>So we like the leverage levels. We have a bit of room. Share repurchase about $500 million, and again, we just want to be thoughtful, given everything that we've just had to deal with, and we don't like to be too close to the edge in terms of the leverage levels.</p><p>I don't know if Ray had anything else he wanted to add. I think that's of most of it.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL, PRESIDENT AND CEO, MOODY'S CORP: I want to underscore both -- this is implied both in the question, and then addressed directly by Linda's answer. Between our cash on hand and our various borrowing options, we feel we have quite a bit of flexibility. And so we are going to be making decisions according to market conditions as we go through the year, and as I imagine you would expect, we're going to pay close attention to what we think are the best opportunities.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Alex, one final point which may not have been taken into account by everyone looking at their models. We did do some financing in 2016. So you'll see in 2017 the roll-forward effect of that interest expense.</p><p>Secondly, we do have the $600 million of CP, and we are considering the term market at this time. And we'll see what we decide to do about that.</p><p>But, again, if we take that 1.2% rate we're paying for the CP and we term that out, I think it would be fair to say that we would expect that, that interest expense would be a little bit heavier. So we're considering that right now, and that's one of the reasons why everything doesn't flow fully down to EPS.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM: Very helpful, as usual. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.</p><p>JOSEPH FORESI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Hi. My first question is, just any thoughts on issuance given the new administration, I'm sure you're predicting that one. What could that do to your current projections, any internal scenarios you're setting up for.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Joe, what we'll do, I'll go through what we usually do regarding our views that we're hearing from the investment banks, and then we have an exciting new feature. Rob Fauber is going to add a little bit of color in terms of what the rating agency is noting in the marketplace.</p><p>So starting with the US view and again, this is coming from the investment banks, and it's an averaging of what we're hearing from the different banks. Investment grade right now is running very, very strong. January was $200 billion in issuance -- a strong month is</p><p>$100 billion.</p><p>This is record January supply. Financials have dominated, as well as significant issuance from TMT companies. For the year, we're looking at about $1.2 billion of US investment grade issuance. That's about flat year-over-year.</p><p>The pipeline is robust as corporates exit their blackout periods and potentially look to get ahead of Fed rate hikes later in the year, which might be June, could be March, and then potentially again toward the end of the year.</p><p>We note that many issuers were hearing from the banks prefunded in favorable 2016 issuance environment. That might serve as a bit of an offset to 2017. And we're thinking about the M&amp;A pipeline, which is bouncing around a bit.</p><p>For US high yield, $35 billion issued so far, $250 billion expected for the year, which is up 5% year-over-year, 2017 has started on a positive tone. Large cash inflows to high yield, recovering commodity prices and attractive yields are very constructive. More constructive default scenarios and energy price outlooks are helping with the backdrop, and we think that will support 2017 high yield bond issuance.</p><p>Leverage loans so far $120 billion. That is a torrid pace. $400 billion expected this year.</p><p>The year is expected to be down 15% year-over-year. But for right now, stability in the macro backdrop is aiding the leverage loan market with potential interest rate increases.</p><p>The floating rate view is preferred for investors, and we continue to have CLO formation, and that will support leveraged loan activity. Not enough, though, to surpass the elevated levels of 2016.</p><p>Now moving to Europe. What we've heard from the banks investment grade in Europe, volumes were higher than usual in January as issuers took advantage of the good conditions and low rates. The ECB and Bank of England continue to buy bonds and support the market, and there's a strong pipeline as issuers look to go to market ahead of key political events in Europe and potential ECB tapering.</p><p>We're about two months away from the French election; that's the first major event. High yield in Europe and the leveraged loan market remain in robust shape. ECB bond buying has indirectly supported the high-yield market and should help maintain rates at all-time lows.</p><p>Macroeconomic and geopolitical risks continue to be a key focus, though, in Europe, particularly for the speculative grade market. And now I'll invite Rob to make any further comments that he might want to offer.</p><p>ROB FAUBER, PRESIDENT, MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, MOODY'S CORP: Linda, that was pretty thorough. I don't have too much to add to that. I might just talk about a little bit of the upsides and downsides in general to you how we're thinking about issuance.</p><p>Certainly, higher economic growth leading to more capital investment and in turn debt financing would be a positive. Some sort of infrastructure stimulus, either privately funded or in the municipal market. More constructive M&amp;A environment.</p><p>Certainly, Linda touched on that. And I think importantly, a pull forward of these 2019 to 2021 maturity walls. We think we're seeing some pull forward now, but if we see more pull forward, that could provide some upside.</p><p>Things we're thinking about as potential headwinds, I think you mentioned potentially unfavorable tax changes. There's been a lot of discussion around that, around corporate interests, tax deductibility, repatriation of foreign cash. Interestingly, we did see in January some very large issuance from some big tech players who have large cash balances offshore.</p><p>And we're looking at trade developments that could disrupt markets, stall investment. Obviously watching the election calendar in the EU. Strengthening of the US dollar would also be something that would have an impact on us as well.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Not that we're supposed to ask the questions, but Rob, you had mentioned one of the pieces of research we released last week on the refinancing law.</p><p>ROB FAUBER: I don't want to confuse people, because I don't have the global numbers handy, but we just put out some research last week. I know in regards to the US spec rate maturity wall, we're looking at the five-year maturity wall is now over $1 trillion for the first time. That's up about $100 billion from the study this time last year.</p><p>JOSEPH FORESI: Got it. So, any color, though, on real-time, what the clients are telling you given the new administration? Are you seeing a wait-and-see approach or any pull forwards? I'm just wondering if there's anything outside of what you laid up from the issuance side of things.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: No, this is Ray. Obviously, conditions were very strong in January, and the markets remain active in February. We really don't expect to see the January kind of numbers in the loan and high yield sectors continue at that pace, but market conditions remain good.</p><p>All of that indicates that issuers are taking advantage of a tight-spread environment. They may be moving ahead of uncertainty later in this year, whether it's policy uncertainty here in the US or the potential implications of unexpected outcomes in the European elections. So the pull forward is, I think, both a recognition of good market conditions and potential uncertainties later in the year.</p><p>JOSEPH FORESI: Okay. And then the last one from me.</p><p>On the regulatory side we've heard about some repeal, maybe, at some large institutions. Just wondering if you have any thoughts about that impact on your Analytics practice? Thanks.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: I'll let Mark comment on how they're thinking about that, and I'll add any color if appropriate.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT MOODY'S ANALYTICS, MOODY'S CORP: I'd say that we're not seeing any meaningful impact to any of the talk about pullback on banking regulation, for example. We're still seeing very good demand for our products, for regulatory requirement as well as some of the accounting rule changes that are coming through, both IFRS 9 and the current expected credit loss CECL program that's coming in the US. So nothing meaningful from our standpoint.</p><p>JOSEPH FORESI: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC: Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the strong quarter.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Thanks.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: So first question on -- wanted to ask about new issuer rating mandates for 2016, how that's been trending versus previous years.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: Well, the fourth quarter was up year on year. We had I think about 175 new rating mandates in Q4, so that's good looking forward into the new year.</p><p>We are not at peaks we were at back in 2013, 2014, but it has been a stable flow of new mandates at healthy levels, just off-peak levels. Rob, I don't know if there was anything else worth adding on that.</p><p>ROB FAUBER: No, I think that's right.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: How is the breakdown between Europe and US?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: I don't have that number in front of me. Rob is telling me it was skewed towards the US, at least in the fourth quarter.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Okay. And then on the Moody's Analytics side, just wanted to ask you how things were looking at RD&amp;A, how the retention rates have been holding up, how the pricing realization has been.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: It continues to be strong on both fronts. We're running in the mid-[90%s] on customer retention, pricing is solid. We're seeing good upgrade activity.</p><p>So that's all strong. I mean, any softness we see in the RD&amp;A numbers for the quarter really are down to currency. We really took it on the chin on currency translation in Europe.</p><p>So it's hit us pretty hard. But the underlying business is as strong as it's been over the of last couple of years.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Last question on ERS. You mentioned the GGY acquisition which you're going to be anniversarying, and then also what looked like very strong software license revenue. I was going to ask for some help in terms of modeling that out for the rest of the year, how we should think about that.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: Well, you're right, we had a good year in 2016 because we had very good performance in the business. We also had help from the GGY acquisition, so that was all good. Linda also referred to the fact that we are making good progress on our transition in the mix of the business, as we've been talking about for a while.</p><p>We are de-emphasizing the services piece of the business and focusing much more heavily on sales of products that are much more scalable and therefore much more profitable. So the impact of that will flow through to 2017 revenue in the sense that we had a revenue -- a deliberate revenue decline in the services segment of the business, and so you're going to see that flowing through to revenue growth in 2017.</p><p>So we're guiding toward mid-single-digit revenue growth in ERS. And I think the way to think about that is, think about 2017 in terms of ERS revenue growth as a transition year as we shift the mix of the business away from services and focus more heavily on products, which we think will drive a much stronger P&amp;L over the coming years.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Got it. Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.</p><p>MANAV PATNAIK, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Hi, good afternoon. Linda, just us to follow up on the expense commentary. Can you give us the ramp that you usually guide us to from now to the fourth quarter?</p><p>And also, how much of that 100 basis points is coming from the Moody's Analytics side? Maybe you could just update us on the efforts for the margin improvement there.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Sure. Manav, the first question's a little bit easier, and maybe I'll let Mark think a little about what he wants to say on your second question. This year, we're hoping that the ramp will be a little bit flatter than it's been in previous years.</p><p>To give you somewhere to start, I think I've got this right, we're looking at about $532 million for the first quarter budget for expenses in 2017, and we're looking at the ramp going up $20 million to $25 million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. Now, I'll give the same warning that I give every year, that includes the review that incentive compensation lays out pretty evenly for the year.</p><p>We haven't had that sort of performance recently in 2016. You'll note incentive comp went way up in the fourth quarter because of the strong performance. But all things being equal, you want to start with $532 million or so and take it up $20 million to $25 million.</p><p>Now, we've had pretty significant margin work in MIS and some pretty strong cost controls in shared services in 2016. That reduces the run rate increase for 2017. And Mark's continuing to focus on margin by at his higher-margin businesses, as we said in the prepared remarks.</p><p>I don't know, Mark, if you want to make any other comments on your thoughts.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: Yes, I mean, I would only observe, consistent with what we've said before, that I think we are making good progress with the MA margin. The challenge that we have is it's difficult for you to see that because of the way that we allocate overhead expense to the two operating businesses. MA, as it's been growing faster than MIS over the last of couple of years, is attracting more overhead.</p><p>So that's sort of offsetting the work that we're doing in the business itself. So it's difficult for you to see it because of that. It's difficult for you to see it because of the impact on the margin, at least in the short run, with some of the acquisitions we've made.</p><p>So we believe we're making good progress. We think that progress is only going to get better over the coming years. But it is going to be difficult to see it on the MA standalone P&amp;L, just given the way we treat overhead expense.</p><p>MANAV PATNAIK: So is the target still mid-[20s] over several years?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Yes.</p><p>MANAV PATNAIK: Okay. And then, just one on the rating side, maybe Rob can add some color here. I think you guys have put out some pieces around tax reform and the impact on issuance. It sounds like for Moody's companies specifically, obviously the lower tax and repatriations are positive.</p><p>Just on the broader tax reform piece, I guess it sounds like the view is it should be a negative, but how should we think about timing and how that impacts issuance and the Company's decision making? Any help or color there would be helpful.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: This is Ray. When we look at potential changes in taxes, it's really -- there are a number of puts and takes. Certainly to the extent that there are impacts from changes in interest deductibility, you have to count that as a negative. But to the extent that debt financing is still a low-cost form of financing, you would have companies that have more available cash.</p><p>It would probably be a stimulus for economic growth and so I would hope and anticipate we would see more new money borrowing. So the quantification of whether it ends up being a net negative or a net positive is difficult to assess without having more detail about what the actual changes in tax law would be. And as we see that, we will obviously communicate it.</p><p>MANAV PATNAIK: Got it. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>TONI KAPLAN, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hi. Good morning.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Good morning.</p><p>TONI KAPLAN: In 2016, your transactional revenues, ratings revenue growth, was up about 0.5%, while your biggest competitor was up about 6% in transactional rating. Was do you think the key drivers are that explain the delta there? Just given that, historically, you've been a little bit more in terms of transactional mix shift, just wanted to figure out what we should be thinking about.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Toni, it's Linda. This is one of the most difficult types of questions for us to answer because we can see what goes into that view for us, but of course we don't know what goes into that calculation for our competitor. Makes it pretty hard for us to judge.</p><p>I'll ask Rob if he wants to make any other comments on this, but that wouldn't -- we don't have as much clarity on that as you might think, and it's a little hard for us to parse. Rob?</p><p>ROB FAUBER: The only thing I think I can surmise would be some shift in the mix.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: Just to add onto that, our transaction versus recurring revenue splits remain fairly constant in 2016 versus 2015, so we didn't see any big shifts there.</p><p>TONI KAPLAN: Okay. Great. And I guess related, can you just talk about the pricing environment within MIS?</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Sure, it's Linda. We had spoken about, at Investor Day back in 2016, that we felt pretty good about the pricing environment. I think that continues, I think I had noted then that we expect to be closer to the 4% end of the range we had said of 3% to 4%.</p><p>We are very interested in providing appropriate value for what we do, and we think we've made some significant investments in what the team has been able to do in terms of ease of use and otherwise a very strong value proposition which I'll let Rob talk about. But we're feeling okay about pricing. Rob, anything else you want to mention?</p><p>ROB FAUBER: I think that's it.</p><p>TONI KAPLAN: Great. And then your long-term framework calls for EPS growth in the teens. This coming year, you're expecting mid-single-digit MIS growth environment.</p><p>Why only 5% on the EPS increase excluding the tax benefit? I think you did mention perhaps the higher interest expense before rolling into 2017 from the actions you took in 2016, but are there other pieces that we should be thinking about as well?</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Toni, you might want to note the new accounting provision is helpful to us, but the UK has a couple of laws that's going to limit the interest deductibility piece to 30% of EBITDA. And that is costing us about 160 basis points on the tax line. The tax line is, in this climate, one of the more challenging things for us to predict.</p><p>If we do see a change in tax policy, I would note, which might be helpful to you, that a 1% change in the ETR, that's 100 basis points, gives us $0.07 to $0.08 in EPS, which is a lot. So we're quite sensitive to what happens to that tax line, but you know that we've guided to 31% to 32%. We'll see what happens with that.</p><p>And there's obviously some variability around it. So we're taking a prudent view on this, given what we know now, and if we have adjustments, we'll be happy to discuss those with you on future calls. Ray, I don't know if you want to --</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: The only other thing I would direct you to is the fact that we do have higher financing cost this year than we did of last year. Part of that is the roll-forward of financing that we did during the year last year.</p><p>And part of it is the fact that we've done some financing and we'll continue to do some financing as a result of the settlement with the Department of Justice and the payments that were made there. So that's just giving us an increase in that line that we normally wouldn't see.</p><p>TONI KAPLAN: Thanks a lot.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Warren Gardiner with Evercore.</p><p>WARREN GARDINER, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI: Thanks. On the margin and analytics in the quarter, it sounds like there were a couple of moving parts there with GGY and some FX. In any sense you could parse that out for us, give us what you think the core margin would be for that business?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Well, I can tell you that if we ignore the additional overhead expense that we absorbed, and we ignore the impact of the acquisition, for the quarter, the margin would have been flat to 2015.</p><p>I should also note that we had a couple of million dollars of nonrecurring expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 that we won't have going forward. And so you probably -- if you want to look at, on a run rate basis, you want to back out a couple million dollars for that as well.</p><p>WARREN GARDINER: Okay. I guess, then, on expenses, overall -- for Linda, maybe -- in the past you guys have -- this is kind of been asked a little bit. In the past you guys have given us a sense of what you might have to pull back on if things got choppy. Any sense what that level of flexibility would be for 2017?</p><p>LINDA HUBER: I think I'd stick to what we said in 2016. We always tell you guys we can achieve $50 million of expense savings, and voila, we achieved $50 million of expense savings. So there's probably another $50 million in there across the Company.</p><p>I would note that we are being very thoughtful about expenses. We note that both operating expenses and CapEx, CapEx is looking to be up about $100 million as we go through 2017. We've had a little bit of lightening up in terms of our real estate projects.</p><p>We had taken two floors in One World Trade Center in 2016, and as you know, we're making some investment in our technology. But we expect that to lighten up a little bit in 2017. So we're guiding to</p><p>$100 million, as we had said.</p><p>Just across the board, we're being really careful with what we're doing and considering every cost. We have a procurement group that's done a really nice job on some of our expenses such as T&amp;E. We're managing very, very closely.</p><p>We'll think about maybe flexibility for another $50 million for 2017.</p><p>WARREN GARDINER: Thanks a lot.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next to Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thanks. Good afternoon.</p><p>I guess I wanted to come back to the ERS growth, and the assumed deceleration of mid-single digits from double digits the last three years. I know you called out the mix shift of going towards products away from services. One, I just want to confirm for similar, I guess, offering, I'm sorry, the implication that it's a lower price, I just want to confirm if that's right for one.</p><p>And then two, how much of it is that versus just you being conservative? The last couple years, I think you've guided to mid-single digits and put up something much healthier than that.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Andre, a couple of things. First, as Linda said earlier, she noted that trailing 12-month sales in ERS are up 4%, and then she decomposed that. She said that product sales, again trailing 12 months, products sales are up 13%, and services are down 16%.</p><p>So if you just start with trailing 12-month sales for ERS up 4%, that flows through to our mid-single-digit revenue guidance for 2017. Because we've got sort of the lag on revenue recognition. So that's how we get to the guidance.</p><p>The mix shift, again, is designed to deliver more margin. I think you're right in talking about fees, you're right in the sense that over the last number of years we've done some very large projects for customers where we charged many millions of dollars for the services work that we did. So in that respect that -- not doing projects of that scale and charging those kinds of fees for services will put some -- will put a bit of a drag on top-line growth.</p><p>But we think that because the product is more mature, it is more scalable, it meets more needs for more customers, we think we'll be able to sell more. We're going to make it up -- to some degree, we're going to make it up on volume. We'll be able to, as we get through this transition, we'll be able to get through a better growth rate over time.</p><p>And then the other thing to keep in mind here is that decline, that 16% decline in services sales in 2016, was kind of a one-time phenomenon. Our expectation is that we'll hold that line flat going forward. So you won't see a big contraction there.</p><p>We'll be holding that flat while the product line continues to grow at a double-digit rate. We're going to get, on balance, we'll get to a much healthier overall growth rate in ERS. Which is why you say it's helpful to think of 2017 as a transition year for the business.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: That's helpful. I guess, just a follow-up on the margin question, a couple other people asked. Definitely makes sense that you're getting more overhead.</p><p>You've been talking about that for a while now. It's just explicitly to make sure we modeled it right. Should we assume that margins for that business are up next year as you work through this transition or is getting to the mid-[20]s more back-end loaded?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Again, we don't give specific margin guidance by line of business, but I will tell you, again, if we were to -- you ignore the GGY acquisition, you ignore the additional overhead that we attracted in 2016. And if you ignore that couple of million dollars that I mentioned, that nonrecurring expense that we had in the fourth quarter, we would have seen over 100 basis points of margin expansion in MA from 2015 to 2016. And I would expect that trend to continue.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray &amp; Co.</p><p>PETER APPERT, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY &amp; CO.: Thanks. Ray, what's left on the legal front?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Fortunately, not much. If we step back and look at all of the crisis era litigation, we've now disposed of better than 90% of what we were facing globally. So very little left in terms of numbers.</p><p>PETER APPERT: And then, Linda, I understand their rationale in terms of a lower pace of share repurchase in 2017. Should we anticipate, then, that in 2018, maybe get back to more of the $1 billion run rate you've been doing in recent years?</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Peter, it's hard for us to guide that far ahead in terms of share repurchase. We do look at market conditions. We do want to reinvest in our businesses, and share repurchase oftentimes is sort of the last number that we look at given that.</p><p>We thought it was best to be prudent for this year. Yes, we would like to return to more vigorous share repurchase but we're going to have to see. It's too early to tell where that will go.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: I think the fairest thing we could say looking out that far is we believe we certainly would have the capacity to do so, and we'd make those decisions nearer the date.</p><p>PETER APPERT: Got it. Lastly, Rob, just on the trends in the structured finance market, which seems like it's basically come back to life.</p><p>Any commentary in terms of changes you're seeing in the market that might give you more confidence in the sustainability of volumes there? And any commentary on competitive dynamics? Because it does seem there's more competitive pressures in that market than you see elsewhere. Thanks.</p><p>ROB FAUBER: Maybe I'll focus primarily on the US. That's obviously the largest market. So in the ABS sector, got off to a bit of a subdued start as folks were still adapting to the Reg AB2 loan level reporting requirements.</p><p>But the pipeline's certainly heating up, and activity is heating up in February on some very strong demand there. In terms of CMBS, we saw a very weak start. That was due to a pull-forward of deals from the risk retention deadline at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, and I would I say that CMBS hasn't weathered risk retention quite as well as the CLO market.</p><p>We've only seen two risk-retention compliant deals get printed since the deadline at the end of December. That said, there is a pipeline building in CMBS. And in CLO, we've seen some very strong issuance continuing into the first quarter of 2017.</p><p>So obviously, you saw in our results, there was very strong issuance in the fourth quarter due to a real pull forward from 2017 into 2016 in advance of that risk retention deadline. I would note that much of the early volume in the first quarter in CLOs is refi as spreads have come in.</p><p>We are starting to see some new CLO formation come into the March pipeline as the CLO market seems to have found some structures that work within the risk retention framework. Just in terms of -- from a competitive standpoint, our coverage continues to be strong, and we actually have seen some nice gains in our coverage in Europe.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go to Tim McHugh with William Blair &amp; Company.</p><p>TIM MCHUGH, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY: Thanks. Just on the margin question, obviously 2017's better.</p><p>Are you finding things that you didn't expect? Or are we seeing some of the expected margin expansion that you talked about at Investor Day, in terms of the path towards 45%, just come faster than you would have otherwise expected?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Yes, I think it's a couple of things. We have taken actions in 2016 that were somewhat accelerated against our original expectations, and we're getting the benefits of those. We've also got a little bit, as you might imagine, better position on the legal side now than we had last year.</p><p>We are still anticipating that we can move to the mid-40%s margin overall. Again, subject to the mix of the two different businesses. But, yes, you've got an acceleration of what we were identifying earlier in the year last year. Linda, I don't know if there was anything else you wanted to add to that.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: We were very pleased with the progress we made in 2016. I think we even surprised ourselves, frankly, Tim. We did a $12 million restructuring charge. The genesis that was split half-and-half between the rating agency and shared services.</p><p>We're being very careful with what we're doing in headcount. And in shared services, we're very thoughtful about our use of lower-cost locations. Those are our own employees we're using in those lower-cost locations. We've gotten the run rate down, and we're very happy about that. We're being really careful about what we do going forward.</p><p>I think it's good housekeeping, and Ray and I encouraged our colleagues to think hard about the margin line. And everybody really got the message and did a great job, and we expect that, that will continue. We run the business in a very disciplined way. We've been very careful in terms of adding new headcount and even backfilling.</p><p>So we're pleased with what we're seeing, and we're doing a little bit better than we even thought. So we're very happy with all that. There's no magic to it -- it's day-to-day hard work and good discipline.</p><p>TIM MCHUGH: Okay, great, thanks. Just a follow-up on the tax benefits from the new stock comp rules, I guess. Does that cause more seasonality in the tax rate that we should expect?</p><p>I know there's timing differences sometimes, and when you'll recognize the benefit associated with that part of it. I don't know if the UK rule has similar --</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Sure. The US rules probably will see seasonal effects. And we've estimated about $0.15, but there are a number of factors that go into that which could move around. So we would urge everybody to think about that as an approximation.</p><p>A lot of that might come into the first quarter when our restricted stock awards vet. And there are a bunch of factors there.</p><p>One is, what is the exercise price? Second is, what is the pace of that exercise pricing? The timing, the number, and any number of other factors.</p><p>So we would expect that, that effect might be heavier in the first quarter, particularly given, very happily, where the stock price is right now. So we'll see how that lays out. This is new to us, and we'll give more information as we see what we get in the first quarter.</p><p>TIM MCHUGH: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER, ANALYST, HUBER RESEARCH PARTNERS: Great. Thank you.</p><p>I have just a broad question on the tax policy potential changes we could get out of Washington. If they do get rid of interest expense deductibility in the US as part of overall tax reform, could you guys base case that would hurt potentially high-yield issuance much more so than investment grade issuance? That's my first question.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: I think it would probably have more of an impact on high-yield. Again, though, just trying to weigh the puts and takes on that. It's also high-yield companies that are going to probably want to take most advantage of having additional cash on-hand.</p><p>And so that gives them more flexibility. It might cause them to engage in different behaviors, whether it's from an M&amp;A standpoint or business expansion. So I do think the premise of your question probably leans against high-yield more than it leans against investment grade -- there's pluses and minuses in both cases.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: Ray, I assume you would say that probably even more so, if the interest expense deductibility was limited to only up to 30% of EBITDA. Similar to what you talked about in the UK, I guess Germany has as well, as opposed to getting rid of 100%.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Yes. And again, there's what it does in an absolute sense, but then it's also, relatively, what is still the more or less attractive ways to raise capital. And so even if it's less attractive, if it's still the most attractive, you would expect firms would make rational economic decisions.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: And then Ray, as a follow-on to that, if you just isolate -- I know this is hard, but if you just isolate, if the corporate tax rate, the US Federal rate goes from 35% to 15% or 20% or thereabouts. What is your general sense on what that could do to debt issuance in terms of -- obviously it should be more pro-growth out there?</p><p>What do think it would do for debt issuance from an M&amp;A perspective, and investing in backing companies, et cetera? (Multiple speakers) debt issuance.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: I don't have a quantification of that for you, Craig, but again, the pluses and minuses that we've outlined in a couple of our comments throughout the call indicate that we don't expect dramatic change in what is happening around our business.</p><p>But it's going to have some impact. Whether it's at 15% or 20% or 25%. And we're just going to have to see.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: Linda, a couple quick housekeeping questions. Maybe I missed this. What percent of your cash hoard is outside the US right now, if you would, please.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: 78% is offshore now, Craig. The numbers are -- US is roughly $500 million, international is roughly $1.7 billion. That totals to $2.2 billion, a little bit more.</p><p>But 78% overseas. And that's because we use some of the US cash as we dealt with the DOJ situation. But as we noted, the very vast majority of the settlement payments have already been made.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: And as has been the case in the past, a substantial fraction of our foreign cash is also held in US dollars.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: Lastly, Linda, if I could ask, given the concerns, ongoing concerns around Brexit. For your ratings business, was your revenues out of the UK for full year 2016 roughly 7% to 8% of your ratings revenue gap? Fair number to think about.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Offshore, offhand -- excuse me, Craig, I'm not certain. We're puzzling and looking at Rob to see if he has any further information.</p><p>ROB FAUBER: It's not as straightforward as you might hope, Craig, because we do both UK-entity-based ratings out of the UK, but we also do European-based ratings, EU-based ratings out of the UK. And the companies that are issuing into the EU may be filed from any one of a number of offices.</p><p>So both how the revenue gets apportioned and then how the expense base supporting that revenue gets apportioned are subject to some interpretations of what's in and what's out. The UK is not a large part of our overall European business, but I don't have a fraction I can give you.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Jeff Silber with Bank of Montreal.</p><p>HENRY CHEN, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Good morning, guys. It's Henry Chen on for Jeff.</p><p>I had a question on MIS. I'm just curious, from a commercial sales perspective, now with the business stabilizing, are there any new markets or geographies that you're looking at to potentially expand your coverage in?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: In terms of markets that we are looking to expand in, we have been active, as you have seen. In emerging markets including India, increasing our stake in Korea, growing business coming out of China has been growing very nicely.</p><p>With the liberalization that is being proposed and discussed in the Chinese market, we would anticipate that, that should create some opportunities. We've also been concentrating on building out the business in Latin America and Middle East. So Rob, I don't know if there's anything else you wanted to add to that.</p><p>ROB FAUBER: We opened an office last year in Sweden. We've been building out presence as well in the Nordic region.</p><p>HENRY CHEN: Okay, that's helpful. Just on MIS, as a follow-up comment, in terms of the different products, is there any margin changes when one increases as a percentage of the whole, say, when structured increases as a percentage? Does that impact the margins of the business?</p><p>ROB FAUBER: The margins in the MIS business for all of the fundamental areas are roughly the same. The structured finance margin is more variable. It's a more transactionally oriented business. And so in periods of high volume, you get higher margins, and low volume, lower margins.</p><p>It's also susceptible to how intense the monitoring to activity has to be. In periods of greater stress, there is greater allocation of resource to having to be on top of the monitoring. That's simply because in periods of stress, there are more assets that have to be scrutinized more closely, so you get some swings there as well. That's the only line of business I would say has substantial variability in margin.</p><p>HENRY CHEN: The monitoring for the structured, or just overall?</p><p>ROB FAUBER: Monitoring for structured in particular, because of the large number of assets that underlie those pools.</p><p>HENRY CHEN: Got it. Thanks so much.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Patrick O'Shaugnessy with Raymond James.</p><p>PATRICK O'SHAUGHNESSY, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES &amp; ASSOCIATES, INC.: Good afternoon. Quick CLO question for you. Does the CLO refinancing create the same revenue opportunity for you guys as a CLO issuance?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: No, new issuance would be a higher revenue opportunity than refi.</p><p>PATRICK O'SHAUGHNESSY: Got it. And then, follow-up question. The acquisition that you just announced the other day, this structured finance data and analytics business of SCDM, is that going within research data and analytics? If so, can you talk about how much of the high-single-digit revenue growth target for that segment in 2017 is going to come from the acquisition?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: The answer to your first question is yes, it is part of RD&amp;A. But it is a very, very small acquisition. It's a good acquisition. It makes a ton of sense.</p><p>We've done this a number of times before where we've acquired businesses where -- in this case we didn't acquire any people. We essentially bought a product that is very similar to an existing product of ours. We're going to transition their customers from the legacy product to our product.</p><p>So essentially, we bought that business without buying any expense, frankly, that would come along with it. So I think it's a very good transaction for us. But it is, honestly, it's tiny.</p><p>Strategically, it's a nice fit, but it's not going to turn the dial on financial performance for RD&amp;A.</p><p>PATRICK O'SHAUGHNESSY: Smaller than the GGY acquisition of last year?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: That's correct.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Significantly.</p><p>PATRICK O'SHAUGHNESSY: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ray McDaniel for closing comments.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Okay. Thank you all for joining the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you again after the first quarter. Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes Moody's Corporationfourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2016 earnings call.

Highlights:</p><p>1. Revenue:</p><p>1. 4Q17 $2.1b.</p><p>1. Up 15%; strong.</p><p>2. 2017 $7.72b.</p><p>1. Up 8%, slightly soft to guidance due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma negatively impacting revenue at Card Services by approx. $80m.</p><p>2. Core EPS:</p><p>1. 4Q17 $6.26.</p><p>1. Up 34%.</p><p>2. 2017 $19.35.</p><p>1. Up 14%.</p><p>3. Excluding net tax benefit:</p><p>1. 4Q17 $5.24; up 12%.</p><p>2. 2017 $18.33; up 8%, better than guidance of $18.10.</p><p>3. Recently enacted tax reform lowered provision for income tax for 4Q17 and full-year by reducing net deferred tax liabilities, essentially reducing cash taxes that Co. would have had to pay in future.</p><p>1. Benefits this moving forward, as Co. expects its effective tax rate to drop to 26-27% in 2018 vs. 33% in 2017 prior to adjustment.</p><p>2. Anticipates cash benefit to approximate $100m to cash flow in 2018.</p><p>4. Year-end net corporate debt approx. $5.9b, while corporate leverage ratio ended the year at 2.7 times, consistent with last several years.</p><p>2. LoyaltyOne:</p><p>1. Mixed year.</p><p>2. AIR MILES made expectations.</p><p>1. Restored profitability of the level Co. anticipated.</p><p>3. BrandLoyalty results were unexpectedly poor.</p><p>4. Entered the year knowing that Co. needed to retool AIR MILES business model following break assumption reset at 2016-end.</p><p>1. Successful in introducing small changes that allowed AIR MILES EBITDA margins to return to mid-20s range.</p><p>2. AIR MILES issued came in short of expectations, down 4%.</p><p>1. Softness and promotional activity, especially in grocery vertical caused shortfall.</p><p>2. Will need to stimulate promotional activity in 2018 in order to drive issuance growth.</p><p>5. BrandLoyalty:</p><p>1. Revenue decreased 12%, weakness is due to:</p><p>1. Key markets Germany and Russia were off to absence of events like EuroCup and Olympics, which reduced number of programs executed.</p><p>2. North American expansion into US did not manifest as it is taking longer to establish the [foothold] here than anticipated.</p><p>3. Rollout of Disney product offering was delayed to 2018.</p><p>2. Backlog for 1H looks good in 2018.</p><p>3. Epsilon:</p><p>1. Goal for Epsilon entering 2018 [represent] top and bottom line growth.</p><p>2. Strong finish to 2017 allowed Co. to hit 5% revenue growth target.</p><p>3. On apples-to-apples basis, achieved 5% adjusted EBITDA target.</p><p>4. Difference to reported decline of 1% is restoration of $29m in incentive compensation vs. zero last year, essentially it is one year grow over that Co. had to play through that it needed to restore bonuses in order to maintain highly competitive compensation packages going forward.</p><p>5. Faster than expected stabilization of technology platform business, which finished strong with 7% revenue growth in 4Q17, as offering stabilized through the sale of more packaged offerings and record volumes through Harmony, digital messaging platform.</p><p>6. Other two big drivers of growth Auto and Conversant CRM finished 4Q17 and year with double-digit revenue growth.</p><p>1. Auto continues to benefit from ongoing penetration to new OEMs.</p><p>2. Conversant CRM [cross selling efforts] continue to gain traction, in particular as its digital capabilities are now embedded in auto and technology platform offerings.</p><p>4. Card Services:</p><p>1. Facing headwinds of second year of credit normalization, Card Services still delivered with double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>2. Credit sales increased 6%, with apparel brand partners showing consistent improvement as the year progressed, culminating in strong holiday performance.</p><p>3. Tender share growth:</p><p>1. 4Q17, more than 160 BP.</p><p>2. 2017, more than 100 BP.</p><p>4. Avg. receivables increased 15%.</p><p>1. Growth rate in 4Q17 gets slightly to 13%, as Co. divested approx. $100m of non-core program receivables in Dec., which hurt receivables growth by about 2%.</p><p>5. OpEx up 7% vs. revenue growth of 13%; strong expense leveraging.</p><p>6. Net loss rate 6%; up 90 BP over 2016.</p><p>1. 60 BP of the increase is due to lower recovery rates.</p><p>2. 30 BP due to higher gross losses.</p><p>7. Gross loss rates stabilized as 2017 progressed, as Co. reached end of credit normalization cycle.</p><p>8. Delinquency trend or wedge, closed within 10 BP at year-and, excluding transitory impact of hurricanes.</p><p>9. Overall, credit sales increased 8% with strong performance from Co.'s recent vintages.</p><p>1. On a comparable brand basis, credit sales up 5% YoverY.</p><p>1. Growth was fueled by continued non-store spend, up 11%, which includes digital and web channels.</p><p>2. Non-store sales growth was driven by increase in buyers and spend per buyer; 3% and 2% respectively.</p><p>1. Growth came from an increase in omnichannel buyers reflecting Co.'s continued strategy to help brands engage customers in all relevant channels.</p><p>10. Card Services continue to expand and diversify portfolio of brand partners, standing nearly $3b vintage in 2017.</p><p>11. New partners Co. has signed this year has been a great reflection of where the market is growing and what consumers' value.</p><p>1. Brands like Ikea and Viking Cruises has being valued for product and experiences they provide and Build.com being a strong e-tailer in a growing category for ADS.</p><p>12. Key initiative for 2018 is to develop a consumer direct funding program for Utah bank.</p><p>1. Would allow Co. to take savings accounts and other non-demand deposits, which diversifying its funding sources and helping funding rates.</p><p>2017 Review (E.H.)</p><p>1. Highlights:</p><p>1. Epsilon:</p><p>1. Goal for the year was mid-single digits top and bottom.</p><p>1. On an apples-to-apples basis, believes Co. accomplished that.</p><p>2. Delta between reported number for EBITDA and 5% growth rate is restoration of incentive comp or bonus program.</p><p>1. Prior year, there was zero payout, which Co. doesn't believe is sustainable in this market.</p><p>2. Wanted to make sure Co. was highly competitive as moving into 2018.</p><p>3. Exiting the year to plus seven topline is a good signal as moving into next year.</p><p>1. Believes Co. is getting to handle on that sort of mid-single-digit growth rate.</p><p>2. Card Services even with 90 BP increase in loss rates, still managed to deliver EBITDA to net of all these provision costs and funding costs and everything else up double digits.</p><p>3. EPS:</p><p>1. Had guided to roughly $18.10, came in at $19.35.</p><p>1. Over performance would have brought Co. in at $18.33, ahead by $0.23.</p><p>2. Little over $1 coming from tax benefit, which consisted both of benefit itself less about $12m that Co. allocated to non-executive bonuses coming out of tax reform act.</p><p>2. LoyaltyOne:</p><p>1. Consists of Canadian business AIR MILES.</p><p>1. After the crisis last year, stabilized model with number of changes that Co. made and specifically, came in mid-20% EBITDA margins, which was its goal.</p><p>2. Renewed Co.'s largest client, Bank of Montreal, which is critical to ongoing success of program.</p><p>3. Wanted to make sure coming out of crisis that Co. retained its clients and had 100% retention rates.</p><p>4. Wanted to get the folks excited about the program again; comes through with active collectors.</p><p>1. Active collectors are all the way back to pre-crisis levels by 4Q.</p><p>5. Probably there a couple of things that Co. still need to work on.</p><p>1. Model stabilized, but it has not yet kicked into adding to growth rate at ADS; wants to move it back now that it's been stabilized into growth rate mode and that's a job for 2018.</p><p>2. The one goal where Co. came at short was promotional spend from clients, which represents about a third of all miles that it issues was quite soft and that's something that it is working on right now to make sure that it's not just every day spend that gets rewarded, but it wants a big chunk of promotional spend.</p><p>2. BrandLoyalty unfortunately had a poor year.</p><p>1. Believes Co. got a little bit comfortable with three straight years of strong double-digit growth of topline and EBITDA.</p><p>1. Just had it fell off a cliff in 2017 and had poor results.</p><p>2. Now has visibility on fact that Co. has had a huge book of business for 2018 and it looks like it's more like an air pocket.</p><p>3. Looking forward to having a very robust snapback from BL in 2018.</p><p>3. Epsilon:</p><p>1. Mid-single-digit organic top and bottom line is what Co. is looking for and that's what it brought to table, that's what it is looking to continue into 2018 and start building up a level of consistency that people feel comfortable with.</p><p>1. 2016-end, that's when there was a big question on Co.'s largest chunk of business with technology platform, which is about over a qtr. of all of Epsilon conversant and that was a bit of a melting iceberg at that point, it's down 13% YoverY in 4Q16.</p><p>1. Team did a wonderful job of turning it not only getting pricing at a level Co. wants, setting up office in India, also moving from a customized model where things take 15, 17 months to get to market to a more standard package where it is talking about 2-3 months.</p><p>2. Thereby, saw steady progress and actually exited year at plus 7% growth for that business.</p><p>2. Two big growth areas digital CRM and Auto offerings both up strongly double-digit.</p><p>1. There was a bit of a concern in 3Q whether digital CRM, which had fallen off in terms of growth rate.</p><p>1. Whether that was an air pocket, fortunately it was and thereby, saw a nice pick up in 4Q.</p><p>3. It's a bit more from a macro perspective, has got a lot of folks and it's both a tech offering, but it's also a services offering.</p><p>1. Going to be watching carefully the impact of tight labor market for hard skills.</p><p>1. Lot of folks competing for this type of talent and Co. wants to make sure it is on top of the list.</p><p>4. Wants to have more consistent better visibility on financial results.</p><p>1. Believes 2017 was a good start, but there is still works to be done there.</p><p>4. Card Services:</p><p>1. Fabulous wedge that Co. put out on 15 months ago, which is Co.'s best predictor of future losses.</p><p>1. Up YoverY about 50 BP and that's where Co. believes losses will be up about 50 BP.</p><p>2. By year-end, it should have closed that would have been a nice finish to the year, unfortunately Co. came within 10 BP.</p><p>1. Had some noise from hurricanes, but trends are friend at this point and it's effectively closed.</p><p>3. Outlook for 2018 gives Co. comfort that stable loss rates will follow.</p><p>2. Book of business growth rate 15%; quite strong.</p><p>1. Believes that's a good number for Co. to shoot for on yearly basis.</p><p>2. Looking back the last five years, numbers closer to 20%.</p><p>1. Believes 15% is a solid number, that gives Co. a lot of flexibility when it comes to signing new clients and being very selective on renewals.</p><p>3. Had a record new vintage this year, close to $3b.</p><p>1. Taking all signings that Co. did over the past year whether it was an existing file or whether it was a file starting from scratch and it takes three years to ramp up, after three years all of these clients together will add roughly $3b to portfolio.</p><p>2. Has number of vintages each year that are spooling up.</p><p>3. Looking at clients, it's interesting that they differ across verticals and across physical presence vs. strictly e-commerce, obviously Signet, Build.com, Viking, Guess, Diamonds, Adorama and Ikea represents what Co. is beginning to seeing now which is different from more traditional model of mall-based soft good apparels.</p><p>1. Sees interest coming from many different areas and that gives Co. a lot of comfort on what it is going to do going forward.</p><p>4. Double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, includes absorbing 90 BP increase in losses.</p><p>5. Missed third-party recovery market.</p><p>1. Thereby, it lowered recovery rates dramatically.</p><p>2. Looking at 90 BP increase in net losses, Co. thought it would be more like 50 BP, what it turned out to be was gross losses were only up 30 BP.</p><p>1. Lost it on recovery side when market cratered.</p><p>5. Results:</p><p>1. Revenue up 8%.</p><p>2. Core EPS up 14%.</p><p>1. Tax [beni] up 8%, excluding the beni.</p><p>3. Leverage at corporate level at 2.7 times; modest.</p><p>1. Includes impact of funding over $1b for buybacks and capital for growth in portfolio.</p><p>2. Good generation of free cash flow for Co.</p><p>4. Stabilization of credit loss rate were there after two years of absorbing increases.</p><p>5. Poised now to return to mid-to-high teen's core EPS growth rate in 2018, which is Co.'s long-term model.</p><p>1. It's been a bumpy couple of years and Co. is right where it wanted to be for slingshot for 2018.</p><p>6. Raising cash dividend 10% to $0.57 per share starting in 1Q18.</p><p>6. 2018 Guidance:</p><p>1. Revenue looks quite strong.</p><p>1. Looking at double-digit revenue growth of roughly 12%.</p><p>2. Against that there is an accounting adjustment that does not affect cash flow or EBITDA or EPS, it's merely geography, but it does change recognition of roughly $350m in business in Canada.</p><p>Accounting Adjustment (C.H.)</p><p>1. Details:</p><p>1. Revenue has been out there for quite a while, but it was really in Dec. when AICPA came out with a white paper that basically said that if loyalty program doesn't take inventory risk, meaning Co. doesn't own it, it doesn't carry inventory into point of redemption, it should record it net (gross revenue minus the cost of product redemption to get to a net revenue).</p><p>1. LoyaltyOne travel has definitely fit that threshold.</p><p>1. What it forces Co. to do is to look at travel-related redemptions going into 2018, recognize will now have a net recordation for it.</p><p>2. No impact at all in terms of any of earnings metrics, obviously it bumps up EBITDA margin appreciably, but it's purely shifting to a net presentation.</p><p>1. Came very late in year, not anticipated it early, not a big impact overall for ADS in terms of revenue and no impact to profitability.</p><p>2018 Guidance (E.H.)</p><p>1. Core EPS:</p><p>1. 12% topline core EPS.</p><p>1. Even with big bump up in 2017 from $18.10 to $19.35, still looking at 16-19% growth.</p><p>2. Going back to original guidance, wanted to do $18.10 this past year, bumping up to $21.50 for next year.</p><p>1. New guidance is Co. came in at $19.35 and going to bump up to $22.50-23.00 a share, representing 16-19% growth.</p><p>2. Tax Bill:</p><p>1. Will provide Co. with roughly $100m a year in additional free cash flow; roughly $1.78 per share.</p><p>1. Going to take that $100m and obviously flow through roughly two-thirds of it and going to take between 30-33% and pile that back into Co.</p><p>2. Going to put it back into Co. in three different buckets:</p><p>1. To accelerate some existing projects that Co. has on board.</p><p>2. To establish an innovation fund to make sure Co. is on leading edge of various digital payment products that are out there.</p><p>3. To bolster some employee benefits, whether it's getting 401(k) participation rate up or holding down any increases on benefits, the premiums on various healthcare packages for employees Co. wants to help out there.</p><p>3. Trying to live the spirit of agreement and what Co. believes is the appropriate thing to do.</p><p>3. LoyaltyOne:</p><p>1. BrandLoyalty:</p><p>1. Expects high single-digit revenue, low double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth.</p><p>2. AIR MILES has stabilized.</p><p>1. Now Co. would like to see it begin to return to incremental growth.</p><p>3. BrandLoyalty usually runs at a solid double-digit top and bottom.</p><p>1. Had a poor year in 2017.</p><p>2. Expect strong snapback in 2018, believes the World Cup, the Olympics and the Disney deals that Co. has, it's already looking like the number of deals it has signed is going to be a record.</p><p>4. Epsilon:</p><p>1. Consistency.</p><p>2. Wants to see minimum of mid-single-digit top and bottom.</p><p>3. Expects tech platform, now, that it's turned to actually turn into growth along with Auto and Conversant CRM.</p><p>1. Those three businesses are almost 70% of Epsilon Conversant.</p><p>5. Card Services:</p><p>1. Expects roughly 15% growth on avg. credit card receivables.</p><p>1. Looking at signings from 2015-2017, those signings are ramping and combined, they add about $2.5b to growth rate in 2018 plus the core Co. expects to be in modest growth mode add another $1b.</p><p>1. At $3.5b and Co. has budgeted about $1b of what it consider folks that either are going bankrupts or it doesn't believes the renewal process is favorable to ADS.</p><p>2. Has put in a fair amount of squish there to get Co. to 15%, it could be a tad bit higher; it is right at 15%.</p><p>2. Credit:</p><p>1. Stable delinquency rates.</p><p>2. Best predictor of future losses.</p><p>3. Started 2017 at about 55 BP higher.</p><p>1. By 4Q17, it get rid of hurricane noise, it's just about close to 10 BP.</p><p>4. Expects stable delinquency rates and that will lead to stable loss rates.</p><p>5. Gross loss rates up only 30 BP last year and better than 50 BP Co. had initially forecast.</p><p>1. Consumer is quite healthy, seeing good behavior from consumer, but really where the 90 BP increase came from two-thirds of it came from third-party recovery market, which fell off cliff.</p><p>6. Recovery market for sales of written off counts got to be challenging for Co.</p><p>1. Delinquent, recovery process for next 180 days; has always done that 100% in-house, it's certainly one of Co.'s advantages.</p><p>2. Post write offs, so after 180 days, after Co. writes off account, sells some of that paper to third-party, that market collapsed.</p><p>3. Normally recovers between 22-25% of gross losses.</p><p>4. In 2016, 1.8% meant to roughly 26% of gross losses were recovered.</p><p>5. In 2017, received much less when Co. sold those accounts, recovery rate fell to 16% and it added 60 BP to net loss rate or two-thirds of total.</p><p>6. Similar to past, can do better in-house that process started in earnest in late fall and will be complete by 2Q18.</p><p>7. 1Q18 will be noisy and will be elevated.</p><p>8. Final hurricane flow through will cause gross losses to be elevated, while Co. will be refraining from any third-party sales of written off accounts, which would normally have lowered and which will lower recovery rates vs. prior year.</p><p>1. Co. wants to recover those itself.</p><p>2. It will come a little bit later in year, expects an elevated loss rate in 1Q18, this is noise only.</p><p>9. Delinquency flow suggests stable gross losses.</p><p>10. In-house recovery process will be done by 2Q18.</p><p>11. After an elevated 1Q18 to aforementioned transitory items, 2Q18 through 4Q18, expects flat to better vs. prior year on loss rates and to make up for 1Q18 noise with favorable comps in 2Q-4Q.</p><p>6. Summary:</p><p>1. Two-year credit normalization process is over.</p><p>2. Back as a co. to mid to high-teens earnings growth.</p><p>3. Free cash flow will be very robust with over $1.5b.</p><p>1. Right now, has only allocated roughly $500m of that to support regulatory capital and dividends.</p><p>2. Over $1b of unencumbered free cash flow.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER, MD, BARCLAYS PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Let me just start off on the card business. From an outlook perspective, the -- I know you're talking about mid-teens receivables growth, or the like again. And I know the year ended off with a slightly slower growth rate. I think it was closer to 10% in the December month. I just want to understand where the confidence is coming from in terms of the portfolio growth and the underlying trends in retailers you're seeing right now. And then just a quick follow-up on the BrandLoyalty -- on the LoyaltyOne business after, please?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN, </nameText></person>CEO, PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION: Yes, sure. What we do is, obviously, we've got roughly 160 clients. Actually, a lot of the core clients that we had wound up doing a bit better in Q4 and holiday than, I think, a lot of people had anticipated. So we are seeing a little bit of traction there. Also what we do is we look at, Darrin, the vintages that we signed not just in '17, but '16 and '15 and see how they're ramping up and when they're going to layer into the '18 growth pipeline. And so you sort of wrap it all together and what we're seeing is even factoring in at roughly $1 billion that could go away due to a client going bankrupt or renewals that we don't want to pursue, we've looked back -- oh gosh, if you went back prior 5 years, our average growth rate has been 22%. If you layer in the vintages, what you're seeing with the ramp-ups of the IKEAs and stuff like that, the 15% looks certainly doable.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER: Okay. So it's really organic. I mean, in terms of the strength you're seeing, it's actually organic addition -- additional clients.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. We have not factored in any acquisitions of portfolios in 2018.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER: Okay. I was just going to ask about -- I appreciate that. On the LoyaltyOne side, just to be clear, I mean, I understand BrandLoyalty has a ton of different new business coming on -- World Cup, Olympics, Disney, et cetera. Just give us more color on the overall confidence on that business, not just -- I mean, on loyalty and the AIR MILES side, specifically, in terms of the overall guidance, high single-digit revenue. What do you need for the AIR MILES business to do for that business overall -- LoyaltyOne, to deliver the guidance you're giving, high single-digit revenue growth and -- I mean, can you give us a little more confidence on what you're seeing there to give you the conviction in that?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. I think the Canadian business, we've set the bar, I think, at a reasonable level. So the goal for '17 was stabilize, get the margins back to the mid-20s. For '18, frankly, Darrin, we're talking 2% to 3%-type growth, which should certainly be doable. The BrandLoyalty, frankly, is going to be the engine driving this bus. And based on what we're seeing in terms of the number of programs signed versus the folks who decided to take a pass last year and sort of wait for the Olympics and World Cup and everything else, it looks pretty robust.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER: Okay. All right. Charles, just last question and I'll turn it back to the queue. But on the tax side, it's great to see your guidance unchanged, backing out now the tax benefit implicit in your '18 guidance. Just curious in terms of the assumptions for the tax benefit. I mean, I think we had estimated a little bit higher than the $1.50-or-so you're guiding and I know there's a $0.50 reinvestment. But even with that, is there any other items we should just be aware of in terms of conservatism in your tax adjustments or tax estimates for the year?</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN, CFO AND EVP, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION: Sure. So if you look at 2017, our effective tax rate was 33%. We're guiding to 26% to 27% effective tax rate in '18. To Darrin's point, it does assume that we'll get a little pressure from the States. You've read what's going on in New York, New Jersey, California. They could -- the states could look to grab some of that federal savings. So there is little bit of conservatism built in, in that the state rate could go up in 2018 versus '17, which is why we set the bar at 26% to 27% effective tax rate '18.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER: All right. So it's maybe another 100 basis points or so above what it otherwise would have been. Or...</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: I can't quantify it, Darrin.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI, MD, KEEFE, BRUYETTE, &amp; WOODS, INC.,RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe this goes back to the spirit of some of Darrin's questions. But Ed, maybe you could just talk about where you see the largest risks to your outlook. I know there's a lot of positive things happening underneath it all, but maybe you could just talk about what you're worried about to the extent that you are worried about anything. And then as far as tax reform, can that help Card Services and Epsilon as consumers benefit from that and businesses look to reinvest? I'm just trying to think through the impacts.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. I think they're fair questions. Look, we don't -- the areas that we need to continue to show consistency, that would be Epsilon/Conversant. We've had a good run in '17. Frankly, I think we need to demonstrate we can do that again in '18 before people get really comfortable. From what I'm seeing, it looks pretty good. Obviously, the BrandLoyalty thing was probably the thing that took us all by surprise. And I can -- I see the number of programs we signed based on prior year. We know how that will flow into earnings growth. I don't think we're going to say much more until we actually just print the numbers because we missed so badly during '17. If there's one place of risk at the overall level, it's certainly not with the consumer. What we're hearing out of the thousands of folks who are in our collection areas is that the consumer is quite strong, quite healthy. So I would say, Sanjay, the only thing that would pop up to me, of our 160-or-so card clients, we're assuming a handful, and we watch them pretty closely, are going to have a very difficult time. A couple may even head towards bankruptcy. To the extent, on the retail side, that estimate is off and there's another handful that we haven't thought about, I don't think it will hurt '18, per se, but what it will do is it will make for a tough grow-over for '19. So from a macro perspective, it's more retailer-specific, a handful we've sort of identified. It's no more than that handful.</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: And on the tax reform, Sanjay, we would say, you've seen many companies come out announcing they're going to put more money in the hands of their associates, which could lead to card holder spending more money in 2018, which could be beneficial to our card operations.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: How about Epsilon? Are businesses looking to reinvest some of the upside?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. I think from some of the reinvestments, I would call out probably 2 areas. The first in terms of reinvestment would be -- we have always -- given the size of the card business today, it was a lot easier when the file was a couple billion as opposed to heading towards $20 billion. We will be rolling out and launching a new source of funding, which will be on the consumer deposit side out of our ILC facility in Utah. And obviously, that requires a consumer platform. It requires marketing. We'll have to come up with some fancy slogan or catchy slogan, I guess, that will get people excited about what's in their purse. And then the other area would be with the CRM business at the Conversant side of it. Given the growth rates there, we will probably -- not probably, we will absolutely be ramping up the size of the sales force effort and, perhaps, focusing even more on not just the large clients, but also mid-market. So those would be the 2 big areas I would see initially for investment.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Caintic with Stephens.</p><p>VINCENT ALBERT CAINTIC, MD AND SENIOR SPECIALTY FINANCE ANALYST, STEPHENS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So first, I have to ask a question on credit. But on the in-house collection efforts that you've had so far, so I know it's early days, but given the 60 basis point headwind you had in 2017, what are you seeing so far in your experience that maybe can give us some encouragement? And then also, how you think about the level of credit reserves that you keep. We've had some good provision performance recently, but just kind of wondering how you think about credit reserves.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. Great question. Yes, we went through this whole recovery in-house versus selling to third parties post great recession, where we raised the same type of issue and we had to bring things back in-house. All right, it's pretty simple math. At a certain level, it's more profitable to push it outside. What we have found, so far, because we're about 6 months into this process, is that much like we had anticipated, if I were to put a number on it, the recovery rates internally are probably somewhere around 20% to 22% of your gross loss rates. So against a marketplace that was paying us 25%, it certainly made sense to go outside. However, that 25% dropped all the way down to 16% during '17. So as we gradually move that up to the 20%, 22% in-house, that's what we're seeing. And that's why I think we feel very good about where the net loss rate trend is going to be this year. From a gross loss perspective, it's going to be flat.</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: In terms of credit reserves, we tend to carry 11 to 13 months in terms of forward loss coverage based upon the trends we see in losses. Beginning back in 2015, we carried up to 13 months coverage all the way through the third quarter of this year. We trimmed it back to 12 based upon favorable trends. Fourth quarter, we kept it at 12 months forward coverage, which is likely where we'll stay until we see it stabilized and potentially drop lower. The key thing to keep in mind in looking at the reserve quality or the reserve coverage, if the Signet file came on late in the year, close to $1 billion, the losses embedded with the file recorded net, so there is no reserve attributable to it. So you always had to focus on the reserve divided by the reservable AR, which would not include the bulk of Signet in that number.</p><p>VINCENT ALBERT CAINTIC: Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And then separately on the -- I mean, the loyalty programs and kind of the loyalty updates, you talked about 15% AR growth in the card side and the signings' activity that you're getting there. I'm just kind of wondering how also that might translate into some growth on the Epsilon side. It seems like -- there seems to be more engagement on the overall loyalty offering that you have and if you can just give more perspective on that.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. Yes. I mean, 100% of our card clients are on the loyalty platform developed by Epsilon. The various digital distribution channels, such as email, our card clients would use the Epsilon. We are, right now, beginning a bigger push to get the unique sort of identification platform that is Conversant CRM into the hands of our card clients. So we would expect that to be a big area for us to push. I would say, across the board, our card clients are asking not only for the type of insight into their existing customers, but they also want to be able to say, \"Let me take a look at my best customers. How do I go out and find people similar to that, that may not be customers today?\" And that's the beauty of what Conversant can do with its unique ID. We can take all those characteristics and then go find these folks and, on behalf of the clients, get something really exciting that could motivate them to show up, either online or in-store at our clients. And that's sort of a new area that we're really beginning to expand. So it's not just taking care of the existing best customers. That's obviously job #1. But it's now moving into, \"Help me take a profile of my best customer and then go out into space there and find someone similar and then get them all excited about the brand.\" And that's -- that is an area that's getting our clients very excited because it's going to drive sales, and that's sort of the bottom line. So that's the big push.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray.</p><p>JASON SCOTT DELEEUW, VP &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY COMPANIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I just want to be clear on the credit recoveries. Sounds like we have some noise with the hurricanes maybe in the first quarter. But taking it in-house and then the changes you've made, I mean, shouldn't the recovery rate -- shouldn't there be a tailwind to your net charge-off rate? Or are you expecting that still kind of flat versus the 2017 level?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: That's absolutely going to be -- when it's fully up and running, it should be -- you should think 20%, 22% versus 16% that we did in 2017. So from that perspective, if you had flat delinquencies, which we have, and you're going to see flat gross loss rates and you've got this tailwind on the recoveries, as the year progresses, it certainly suggests that we're going to be in decent shape.</p><p>JASON SCOTT DELEEUW: Good. And then just on Epsilon. The technology platform revenue, it grew 7% in the quarter, so it was a nice improvement on the growth rate there. Can we sustain that level? And can you just help us understand kind of the drivers of that and then kind of the margin profile of that revenue versus the rest of Epsilon?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. I'll let Charles do the margin. In terms of the product itself, what we basically had there was the traditional Epsilon product release, big iron-type databases and loyalty platforms that were highly customized for each and every client. And they were just massive, right? They dealt with tens of millions of customers of clients, all the bells and whistles in the world. And they were, frankly, pretty cool. The problem was they cost an awful lot of money. And it took anywhere between 9 to 15 months for this thing -- for these things to be delivered and cranked up for the customer. That just wasn't feasible anymore. We were frankly a bit slow to make the pivot to transition to a lower cost, quicker delivered product. And that's what took us a full year, maybe 15 months to do. We opened a large office in India, which helped with the price point. It brought us very competitive with some of the SaaS-based solutions out there. In addition to that, we, frankly, could no longer sit there and spend 6 months getting all the bells and whistles on these platforms. And we said, \"Here's what we can deliver in a 2-month time frame.\" And so we sort of marginalized the offering. And lo and behold, with the new price point and the time to market being brought from 10 months to 2 months, we found a very receptive audience because a lot of these folks, frankly, don't want to run the things in-house. There's a big market for companies that want to run and they get SaaS-based solutions and they hire IT staff and they go do their thing. So it's also a very big market as long as we can hit the price point and we can deliver in a timely fashion, where they're saying, \"Look, I don't want to be the ones responsible for figuring out how the watch is made. I just want to know the time.\" And so that's why I think this is something that, right now, certainly seems sustainable based on the book of business we've signed.</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: Yes, Jason, from an EBITDA margin standpoint, think of technology platform being in the 18% to 20% range.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question is from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT, SENIOR MD, HEAD OF PAYMENTS, PROCESSORS &amp; IT SERVICES RESEARCH AND FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI, RESEARCH DIVISION: Could you drill down a little bit more into the mid-teens portfolio growth assumption for '18 for Card Services? More specifically, could you talk about your assumption for same-store credit sales and what the breakdown of that would be between expectation for same-store sales of your existing retailers versus expected wallet share gain?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: You bet. I think, David, it's -- we are taking a fairly conservative view based upon what we've seen over the last year or so. So for the core clients, the folks who've been with us for 3 or more years, what we have seen is they've gone from probably negative 2% or 3%, to the last quarter, they were probably -- it just broke the surface of the water, probably 0% to 1%. So we're assuming same-store sales are probably not going to be better than 1% for those core retailers. With tender share, we should be able to get to somewhere between about 4% -- 4% to 5% in terms of sales that will -- sales growth on our cards from those core. And so as you know, you go back half a dozen years or so, that 5% used to be closer to 8% or 9%. But it looks like factoring in same-store sales of about 1 point, we'll get tender share, of course, and so we're thinking 4% or 5% and then the rest will come from the big books of businesses that we've signed in '17, '16 and '15.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Got it. And then just a follow-up on capital allocation. Charles, you highlighted $1 billion of unencumbered free cash flow. How are you thinking about capital allocation priorities with your stock at its current price, let's say, balanced against potential acquisition and/or divestiture opportunities?</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: I'd say, David, we're going to be flexible on how we use that. I'd say, right now, M&amp;A is probably pretty low on the radar screen. We could use some for buyback. We could use some to pay down debt over the course of the year. Really, the focus Ed and I have is to make sure that all 3 of our segments are firing and back on track. And based upon those trends, we'll determine how we deploy that capital. So I'd say, conservatively, expect it can go to just pay down debt, delever a little bit. Even though we're in a very good shape now, it makes sense. We could do a modicum of buyback. Obviously, we have the dividend that's there as well. What I would say is just expect M&amp;A to be a relatively low priority at this point. Really, the focus, as I said, is to get all 3 of our segments back firing.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.</p><p>ANDREW WILLIAM JEFFREY, DIRECTOR, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Really nice to see Epsilon back in the mid- to high single-digit range. I'm wondering if you could provide just a little more color. Auto has been really strong. CRM is doing well. So I guess, a couple of questions. First, on auto, could you characterize how you think about the cyclicality of those -- of that end market versus sort of structural demand? And then within the CRM offering, are there any verticals, in particular, that you'd call out as being important drivers? And again, I'm just trying to get a sense for the sustainability of the growth in those 2 really important drivers of Epsilon.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, good questions. On the auto side, what's interesting is the bulk of the work that we do, both for the OEM and for the various dealerships, the thousands and thousands of dealerships, really is more after the sale is made. So it's much more in terms of service. So that doesn't have the type of variability you'll have with everything is driven off of sales, new car sales. So we're the folks who will sit there and, hopefully, use predictive analysis and more and more of the telematics, the data that comes out of the dashboard that basically will say, let you know through a text or an email or a big card in your mailbox that says, \"Hey, Andrew, it looks to me like you're about 1.5 weeks away from when it's time to get your oil changed. Come on over to the dealership and we'll give you a great deal.\" That's the type of stuff that we'll be doing. As more and more data comes from the telematics side of it, we'll be able to bug you all day long about your transmission level and all these other things that we'll be making sure you don't break down out there in California. So that's sort of it on the auto side. From the CRM side -- so the auto side shouldn't all be that cyclical. From the CRM side, look, the huge verticals, thus far, have been retail. Auto is certainly looking bigger. What else, Charles?</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: Financial.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, financials, the banks for sure. There's a couple other verticals we're beginning to look at that hold promise. So we want to take the offering and move it from just sort of a retail-type offering to auto financial services. CPG looks promising. Those are the verticals we'd be focused on.</p><p>ANDREW WILLIAM JEFFREY: Okay. And just one quick one, if I may. In technology, to the extent you're winning more there and your win rates look better, are there -- are you -- are these competitive takeaways? Or are they buy versus build decisions that you're swaying?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: I would say it's less competitive takeaways. I think it's -- the market continues. It's a very -- it's a growing market, right, as you know. It's really -- comes down to the CMO needs to decide whether she wants to have the thing built in-house and have a big tech stack, meaning let's get a SaaS-based solution and surround it with 100 tech people or now that we can have a similar price point to that offering and do it ourselves, is it okay to give up controls of the guts of this thing and just have the results pour through into her shop so he or she can just have a bunch of analysts to look at the results? So that's -- the sandbox itself is getting bigger and bigger, so I would say the vast majority of it are more and more folks who are getting into the whole concept of,</p><p>\"Hey, we can use this data in loyalty platforms to understand my customers and market to them.\" It's huge.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your last question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL SCHARF, MD AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: First question on the card side. Just a point of clarification. Ed, when I look at the components of your portfolio growth guidance this year, is the $1 billion subtraction for retailers that ultimately may become noncore, non-growing, is that just a guess and a cushion? Or are there specific programs you've identified?</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: Yes, I think it's a case. Think of it, David, we divested $800 million in December, so you know for the full year, in terms of average, that's going to be part of it. So basically, it means that there's another $200 million potential over the course of the year that we could look at and evaluate, either do a held-for-sale or could be a retailer that goes away. So said simply, the bulk of it was the divestiture we made at the end of December.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL SCHARF: Okay. Got it. And the mid-teens, Charles, that's a year-over-year -- that's a 12/31 versus 12/31 guidance apples-to-apples, that's average.</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: Average '18 over average '17.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL SCHARF: Got it. And then lastly, shifting to Epsilon, you noted the tightening labor market. Curious, you obviously took a lot of initiatives in recent years on the off-shoring side to address that. Do you feel like, based on the mix of skill sets that are needed, the composition of Epsilon as it exists today, is off-shoring as an option pretty much run its course? Or are there additional opportunities there?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Again, we view it a little differently as from off-shoring. It's actually an office that we built over there. These are Alliance Data employees just like the folks here. So it's very much keeping it within the family-type approach. I would expect we're going to have 2,000 folks over there. And no, I don't think it's run its course in terms of the cost model itself. The proportion that -- of our associate base that's over there versus here is probably getting to be at the point where we find it's comfortable. And I don't think there'll be a huge shift, either way, going forward. But in terms of the benefits on working across, both India and here in the states, we're just beginning to see that. So I would expect, while there's a nice chunk that we've picked up thus far, there's probably another chunk to go.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL SCHARF: Okay. That's helpful. And just last question quickly on the AIR MILES business. You've noted, obviously, for several quarters the challenges in issuance growth associated with the grocery segment. Is there something structural that's changed among a number of the large sponsors in terms of how much they're willing to spend on promotional activities? Or did you feel like 2017 may have just been a breather on their part as they assess maybe the fallout from the expiry events? Trying to get a sense for visibility there.</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: Yes. I think, David, it's hangover from what took place in the fourth quarter of '16 around the expiry. I think that's really what it was. Obviously, we had a number of things come on this year. We need to get Bank of Montr\\xE9al renewed, which we did around the third quarter; that should help. And I do think in the grocery vertical, we just need to get them back satisfied, get the consumers back in their stores and that, by itself, will lead to getting promotional activity back. But I would attribute it to purely hangover from the Q4 '16 event.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Okay. Thanks, everyone.

On 02/10/20, Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI announced indictment of four Chinese military officials for their role in 2017 cyberattack on EFX.</p><p>1. FBI and DOJ successfully identified attackers of EFX and US consumers.</p><p>2. This announcement is another positive step forward for EFX as Co. closed chapter on 2017 event.</p><p>2. 2017 cyber event:</p><p>1. Took $700m charge in 1H19 related to comprehensive settlement of most significant legal and regulatory matters facing EFX.</p><p>2. In 4Q19, recorded additional charge of $100m related to resolution of all remaining US legal proceedings and investigations, arising from 2017 cybersecurity incident; includes settlements reached in:</p><p>1. Securities class action.</p><p>2. Shareholder derivative litigation.</p><p>3. Financial institutions class action.</p><p>4. Lawsuits by states of Indiana and Massachusetts, who did not join last year's multi-state Attorney General settlement.</p><p>3.

Timing of that resolution of appeals is still uncertain.</p><p>3. 02/10/20's indictment by DOJ and resolution of US matters related to 2017 cyber event allows Co.'s team to fully turn page and focus on EFX2020 security and technology transformation and growth at EFX as a leading data analytics and technology co.</p><p>2. 4Q19:</p><p>1. Pleased with 4Q19 financial performance and 2019's strong progress.</p><p>2. Broad-based results:</p><p>1. Showed sequential improvement.</p><p>2. Above guidance.</p><p>3. Another positive step forward for EFX.</p><p>4. Strongest, since 2017 event.</p><p>1. Reflect EFX's return to a more normal growth mode.</p><p>3. Revenue $906m.</p><p>1. Growth:</p><p>1. Constant currency, 10%.</p><p>2. Organic constant-currency basis, 8%.</p><p>3. Above top end of Oct. guidance.</p><p>2. Strong revenue growth was driven by two US B2B businesses, USIS and EWS, collectively growing 13% overall.</p><p>1. Workforce Solutions up 22%; strongest, since 2016.</p><p>2. USIS up 8%; 2H19 performance was their strongest, since 2015.</p><p>3. US mortgage market inquiries remained strong.</p><p>1. Inquiries grew just under 21%; consistent with guidance.</p><p>4. International, constant-currency revenue grew 4%, with growth in all regions in the qtr., but with continued pressure from slowdown in Australia, Brexit uncertainty in UK and most recent unrest in Chile.</p><p>5. Global Consumer revenue grew almost 3.5% as expected, driven by recovery of US consumer business.</p><p>4. Adjusted:</p><p>1. EPS $1.53.</p><p>1. At top end of Oct. guidance.</p><p>2. EBITDA margin, 35.2%.</p><p>1. Grew 200 BP YoverY.</p><p>5. Seeing increased depreciation in duplicate cloud costs as EFX's transformed systems move into production.</p><p>1. These costs were in line with Oct. guidance.</p><p>3. USIS:</p><p>1. Revenue:</p><p>1. YoverY growth:</p><p>1. Reported, 8%.</p><p>2. Organic, 5%.</p><p>2. Total mortgage grew just over 20%, consistent with growth of mortgage market inquiries.</p><p>3. Mortgage Solutions grew 19%, much stronger than prior quarters in 2019 as Co. left negative impact of mix shift from a large mortgage retailer, which occurred in 4Q18.</p><p>2. Non-mortgage revenue grew 3%.</p><p>1. Positive organic growth.</p><p>1. Up only slightly YoverY.</p><p>2. Lower than 3Q19.</p><p>3. Lower than expectation.</p><p>4. Reflects continued choppiness of USIS recovery, discussed over past two years.</p><p>5. Saw continuations on some positive trends in USIS.</p><p>6. Feels good about accelerating USIS non-mortgage organic growth in 2020.</p><p>3. Online revenue:</p><p>1. Growth:</p><p>1. Reported, 7.5%.</p><p>2. Organic, 4.5%.</p><p>2. Saw double-digit growth in mortgage, ID and fraud, insurance and DataX, and in auto and banking and lending.</p><p>1. Very important verticals for USIS.</p><p>2. This growth was principally offset by declines in telco segment and direct-to-consumer segment.</p><p>3. Direct-to-consumer:</p><p>1. USIS sells credit files and scores to other credit reporting agencies.</p><p>2. Down, due to one-time sale that occurred in 4Q18, that did not repeat.</p><p>3. Expects this segment to return to growth in 1Q20.</p><p>4. Telco:</p><p>1. Declined.</p><p>2. Had good success with recent customer wins and win-backs.</p><p>3. Sees clear line of sight to growth in telco, moving into 2020.</p><p>4. Financial Marketing Services (FMS):</p><p>1. YoverY revenue growth:</p><p>1. 4Q19, 3.5%.</p><p>2. Full-year 2019, 2.5%.</p><p>2. While quarterly FMS revenue was still choppy, they delivered growth in three of the four quarters in 2019, which Co. views as positive.</p><p>1. Revenue growth reflects continuing growing pipeline, discussed over past couple of quarters in that business.</p><p>5. USIS team continued to show accelerating commercial activity through 2019, with good momentum coming out of 4Q19 and into 2020.</p><p>1. New deal pipeline grew 15% at 2019-end vs. 2018-end.</p><p>1.

Adjusted EBITDA margin 45.1%.</p><p>1. Down 240 BP YoverY, primarily due to increased royalty costs and higher development expense, and investments in data analytics, commercial resources and new product resources.</p><p>4. Workforce Solutions:</p><p>1. Revenue:</p><p>1. Grew 22% YoverY.</p><p>1. Much better than expectations.</p><p>2. Verification Services:</p><p>1. Grew 33%, driven by broad-based strong double-digit growth across mortgage, healthcare, debt management, auto, government and talent solution verticals.</p><p>2. Strong and broad-based revenue growth reflects continued growth in Work Number active records and rollout of new products, expansion into new verticals and addition of new customers.</p><p>3. EWS and Verification Services revenue, excluding benefit of mortgage market, grew 12% and 19%, respectively.</p><p>2. EWS team, in 2019, grew their business and expanding twin database.</p><p>1. Twin has almost 105m active records at 2019-end and over 82m active unique individuals, up 15% from a year ago, vs. roughly 170m, including self-employed individuals in US non-farm payroll, which gives Co. plenty of room to grow its database in future.</p><p>1. These twin records really drive revenue hit rates for customers and benefits to US consumers.</p><p>2. System-to-system integrations with customers allow Co. to monetize additions to twin database as soon as they are added by delivering the higher hit rates to customers, as they access EFX's database in their system-to-system applications.</p><p>3. Employer Services declined 6%.</p><p>1. In line with expectations, primarily due to expected declines at workforce analytics, ACA business, and unemployment claims business.</p><p>4. Strong verifier revenue growth resulted in strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 47%.</p><p>1. Margin were lower YoverY, principally due to:</p><p>1. Incremental third-party implementation and royalty costs associated with twin records expansion.</p><p>2. Some higher selling costs.</p><p>5. Workforce Solutions:</p><p>1.

Expects local-currency Australia revenue growth to return to growth in 1Q20 and strengthen in 2H20.</p><p>6.

Global consumer direct, which represents just under half of total GCS revenue, down only 1%.</p><p>1. Double-digit growth across UK and Canada's combined consumer direct businesses was offset by 8% decline in US consumer.</p><p>2. Although a slightly greater decline in US than expected, this still represents a substantial improvement from double-digit decline in US consumer direct, seen in 3Q and earlier in 2019.</p><p>3. GCS partner business increased 6%, due to solid growth with:</p><p>1. US partners.</p><p>2. Benefits channel.</p><p>3. Canadian breach.</p><p>4. GCS partner team:</p><p>1.

Estimate Co. provides is for 2020 mortgage market credit inquiries; bases Co.'s estimate on multiple third-party forecasts of mortgage originations in dollars, including MBA, Fannie and Freddie.</p><p>1. Current forecast originations, of about flat in 2020, is Co. believes only slightly more positive on order of 50 BP than current MBA originations forecast of down 7%.</p><p>2. Inquiries can vary meaningfully from originations, principally due to [mortgage-type mix] and timing of inquiries vs. closed loans.</p><p>3. General corporate expense $211m.</p><p>1. Adjusted general corporate expense, excluding non-recurring costs, $72m.</p><p>1. Down $4m from 4Q18.</p><p>4. Adjusted EBITDA margin 35.2%.</p><p>1. Up:</p><p>1. 200 BP YoverY.</p><p>2. 130 BP QoverQ.</p><p>2. As discussed in Oct., increase in overall adjusted EBITDA margins YtoY is driven by:</p><p>1. Positive mix as high-margin USIS and EWS had highest revenue growth rate in 4Q19.</p><p>2. Growth in margins in international and GCS.</p><p>3. Leverage on corporate costs as revenue grows.</p><p>3. Margin declines in USIS and EWS from strategic investments partially offset these increases.</p><p>5. Effective tax rate, used in calculating adjusted EPS, 22.7%.</p><p>1. Slightly below approx. 23%, Co. has provided for guidance for 4Q19 in Oct.</p><p>2. Expects 2020 effective tax rate to be [about 24%].</p><p>6. Full-year:</p><p>1. Operating cash flow, positive $314m; down $358m from 2018, more than driven by following non-recurring items.</p><p>1. EFX made payments of $341m in 3Q19 for consumer settlement announced in 2Q; no such payments were made in 2018.</p><p>2. Payments related to $57m of restructuring charges taken in 4Q18 and 1Q19 were $36m.</p><p>7. CapEx or incurred cost of capital projects in 4Q19 and YTD was [$90m and $376m, down $28m and up $8m,] respectively from 2018.</p><p>1. Excluding payments related to settlements of litigation or regulatory actions, full-year 2019 free cash flow was above $250m.</p><p>1. Better than expectations.</p><p>3. 2020 Outlook:</p><p>1. Important turning point for EFX2020 security and technology transformation as Co. accelerates move of:</p><p>1. Data exchanges to data fabric at GCP.</p><p>2. Customer transitions to Ignite InterConnect API framework.</p><p>3. Identity and fraud customers transition to using new systems at AWS.</p><p>2. As Co. puts cloud-native systems into production, it will begin to depreciate these new systems, and incur cloud and other operating costs of running these new cloud-native systems.</p><p>1. It will generally take 6-12 months from start of production to fully transition a legacy exchange or decisioning system to a new cloud-native system.</p><p>1. During that time period, Co. will incur cloud and other operating costs of new system, and operating costs of the legacy systems.</p><p>2. As 2020 is a transition year and decommissioning of legacy systems is not expected to substantially occur until late 4Q20 and 2021, Co. will incur these additional system transition costs for much of 2020.</p><p>2. For 2020, expects these additional system transition costs to be in the range of $0.40-0.50 per share, with:</p><p>1. Increased depreciation, representing about two-thirds of this additional cost.</p><p>2. Cloud costs, net of any legacy system decommissioning savings, representing approx. one-third of this cost.</p><p>3. Moving into 2021, expects savings from decommissioning of legacy systems to exceed incremental cloud costs, resulting in net benefit to P&amp;L as opposed to duplicate cost, Co. will be incurring in 2020.</p><p>1. When this transition is complete, expects to generate significant cost savings of 15%-plus savings in technology cost portion of COGS.</p><p>2. Technology cost portion of COGS represents just under 15% of total COGS and 25% reduction in development spend, both in expense and capital.</p><p>3. Expects new single-data fabric and cloud-based applications to accelerate innovation and new products that will be accretive to growth rate.</p><p>3. Total revenue, $3.65-3.75b.</p><p>1. Reflects constant-currency revenue growth of 4-7%.</p><p>1. US mortgage market will be about flat.</p><p>2. FX will negatively impact revenue by almost 1% and adjusted EPS by about $0.03.</p><p>3. Revenue:</p><p>1. USIS to be up mid-single digits.</p><p>2. EWS to deliver double-digit revenue growth with strong growth in Verification Services; Employer Services is expected to be flat to down.</p><p>3. International will grow mid-single digits, with growth strengthening in 2H20, due to expected economic improvement in Australia and Europe.</p><p>4. GCS will grow mid-single digits with continued growth in partner business at ID Watchdog and in UK and Canada consumer direct businesses; expects US consumer direct to return to growth late in 2020.</p><p>4. Adjusted EPS, $5.60-5.80.</p><p>1. Reflects constant-currency growth of approx. flat to 3.5% vs. 2019.</p><p>2. Impacting adjusted EPS in 2020 is $0.40-0.50 per share of increased depreciation and additional system transition costs.</p><p>1. This represents approx. 8 percentage points of growth in adjusted EPS.</p><p>3. Excluding this tech transition impact, adjusted EPS growth is 8-11%.</p><p>1. Helps gives a clear picture of post-EFX2020 earnings power of EFX.</p><p>5. Due to substantial increase in depreciation, Co. will, in 2020, add to its discussion with more focus on adjusted EBITDA margins, which it believes will better reflect true earnings power of EFX.</p><p>1. Adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by approx. 50-100 BP.</p><p>1. This includes a drag of about 50 BP from additional system transition costs.</p><p>2. Excluding this transition cost, adjusted EBITDA margins will expand between 100-150 BP in 2020.</p><p>2. Duplicate legacy and cloud costs will be in place during 2020 and 2021, as Co. migrates customers to new cloud environments and decommission legacy mainframe and server environments.</p><p>6. In 2020, expects to incur approx. $255m in non-recurring expenses.</p><p>1. Comprises:</p><p>1. Non-recurring security and technology transformation expenses, $250m.</p><p>2. Legal and regulatory expenses, less than $5m.</p><p>2. This does not include cost of any potential judgments or other regulatory outcomes, should they occur.</p><p>3. In 2021, will no longer exclude these non-recurring expenses from adjusted EPS.</p><p>7. CapEx, approx. $335m.</p><p>8. Several important assumptions impact 2020 in total and individual quarters.</p><p>1. US mortgage market inquiries:</p><p>1. For all of 2020, to be flat.</p><p>2. 1Q20 to remain strong, up over 21% YtoY.</p><p>3. 2Q20 to be about flat.</p><p>4. Expects inquiries to decline about 10% in each of 3Q and 4Q.</p><p>2. Corporate costs to increase approx. $45m vs. 2019.</p><p>1. Depreciation expense to increase [over $15m].</p><p>2. 2020 corporate costs, excluding depreciation, to increase YoverY by about $30m, principally in security and technology and equity compensation.</p><p>3. Higher security and technology costs are partially a result of system transitions in 2020 as Co. invests to ensure it maintains high levels of security in new cloud-native and legacy systems.</p><p>4. As Co. decommissions legacy systems at a more rapid pace beginning in late 2020, would expect these security and technology costs to moderate.</p><p>5. Over half of 2020 total increase of $45m in corporate costs will occur in 1Q20.</p><p>3. Interest expense to increase [about $30m] or $0.08 per share in 2020, reflecting incremental borrowings to fund legal settlement payments in 3Q19 and 1Q20.</p><p>1. About two-thirds of this increase will occur in 1H20.</p><p>2. Guidance does not reflect any incremental borrowings associated with approx. $355m remaining in consumer legal settlements, as the timing of that payment is still not known.</p><p>4. Tax rate to be slightly higher than 2019 tax rate at 24%.</p><p>5. Expecting normal seasonal pattern for reported revenue and adjusted EPS.</p><p>1. 1Q, the lowest.</p><p>2. 3Q and 4Q, the highest in dollar terms.</p><p>3. In YoverY growth rates, would expect 1Q20 to have highest growth rates for revenue and adjusted EPS.</p><p>4. 1Q20 Outlook:</p><p>1. Revenue, $915-930m.</p><p>1. Reflects constant-currency revenue growth of 9-11%.</p><p>2. Adjusted EPS, $1.29-1.34.</p><p>3. FX is expected to negatively impact:</p><p>1. Revenue by over 1% in 1Q20.</p><p>2. Adjusted EPS by $0.01 per share.</p><p>1. Higher interest expense negatively impacts adjusted EPS by $0.03 per share vs. 1Q19.</p><p>4. Tax rate, about 25%.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.</p><p>ANDREW CHARLES STEINERMAN, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just wanted to understand how you're using the word mortgage inquiries, like to be flat in 2020, as your team's expectation, is that supposed to be a proxy for Equifax' revenues in 2020 for that part of the business which you said was about 19%? And if so, a 4% to 7% constant currency revenue growth would mean kind of high-single-digit non-mortgage revenue growth, right?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE, CORPORATE VP &amp; CFO, EQUIFAX INC.: Yes. So the credit inquiries is exactly as it sounds, right? It's with each mortgage transaction, we get an inquiry. And we're simply trying to let you know what we forecast those inquiries to be for the year. And as I said, we estimate that based on the information we have in terms of the number of inquiries that we get per closed mortgage loan, and then we use the forecast provided by MBA and Freddie and Fannie to do an overall originations forecast, and then we translate it into credit inquiries. So it does reflect the inquiries we receive. It isn't necessarily a proxy for our revenue because, obviously, there's pricing changes in a year. We also get new records in Workforce Solutions, so we get growth from that. And we also launch new products in mortgage, which drives our growth higher.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, EQUIFAX INC.: And we also get some penetration with some mortgage customers where they're using our either credit reports or the TWN records 2 times, 3 times, 4 times in their mortgage process. So that's another part of our revenue model.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Yes, absolutely. So -- and as you know, historically, we've tended to outperform the inquiry index. So it is to give you a view as to what we think the market is going to do in terms of the number of times the market will request information from the credit bureaus.</p><p>ANDREW CHARLES STEINERMAN: Right. And then, John, the second part was to do 4% to 7% constant currency revenue growth, you're assuming that 19% of your revenues is a headwind. So you would have to do kind of high-single-digit constant currency revenue growth in the non-mortgage segment, right?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: So certainly, our guidance indicates that non-mortgage is going to be higher, right? Is going to do better. Now again, but you have to keep in mind, we'll outperform that -- EWS, for example, as they continue to grow records, will certainly outperform in the mortgage segment the revenue they generate versus that inquiry index. So you can't just use the credit inquiries as a proxy directly to revenue because certainly, we do perform differently than that in certain circumstances.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p><p>KEVIN DAMIEN MCVEIGH, MD, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: So John, if I heard you right, it seems like if you added back the depreciation, the EPS would $6 to $6.20. That's a lot better than where The Street is on revenue, which is pretty much in line. Is that the mix in EWS? Or where else is that leverage coming through in the model?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Just ask the question one more time. I didn't fully follow. I'm sorry.</p><p>KEVIN DAMIEN MCVEIGH: Yes. So it looks like there's -- the depreciation, if I heard you right, it was kind of a $0.40 to $0.50 headwind, the duplicative depreciation, which would imply $6 to $6.20 versus -- or your guidance would be $6 to $6.20 versus The Street at</p><p>$5.80. That's a lot better than kind of where The Street is, the adjusted EPS versus kind of where the revenue guidance is relative to The Street. Is that just the mix that's driving it? And I guess, I'm assuming there's some margin outperformance there. Is that margin outperformance in Workforce Solutions, or am I just not thinking about that right?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: So what we indicated was it was $0.40 to $0.50 per share for both the increase in depreciation, and the duplicate costs were occurring because we're running both cloud systems and our legacy systems until those legacy systems are decommissioned. So that is 40% to 50%. And yes, we did say that's about 8 points of growth in the year. So relative to where The Street was, I can't specifically address that. But I can indicate that we did, in the third quarter, give pretty specific guidance as to how much we thought our depreciation would go up, right? So I think there was a pretty good understanding generally prior to the fourth quarter beginning, following our third quarter earnings call, that we were going to see significantly increased depreciation in 2020. And we are also going to see significant increases in cloud costs in 2020. So I think that information was broadly out there before.</p><p>KEVIN DAMIEN MCVEIGH: That's helpful. And then, just with the indictments, does that open the potential that maybe you can recover some of those costs you have incurred already, the outcome insurance? Or does that change the outcome in terms of what you've already incurred?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: I think we've fully taken advantage of our insurance coverage there as far as any recovery. So our expectation is that the charges that we took last year and the charge we took in the fourth quarter will be Equifax-funded. These are all net -- the numbers we shared with you are net of insurance.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK, DIRECTOR &amp; LEAD RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mark, you've -- over the course of the year, talked a lot about how the pipeline will be improving, new products and all the progress you've made. But at the same time, I think it's been a few quarters where you said the ex-mortgage, USIS, has been short of your expectations. So I was just curious if you could just help us bridge that gap? And maybe what is your expectation for USIS ex-mortgage for 2020?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, I think that John talked about, we expect that USIS overall to be in the mid-single digits. With regards to expectations, we've got a high bar here. That's how I operate. I think that's -- Manav, you know that we want that business to return to its historical growth rates. It's making great progress. I think you know, a year ago, when we were on this call with fourth quarter of 2018, that business was in the flat-to-negative mode and was just getting out of the penalty box with our customers. And we're now 4 quarters or so into that recovery. We're making great progress as far as their pipeline's building and their win rates, and we see some really positive momentum as we move into 2020. We expect that business to continue to improve as we go through the year and expect it to return to its historical growth rate. It's just a matter of time. It's still one that -- the non-mortgage growth, there's a lot of variables there as far as pipelines being rebuilt and the timing of closing deals that we've talked about virtually every quarter that since the cybersecurity incident. But we're just seeing deeper pipelines and better win rates, which gives us confidence as we go into 2020.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: I just want to make sure -- to Andrew's initial question, just to make sure I was clear, right? So Equifax has historically performed better than the mortgage index in terms of our revenue. So again, as you're doing your analysis on the implications of our mortgage market guidance in terms of its implication to our non-mortgage revenue growth, you need to please recognize and take a look at history of the fact that we've generally significantly outperformed the mortgage index in terms of our own mortgage revenue growth.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: Got it. John, just 2 clarifications on the guidance. So one, could you just -- is there any M&amp;A baked into it, whether that's India or any of the other tuck-ins you did from this prior year? And then I lost you a little bit on the $0.40 to $0.50 that you're incurring this year and how that -- the savings that you said was 1/3 of the cloud cost or something. I was hoping if you could just help me with that in '21?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Yes. So in terms -- the only thing we include in our guidance is acquisitions that have actually closed, so there'll be no new acquisitions included.</p><p>In terms of the -- I think you're asking about the $0.40 to</p><p>$0.50 per share in transition costs, in system transition costs?</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: Yes.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: That $0.40 to $0.50 per share is made up of 2 things. We said about 2/3 of it is incremental depreciation, right? So we've been investing heavily over the past several years, building new production systems, cloud-native production systems in the cloud. And as they go into production, obviously, we start to depreciate them. So of that $0.40 to $0.50, we've said about 2/3 of it will be substantial increase in depreciation in 2020 versus 2019. And that's -- and then about 1/3 of the incremental costs is related to duplicate costs in operations because we're running cloud systems as well as our legacy systems in parallel for an extended period of time while we migrate customers. So we're incurring effectively double cost, the cost of the existing legacy premise system as well as the cost of the cloud system during the transition period. And we said that transition cost, the period of running 2 sets of systems, would be about 1/3 of that $0.40 to $0.50 per share. And the final comment I made is on that specific cost, the duplicate cost of running 2 sets of systems, we had said as we move into 2021, as we move through the year, we expect that to actually become a positive, where the savings related to shutting down legacy systems will exceed cloud costs, and that will start to become a positive for the company.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: And Manav, just to add to that. It's Mark. I think as you know, a lot of our investors have asked for some transparency around that because number one, on the second point John raised on the duplicative cloud costs, as you know, those aren't going to be here forever. And those are going to start, as we decommission systems, that will turn into being a positive. There will be some of that 2020. That's in our guidance now and the numbers John talked about, and that only accelerate in 2021, and we'll get to a fully migrated basis sometime in the future, and we'll give you guidance on that. So that was that element. And then on the increased amortization, same thing. That's a temporary element, if you will, which will be there for a number of years of that increased amortization, which is a noncash item, and that's going to work its way down as we amortize off our investments in the cloud costs. And as you know, our intention is to reduce our CapEx spending in 2021 as we complete the cloud migration. So our intention is to be clear about our guidance, which John gave you, but also give the additional visibility of what's inside that guidance so you can be aware and think about what Equifax looks like on the other side.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: And just what was the M&amp;A contribution, John? I know you assume only deals closed. So what is that in 2020?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: It's relatively small, right? If you think about -- we closed PayNet in the -- I think, in the second quarter of 2019, and that was the largest acquisition for the year. So there -- in the fourth quarter, we gave some indication. Total -- the total amount of acquisition revenue was just over 1% of revenue, so not a significant number, and it should decline as we move through 2020. Well, it's -- move through 2020.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from George Mihalos with Cowen.</p><p>ALLISON MICHELLE JORDAN, ASSOCIATE, COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Allison on for George. I wanted to follow up on the comments made about Workforce Solutions margins in the quarter. I think I heard that the year-over-year decline was driven by third-party implementation royalty costs. I'm just curious if there's anything else to call out there, maybe mix? And how we should think about segment margins going forward in 2020?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, I also mentioned, Allison, that there was some additional sales costs in the fourth quarter in that business, which puts some pressure on margins. I think John also said that we expect that business to expand margins in 2020. And we don't see any change in that, but they're high growth in their inherent margins. That's a business that we expect expanding margins going forward.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: And just to make sure you were clear. The royalty costs are actually separate from the third-party implementation costs, right? So those are 2 different cost items that affected us in the quarter. As well as, obviously, increased sales expense.</p><p>ALLISON MICHELLE JORDAN: Okay, great. That's super helpful. And then just one quick follow-up. Mark, I heard you mention the solid progress being made with positive data in Australia. I'm curious if we should expect any impact from this in 2020?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, we hope it will be accretive as we go through the year. We've seen in all the markets where positive data comes in, it obviously first takes a lot of time to get that data from the contributors into Equifax and the other credit bureaus and then turning that into usable information that we can take to the marketplace has a lag to it. The good news is we have the data now, which we've been working to get there. So we expect it will be a positive element for that team in 2020.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.</p><p>HAMZAH MAZARI, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: My first question is just if you could just talk about how long your sales cycle today is on new products currently? And maybe how much they're contributing to growth today versus sort of pre-breach, just to give us a sense?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Go. Take it, John.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Perfect. So sales cycle, it really depends on the product, right? So if it's a batch product, something that we've sold historically, that's effectively reselling. It's something that can sometimes be initiated and transacted within a period. For implementing a new online service with a customer, the implementation period can be over a year, right? And it really depends on the service. In terms of NPI contribution, new product contribution in 2019 versus prior years, I think what we tried to be clear on is the level of acceleration we're seeing in new product launches, which we think is very beneficial as we go forward into 2020 and 2021. Obviously, the level of new product revenue we generated in 2019 and 2018 was certainly down from what we saw historically because of the fact that we didn't have the same level of product generation over the 2017-28 (sic) [2018] period. So that was a -- so we're seeing a period of lower new product revenue generation, but we see very good signs that, that will start to recover as we move into 2020 and then certainly, 2021.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: If you heard my comments, just to add on that. New product innovation is a real priority of ours, and it's one that obviously, we had some pressures on following the cybersecurity incident with all our focus on security and remediation and everything else. And I'm pleased that our efforts in 2019 to make this a priority central to Equifax' strategy. And you saw the performance of us rolling out the highest new products in a number of years in 2019, and that emphasis is going to continue. We really believe that our cloud transformation and having our single data fabric and our having our products in the cloud is going to allow us to even accelerate that going forward. And this is an area that we're going to continue to invest resources, time and money on because of the positive impact it will have in the future around our top line by investing in more new products.</p><p>HAMZAH MAZARI: Very helpful. Just a follow-up question, I'll turn it over. Could you give us a sense of how much of your portfolio is sort of directly linked to the credit cycle versus how much of the portfolio is just data similar to sort of an info services company? Any sense of rough percentage? Or qualitatively, anything -- any comments there?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: I think the best thing I can suggest is if you take a look at the earnings deck that we published, we published obviously last quarter, and there'll be one published today. In it, we show revenue by market segment for Equifax and for the -- for each of the business units. And that's probably the best place to take a look to -- so you can judge based on where we sell and how you think that is impacted by the credit cycle. I think that's the best source for you.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: I think the other thing that you should be aware of is that our business and our industry, during a credit cycle, obviously, expenditures by our customers on new originations may come down, but then there's a shift in the focus to the back book, to managing credit lines. So there's an element of counter cyclicality to it. And then the other element that's quite different at Equifax today versus the last economic cycle is the mix of our businesses. We're obviously larger internationally than we were in the last economic cycle. And then second, Workforce Solutions is a very different scale in our business in size. And Workforce Solutions has that additional lever in a credit cycle of the ability to continue to add new data records that are monetizable. So that's another element of -- that's how we think about ourselves if there is a credit cycle, we're very different, in a positive way, than we were in the last credit cycle.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Barry -- Gary Bisbee with Bank of America.</p><p>GARY ELFTMAN BISBEE, MD &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I was hoping to dig in a little bit more to the USIS growth organic ex-mortgage slowing from, I guess, it was 3% to slightly positive. Part of it, clearly, I understand financial marketing and an outsized growth quarter last quarter and maybe a more normalized trend number this quarter. And so that's part of it. And you called out a couple of the end markets that were a little weaker. But can you give us any other color just to understand this, and maybe how we think about the cadence of that into Q1? That would be helpful.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Go, John.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Sure. So the -- yes, I think in Mark's script, right, he talked specifically about direct -- our D2C business, which is the transactions we do with our competitors. And part of the reason that was down obviously was because we had a transaction that occurred in -- a sale that occurred in the fourth quarter of '18, that was one-time that didn't recur, and that directly impacted the organic growth in the period.</p><p>And then also, we talked about telco, and yes, it was down, but we think we see very nice path to growth as we get into second quarter and beyond in 2020. So I think overall, we're expecting to see nice improvement in our level of organic non-mortgage growth as we move into 2020 and beyond. So we do like the trend, right? We said it would be choppy, so that doesn't mean the trend is always straight up. But we do like the trend, we do see continuing improvement, that the sales metrics are very good, the level of growth in pipeline is outstanding and we're very happy with our performance. So I think overall, we're expecting to see nice improvement in 2020 relative to 2019 in total and certainly relative to where we ended the year.</p><p>GARY ELFTMAN BISBEE: And then a follow-up, just on the pipeline, you've referred to improvement and growth, but in absolute terms, is like the -- is the pipeline back to where it was in mid-2017? Or are you still below that? And as part of that, historically, with NPI, you guys talked about a 3-year build to sort of mature revenues. '17 and '18, you had a lot less product development in NPI or new products as you were trying to fix some of the challenges. Is the fact that you had those product launches in '19, should we think it's a 3-year process to really get a lot of that stuff, particularly in USIS, getting the business back churning the way one might expect it to on a normalized basis?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: You hit a lot of the challenges that we've had following the cyber event. First was we had a pipeline in place the day before the cyber event happened, and that pipeline went virtually to 0 for the balance of 2017 and through the bulk of 2018. As you know, we were on security freeze for much of 2018. And as we finished</p><p>'18 and moved into '19, we were able to start getting into a more commercial mode when customers grew quite comfortable about our security protocols and our investments, and that pipeline has been building rapidly through 2019. And John, I don't know if it's -- I believe it's actually back or above where it was pre 2017, and we've seen real growth in that. We've also got a different leader in the business, who's got a real commercial cadence to him, and so there's real intensity around pulling that forward. I wouldn't think about a new product taking a full 3 years to get to revenue. I think we've talked about before that there's a maturity element in that. But each of these new products have a different cycle depending upon the customer. You've got a customer that the operations team or the marketing team or the risk team really likes the product and then they want to test it, and then they go -- we go through a contracting process with their sourcing team many times. And then, of course, then you go into implementation mode, which sometimes includes their IT team. And that creates some unpredictability in a pipeline that, maybe to your point, is less mature, meaning you don't have 2-year-old deals in there, 3-year-old deals, 1-year-old, 6-months, you don't have that layering. Our pipeline today is more of a, call it, a 12-month kind of build versus a historical would have 2, 3 and -- 2- and 3-year kind of deals in there that sometimes take that amount of time. So I think that layering creates some of the choppiness. But the fact that the pipeline is building, we're seeing better win rates out of the pipeline in the second half of the year than the first half, which tells us that we've got a better pipeline. And that commercial activity gives us the enthusiasm about the continued progress of USIS going forward as we get into first quarter in 2020.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: And Mark specifically referenced new deals won in his script. And yes, that is -- that's up higher than we saw prior to 2017.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Right.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: So we think the momentum is good.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>TONI MICHELE KAPLAN, SENIOR ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: In an interview the other day, Mark, you mentioned that you're about 2/3 of the way through the tech transformation. And you mentioned some color earlier in terms of what you've done and what you have left to do. I guess, my question is can you just give some color on how much risk is left in terms of execution? Like have a lot of the difficult items been done already, or is there still a lot to come? And just any color on that would be helpful.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Sure. And I talked a bunch of my comments earlier, Toni, about that. And I think, first off, as you know, these kind of tech transformations are not for the faint of heart, meaning that you use the term risk, but there's a lot to do and a lot to work on. We're 2 years into it, call it that, whatever, that kind of time frame. And the milestones we're achieving around this -- when I think about a tech transformation like this, and I've done them before, obviously, not at this scale, but I've done them before. First off, you have to make sure does the technology work? Meaning, can we get our databases from our legacy applications into the cloud. And I think we're making this big move of going from siloed databases to a single data fabric. And that's in place. We did that in 2019. We've started moving our exchanges. As you know, we have -- I don't know what the number is, but probably a couple hundred exchanges around the globe, close to 50 here in the U.S., where we have some big ones. And we're moving big ones into that new Google Cloud fabric, and it's working. We have customers accessing it. So that's kind of risk #1 is, will the technology work. And I think we're over that hurdle. The second one is you've got to migrate your customers. And we've been very clear with you that the feedback from customers is extremely positive. If you think about it, if you're a customer, do you want to do business with a company that has the very latest technology, that's going to deliver always-on capabilities, that's going to deliver a latency and speed that is not possible in the industry today, and with security that's second to none given the focus on data security. And so customers all want to do it. The wildcard or that one complexity that I talked about in my comments earlier is getting into their schedule. And every one of our customers has an IT team, they've got their own priorities for 2019, '20 and '21, and we just have to make sure we fit into that. So that's, that scheduling or forecasting element that I talked about earlier. But as you also heard in the comments, we're really rolling, meaning we're moving thousands of customers. And so there's real progress there, but it just takes time. And of course, we need to move all our customers off each of our different mainframe or server environments at different data centers we have in order to decommission those and get the savings that we're looking for from the technology transformation. So to me, it's really around execution. And you've heard our transparency around the technology element, and we feel very good about that. And we're making real progress around the customer migrations, but there's still work to be done there.</p><p>TONI MICHELE KAPLAN: Great. And then with the legal settlement almost behind you, pending the final payment, I guess, any new thoughts around capital allocation, notably, like when we could start seeing share repurchases?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, I think you're leading me towards our financial framework, which, as you know, we pulled in 2017. We've been clear with you that we want to put that back in place. We're getting closer to that time frame. We've been very consistent. We talked about 3 areas that we wanted to make sure we had clarity on before we put that framework back in place, which will include our capital allocation model. One was real clarity on the legal settlements. And with today's announcement of the finalization of the U.S. issues, we're at that stage with that first item.</p><p>Number two is the tech transformation. We already talked about that. Really having some clarity about timetable, our execution, our confidence in that. And I'd say every day and week, we get closer to completing that one.</p><p>And number three is USIS. And we're way further along than we were a year ago, and even in the fourth quarter with our confidence in USIS. And so just a long-winded answer that it's our expectation that the way we're pacing that we're looking to put that framework back in place for sure in 2020.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank next question will come from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.</p><p>WILLIAM ARTHUR WARMINGTON, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So first off, a tip of the hat to Jeff Dodge. It's one of those, just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in situations, I think.</p><p>So my question is, you gave some strong new stats on the new deals won in the fourth quarter. I was just hoping to get some color there. You mentioned some on telco, some wins and win backs. But for the new wins, how many are going to new customers? How many are share gains? How many are just additional sales into the same customers?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, Bill, it's probably hard to split. I would just tell you that it's all of the above. First off, new wins, as you know, a competitive takeaway is hard, and it's one that we all work on, but we've had a handful of those. So that's in that bucket. New products are really a fuel for us, whether it's InstaTouch or Ignite rollouts or some of the new products and scores that we talked about that we've got in the marketplace. Those are bread and butter, really helping our customers grow their originations, solving on fraud. So that's a positive. And then share gains, we've had a handful of those, too. And I think you're talking mostly about USIS in your comments or that's where your question is directed. But of course, broadly, that's the fuel for our growth in Equifax is to look for expanding either new customers, new verticals, penetration and share gains with existing customers. New products are really a big fuel for growth. And I hope you get a sense of the focus we have around the new products. It's a real priority of mine. It's one that I think our tech transformation is going to leverage. It's going to give us real fuel in '20 and '21 and beyond as we go forward to really be more aggressive around funding new products, investing in new products and then bringing them into the marketplace.</p><p>WILLIAM ARTHUR WARMINGTON: And for a follow-up question. Just wanted to see if we could get an update on the FICO partnership, how that's been going? And maybe some comments on the Inflection score that you're putting together with Verisk?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, first on the FICO partnership, as you know, we announced that last March. We're in the marketplace with our integrated decisioning system inside of FICO with our data piped in there. And we're in with a handful of customer POCs. We've had a handful of customer wins around the globe. So we're pleased with that performance with FICO. And I think you know, we're rolling out some other products, including an AML/KYC here in the United States that's going to be in market in the first quarter. And we've got some other opportunities there. So there's a great collaboration between Equifax and FICO around how we can leverage our respective capabilities in the marketplace, and we'll look forward to that growth going forward.</p><p>The score with Verisk is new. It's just in the marketplace. We've had good response from customers so far. I think it's another example of what we -- what I like to do and we like to do is really collaborating with strong partners like FICO or Verisk to really leverage our respective assets and market capabilities to bring new solutions to the marketplace, and that's just another example. So that one's just newly launched in the marketplace.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from Jeff Meuler with Baird.</p><p>JEFFREY P. MEULER, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes, it sounds like, given the CapEx guidance for 2020, that depreciation is going to continue to build in '21. So can you give us some sense of once you're through EFX2020, and I know there's some spillover into '21, what does CapEx go to as a percentage of revenue on an ongoing basis? Because I think the 25% development savings are both OpEx and CapEx. So that would be part one of the question, so we can get to EBITDA less CapEx.</p><p>And then part two, on the 15%-plus of tax savings within COGS, do you get the substantial majority of that on a gross basis in 2022? And I understood there could be some reinvestment. Just trying to figure out the timing of when you'll get the step-up on that?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Jeff, you're leading us quite tactfully into a financial framework, so let me give you my best response to that. I think they're very good questions. And first, on the CapEx, we're not ready to give '21 guidance, but -- or a financial framework for our capital allocation in the future. But we've been clear with you that we expect: number one, the incremental spend that we've had in '18,</p><p>'19 and '20, to fund the EFX2020 cloud transformation. We've been very clear that, that's going to come down in '21 and will continue at a more normal rate going forward, meaning versus this incremental rate that we've had in '18, '19 and '20. And we've really shown you what the incremental dollars are. So I think you can think about what it looks like on the other side. And then as you pointed out, we've also been clear that we expect to see development savings, meaning with a new tech stack, with a single standardized set of products, we expect to see savings in the future. So that will be a part of that CapEx benefit in the future post-2020. And where we get the full run rate will be something we'll come to you when we put the financial framework in place.</p><p>On the operating cost savings, we've also been clear that we expect to see inside of our cost structure for technology real savings from going from legacy to cloud. That is -- we have some of that feathering in our guidance. It's in our numbers for 2019 -- I'm sorry, for 2020. That will continue to accelerate through the year as we decommission legacy environments, and that will continue into 2021. And we're not ready to give a run rate on that, but we tried to give you both by sharing what we view as the duplicate costs as well as that guidance around our expectation of 15% to 20% operating cost savings from technology going forward so you can think about what Equifax looks like in the future. And as you know, those 2 benefits, along with -- we expect some accretion to our top line from ability to roll out more new products from the new technology investment are the 3 benefits that we're driving to as a part of this big tech investment.</p><p>JEFFREY P. MEULER: Okay. And then just how meaningful is this EWS data hub concept like the new data sources beyond employment and income data? Just any additional color on that or how meaningful this is.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes. It's another element, Jeff. I think we've been very clear that we think more data results in better decisions for our customers. And EWS has a very unique position in a lot of verticals with their income and employment data that they provide. As you know, it's really the only place to go to get that data set, and a lot of our customers have to go to other data sets to get other data. And either us building that out, us partnering on it or making acquisitions to add those data sets we think is another lever for growth for EWS. It's part of that theme that I've used with the team internally and with you and others in the investment community that while Workforce Solutions is clearly our best business, it's performing way above the rest of Equifax. We think about it being in the second inning with the opportunities in front of it, both in its core business, but also in what it can do around things like leveraging its market position and its unique data assets with other capabilities in order to bring more value to our customers.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.</p><p>ANDREW OWEN NICHOLAS, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: You touched briefly on your decision to increase your ownership stake to 100% in ECIS in India, which is obviously a fast-growing market. Can you talk a little bit more about your business in India today, how you think about the opportunity set there? And then any color on ECIS' competitive positioning? That would be helpful.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes. It's a business that, as you know, we've been in for a long time. We like the market a lot. We had the opportunity and strategically owning 100% of the business makes it easier to operate, easier to control, and then we kind of own our whole destiny. So we're very pleased to move forward on that. I think it's a market we want to be in. It's a market that we want to grow. You may know that we're doing a build of Workforce Solutions in India, as an example. We started that a couple of years ago, and that's got some traction on it. We just think it's a market that we want to play in. And one that's a big market.</p><p>ANDREW OWEN NICHOLAS: Great. And then just back on organic revenue growth guidance, just to ask it another way. Can you just walk us through what you consider to be the primary factors that would drive you to the top and bottom ends of that guide outside of any changes to mortgage inquiry volumes?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, I'll give you a few thoughts. I don't want to go too far in this. But obviously, USIS is still not back to where it was before the cyber event. And we're convinced -- I've been very clear. It's not a matter of if, it's only when. But their recovery, which we see great momentum in, if that accelerates, that's a real positive for us near term and long term, so that's a very positive one.</p><p>International, I think as you know, we gave guidance on where we expect the year to be, but we're still battling some economic headwinds. Brexit, while it's resolved, there's still some uncertainty on implementation and what it's going to do to the economy over there, so I think that's a little bit of a headwind. Latin America seems to have settled down, but that tends to be temporary. There's always issues and challenges down there. And of course, Australia, we've seen some positive momentum, but the recent wildfires there, some are saying could have an economic impact there. So I think that's another factor in there.</p><p>And then the real positive is, obviously, Workforce Solutions has some great momentum, is performing extremely well, and that's kind of a bedrock inside of Equifax that we've got a lot of confidence in, that they continue to perform. And they performed last year above our expectations quite significantly. And we expect them to continue to perform very, very well in 20 -- 2020.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Just want to be clear, right? So we provided overall guidance, and we provided mortgage market inquiry guidance, right? We didn't give mortgage guide -- mortgage revenue guidance or non-mortgage revenue guidance. And again, just to repeat where we started, right? So we did say flat for the total mortgage inquiry market, but people should keep in mind that historically, we have performed -- our revenue has performed better than the overall mortgage inquiry market, in some cases, substantially. So that's a judgment you're going to have to make for yourself.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes, [Brian] on for George. So I was just looking at your 2020 revenue guidance, which I know comes below your prior long-term target of 6% to 8%. I know you haven't reinstated financial targets yet. But based on customer conversation, to what degree do you believe long-term organic growth potential of the business isn't halted?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes. Again, got a similar question earlier,</p><p>[Brian], on long-term guidance, we clearly gave you our guidance for 2020. We're not ready to put a long-term financial framework back in place. Although we're working towards that in 2020. We talked about the things we want to see, and we're getting really close to that. So I think I'll just leave it at that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. And then for your revenue guidance, what level of price increases are baked into that?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Yes. So we didn't give specific information on price increases, right? So generally speaking, there's some level of price increase in the market. However, for credit reports, in general, if you think about those, they tend to go down in price over time. So we haven't given specific price increase guidance as part of this process.</p><p>And operator, we have time for one more.</p><p>OPERATOR: And our final question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM, MD, STIFEL, NICOLAUS &amp; COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: The company used to just give straight-out organic growth, excluding mortgage. And I was just wondering, there's a lot of positivity in terms of the sales momentum. That's not a number, though, that you're providing now. And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more just clarity -- just as the rubber meets the road, the organic growth of the business, excluding the mortgage, just so that we can track. Was it a little bit up? Was it a little bit down? Where are we doing in terms of actual sales and things coming into revenue?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: So we actually are giving that -- we gave that number, I think, each quarter last year, right, in terms of organic non-mortgage growth. We indicated this quarter, it was up slightly. Last quarter, I think it was just under 3%. And I think we gave it each of the first 2 quarters as well. So we are trying to give that indication. And we're also trying to separately give a view of just what the market did so you can have some perspective. So I think the depth of information is actually quite good in terms of how USIS is performing to let you kind of disaggregate the performance by piece.</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM: So this -- I'm talking about for the whole company. So that net numbers -- the numbers you're referring to for the whole company?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: That's for USIS.</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM: Okay. And just -- if I took the whole company together just in mortgage, and should I look at it as like 8.5% growth, minus 4% that would be implied by -- inquiries?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: So Shlomo, we do give mortgage as what percentage of the total company mortgage revenue is, right? So I think from that, you can get a good view as what -- of what mortgage revenue is for the entire company and how it's changing. And that's information we also provide.</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM: So is it going up or down? I mean, just -- it's just a question. If I look at it, is the mortgage, the non-mortgage revenue organically up or down? And just -- I know it's choppy. I'm just trying to see if I can do the calculation the way I used to do it.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: So that isn't something specifically we disclose, right? So -- but I kind of walked you through what we do disclose, and that I think the information is available for you to do whatever analytics you'd like, okay?</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM: Okay. And then what drove the strong EBITDA margins in international?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Yes. So I think Mark walked through that in his discussion, right? So we got back to growth. They did some very significant cost reduction actions. As you take a look at fourth quarter of '18 and 2019 through that entire period. So their cost structure got nicely better. And as they return to growth, they got a lot of leverage from that in the fourth quarter. And they also had some benefit from income from some minority investments. So those 3 things drove their higher EBITDA margin.</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM: So is that -- were the cost takeouts a way that we can look at them kind of establishing a base here? Or as that ramps, that we should be ramping from this kind of level?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Yes. So the significant majority of the cost actions, I think, that they plan to take have been executed. So yes, this is kind of the base of cost that we're starting from. The base that we ended with in 4Q '19.</p><p>Okay. We'd like to thank everybody for participating, and we'll talk to you again soon.</p><p>OPERATOR: And that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

There are upsides of tablets and computers for children - education for one and just plain old entertainment value. And we know there are downsides. NPR reported last week on a study that indicates screen time can negatively affect children's ability to read people's emotions. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screen-free zones at home, no more than one to two hours of entertainment media a day for kids - and that includes television - and none for kids under two. So how do people who work for big tech companies like Google or Yahoo approach this with their own children? We're going to talk about that with Manoush Zomorodi. She's host of the WNYC podcast New Tech City. Hi, Manoush.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MANOUSH ZOMORODI:  Hi, Melissa. </p><p>MELISSA BLOCK:  And this is a question you haven't been exploring for an upcoming podcast. For starters, you mention a revelation about one of the biggest names in Tech, the late <person><nameText>Apple co-founder, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Steve Jobs. </nameText></person></p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:  That's right. So Melissa, <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>was a low-tech parent. That is what Nick Bilton wrote about recently in the New York Times. And if you're a parent, you've - probably saw this article. It was being passed around in all of our circles. While- so Nick and I got together to sort of swap stories about how technologists deal with their kids and screens. And <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is really just the jumping off point. So many people in tech are not worried about making sure that their kids learn to code. They put very strict limits on the very gadgets and software that they spend their days developing. </p><p>MELISSA BLOCK:  And Manoush, it sounds like some of the sharpest criticism that you've heard about screen time for kids is coming not from the tech world. It's coming from the group The Campaign for Commercial-free Childhood and its founder, Susan Linn, who says she's really worried about how advertisers get free access to kids through smart phones and tablets - things like that. Let's listen to how she explains her concerns. </p><p>SUSAN LINN:  No parents in history have ever had to cope with the unprecedented convergence of a ubiquitous, sophisticated, alluring, habit-forming screen technology and unfettered, unregulated advertisement. And that combination is really what the major problem is. </p><p>MELISSA BLOCK:  So Manoush, when you put that point to people in the tech world, what do they say? </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:  Well, you know Melissa, a generation ago - right - our parents told us take your bathroom break during the commercials, right? They are a waste of time. And now parents are trying to teach their kids some of the tricks of digital advertising - the in app purchases or requiring a login. But on the whole, most of the tech parents that I spoke, they seem to be more concerned about that addictive nature that Susan Linn referred to. And they're less worried about exposing their kids to advertising. I mean, after all that's where their paychecks come from, and advertising is how many of these tech companies fund their less commercial research. So I think they sort of see it as a trade-off and that their kids just have to be savvy. </p><p>MELISSA BLOCK:  And you heard a whole bunch about that - that addictive component when you went to a family in Brooklyn. It's a Google engineer - his wife is a child psychologist. They have a couple of kids. What did you observe when you were with them? </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:  Yeah. I went to visit Sameer and Mandy Ajmani. They have three kids. And it's interesting. They recently did a little experiment on their oldest son, 7-year-old Nolan. For one week, they gave him absolutely no limits on screen time. To see if he would self-regulate - you know, put the iPad away when he had had enough. The experiment, Melissa with, was a complete and utter disaster. He binged. So now they have rules about fun screen time versus educational screen time. And here's how Sameer puts it. </p><p>SAMEER AJMANI:  I have tried to explain to Nolan that I want him to be learning stuff when he is spending time on the screen and try to help him understand the difference between which are the apps I say it's OK to spend time on this because it's learning screen versus OK this is just candy for your brain. And, you know, we're going to limit that the same way we do real candy. </p><p>MELISSA BLOCK:  And Manoush, that can sound really great in theory - much harder to make that work in practice for a lot of parents. </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:  (Laughter) Yeah. And speaking from experience, I have a 4-year-old and a 7-year-old and just every day we sort of our grappling this. We don't have any ideas scientifically yet what entertainment or educational screen time is doing to us or to our kids. So at this point, we all have to make our decisions for ourselves. </p><p>MELISSA BLOCK:  And how have you negotiated that with your own two kids? </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:  (Laughter) Well, at this point, I have decided - and my husband, too - that we would rather our kids watch Mary Poppins or a show with a good narrative arc rather than, you know, this swiping, swiping at a screen. But maybe that's just how a journalist parents. </p><p>MELISSA BLOCK:  (Laughter) That's your story. You're sticking to it. </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:  That's right. </p><p>MELISSA BLOCK:  Manoush Zomorodi hosts of the podcast New Tech City from our member station, WNYC. Manoush, thanks so much. </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:  Thank you.</p><p>MELISSA BLOCK:  And you can download her whole show on Techies and Parenting this week. It comes out on Wednesday. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-201410062004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D9H-5NN1-DY2S-N3X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"926\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>October 6, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Parents &amp; Parenting</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Children &amp; Youth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Digital &amp; Mobile Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Child Development</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Learning</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009GHY</classCode><className>MOBILE MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CF4G</classCode><className>TABLET COMPUTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N710000CC</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009T98</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A39R</classCode><className>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009RO7</classCode><className>PODCASTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000CYWJ</classCode><className>SMARTPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE0009T1D</classCode><className>STEVEN JOBS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

They stopped to face the rays, knees bent, palms open at their sides, eyes closed. After several moments of silent contemplation, the reverie ended and they went on their way. Scenes such as this happen a lot at 1440 Multiversity, a luxury retreat in Santa Cruz full of babbling brooks, bearded gurus and \"wellness\". Lots of wellness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The centre, nestled in 75 acres of a former bible college, is the brainchild of Scott Kriens, a tech executive who made a fortune helping to build the internet.</p><p>He set up Juniper Networks, a maker of hardware, with several colleagues in 1996 and ran it for a dozen years. In 2017, he and his wife opened 1440 on the doorstep of Silicon Valley, just as the web's darker elements were coming to light. Their hope? That the campus will become a spiritual laboratory - a mountain refuge where tech's leading lights can tune out from the chaos they have unleashed, and consider how best to fix it.</p><p>Kriens said: \"Sometimes, the best way to go faster is to slow down.\" At a time when breaking up Big Tech has become a ticket for presidential hopefuls, 1440's arrival seems apt. \"I have huge respect for being in the right place at the right time,\" said Kriens. \"We've had a lot of support and participation from a lot of names you'd recognise in the Valley.\"</p><p>The site, which offers courses such as \"Awakening to your life purpose\", is a sign of the existential crisis at ground zero of the tech revolution. Executives are reckoning with creations that have altered how people communicate, meet, mate, vote and feel about themselves.</p><p>The phenomenon is not limited to tech. The Business Roundtable, a group representing 181 of America's top companies, last week rejected its core tenet since the 1990s: that the purpose of a corporation is to make profits for shareholders. The new mandate is pay fair wages, protect the environment and treat suppliers fairly. The sudden bout of \"wokeness\" at corporate titans - signatories included Jamie Dimon, head of JP Morgan - was dismissed by many as a publicity stunt. Yet the sentiment it sought to head off - that there is a deep flaw in the system, which regulators and the public are waking up to - is palpable in Silicon Valley. Sydney Mintz, a rabbi at San Francisco's Emanu-El synagogue, gestured towards some smartphones wrapped in black bags, arrayed around an altar with a flickering electric candle. \"They're resting right now,\" she said. \"And what we're doing is having full faith that when we turn them on, things are going to be fine.\"</p><p>Mintz travelled to 1440 to help lead Tech-Free Shabbat, a course based on the Jewish period of rest. Instead of a break from work, the course calls for a break from tech - 25 hours without a screen.</p><p>\"Technologies have been challenging Shabbat for the past 4,000 years,\" Mintz said. \"This is just the next iteration. It is the most powerful challenge because it's so pervasive and invasive. I'm not antitech at all, but in order for us to retain our humanity, and our essence, we have to cease from technology for a period of time. This ancient wisdom isn't just for the Jews any more.\"</p><p>The idea for this iteration of that ancient wisdom started a decade ago, in the house of Tiffany Shlain. A film-maker and co-founder of the Webby Awards, she instituted the policy with her husband and two daughters. \"It's the best thing I've ever done - individually or as a parent. I race towards these days off,\" Shlain said. \"I feel we've created a society that has no room for reflection.\"</p><p>Sprinklings of this shift have begun to appear in \"screen time\" apps - from Apple, Google and Facebook - that let users track and reduce device use. Shlain's method is blunter, addressing the difficulty of having a phone but not instinctively reaching for it at all hours.</p><p>Tristan Harris, founder of the Center for Humane Technology in San Francisco, saw how what he calls the \"attention economy\" was built. A decade ago, he studied at Stanford University's Persuasive Technology Lab, learning the \"full stack\" of tactics to tweak behaviour, from clicker training for dogs to Las Vegas slot machines. One of his classmates was Mike Krieger, co-founder of Instagram. \"We weren't learning persuasive technology to manipulate people,\" Harris said. \"But of course \u2026 this whole discipline got co-opted into what would be really good at hijacking people's psychology to get them looking at things on screens.\"</p><p>Kriens, 61, is hopeful that 1440, where a giant redwood tree or glass of crystal-infused water is always in reach, may help Silicon Valley reorient itself. He said: \"To the degree we can affect leaders, it's the greatest upstream leverage that I know.\"</p><p>When The Sunday Times visited, a group from Google had commandeered a large portion of the campus. So has Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg used one of the $700-a-night ((EURO)630) suites? Or had the \"Soul Shift\" course? Kriens declined to respond directly: \"We've had a lot of interesting guests.\"</p><p>He added: \"These are tough problems, and we're trying to harness something that is more powerful than we know.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>1440 Multiversity, where high-powered guests are encouraged to see the world beyond their screens and slow down</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-152300279</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWR-NST1-JCBW-N2DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"855\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 25, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002KE2</classCode><className>JUNIPER NETWORKS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Up to now it has only been conservatives \u2014 the people this censorship is targeting \u2014 that have been complaining about it, to no avail. Will the New York Times, of all the organizations, be the one to save the freedom of speech?</p><p> That seems doubtful, but it is good to see Thompson saying these things. The social media stranglehold on the means of communication is a direct threat to our democracy. 'NY Times CEO: Facebook's Algorithm Will 'Damage' Democracy,' by Eric Lieberman, Daily Caller News Foundation[1], June 13, 2018: New York Times CEO <person><nameText>Mark Thompson </nameText></person>cast serious doubt Tuesday about tech companies closely trusting algorithms to help determine which news stories are fraudulent or misleading. 'The process of citizens making up their own mind which news source to believe is messy, and can indeed lead to 'fake news,' but to rob them of that ability, and to replace the straightforward accountability of editors and publishers for the news they produce with a centralized trust algorithm will not make democracy healthier but damage it further,' Thompson said in a keynote lecture. He added that if algorithms are to be the primary means for attempting to combat the purported rise of misinformation, then companies like Google and Facebook must be as transparent as possible in their efforts. 'We do not know, beyond inevitably imperfect and incomplete empirical observation, how the algorithms of the major platforms sort and prioritize our content, nor can we reliably predict or influence changes in those algorithms, nor in any sense hold the companies to account for them,' said Thompson. 'Full transparency about both algorithmic and human editorial selection by the major digital platforms is an essential preliminary if we are to address any of these issues. It would be best if this were done voluntarily, but even if it requires regulation or legislation, it must be done \u2014 and done promptly.' Thompson's speech came at an event[2] hosted by New America's Open Markets Institute and the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University called 'Breaking the News: Free Speech ...mocracy in the Age of Platform Monopoly.' Several other key figures and experts in the industry discussed the rising power of Google and Facebook, and what it means for journalism[3]. His urging to not place too much trust in artificial intelligence systems for deciphering the validity of news stories \u2014 and practicing openness when doing so \u2014 plays off of examples of errors that algorithms create. Big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter are often accused of both over- and under-censoring, as separate portions of the public respectively demand they do more to combat always ambiguous hate speech, false news and terrorist exploitation of the platforms' features, and others call for an overarching free expression ethos, while still doing their best to stop evildoers. But with some examples of apparent censorship, it's not clear if the removal or restriction of content is due to human moderators or the automated algorithms. Twitter recently blocked a user who posted harsh criticismof Hamas, the militant and political Islamist organization regarded by much of the international community as a terrorist group. The social media company told The Daily Caller News Foundation it was an 'error,'[4] but wouldn't clarify if the mistake was directly human, or indirectly human-induced through the way of the 'hateful conduct' detection algorithm. Other cases, on the other hand, are far more definite. Google, the most powerful search engine, and potentially company, in the world, displayed[5] fact checks almost exclusively for prominent conservative sites, including The Daily Caller. But most importantly, the attempts to verify certain claims wereriddled with errors of their own[6], as the sidebar feature was proved to be faulty. Google eventually agreed after constant communication with TheDCNF, suspending the feature and blaming[7] it on a flawed algorithm. Officials within the tech giant, however, declined to elaborate further as algorithms are proprietary. 'But the underlying danger \u2014 of the agency of editors and public alike being usurped by centralized algorithmic control \u2014 is present with every digital platform where we do not fully understand how the processes of editorial selection and prioritization take place,' Thompson said in his speech.

Bill Blain's Financial Porridge Outlook - 10 More Years of what[3]? 'It was the era of risk, it is the era of sustainability, it was the age of unicorns, it is the age of wisdom, it was the epoch of renewal, it is the epoch of repair, it was the season of sure fire gains, it is the season of uncertainty, it was the spring of monetary policy, it is the winter of fiscal credulity, we had everything behind us, we have nothing ahead of us..'  The Next Decade: The most exciting 10-years will be the next 10-years.  Introduction  The global market is a dynamic, energetic and malicious entity. It delights in confounding those who try to understand it. </p><p>Blain's Market Mantra No 1 states: 'The market has but one ambition: to inflict the maximum amount of pain on the maximum number of participants.'  The global economy is equally dynamic. It does not exist as a steady-state entity. It is constantly evolving with increasing rapidity. Competition among new unicorns demonstrates what we once held to be constant and forever, is now likely to be done, dusted and obsolescent over a very short-time frame, but also the fundamentals of good, profitable businesses don't change.  I am only a part-time market strategist - most of my day is spent trying to figure out who will buy my latest private debt deal, venture capital issue or where to finance yet another jet or block of commercial property. It does mean I spend my days actually talking with investors, traders, issuers, government and regulatory officials, rather than just looking at numbers. I'm sitting in the middle of a trading floor watching screens, hearing deals, and after 35 years of listening to market mumble-swerve with a trained broker ear some of it is finally beginning to make sense!  (Most traders my age retired long ago with the loot they amassed during their careers. Not me. I am addicted to sailing and yachts. It will say on my grave: 'He spent it on fast boats, fast cars and fast women his wives, and squandered the rest.')  My greatest difficulty is collating what I hear, explaining my experiences, and putting them together into context as meaningful market insights It's fairly easy to do when I've got a time horizon of the next day - which I do on the Morning Porridge each day.  To make this more difficult, I am going to give you a market outlook for the whole of the next decade - the 2020s.  More Years - It's all about Themes and the Narrative  An awful lot happened over the last 10-years. Stock markets have risen dramatically. Bonds yields have never been so low. Passive index tracking has become the norm. Interest rates have never stayed so low so long. We have seen a European sovereign debt crisis and repeated country crisis in Latin America, Russia and Asia. Fintech, cryptocurrencies, unicorns, gaming, streaming and lots of other stuff we'd never heard of 10-years ago now dominate our current thinking. Our world has become much more complex, integrated, more fractious, innovative and changes far more swiftly.  What word would you chose to sum up the last decade?  Credulous - the era of showing too great a readiness to believe.  What word will sum up the next 10-years? Who knows? I suspect:  Cautious - eventually the party will stop  The pace and breadth of change across electorates, governments, businesses, and new opportunities over the next 10-years will have enormous implications for markets. There are so many potential points of divergence, it's going to prove even more impossible to accurately predict the numbers, but we can certainly make educated guesses at what the themes are likely to be.  Given an infinite number of economists, analysts and strategy geeks armed with computers, I suppose it would be possible to brainstorm the future and come out with proper predictions. Flying cars? 3D Star Trek replicators producing perfect steaks? Teleportation? Investment certainty? Dow to hit 100,000?  I was going to start with one high-probability prediction: 'this will be the last Decade Outlook I write', but who knows: if interest rates remain this low, will I be able to afford to retire in my 60s?  Markets are Event Driven, but trends are critical  Economists and Strategists pepper their yearly outlooks with comments on the likelihood of recession, downturns, upturns, the shape of yield curves, overbought and undersold markets, sector developments and where gold, currencies, rates, and commodity prices are heading.  Investment banks and fund managers are very good at producing pages and pages and pages of graphs, charts and pies showing just how the market will develop. Prices move in line with trends, which are set by events.  Events can take form of a tiny little improvement to a product that increases its sales, right the way up to the scale to fundamental economic shifts, like a trade war or a surprise in politics. They can be momentary 'no-see-ums' like an earthquake, or a culmination of a long-term trend, such as the unravelling of Unicorn tech valuations. Markets are determined by events. Some are predictable, some are not. The UK election illustrates how an event moves markets - on the back of increased Brexit certainty, sterling rallied, and we can predict businesses will move forward with new investment plans in terms of Capex, infrastructure, hiring and property plans. Even more prices move up and down.  Themes are very different. They are the tides, currents and winds of markets around which events occur and trends follow. Skilled investors who can read these themes and use them to navigate the global markets by making educated guesses on where they will lead us next. Themes tend to merge and change as they encounter other narratives, becoming new market moving themes in themselves.  Let me present a number of themes and narratives I reckon will play out during the next decade. Individually they might be limited, but it will be how they interreact with each other that will be most significant.  Seven Major Themes  There are 7 themes which I reckon will really matter:  1) Market Distortion  Are the market distortions of the 2010s in terms of QE and monetary experimentation sustainable?  How damaging are the unintended consequences of distortion - inflated financial asset prices driving sub-optimal investment decisions and increasing income inequality across economies?  Can/will central banks continue to prop up markets and repress volatility via monetary policy?  Are central banks caught between a desire to normalise rates, but can't?  If they withdraw monetary support, will markets tumble?  How violently could markets correct?  Are we still looking at lower for longer rates and zero inflation, or will inflation return?  Are deflation and Japanification greater threats than ongoing distortion?  2) New Opportunities and business  A fourth industrial revolution is underway - Artificial intelligence, robotics, 3-D printing, nanotech, AR/VR, longevity, health, bio-pharma and climate cure tech will change business, employment and incomes.  The invention/innovation/commercialisation cycle is accelerating.  As the economy evolves, the need for new approaches to education and work will create bottlenecks.  Consumption, supply chains and work patterns will evolve.  New industry and manufacturing chains will require massive investment and financing to benefit.  Focus to shift back on profits, payback, competition and fundamental risks.  3) Politics  Increasing dissatisfaction with politics, the political classes, and policies will lead to increasing unrest across democratic economies - raising the prospects of political event risk and/or gridlock.  Mature democracies may find new leaders emerging into the current political vacuum. Increased populism, especially on the right wing. Raised risk of charismatic leaders on right winning power.  10 years of austerity will prove difficult to unwind through fiscal reflation in stressed debt markets - increasing political dissatisfaction.  Dissatisfaction with big-tech, surveillance capitalism, and Income inequality may spawn considerable voter pressure and regulatory backlash - 'blame somebody' theory.  Europe likely to suffer particular problems as the 'committee' structure fails to agree fiscal policy, banking union, and how to enact fiscal support to struggling economies. Increasing imbalance and tensions between key members could pressure Euro.  US political cycle will continue to dominate markets and confidence in dollar and central banks.  Perversely, a period of potential calm for UK may beckon in early part of decade.  4) Debt Crisis  If fiscal spending is the answer, will global debt levels test the limits of political credibility and thus the likelihood of rising rates and inflation?  Corporate debt levels look unsustainable and a result of distortion - will they break?  Liquidity issues will dominate any debt crisis.  Personal indebtedness is rising in line with diminished responsibility and victimhood society - it's nobody's fault but yourself does not play anymore.  Massive implications for risk - risk has been transferred from banks to asset managers. Can nonbanks manage rising fixed income risk?  5) Geopolitics  Tensions between Europe, US, China and Russia will continue to rise.  Need for fundamental defence review and increased spend across democracies.  China likely to set own economic sphere using Chinese tech and Chinese government system - market driven communism.  Changing global supply chains will exacerbate tensions  6) ESG/Sustainability and Fundamentals  ESG has emerged as a critical component of investment decision making over the last few years. It is likely to further develop as a theme.  It will become more thorough to prevent greenwashing, ensure sound governance and increasingly play to social themes.  Labels such as 'Green Bond' will be redundant - everything will be expected to include a green element and be compliant.  Risk that potential regulatory capture of climate change agenda causes as much distortion as QE for instance, disrupting supply chains by penalising fossils fuels and investments perceived as non-green.  Sustainability as an investment precept will become increasingly important; analysing firms, their business, and their place within the social and changing real environment as the critical issues in investment management. It's a less proscriptive and more effective way to judge companies than ESG 101.  In a new global business environment of increased competition and shorter and shorter business life cycles, investors can't wait aeons for profits. It will mark a return to fundamental investment based on rational expectations, profitability and sound businesses.  Opportunity to invest in efficient sectors damaged by excessive ESG.  7) Climate Change  The easy one to predict- but the 2020s will likely confirm the reality of the environmental threat.  It raises increased sudden event risk from meteorological disasters, stressing the abilities of markets to cope with sudden large insurance and stranded costs.  Likely to create a massive new climate cure opportunity - inventing, innovating and commercialising climate cure technologies.  Perhaps the best way to address climate change is to stabilise populations - which could be done through education and jobs - but raising the issue of how to sustain growth while cutting emissions?  And the rest  It's a rule of markets that while things are never as bad as you think they might be, they are never as great as you hope. In a new era of financial realism and the re-establishment of monetary sanity, the new businesses claiming to have discovered a philosopher's stone - for instance turning base automobiles into gold plated EVs worth trillions - are likely to be tested to destruction.  Two Major Narratives  There are multiple narrative possibilities, but two particular stories are most likely to dominate the next 10-years. From these flows many of the other themes, including geopolitics and how we react to Climate Change.  Unravelling 10-years of Financial Repression: Past Performance is not an indicator of future performance.  My first prediction for the next 10-years is: Markets are likely to hurt if and when they ever normalize. However, there is a possibility they remain distorted for far longer than we expect due to central banks fearing a stock or bond crash would trigger damaging global congestion.  If you simply invested all your money in global stocks in 2010 you would have done rather well. Spreading it out to cover bonds also would have further enhanced your returns. If you did so, did you thank the Central Banks who funded your market upside?  Can central banks continue to repress market volatility and push markets higher by throwing cash at them? That's effectively what's happened over the last 10-years. QE, ultra-low interest rates, and now the US Fed is repeating QE to stem a crisis in the repo market.  The result has been massive market distortion - low rates chased investors down the credit risk curve in search of returns and into the equity markets; yield tourism. Corporate owners took advantage of low rates to leverage up and buy back stock, and spend on M#38;A.  How complex will it get before it all breaks?  We have to pay the piper not just for the last 10-years of distortion, but for the last 40 years spent in a bull interest rate environment. As yet there is little sign of inflation in the real economy - all the inflationary money created by central banks has flowed into the inflated financial assets. When I started in markets in 1985 the US 10-year Treasury was yielding around 12%, having fallen from 21% in 1980, and 15% in 1982 as I studied economics. Today its yielding 1.5%!  Let's remind ourselves how financial assets played out over the past 10-years:  US 10 Year Treasury - Rallied from 3.91% to 1.79%  Dow Jones - Rallied from 10,329 to 28,000  What do such low interest rates tell us? Conventional economics would tell us low rates describe a global economy in slowdown, depression, limited inflation, minimal growth and few positive prospects. It sounds like the lower for longer economy many analysts predicted in 2010.  Or you could look at the stock markets. Totally contradictory story. The US Dow is 3 times higher than 2010! It's been driven by an insane mix of inspiration, insights and insolence as Unicorns reared and stumbled, corporate buybacks and low rates. A glance at stocks would suggest it remains a global boom time.  The bottom line is simple. The last 10-years has been a story of massive central banking distortion to address the 2008 crisis. Now central banks face the consequences and are trapped. The distortion can't go uncorrected indefinitely.  10 years of monetary experimentation, QE, ultra-low interest rates fuelled and juiced an extension to an ongoing 30-year binge of irrational exuberance. It has fuelled massive inflation in financial assets - stocks and shares. Whatever lessons were learnt in 2008 have been quickly forgotten as investors followed the money and gorged on financial assets.  Globally debt yields have tumbled. Most government bonds have flirted around negative yields. Even serial debt basket cases like Greece now trade within a few points of financial paragons like Germany. Ultra-low interest rates have meant debt levels are at a place that would have given bond analysts conniptions just a few decades ago.  Equity prices are at record levels - juiced by corporates who have raised billions on the bond markets to buy back their own stocks and yield tourists looking for higher returns.  Meanwhile, regulators have overseen rules that have resulted in risk being quietly transferred from banks to the investment sector - putting the savings of billions of pensioners and savers in peril  Analysts will tell you the markets can't continue to hide the distortion.  Central bankers will privately admit there is nothing else they can do except maintain the distortion.  Traders will tell you to follow the money and buy the distortion  The traders called it right for the last 10-years, backing their hunch central banks were trapped. They coat-tailed QE and low rates with a certainty global central banks have no alternative but to maintain low rates and keep juicing the markets.  Analysts know it can't continue indefinitely. Experienced traders know markets can remain irrational longer than investors can remain solvent. Global central banks know that to take their fingers off the monetary easy dead-man's switch will destroy confidence. If they do extract the proverbial digit, then the all-out contagion consequences could make 2008 look like a slightly runny nose.  The real threat would appear to be deflation and the Japanification of occidental economies. That may change if a crisis was to uncork the inflationary genie?  How the end of financial distortion plays out depends on how other themes develop.  Debt Markets depends on how much credibility Governments maintain.  Prediction 2 - Global Debt is likely to Hurt. Lots.  Global GDP is around $85 trillion, meaning the global economy is levered by a factor of some 3:1 - on $260 trillion of public and private debt, which is startling.  The first question to ask about debt should always be: how will interest and principal be repaid? Have the trillions that have been raised in the last 10 years been spent in ways likely to return money to investors? Has the money been spent on building factories, creating jobs or building efficient infrastructure that will generate the returns necessary to repay the debt? Anyone looking in at how ultra-low interest rates have driven stock prices higher due to an orgy of debt-funded corporate buy-backs or to fund ill-advised M...or how massive populist-driven fiscal spending programmes are likely to increase government debt, would immediately assume the current debt markets are completely unsustainable. The looming debt crisis of the 2020s will be complex and multifaceted. Even governments with access to magic money trees, who retain the keys to their own printing presses, are going to struggle to retain credibility and financial probity in the face of massive funding needs.  Government Debt  Over the next 10-years governments are going to be forced to correct the fact fiscal policy has effectively been ignored the last 10-years - buried in austerity budgets. There are two main factors that point to the need for massively increased government spending in coming years - populism and decay.  Populism  Electorates are angry. They increasingly perceive the last 10-years of monetary mistakes have made the rich richer by ramping financial assets and executive bonuses, while they were forced to pay through austerity public spending. The UK election illustrates the competition between politicians willing to buy votes through fiscal spending programmes. The revolting French illustrate the refusal of electorates to accept tough decisions. Pensions, health services and other public goods including defence and educationdemand spending.  Decay  A massive infrastructure rebuild is required across the occidental economies - simply to maintain the current dilapidated occidental system. Yet infrastructure and government spending are massively inefficient in terms of cost overrun, delay and effectiveness.  Any significant infrastructure enhancements - including HS2 in the UK - are going to be luxuries, perhaps killed by other competing demands.  To replace ageing infrastructure with new climate-cure compliant rail, roads and port facilities, while rebuilding hospitals, schools and the housing stock to meet green goals is going to be massively expensive.  10-years of government austerity programmes have created the need for massive social infrastructure catch-up spending. Education, health, benefits and care are all under pressure.  Rising geopolitical threats in an increasingly uncertain world where food and water security become the major issues means spending on defence will need to dramatically increase.  The bottom line is government spending has to rise, at a time when rates are likely to be rising. Does that matter for economies that can create their own money? Not really, the choice is to create new money and call it debt.  The factor that matters is credibility - if governments are credible and deliver credible spending plans then global investors will be prepared to fund debt at low prices. If credibility in the government wavers, the price of debt starts to increase.  The problem here is not the amount of debt - because governments can create as much money as they care to. It's the credibility of the government that sets the price of the debt - and that's a political issue.  Politics is the major factor likely to break the credibility of governments and trigger a succession of major global government debt crises.  This is especially true in Europe where governments don't hold the keys to the printing presses - they are owned by the committee called the ECB. This actually works in favour of some governments - where the credibility of the ECB outweighs the lack of credibility specific governments with investors who are willing to accept an implicit assurance the ECB will 'do what it takes' to conditionally bail-out bad governments. What if that breaks? As it nearly did during the European sovereign debt crisis in 2010?  Corporate Debt  Corporate debt is dead simple. If interest rates rise, then lots of companies will struggle to repay debt and will go bust. Highly levered private companies that form the bulk of CLOs will probably collapse first, triggering a wave of panic around the market. Investors trying to exit corporate debt will find themselves trapped in illiquidity, driving prices swiftly down - which will look like a massive buying opportunity. eventually.  A few years later analysts will wonder why we allowed covenant-lite borrowing by barely solvent borrowers; why companies were allowed to bankrupt themselves by transforming equity into debt via buybacks; or how stockholders failed to constrain company managements.  Corporate debt spreads show how the market is undervaluing risks. Corporates can't make money the way governments do - they can't create more; they have to borrow and most certainly pay it back. The risks of corporate debt are completely different to governments - the business ability to repay, the business environment etc. That risk is significant and isn't covered when junk borrowers can issue debt a point over governments. When the market realises it will be a wake-up moment.  Personal Debt  If you start your working career encumbered by 50k of student debt, with no chance of ever getting on the housing ladder, and with limited job prospects as careers are automated or digitised while workers are treated as anonymous resources to be hired/fired and employed by algorithms, then it's hardly any wonder young Millennials, Gen X, Y and Z are increasingly angry. What else is there to do but spend money and borrow more.  When a company can make workers redundant and skip paying wages or redundancy, and makes off with the pension pot, then what's the incentive on the young workers to repay their pay-day lending? Go buy a car - what else would you spend your gig-economy wages on? If the delivery company lays you off because of a recession or replaces you with a drone - what can you do about it.    If personal debt flattens consumption, then the whole corporate party tumbles off the merry-go-round as consumers stop buying. Helicopter money?  History repeats. Egyptian masons downed tools building pyramids and swiftly robbed graves when they weren't paid. Peasants were revolting in Plantagenet England. A guillotine was erected in Paris on the back of bread riots and an ill-timed comment about cake instead. The Nazis arose from the inflation of the Weimar era.  Rising personal debt in this age of fake, easy money is presented as a consumer choice and desirable outcome - it's not. It's a massive political threat.  Details, just details  The predictability of events ranges from a nailed-on dead certainty, to a completely unexpected 'no-seeums'. Without intending to insult believers in the Cygnus Atrastus, the predictability of events is not digital - almost everything is predictable, especially from the perspective of hindsight! Themes are complex and are only doors to more and more questions. Investors should regard the themes and narratives I've described above as concepts to drill down into further.  There is so much more I would like to find the time to write about.  I have a massive list of things that will solve everything, like cracking the capacitance problem; doing away with inefficient batteries and making electric vehicles light and efficient. Or maybe we will see the fusion problem solved - fusion power could save us with unlimited power, and its only 30-years down the line. (Its been 30-years down the line since fusion was declared our energy messiah in the 1950s).  I would love to write how opportunities to develop new technologies to clean the seas of plastic, to develop hydrogen and electric aircraft will develop, or how we can crack the water crisis with desalination and icebergs. These things are all possible, but will require significant investment.  Or I could look at areas like global aviation, berate both Boeing and Airbus for their failure to develop new cheap efficient regional aircraft using modern tech. Both got greedy and stuck with 1960s and 70s designs. Maybe the Chinese will win that one - surprising us all by introducing a competitor. Even a plane with similar capabilities to the current aircraft would cause a demand shock in aviation.  Maybe I should spend time talking about market risks from defaults, distressed debt, a new EM crisis brewing but there is only so much I can say without getting really boring.  For instance:  Animal Protein  Cutting back on meat production will reduce methane. It will drive business opportunities for protein replacement in terms of fake meat, vegetable alternatives, and the prospect of increasing food security by replacing land used for meat production with crops for human production. It will spur the development of 3D meat printing.  It will also trigger a luxury meat market - where countries that can produce Co2 efficient meat command premium prices.  These sub-themes create multiple new narratives:  The UK could benefit from a shift from meat to crop production - our damp climate produces superb pasture allowing the production of high-quality luxury animal protein with a limited carbon footprint (because we don't have to hack down forest to provide grazing). It opens the opportunity to export our meat around the globe.  In contrast, repurposing former rain forest that was slashed/burnt to create cattle ranges by planting food crops will require soil enhancement and new farming infrastructure across South America at a time when water security is becoming difficult - begging further questions!  Or,  How about China?  How successfully can China under the new great helmsman Xi navigate the next 10-years? Will China end up on a path of tumbling into a new gerontocracy of elderly men whose experience was moulded as children during the pain of the cultural revolution and the great leap forward? Or will it find a new route forward to successfully manage its evolution from a developing country into superpower?  What are the prospects for success? Can it innovate technical solutions to its demographic, environment and bureaucratic challenges? I reckon China faces as much pressure as any state to improve its environment, and far from being suspicious of its ongoing reliance on power, the fact its embraced renewables is fascinating. Can China sustain growth without a debt bubble or does that actually matter if the state simply prints money and internalizes debt? Where does the party take the country - domestic capitalism or state control?  It looks like China will go its own way - developing its own tech ecosystem, hi-value goods in autos, aerospace, shipping and rail. It will stage its own industrial revolution - AI, robotics, energy, pharma and health. The Chinese economy is going to move forward - and in the face of the increasingly erratic behaviour of the US president, and the political gridlock apparent to anyone trying to read US politics, perhaps long-term relationships with China will be preferable to a relationship with a flaky USA?  Finally. Some predictions from readers:  Markets  'I am expecting to see a massive correction in the bond markets. 10 yr UST moving above 3%, 10 yr Bunds above 1%. Credit spreads blowing out and Stock markets falling 20 to 30%.'  'We will not see much higher yields next year. There is no case for inflation. Rates will go back to January 2019 levels once Trump settles with China. There is a case for margins to widen. We need a couple of spectacular defaults and that could signal a turn in the market. A future crisis will not be with banks but with institutional investors who have to write-off a lot of debt in their balance sheet and will try and sell deals.'  Fiscal Policy  '2020 will be the year where we will hear much more about governments' opening up the purse strings in response to widening inequality. This is likely to result in developed market bond yield curves meaningfully steepen and 10-year Bund yields turn positive as the Germans finally give in to some stimulus.'  '2020: Who wants to invest in the long Euro government bonds at -.5% or -0.7% of the countries that need to borrow heavily, i.e. that are in deficit? Only if you are forced toTherefore capital controls are coming in Euroland sooner or later!'  US Politics  'Donald Trump will be easily beaten in November 2020 and win fewer electoral college votes than John McCain managed in 2008. The US economy will grow nicely but the impact of Trump's unpresidential behaviour and his deep unpopularity with women will be impossible to overcome. In the early part of 2020 speculation will emerge that Hillary Clinton will enter the democratic primary. She will be blocked from running however - centrist candidate Biden will win the Dem nomination and then the election.'  'In 2020 markets will fret about the choice between four more years of Donald Trump or a Democrat elected on a 'socialist' platform. The battle will mean delays in corporate, and investor, decision making suggesting a sluggish economy and a sluggish market.'  Tech Unicorns  '2020 will be the year when Silicon Valley investors are caught swimming without trunks. IPOs start to dry up for cash-guzzling companies that have followed the 'blitzscaling' growth strategy and that has a knock-on impact on sentiment amongst the funders that have supported them to date. VCs start to look for businesses that can achieve profitability even if their ambitions are more modest than dominating entire industries or creating new paradigms.'

Well, good afternoon. Good afternoon and welcome to Excellence in Innovation. I'm Cameron Pitt. I'm a partner from Deloitte and I'd like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which we are meeting today and pay respects to the Elders, past and future. I would also like to extend that respect to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people today and present. Excellence in Innovation. And thank you for coming today.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> The public service and, in fact, every single industry within Australia, is undergoing a major shift. There are forces at play that are absolutely unavoidable and are working their way into organisations and the public service today. Big data, digitisation, demographic trends, social media and fiscal constraint are all big things that we are driving to deal with on a day-to-day basis. And in response to that, the public service is innovating. It is moving. We have macro innovation and those large-scale transformative programs that practically every department is embarking upon today. And endeavouring to overcome a lot of the issues and problems associated with meeting a rapidly changing community expectation and government policy setting.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> But let's not forget about the micro innovation. Those small things that make a big difference. Lots of small things that are in our control daily, hourly, decision-by-decision, that we make as a public servant and in the way that we communicate, innovate and collaborate on a day-to-day basis. We can't downplay the impact of those on a day-to-day basis and they are all in our control. One thing is clear, however. It starts with thinking differently. We need to think differently about the way that we do things, the work that we do and the way that we do things on a daily basis. And we're fortunate today to have some leading global thinkers in innovation.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Three individuals who have made innovation their career and have had a big impact upon a range of industries, both big and small, a range of countries, both Australia and global, and a range of scale, both macro and micro. So just to kick things off today, I'd like you to get out your phone. Now, normally, I would ask you to get out your phone and turn it off. But in this instance, you've all been sent my polling app or a link to that polling app. And we would like you to, if you haven't already, download that app and log in with the password of 0124. Don't ring anyone.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> How big is the app?<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> How big is the app? That's an extremely good question. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I think we might now just go to the first question within the app. If you may. So, can I just get a raise of hands, who's actually in the app and can see the questions? Go back. We're going back.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> It's closed. The poll's closed. You missed your chance. We're moving quickly as we innovate. Could I get a raise of hands, who's actually entered a response into the app and provided an answer? It's closed. Can we reopen the question, please? The first one's always hard, the first question, to get things up and rolling. Wonderful. Can I get a raise of hands, who's put a question in there? We're getting there.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> 0124.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Great. So, we're now testing your ability to embrace innovation, rapid prototyping, piloting new things. Wonderful. Question he's opened.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Fantastic. Sometimes. \"Do you think innovative ideas in your workplace are embraced?\" And a lot of uncertainty. And that's something that we do see quite often. Where do good ideas go? How do they get processed? And how do we get the benefits associated with unlocking those ideas? Now, let's go to our second polling question. \"Do you believe your SES communicate their encouragement of innovation in the workplace?\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> A lot more conversation about that one. Wonderful. And you've now got 44 seconds to put your response in for a second time. Thank you. Wonderful. Just while we're waiting, I would ask you to just inch yourself to the person next to you and start thinking about the question that you're going to ask our panel members a little bit later today. So, the structure of today, we are going to have presentations from our three panel members, followed by about 30 minutes of open discussion with the panel members, and we'll then throw it open to Q and A to everyone. So be prepared to ask that question.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Wonderful. Sometimes, sometimes. I think one of those most fascinating things, with regards to innovation, and let's probably stop thinking about innovation as innovation. Let's just think about it as those small and big ideas that people come up with that they think is going to make their work and the way that they make government policy and achieve outcomes, better. And it's interesting, every one of us, in our reaction and response to both our people and our colleagues, good ideas directly impacts the ability of us to innovate as a culture, to make small things to have a big difference.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> So, we do have three big thinkers today. Our first speaker today is Jenna McCann and she's the general manager of BizLab from the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. Jenna has over 25 years' experience in business strategy and innovation, having worked with a range of cross-sectoral Fortune 500 organisations throughout Australia, Asia and the United States. She has a passion for innovation and its ability to improve the lives of individuals and societies. This is underpinned by her decision to move from the private sector to the public sector only three months ago, in order to establish and head up the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science innovation lab called BizLab.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Jenna has deep expertise in the area of user-centred design, qualitative and quantitative research, and innovation commercialisation gained through working with start-ups, SMEs, multinationals both across the world and within Australia. And some of those include Coca-Cola, Bristol-Myers, and CommBank. And having spent some time earlier this week with Jenna, I can tell you, her passion for innovating with a purpose is absolutely palpable and an absolute credit to her and something that we're looking forward to unleashing within the public service. Jenna, I'd like you to come up, if you may.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> Thank you, Cam, for that lovely introduction. No pressure whatsoever. As you know, as Cam said, my name is Jenna McCann and I'm the GM of BizLab, which is the relatively new innovation lab within Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. And I, myself, am relatively new. Well, only the APS perspective, unfortunately. But I've actually been here seven months now, not three months. So, time is flying like that. And that is a big change for me, after 25 years in the private sector.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> But I think after working for companies like Coca-Cola and Nestle and the like, I figured I'd made enough of you fat. And working for banks like CommBank and Westpac, et cetera, I figured I'd taken enough of your money, so I wanted to do something a bit more purposeful. So when this opportunity came up, it was a great fit with where my passions lay.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/>BizLab, I just want to give you a bit of background today in terms of what BizLab is. We don't have much time. What BizLab is, what the remit is, and maybe give you a few tips and learnings that I've had along the way in this brief period of time within government. So, BizLab was born out of a number of drivers. The key one being the National Innovation in Science agenda. And specifically, the government as exemplar pillar, which aims to deliver a more innovative 21st century government and in line with evolving needs and expectations of those we serve. So that was one of the key drivers of setting it up.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> Now, let's see if I can get my slide clicker the right way. Yes! So, what is BizLab? Well, as you can see, it's anything, if not colourful. We like a bit of colour. We unfortunately don't have cupcakes on a daily basis, but that was for our launch. BizLab is both a physical space and a group of innovation practitioners. We do cop a lot of flak. That was one of my first lessons for how different our space looks and the colour and the dots everywhere. But I actually welcome that and say, \"Bring that on,\" because business play is one of the foundational pillars or the cornerstones, if you like, of innovation. So, I welcome that kind of feedback.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> And I think that the most important thing about it \u2013 it's not about having this funky space \u2013 and for those of us in this area, you'll see there're lots of labs and innovation teams are popping up all over the APS now. It's like, \"You have one. I want one. I can't be innovative without a space.\" And that's definitely not the case. There is a lot of neuroscience behind how these things are actually structured and all the colours and colour schemes, et cetera, are really based on Harvard, Stanford, years of research that they've done into the areas of innovation. But it doesn't have to be a big, expensive, arduous undertaking. You can start as simple as getting an office, an office room and decking it out yourself.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> In fact, a lot of what my teams here in the front, a lot of what we have done has been the PowerPoint and the printer and cutting out and sticking things on the window. The whole point is having a space that when you walk into, is a transition space. So it's triggering your mind out of task mode, into a different, more creative mode. So I encourage you that you don't need a big funky lab with all the colours. Don't take it away from us, this, but we love it. You could always come and use our space, but it's something that you can get going yourself.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> We have, at the moment, 13 very diverse folk who are all sitting here in the front row, looking at me very diligently, who have a different background, I should say, or a diverse background, sorry, across program, policy, delivery, right across the APS. And more and more, we're recruiting external folk as well, and that's really around the issue of wanting to inject some skills and capacity and fast-track that development of that capability. So our remit in BizLab is two-fold. The first one is to deliver with impact. Well, what does that mean? That means that we work with multi-disciplinary teams and we scaffold them, if you like, for want of a better word, with UCD, or User-Centred Design principles.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> The big learning, I think, here, is for innovation teams and everything setting up, is to be very cautious of being locked into the business and not being over to the side of the business. So we're not an internal consultancy. We don't take on project briefs and then go off into our glass box over here and do it on our own and deliver it back to the business. We work hand-in-hand. You're the content experts. We're the one that know the technical skills around\u2026the latest thinking around innovation, to help you evolve to the next level.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> So it's really important that you work in the business and that you work on big strategic priorities. And I think we'll talk about that in our session today. A lot of the time, when you don't get traction, is it because it's not linked to the strategic intent of the department. So, that's one, deliver with impact. And the second remit that we have is to drive a culture of sustainable innovation. And, of course, that's the pinnacle, isn't it? And it's about creating a mind shift, I guess. And it's really long-term change management, and that's something that you've got to chip away at over time.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> We're also, actually, very lucky. If you can see down in the right-hand corner, the little logo there for the PSIN \u2013 the Public Sector Innovation Network \u2013 who I'm hoping some of you here are members of. And so, it is a social network, a social enterprise network for both APS and citizens who can join up. You can share on innovation initiatives. You can get inspiration. You can find out topics of forums such as this that are on today. So, I encourage you to go online and to sign up and you can connect in with like-minded individuals. And we've actually just launched a Yammer for those of you who can access Yammer, so you can take part in the dialogue as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> So that's our remit in terms of what we're supposed to do. But what's more important to me is why we actually do it, and we're very much a purpose-driven team. I think one of the things about innovation, obviously, there's a lot of naysayers. It takes a lot of time. There's a lot of barriers. And it's hard. It can be really hard. And when you have those days, you have to remember why the heck you're doing this. You have to have a long-term game plan that gets you out of bed in the morning and then inspires you. And I think that's life, as well as business.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> So my team and I spent a lot of time in the last few months, saying, \"Why are we doing this?\" We're doing it for more than just being told. We're here because we're passionate about something and what is that about? And our articulation of that purpose and a purpose is a very difficult thing to articulate, but our articulation of that is that we strive to inspire and equip individuals to connect, empathise and collaborate with end users to achieve previously impossible solutions.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> I don't know about you, but for us, that gets us a smile on our dial and gets us going. And it's very much about \u2013 we are the facilitators. We're not the ones there that are the answers. And, in fact, we call ourselves either a coach and also an agent provocateur, the one who asks those pointy, annoying questions to get people to think a bit differently. But at the end of the day, the definition of success is to ask if you can repeat back the voice of your user, if you're designing solutions with your end user in mind, that you've had conversations with.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> Our mission, as you can see up there, is to support the department in the innovation strategy enabling growth and productivity of globally competitive industries. So once again, everything we do is intricately linked to the department's strategy and the department's innovation strategy. How we go about doing that is through projects, consulting and capability development as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> Excuse me. I'm not going to go through this slide. I just simply wanted to put up it and say that codification of what we're referring to is UCD or User-Centred Design, and just to express that the essence of it is really about simplifying and humanising. The problems that we face today are what we call wicked problems. They're very interconnected. They're multi-factorial. We can't look at problems just within our own department now. They cross a lot of departments because they touch a lot of aspects of citizens' lives. And there is no-one obvious answer to a lot of these problems.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> That's what UCD actually does. It breaks things down into component parts and it goes to the end user and has conversations. When I say conversations, they're not interviews, because it's very, very different, having a conversation than an interview. A conversation is a self-directed dialogue. It's not, \"I ask you this question, you answer this,\" because I'm not going to understand why. Why you're saying what you're doing. We go in situ as much as possible. And by that, I mean I'll be into people's businesses. I mean, over the years, I've been into thousands of homes, as creepy as that sounds, and have taken lots of videos of people and watching what they're doing. So it's also observing people. What they say they do, versus what they actually do.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> I'll never forget the time, I think it was Cadbury I was doing a project with, and I went to some woman's home out in Blacktown and she sat there and she had the kids around and she said, \"No, no, no. We do not eat chocolate. No, no. I keep it away from the children. We only eat greens.\" And this and that. The little son was like, \"Mummy, that's not true!\" And he opened the cupboard and it literally poured out of the cupboard. If you did a survey, you wouldn't know that. She would have answered, \"No, we don't eat chocolate.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> So that's just a bit of an example of why it's important to look at people in the context of their actual lives. The thing, though, just to sum up that I wanted to get across, that it's actually different about user-centred design \u2013 and it's not rocket science by any means \u2013 is that it starts solution neutral. So these big wicked, interrelated problems, you can't go in and say, \"This is our policy. What do you think? Tell me what you think?\" That's not going to work. You have to break it down and get to know the person first. So, solution neutral, which sounds really obvious, but it's really, really hard to do.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> And we put a lot of effort in at that front end, where you can see that curve is to represent divergent thinking. We put a lot of time and effort into that front end to articulate the actual problem we're trying to solve through the eyes of the user, and we go round and round a lot in that until we get to an inspiring point that we think it really got to the nub of the issue that we're trying to solve. And so, as you move through the stages, you spend a lot of time up-front, you start to clarify the problem more, and then you get into rapid iterative prototyping. And I think the step that we still have to demonstrate and move forward through is co-creation. That's the essence of design thinking, is working with the users.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> We're starting, but that's probably one of the barriers that we're facing at the moment. Not just consulting with them up-front, but having them the whole way there along. So that is us. To date, we've sort of been up and running with projects for about seven months. We've done five massive projects so far. So we're all a bit weary, but our pipeline is full for the next six months, and so let's watch this space. And come and see us at any time. If we can give you any insight into what's happening within the department, we'd be happy to do that. Thank you.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Thanks, Jenna. I did have the benefit of visiting the lab earlier in the week and it is a hive of activity and abuzz. And asking questions to think differently. What a wonderful statement. And I think that really sums it all up. Second on our list is Rick Wingfield. He's a partner within the Australia Post Accelerator. So, Rick has a passion for entrepreneurship and helping Australia become an innovation nation. He is leading a program of reimagining the future of the financial government and other trusted services with a focus on digital identity. He drives customer-led innovations from incubating and investing in start-ups and exploring emerging technologies.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> He is a strategic, customer-focused leader with a proven track record of successful digital and strategy experience with executive roles in retail, logistics and financial services across Europe, Australia and Asia. He has worked for large institutions \u2013 Barclays, NAB, Australia Post, as well as the start-ups as a founder and as a consultant. I'd like you all to welcome Rick to the stage.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> Hello, everyone. Thanks very much for having me. So, I'm just going to talk really quickly about the approach that we've taken, overall, at the Australia Post to enabling innovation. And I'll kind of finish off specifically with what I do in the Australia Post Accelerator team. But I guess whenever we talk about what we do and whenever we talk about innovation, we like to talk about our overall strategy to enabling innovation first, because it's really exciting for people to hear that we're working with start-ups or that we are doing trials with drones or doing things with blockchain and they certainly get written up a lot by the press. But that's such a small part of our overall innovation strategy, you know, that's the thing that I'll finish with.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> But, really, what I want to start with is empowering our people. So we've kind of got a three-pronged approach to our innovation strategy. And I guess the important thing about that is it is part of the overall strategy of our organisation. I was just commenting before, you know, to Jane, that one of the things that I really love about working at Australia Post is we get to go and do exciting and innovative things. And part of the reason for that is, we don't have to make the case for change. Often, you have to make the case for change in an organisational world, you know, why do we have to change?<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And one of the things that's very clear about Australia Post is we have a burning platform. Our core business, which is the letters business that has sustained us for 200 years, has halved in the last five years. So, you know, there are half as many letters being sent now as there were five years ago. It took 200 years to grow that business. You know, half of it is gone in five years. And so the case for change is very strong. And so we can have a discussion about changing and we can have a discussion about doing things differently and what we should change to.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And the first part of that starts with all of our people. And there are 40,000 people working Australia Post and that includes people working at post offices, delivering to every house, everywhere, every day. And I guess the way we think about that \u2013 and these are just three examples of things that we do \u2013 one of the first things we did is we needed to build a feedback loop.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> If we're going to enable people, for example a delivery team who's delivering to a particular suburb, to make improvements and to have a, you know, we have a stand-up meeting every day and say, \"What happened yesterday and what can we do better tomorrow?\" And we're going to empower them to be in charge of the improvements that they make. They need to have that feedback loop. And so we've spent a lot of time capturing customer feedback and feeding it back to those frontline teams so that then, they can have the information to go and make the right decisions.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> We also run a number of events which we call hack days, and really what that was about was taking people outside out of their day jobs and giving them 24 hours and say, \"You can work on any problem you want.\" And then having us leaders come in and presenting back to them. And the important part about that was not necessarily the ideas that came out of the hack days. I think you can overemphasise those. But it's really changing the mindset to say, \"Look how much you can achieve in 24 hours, if you put your mind to it and if you really want to do something great.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And we have an internal incubator, so we have a kind of a process for capturing ideas that can get bottled up and people can win funding to go and essentially be seconded to go and work on those projects. Again, away from their day job, typically in a different environment, you know, a bit like BizLab, where they get a small amount of money and they can see if they can make progress and carry on. So the first part of our strategy is enabling all our people. The second part is co-creating with our customers. And I guess this comes back to what we're hearing about before, which is really kind of user-centred design or design thinking.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> If we're going to go and solve problems, sitting inside of our own buildings, thinking about what those problems are, is not the best way to go and solve those problems. Going out to our customers and hearing about what problems they would like us to solve and actually working together with them to solve those problems is the way that we think about that. And there are a number of different customers that we have and we run customer-led design sessions together with them, and we found that to be a very, very productive way of coming up with some great solutions. And then the final part, I guess, of our innovation strategy is really helping people start and scale businesses.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And this is the Australia Post Accelerator, which is the part of the organisation that I work in. And really, what we're thinking about in that is the role, you know, how would you reimagine the role that Australia plays in the community? And when we think about that, I guess we think about three things, where we're interested in the future. The first of those is the future of ecommerce. So, our business today and more than 100% of our profit, which you have to think about a little bit, comes from delivering parcels. 80% of things that are bought online in Australia gets delivered by Australia Post either by a postie or one of our delivery contractors. And so, we want to think about the role that we play in the future of ecommerce.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And, you know, when I think about that, we've been in this business of providing critical infrastructure to the economy for 200 years, and that's something that I think continues. When I think about people, particularly in rural and regional Australia, ecommerce is fantastic. When we go and talk to our customers, you know, if you used to have to drive an hour to get into your nearest town to go to the shops, you can now get online and order the same things that anyone else can and we'll deliver them to you. So that's the first area that we've been thinking about. And some of the things we're doing in there, I guess, is we're thinking about different delivery models, different receiver models.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> A lot of people tell us that they're not home when their parcel is delivered, so what can we do to solve that? We're doing some trials with drones, as I mentioned before, and we're really thinking about what are those kind of next generation platforms for ecommerce? The second thing that we're thinking about is the future of trust and trusted services. So, through the post office network today, we provide agency services for a huge number of government departments. I think about 150 state and federal government agencies use the post office as a shopfront for what we call trusted services. And the reason they're called trusted services is because part of what the role that we perform is, we really have to make sure that that person is who they say they are.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And so what we're thinking about in that space is, how does that digitise? How do we digitise identity? How do we prove who we are online so that, you know, if I'm going on eBay and I want to buy something, I can say that my name is Mickey Mouse and as long as I pay and as long as I give some way for something to be delivered, we don't really care on ecommerce, who you are. But if I'm going to give someone access to their health record, if I'm going to do my tax online, I need to be really, really certain \u2013 to a high level of assurance \u2013 that someone is who they say they are.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> So we're thinking about that space, and that's the second area we're looking at. And the final area is the future of community and work. And we know, particularly in rural and regional Australia, that the post office plays a very important role in the kind of fabric of the community of Australia. And we're interested in thinking about, as things digitise and as the world changes, what our ongoing role can continue to be and how do we make sure that we continue to be relevant to all Australians everywhere, every day?<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And one of the most exciting things we're doing, which we're launching this month, is a Regional Pitchfest. So we'll be going around regional Australia, running a competition for start-ups from all states to pitch and have their ideas funded and go into our Accelerated program, so we're really excited about that. So that's just a little, quick summary, I guess, of our innovation strategy and the way we think about innovation. But, really, it starts with all of our people, and then goes to our customers, and then we kind of go towards thinking about, how do we support start-ups and the next generation of innovation in the community? Thank you.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Thanks, Rick. And if ever there is a pressing need, an organisation shrinking by 50% within five years, is absolutely it. But turning to your employees and your customers for your solutions and those ideas about how you're going to navigate that shift is certainly telling about where those ideas are going to come from and how those changes are going to get made.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Third and final speaker. Jane Haycock is a director at the InnovationXchange from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Jane has over 20 years' international experience gained as a public servant, consultant and academic in the UK, Australia and many partner countries. She prizes creativity and seeks to improve the way things get done wherever she works or how things there get done wherever she works. Jane has designed and delivered programs globally that help combat poverty, improve people's health and build economies. Jane is an experienced negotiator, having spent four years at the United Nations in New York, and has represented the UK on the executive boards of UN agencies and of UNICEF.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Jane led the development of DFAT's knowledge and information management framework before moving into the InnovationXchange, where she has launched a global challenge to improve nutrition in the Indo-Pacific region and an X Prize to find technology that can harvest water from the air. Jane is focussed on how the InnovationXchange is supporting the adoption of innovation throughout Australian Aid. Welcome on the stage, Jane. Thank you.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> Well, it's just a real pleasure to be here this afternoon, and excuse my accent from the start out. I sound a bit more Australian, but still quite British, so apologies for that. Yeah, I'm Jane Haycock. I've been at the InnovationXchange for about a year. And the InnovationXchange itself, for anyone who's got any familiarity with it, as Jenna was saying, it's kind of a bit of an experiment. And I won't repeat, but it's got the funky walls, it's got the funky wallpaper, it's got the glove stuff, it's got the Post-it notes, blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So, anyone can come in and you can co-create and you can write on our whiteboards and our bean bags, which are very famous \u2013 that's an estimate. And you can do the sorts of things that have been talked about this afternoon. So, I won't go over that again. So we're kind of a living example of some of the strategic points that have been made. But why have an InnovationXchange? And I think this kind of gets to the burning platform.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> When Julie Bishop became the foreign minister, she had a look at the Performance of the Aid program and she took a few real-time case studies and she took PNG and she basically said, \"We've spent an awful lot of money, an awful lot of the aid program in PNG for the last few years, but they didn't mean a single one of these global goals, then, the millennium development goals that we're all trying to achieve.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So, why was that? Was there something better about the way Australia can provide its aid support? Was there a different kind of conversation that Australia could have with PNG and similar countries in our region about how we can develop as a region? So, less of a kind of bilateral, less of a sort of client partnership. But how could we work together as a partnership of countries to improve the health of all our people?<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So she took a bit of a trip \u2013 this is Julie Bishop \u2013 she took a bit of a trip to the US and she went to Google and she went to some of the really big tech companies out in San Francisco and she saw how they supported innovation and new thinking. And one of the common themes was that they had centres for the edge. So she thought, \"Well, I'll have one of those, then.\" So she came back and into Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which isn't maybe known for being the most, sort of, creative environment. She said, \"I'd like to have a centre for the edge.\" And so they kind of looked at her and went, \"Hmm, OK. Well, you are the minister.\" So they created the InnovationXchange. There was a bit of a discussion.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> But if anyone knows where we are, we're actually physically across the road from the main DFAT building, which is important, because we sit in a slightly different space. We're not subject to quite the same security constraints. So DFAT deals with an awful lot of quite highly secure information. So we've created a space where it was possible to come and possible to talk and possible to work and access some IT which wasn't quite linked up to some of the main part of the department. So we're a physical manifestation of change and we're also the guinea pigs of the aid program. So the rough idea going, because the InnovationXchange has a budget, but it's primarily aid money.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So that means it needs to be spent on things that have a development outcome. That means basically spending that has an impact for a poor person in another country. So we're not primarily spending within Australia. So it's all about catalysing change through partnerships with other countries.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> There is a broader innovation strategy within DFAT which is much more about some of the culture change issues within the organisation. And I think as we move forward, those things are fusing. As we understand that many of the cultural characteristics, the behaviours required of people to be innovative and think creatively doesn't really matter, whether it's applied to the aid program or passports or consular or all the other business lines that we have, as quite a broad department. But the money we have is spent on improving the aid dollar, and so our purpose is about trying to deliver more cost-effective, more impactful change for poorer people in our region.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> And then the way we do that is to trial things. We're a learning hub. We continually review the success or otherwise of what we're doing and we take people in the department on that journey with us. So we're partnering with our country programs. We're partnering with the policy teams in DFAT. We're partnering with people overseas to rethink and test the way that aid programs are traditionally delivered.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So I will try and\u2026 Ahh, there we go. So our strategy is relatively simple and our slides are not nearly as nice as the lovely ones from Australia Post. We are experimenting, so we are trying new things in the way that we are designing programs where we're delivering programs. And we very early on recognised we needed to get some new partners. So the aid program, like any business, has some tried and tested people that we work with to deliver aid overseas. But tried and tested is good, if you know what you want to achieve, but doesn't necessarily push you to think differently. So one of the things we were explicitly asked to do was to get a friends' group of the IXC to find some new partners for Australia \u2013 to push that barrier, to bring in new ideas, to bring in new money.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> And then the final part of our strategy is to learn from what we do. So as Cam mentioned the food challenge, I thought I might just give you a little potted history of that one as an example to bring us alive. One of the key problems in our region is malnutrition. A child growing up in a rural village in East Timor is about 80% likely to be stunted. That means that they don't eat properly when they're between the ages of about one and five, and as a result, they're physically little, but also they're cognitively impaired. So that child, even if it goes to school and it possibly won't go to school, but if it does go to school, it won't learn as much as a child who's better fed when they're younger and fed with the right kinds of things.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So we wanted to solve that problem, because Australia and East Timor want to have a great partnership into the future. We want to have a secure region. We want to have a trading partner. We want to enable each East Timor to grow and be a sustainable country in itself. But that means the people of East Timor, from the very beginning of their lives, need to start off, need to get the right food, need to get the right education.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So we partnered with a company based out of San Francisco and we said, \"Can you help us pull together a challenge which looks globally, to find, really, the best ideas for dealing with this problem of undernutrition in East Timor and actually, also, overnutrition in much of the Pacific?\" There's horrible rates of diabetes. And so we went out and we got together about 100 experts in nutrition from around the world. But also, we flew in people from the Pacific themselves. So we could really understand what it felt like to be someone growing up in a relatively poor agricultural area and understand the choices that they actually had, what their real-life choices were in terms of food and what you ate and when you ate it.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> And so, we had what we called a big think, and actually we had several of them, and then we wrote a challenge based on all the feedback that we'd received. So the first point, really, to make is, we really took trouble to understand the problem, really careful problem diagnosis. So I think we've heard that this afternoon from both of the previous speakers. And then we put up a global challenge. And normally, these things are done \u2013 any familiarity with it \u2013 you stick it up on the internet and you put some social media stuff out there and you hope people find it. And we were like, \"Well, that's OK.\" And we did some fairly creative things on Twitter. But it wasn't really going to work, because we also wanted to get people in the Pacific to join the challenge.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So not only did we want to get solutions from the UK to help the Pacific, because that may not work, because their culture and the context would be so different. We wanted people in the Pacific and in the Indo-Pacific region to join our challenge. But if you haven't got a smart phone or any access to a computer, how on earth are you going to find a challenge on the internet in English? So we decided to do some other work to try and actually get out and talk to the people in the region. So we ran a workshop in East Timor and the president's advisor for malnutrition came and it was in this kind of funky little cafe.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> We really worked through with innovators and people who wanted to work a little bit differently, how you fill in the form. And we changed it a little bit so you could talk. You could talk your application, if you wanted to. So we've been trying to rethink the process of actually how you run a challenge, at the same time as running a challenge, so the people we want to join the challenge can join it. So there's some learning all the way that we go along. And then, as a result of this call, we ended up with about 300 applications from 74 countries. So, again, we really pushed the boundary. Because what DFAT is quite used to doing is looking within itself or looking within our near neighbour.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> But to find 74 countries \u2013 and this is South America, this is everywhere \u2013 saying, \"Hey, we've got a great idea and we'd really like to look at malnutrition in the Pacific. We're starting to crowd in ideas from unusual places. So we're trying to change the discussion in our own region, as well as make the problem of our region much more apparent to people globally. Because having grown up in the UK, it's too easy to think, \"Oh, Australia. That's kind of 12 hours away. Where is that? And where's the Pacific?\" I can't quite compute how to even be in that time zone. So we're trying to kind of work, as we call it, locally. Source globally and able locally. Spanning. But that's easy to say. It's actually quite difficult to do, to kind of span, build this global network.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> And so along the way, we had a bit of help. So we managed to get Jamie Oliver to tweet from his own account, how wonderful our work was. Immediately, 6 million people knew what we were doing. There was some nice things like that, that happened. Anyway, so as a result of that process, we\u2026the process is always going to be that we would find 12 innovations which we whittled it all down, we used experts and we ended up with 12 innovations. But we then kind of looked at those 12 and said, \"Well, they're really great. They are globally game changing. We're going to pick them up and we'll do some acceleration work with them and we'll fund them and we'll test them.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> That's kind of the process that we're in. But actually, we didn't really manage to get global-changing ideas from our region. There's one or two, but we want a few more. So when we trawled back through the 300, we found another 20 that actually we think we can support locally. So, again, we're adapting as we're going along. We had one model, picked 12. Actually, we're now going to pick 30 and we're going to find other ways within the aid program to support the next 20 from existing aid programs and existing relationships. So, again, always squeezing it. Always trying to think, \"How can I get more out of the investment I've already made?\" And that's a good example.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> Another example was someone came along and said, \"It would be really, really good if we could have this global conversation about malnutrition. How can you build empathy? How can you really make someone understand what it feels like to be stunted in East Timor?\" So, you said, \"Well, OK, great. We'll try out something new. We're going to have a competition for people who can send us ideas, so you get augmented reality, virtual reality, gaming.\" Where do people build their empathy from? Where do they find out things?<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> Well, they game. They play. So we all should have a competition and we've got some amazing ideas, including someone who used to work for Disney, saying, \"I'd like to build this app and this game that's going to work in Vanuatu to look in context about how you could talk about malnutrition.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So, again, it's always kind of, if we didn't have the idea of doing that at the beginning, but halfway through, the idea came up and we built it in. So just to flick through. I won't spend much time on that one, just to say, the overall context is to leverage in money, ideas and partners into solving challenges. The next slide is who are we experimenting with. So I've touched on this a little bit. But the minister has high ambition for the InnovationXchange, and so one of the first partnerships we announced was with Mayor Bloomberg of New York and he set up a philanthropic arm. So she would really like us to kind of bring in global recognition, global partners, which was slightly unusual for the way the aid program has previously worked.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So we're partnering with Bloomberg Philanthropies to do a program to improve the quality of health data in 20 countries. But there's little innovations in that. So there's the use of, like, verbal autopsy, 'cause quite frequently when people die, they don't have a death certificate overseas, so you can't really plan health services to meet why people are sick, if you don't know why they died. So using a verbal autopsy is a simple way of allowing you just to talk to people and collect an autopsy and then put that back into the health system.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So we're taking what is a big program based on data and then putting innovation into it. So that's some of the external partners. But some of the other things we've just done, to give you a sense of spanning aid program into mainstream department, is running an ideas competition in DFAT, and we actually ran two of those. And the first one was just after the integration of the aid program into foreign affairs and trade. When there was quite a lot of, \"Oh, who are you? Who are you? You don't look like me. You don't talk the same words as me. You don't have the same mission.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So we ran an ideas competition to basically say, \"If you've got a great that can help these massive 6,500 people get to know each other, what are the problems we're coming up with, putting together two quite different business areas?\" And so that was a great success, partially because people actually entered it. So there are about 400 people who, over a period of time, entered the competition. And one point I just wanted to make about that is that some of the ideas that ultimately were picked up came from people of any level in the organisation.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So something that's recently been in the press is that DFAT's renamed some of the rooms in the building after women, 'cause someone, actually an EL1, realised every single room was named after a flower or a man. So they decided, \"Well, actually, it would be quite good to have a room named after a woman, too.\" That was an EL1. A graduate had been doing some reading and she came up with the idea of using behavioural insights to actually rethink how we could do some of our policy work, and that got picked up and now we have a behavioural insights unit working with PM&amp;C. But also, SES need to show leadership in this area too. So an SES actually won the competition by having an idea about how to work on tax in overseas countries.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So, I guess, I just make the point that these competitions, yes, you identify people and you back them. But actually, the ideas can come from anywhere and they really did come from anywhere, and that was exciting. And then, finally, because I know I'm talking too long, just to say a few things about what we're learning, because I think the key part of our strategy is to do stuff, but learn from it. So just not remaking some of the points, I think I really want to just make two. One about risk and one about storytelling. So the point about risk is a really interesting one, because people often say, \"Oh, public service is really risk-averse. They won't do anything. There's no appetite for change.\" And we've kind of discovered that's not wholly true.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> We do take risks and we have risk manuals and managing risk handbooks and we think about risk quite a bit. But what we're learning is that our language of risk is not particularly suited to the language of innovation. So it's a different discussion about risk. So what happens if we ran a competition for entrepreneurship and a private sector company \u2013 it doesn't go wrong, it goes fantastically well \u2013 and it makes thousands of dollars out of a public sector investment? Some people might be quite critical about that, because actually, that's the public sector money supporting vast amounts of private sector gain.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> What's that conversation? Where's the risk in that conversation? Or what happens if something really doesn't work? So we're always kind of telling, \"Well, we can still learn from the things that don't go so well.\" But actually doing that and owning that learning, again, is different. And then, finally, the issue of storytelling is that we've found innovation, as a word, can be quite impenetrable.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So, really, we need to take the story, all the work that we're doing, and then just tell the stories. Just tell how someone ate something different at the end of it. Tell how we're able to find a different vaccine from a fish. Tell the outcomes of what we're doing, and then people switch into it and then you can work back from the outcome of what you're doing, to explain how you found that idea and how you supported it and that group was a little bit different. So, just all about the stories is the most important thing. Thank you.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Thank you. well, I think I've just redefined my definition of complexity and how it all starts with really understanding and simplifying it down to the problem that you're trying to solve for. And that does say a lot about excellence in innovation. So we're going to spend a few minutes now just having a bit of a facilitated discussion with the panel. And I'll be asking them a few questions that have sort of popped up throughout the session and also some questions from yourselves, for those that did actually submit questions prior to the event. So, I might just start with Jenna.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> Yep.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> So the concept of excellence in innovation, it's very big, it's very bold. But what, in your mind, is excellence in innovation? We've heard about the process, the design rooms. What is excellence in innovation, from your perspective?<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> Yeah, it... Can you hear me? Is that working?<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Yeah.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> Yeah. I mean, it is obviously a massive, massive question. And I think the bottom line is, it's contextual. So it depends on what environment you're in, as to the definition of excellence in innovation. However, I would say there are some definitely common principles or characteristics. And for me, one of them goes back to exactly Jane's last point, which is, I would define a sustainably excellent innovation organisation to be a learning organisation. And that is really the essence of what we are trying to achieve.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> Just yesterday, we had 50 heads of design labs and innovation labs hosted at BizLab, and it was quite confronting to do the autopsy and find the timelines on what had been done. One of my team members found some information back to 1977 that we'd been doing sort of similar things. And the question becomes, why is this not sticking? And it was very, very evident, no-one had captured the learnings. And that's when you get into this very zero-sum game around failure, because you would never see a scientist do certain things and fail and not capture that learning. That's not the way it works. It's experimentation. So that, I think, is a huge change we have to make and, to me, a signifier of excellence in innovation and organisation.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Wonderful. Rick, what are your thoughts on that?<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> Look, I think I agree. You know, it is definitely contextual. One of the things that you are looking to do, I guess, is to drive up the kind of pace of change. So one of the things that I guess you'll look to do through innovation is to allow, kind of, more things to happen more quickly. And I guess the only way to do that, if you assume a kind of a fixed capacity, is to do more smaller things. And if you do more smaller things, you necessarily can't know about all of them, and so this is where we come back to. You have to kind of create an environment where it's OK for people to go and try things and to, you know, I think language is really important.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> One of the things that we had to do within the way that some of our funding programs worked was to stop necessarily calling things projects, because projects come with a certain\u2026or programs come with a certain set of expectations. And certainly one of those was, \"Ooh, what's your business case?\" And sometimes, you don't know. And so, you know, one of the things that we're able to do was to say, \"Well, what about if I said I want to do an experiment? Potentially, it could be as short as two weeks, definitely no longer than six weeks, and this is what I hope to learn. And I'm not going to tell you business case, but I'm going to tell you what I hope to learn and what I think would happen. What success would look like and what failure would look like.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And to have that conversation before you even start. So I think, for me, excellence is about being able to, kind of, do more things more quickly and that necessarily requires those things to be smaller and necessarily requires people to be empowered and to be able to go and make decisions and move quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Wonderful. Jane.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> It's always hard going third, isn't it? I think excellence\u2026or at least, I don't think we've really set a bar where you're kind of excellent or you're not excellent in innovation. I think the way we're trying to write our own strategy for the InnovationXchanges on that experimenting, partnering, learning, setting out how we add value to the work of the department on every aspect, just small things, though. So just in the learning, what are we trying differently? Well, we're trying to do more adaptive evaluation or adaptive monitoring.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So what does that mean? So, not doing a project, at the end of the project, asking someone to come and look at it and retrospectively trawling back through everything and all the notes you've kind of lost and they're under the dishwasher. But actually, having the evaluator sitting right next to you, all the way through the process, prodding you, asking you the questions, framing the hypothesis, getting you to actually think in a way you don't normally think. Because most of us are bound up in doing. We're not sort of taking that step back as a kind of bit more of an academic and kind of saying, \"Well, this is your hypothesis, this is your null hypothesis. Are you doing this? Are you doing this? What's your evidence? How are you doing it?\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So having that other brain ticking over as you go along, capturing that for you, so actually as six months into it, you can say, \"Well, we're on this course, but actually, you're telling us we've done this. So, actually, are we going to course correct to here and then to here?\" So we're adding value by just trying it, by showing it's possible, by making that way of work more familiar, by debunking all these horrible words like 'co-creation'. Actually, that probably just means meeting someone, having a chat and deciding what you're going to do with somebody else.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> It's all these words out there and I think we're adding value by making it much more normal. But I think Rick is right. We are trying to push it a bit faster, you know, just provide a bit technical support, provide a bit of money to enable people to work differently, but using the words they use. So, putting innovation back into the business processes that we already have.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Wonderful. So we've spent a bit of time today talking about\u2026 And, Rick, I'll throw it to you first, on this one. We've spent a lot of time talking about labs, co-design, the centres of excellence that are being created, and I suppose the process of developing ideas and how we push through those. Can you talk us through your views on what some of those largest constraints are, both in innovating and implementing innovations, and sort of how you've seen those overcome so that the innovation has a real tangible benefit as it is actually implemented into daily working lives and experiences within the community?<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> Yeah, sure. Look, I think one of the things that is really powerful about a lab or a centre of excellence is that it's a symbol. But I think, you know, as everyone said today, one of the things that you need to be careful about is that it doesn't just become something that's outside of the organisation, that's over there, that's, you know, \"I don't need to worry about innovation because those guys over there are doing it.\" So as a symbol of change, I think they're really powerful. As a tool for bringing people outside of their day jobs and getting them to think about different perspectives, they're really useful. But ultimately, for an organisation to become innovative, you need to start going into changing the way that everybody works and the way that everybody thinks.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And so, in terms of the cultural change journey, those things are really important symbols. But to get something to stick, it needs to be owned in the organisation. It needs to go back into the organisation. And, in fact, some of our most exciting innovations have happened completely bottom up and that needs to be enabled. You need to be able to capture those ideas and they need to be able to be implemented.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And then, if you're going to get them to stick, you need to then go and then tell the story and publicise those things where, you know, for example, we had a postie who was finding that whenever he was delivering parcels in his local area, people were out and his customers were getting frustrated with him because he was delivering at 10:00 in the morning and they'd left for work and they weren't there. And he completely, off his own back, created a Facebook group and invited all of his customers to be part of it and asked them to tell him when they would like their parcel delivered. And what most of them said is, \"We'd like that to be in the evening, when we get back from work, because we leave pretty early and you're coming around at 8:30.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And so he did that and that was a piece of innovation and he changed his hours and he started to deliver in the evenings and suddenly, because we were measuring the customer feedback loop, we could see that this guy had amazing customer scores compared to anyone else. And we're like, \"OK, what's he doing that no-one else is doing?\" And so, then, that innovation has started to\u2026 So, first of all, it's a great story and we should share that story, because that's really important for allowing for the culture change and for allowing for people to understand that they can be empowered to do things.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> But we're also now trying to institutionalise that and say, \"Well, how do we change our delivery hours so that we can do more deliveries in the evenings? And how do we, through our Australia Post deliveries app, allow all of our customers to set their preferences for when they would like their parcel delivered and to set the hours when they would be at home?\" So how do we bring that back and also institutionalise it? And so, I think it's important to remember that, really, what we're talking about is innovation is a little bit of an overused word and I think we've all agreed on that. But, really, what we're talking about is kind of new\u2026 I don't even like to call them new ways of working, because these are the ways of working in the 21st century.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> What we're talking about is leaving behind old ways of working and that's a culture change program.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Wonderful. Jane, do you have a view on those various constraints and how they can be overcome?<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> I guess my answer to that is just to\u2026 I mean, we have had all kinds of different resistance, levels of resistance. I mean, most obviously, the Labor Party wanted to abolish us if they'd won the last election. But I think a much more, everyday concern around, \"Well, if I have a great idea and I don't get support for that, will it be against me in my performance appraisal? Or if I try something and it doesn't work, would that be against me on my performance appraisal? Or, you know, I just don't have the time to take that on. I'm so busy. My section's too small. How on earth am I supposed to squeeze out five minutes to do something different?\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So, I guess what we're trying to do is to meet people where they are. So, have groups of APS6, have groups of EL1s together, talk to them about the five minutes you might be able to squeeze out of the week to think about something different. And then don't make it moonshot. You know, what is your job? What are the things that annoy you about your job? What could you potentially do differently about that and can we, as a peer group, help you? So, trying to bring it back down and use the peer support networks and help people help each other improve their performance. And then we get into a bit of an interesting conversation about, \"Well, is that just incremental performance improvement or is that innovation?\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So, I guess, you know, if Lisa Rauter, the head of the InnovationXchange, was here, she would probably say something like, \"Innovation has to be new. It truly has to be a new idea or a concept.\" But I think definition of what's new is quite contextually specific. So, 'new' for a group of EL1s is probably quite different to 'new' for somebody else. So I'm all in favour, really, of enabling people to come together and just brainstorm and challenge each other about how to improve their average day. But I do think we can help that. So, one of the things the InnovationXchange does, and this may be a little bit like BizLabs, is we do have a panel of experts that we can make available to you, to support you on that journey.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So that's, I think, an important thing. Another thing we have is a little pot of money that you can apply to, to say, \"Well, I've got a great idea I want to test.\" So then, you can apply and if it just goes through a couple of hurdles, then you get a bit of money and you can test it out. So there are enablers, and I think having the presence of enablers, enables people to go that first step and try to think and try to put out their idea. And then, also, we've set up our little interactive map to just tell the stories of people who are doing fantastic things all over the aid program already. So, like, without any reference to the InnovationXchange whatsoever, someone out in Vanuatu has pushed the boundaries on the tourism.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So we've got a lovely video about how they've done that and they've actually had to buy a new plane, because there were so many people flying there, they needed a bigger plane. That kind of story is an inspiration to others to say, \"Well, I can do that within my area.\" But being able to capture it and show it and just give them a little bit of a champion, I think that's actually quite important.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Wonderful.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> Yeah, I just had a couple of things to add to that and maybe give a different perspective, because of where we are at on our maturity model, I suppose, in the sense that we've only been running for about seven months now. So the barriers that we're facing are somewhat different and a lot of them are similar. But one thing I did want to say is that I'm in violent agreement around language. And it might be semantics, sometimes, but it's so, so, so important, in terms of how you frame things. I never talk about risk. That's just a red flag. I talk about uncertainty. That's what we're facing. The risk is not doing anything. Doing the same thing is the risk.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> So let's talk about the uncertainty and managing the uncertainty. And I think that's fabulous, what you were saying about framing \u2013 not projects \u2013 but experiments. It's a really, really important mind shift, and setting the expectations around what the output will be. And that's certainly what we're trying to do as well. For me, there's two things. One of the things that often happens when you're trying to do something new and set up a new BizLab is people are like, \"Well, that looks kind of good, but I'll just sit over here and see how they go and if it's good, I might join them. But if it's not, oh, I don't know if I could have a part of it.\" So, you have to get people to buy in.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> Well, how the heck do you do that? I mean, you can talk till you're blue in the face and show them sexy slides and all the rest of it. Nothing gets them engaged like getting them out there in the field, getting them in front of people. And I think one of the biggest projects that we just finished, which was the R&amp;D Tax Incentive project, one of our most massive, the biggest program that we run with DEEWRs. And we took out the band ones with us, in front of customers, and it was quite funny. It was just having a conversation with people, but it was like deer in the headlights. They just sort of sat there. But I've never, in my 25 years, ever seen anyone sit through one of those experiences and not get it.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> Afterwards, you see their eyes change and they get it. They say, \"I see what you're trying to do now.\" And they're on board and they're engaged, and that was really, really powerful. The other point I just wanted to quickly make was around our leadership, when it comes to barriers. It's something I've observed in the APS and it's not just in the APS, but people are always like, \"Well, our leaders don't get it. They don't support us. They say they want to be innovation and they don't walk the talk or anything.\" And a more interesting question to me is, what are you doing to support your leaders in understanding it and in getting it? And what I found worked really well is telling your leaders what you need.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> It sounds really obvious, but, you know, a brief example just a few weeks ago, there was a public forum and they were talking about the innovation successes over the year in this, and BizLab didn't come up. Now, I don't care from a promotional experience, but that was a huge opportunity to signal that we've invested in innovation, we're committed to this, we're training people in this. So, you bring that up to the leader and they were like, \"You know what? You're new? I never even thought of it.\" They're just not on the radar. And then the next week, they mentioned it and talked about it.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> So we've got to take some personal responsibility, I think, as well, for supporting our leaders and not just saying, \"Well, they're not doing anything. We can't be innovative.\" So that would be my bill.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Yeah, and I think\u2026 Let's go with that theme, right? So, at the start, we had a resounding response for both questions was, \"Sometimes.\" Sometimes, they take note. Sometimes, leaders listen. What do you say to the public servants who are out there, that have taken ideas up, been knocked down, they feel they've got no money to innovate, no money to fund innovation \u2013 no time, in fact, to innovate? How do we get it practical? What advice would you give to everyone in the room now, to get that idea up and moving? And what's the role of leadership in that?<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> I'll just make a quick comment on that and I'll hand the microphone over. I think, from my perspective, one of the key things is there's no shortage of ideas. You can have a million ideas and there's a million ideas graveyards, as well. And sometimes, running ideas challenges can actually be demotivating over the longer term, because people put these ideas forward, nothing happens to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> I think a critical thing is to make sure that we're very focused with our challenges, or that individuals are focused, that the ideas you are coming up with are, as much as possible, linked to the strategy and the intentions of the business. If you can come back and support your leader and say, \"I know what you are trying to get to and what we're trying to do and how we're trying to serve the public, and here's a way we can do it,\" you've got a much stronger, in my experience, chance of getting there over the line.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Rick?<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> Yeah, I think one of the\u2026 I mean, you know, it's kind of interesting to reflect on senior leaders and, you know, I think one of the things that's really tough and that I've learnt through the, you know, change process that we've been going through at our organisation over the last four or five years is, you know, necessarily, and, you know, I've been working for 20 years now, you get to senior positions. You've been doing some things for a long time and often, you've been doing certain things in a certain way that have ensured that you became successful. And, you know, it's counterintuitive, but now, we know that there are better ways to do things and so sometimes, you're asking your senior leaders to unlearn some things that have become habits or ways of working.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And just, you know, building on what was said before, there is no more powerful way of doing that than showing, than learning by doing, rather than them trying to learn by telling. And one of the most kind of pivotal moments that we had was when we found we would get, we'd kind of created a bit of momentum. We had some really great teams working in different ways, delivering outcomes, but we just couldn't get the right level of executive support. We thought, we really need our leaders to understand about user-led design, we really need them to understand about agile development, and we really need them to just understand how quickly, with modern technology platforms, you can actually create something.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And we challenged ourselves to say, \"These leaders are really time-poor. What's the shortest amount of time that we need to do that?\" And then we went and found when the next leadership conference was and every quarter, there was like 100 people getting together and typically the CEO would stand up and talk and everyone would listen, and then there would be some break-out sessions and you know the format. And we went and spoke to the person who organised it and we said, \"Can we have that? Can we take over that day and here's what we're going to do.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And they loved it. And so when everyone came in, we said, \"Right, you're in groups and you each were given a customer problem. You now have 24 hours to solve that customer problem and you have to build a working app.\" And, you know, the kind of shock and disbelief that you could sort of feel going through the room was really powerful. But then we said to each of the teams, \"But don't worry. Each of your teams, we're going to give you one coach who really understands how to do this user-led design and we're going to give you one developer. So we're going to give you some resources to make sure that you don't fail.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And within an hour, all those leaders were out on the street or in a post office, doing customer interviews, trying to understand the problem, trying to synthesise the feedback. They had to then bring them back, they had to then explain to the engineer what they wanted built. In the meantime, you know, an app was getting created. And the experience that doing that, and being able to see that you could create working software and, admittedly, it was an app and some of it was framed up. There's a whole bunch of shortcuts that you have to do, to do something in 24 hours.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> But we got all of our leaders to go and talk to customers, as you described, and have real conversations about problems and work and be coached in the way of working, which we kind of think of as the way that everybody should be working, and that was a really powerful moment. And so, I think, sometimes, it's thinking about what you can do and it's thinking about how you can go. Not as you'd always have the conversation, but what could I do to kind of influence someone's mindset? And after that, we had lots of people coming and saying, \"I really want to go and spend more time with this team. They're doing interesting things.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> We had some of the people who were the engineers, the developers, who'd been in that team, working, kind of, as just coding a mobile app, kind of create relationships where there were kind of reverse mentoring about social media and all other sorts of things. And it was a really powerful experience. So just kind of building on what you were saying, I think, sometimes, it's not necessarily about what you say, but it's like, how can I create an experience that changes someone's mindset?<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> And just, Jane, just before you answer or add to that, if you may, we are going to be taking questions now from the floor. We've got two roving mics. So, Jane, after your response, we'll then start to look to the floor for some questions. So, please feel free to raise your hand and we'll get out there. So, Jane, any further thoughts with regards to, you know\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> Think I might just drink the Kool-Aid.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Yeah. Yes.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> I think that one, this little issue we often nut about is that innovation can often be talked about as a shiny thing. So there's an innovation and it is the saviour thing. It's a widget. And I think one of the things we kind of talked to our senior managers about, is that, actually, it's a verb. We can innovating. And it's the way you do your job and the way that you ask people and the way you empower people and the way you demonstrate openness and willingness to listen. It's kind of creating a culture which probably enables things to change a bit faster. So we're not necessarily looking for the widget.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> And then, sometimes, when people have the idea about a widget, we realise it's only kind of half a widget, the idea. So, then, you need to kind of rethink it through with them. So, again, we're sort of learning that finding the innovator is almost as important as finding the innovation. And then working with those people and people who they want to bring with them to bring the ideas to fruition and, if possible, bringing\u2026because they're not actually very often the senior leaders. But if you can bring some senior leaders into that conversation and they go on that journey, then they can pick something up and they can feel good about it too, because they're part of a reflected, it's a reflected chain.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So I don't think\u2026 Yeah, it's not really rocket science and they're just ways of building teams and bringing people into things, which I think is really important.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Wonderful. So, I would ask anyone who does have a question to raise their hands. Not often. In fact, it's very rare that you do get three\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Yes, this gentleman here.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Three innovators on stage and you get to ask him whatever you want.<br/><br/><br/><br/> MARK:<br/><br/> Thank you very much for a very interesting presentation. I'm Mark Watten from the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. My question relates to each end of the innovation process. Innovative ideas is simple. It is simple. But it's about developing a trust and work culture, workplace. And then it's the other end about implementation. And I often see that graveyard that you mentioned, Jane, of really great ideas and they don't go anywhere because of the lack of focus and resourcing on the implementation. I don't know if you got a comment or\u2026 Poor you, Jane.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Yeah. Don't ask me.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> Yeah, I do actually have an answer to that. I have a comment on that. So, Australia is part of something called the \u2013 I don't want to get the name wrong \u2013 but it's basically an international group of countries that have something like the InnovationXchange focussed on development. So it's called the IGIA. So we are behind the curve. Like, the Canadians have had something called Grand Challenges Canada for six years and the US has had their similar thing for about eight years. So we can learn a little bit from them. And one of the things, I think, that's happened is there's been a lot of searching for fantastic innovations.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So all these grand challenges, people who have found the Holy Grail, and they've backed the person who's got the Holy Grail to kind of test it and go from here to here. But it's still kind of out there in a research lab somewhere or it's in one place. It hasn't actually been taken and embedded back in the neighbourhood of the people who provided the money. So with this food challenge, we found the sort of second 20, the things that maybe feel a bit more like home. We're going to spend a bit more time in really embedding those and we're calling it, like, localising innovations in country. And to do that, we're kind of saying, \"Well, this is the innovation.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> And for it to kind of go to scale, firstly, someone's got to want to use it. So we need to find someone that wants to adopt it. It's no good me, saying, \"I want you to do this.\" We've gone out to our partner countries, saying, \"Do you want to try this?\" And anyone who says, \"Yes,\" then we can look at how we can support them on that journey.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> Then, for the innovation to go to scale, the innovation is likely to have to change. So we need to work with the innovator to work out how it can grow over time to be done cheaper, faster, better, at greater scale. But probably, you also need to understand the environment within which the innovation is being tried. So, sort of, the legal environment, the regulatory environment, the education of the farmers, if it's an agriculture innovation. Because that's probably going to have to change a little bit as well to enable the innovation to grow.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So as we're moving past the funky searching into the really \u2013 and this is almost like a business process for engineering, but we're really trying to support things, get traction at that local level and support those people who are taking a risk on doing something different by de-risking it, by a bit of support capital, de-risking it with some technical advice, de-risking it by saying, \"We're here to help you learn and we'll help take the rub off it, if really doesn't work.\" And that's a process that's going to take a year, two years.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JANE HAYCOCK:<br/><br/> So we kind of talk about this, fail fast, fail early thing, but actually, that's not going to be particularly fast or particularly early. It's going to be one, two, three years of just going through working things through, certainly at the ground, to see whether these innovations are going to take traction. So, I think there hasn't been sufficient attention given to that end of the innovation journey and that's, I think, a common lesson coming out from this kind of global experience, where we are hopefully going to be a bit of a test case as to how you can really take things into your own aid program and then get them used. But, you know, it's early days, but we're thinking that way. We want to try.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Jenna, did you have anything further? I'll just get from one of you.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> Yeah, so just a quick comment on the innovation graveyard. I think it's easy to look for reasons to not do it. I have the pleasure of also working with a lot of start-ups. And if you go into the start-up world, obviously, I think within the first two years, 80% of start-ups fail. But nobody is saying, \"We shouldn't do another start-up because all of those other ones failed.\" What we're saying is, and one of the books that I recommend to a lot of founders is a book called The Hard Thing About the Hard Things. It's hard, right?<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> And so, you know, if you're trying to make change and the bigger the change you're trying to make, the harder it necessarily is going to be. And so, I think finding those people, and particularly early on, finding those people who have, you know, who are going to try and push through. And it doesn't necessarily guarantee success, but, you know, and then, creating the enablers and, you know, putting as much support around them as you can, is super important.<br/><br/><br/><br/> RICK WINGFIELD:<br/><br/> But I think within corporates, it's easier to kind of look at the things that didn't work and kind of think of that as necessarily a bad thing. And I think that's something where we really need to think about, \"Well, what did we learn and what are we going to do differently next time?\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Wonderful. And just while we go to our next question, just over onto the right there, I'd like you all to get out your phones again. You've got another couple of polling questions that will open up in a few minutes more and I think this is our last question.<br/><br/><br/><br/> KELLY WEST:<br/><br/> Hi, I'm Kelly West from IP Australia. I just had a question. Do you think, as a society, that we might be falling into the trap of considering that anything, that something that isn't a technology solution, isn't innovative? Because we seem to get a lot of talk about to be innovative, it has to be something completely brand-new and a technology solution, when sometimes, it just could be staring you in the face and not be.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> Yeah. Hi, Kelly. How are you? I think that's a great question and because we face that a lot, and that's why I rarely call what we do 'user-centred design' or 'human-centred design', I think, you know, I've stuck through with innovation as a passion for 25 years when it wasn't sexy and it wasn't on the agenda, but it was the only thing I was good at, and I stuck with it, and now it is and it's been put onto the agenda because of all this new technology. And that's the fireworks you see which are really exciting and it's the big bangs and it's the big fails. But at the end of the day, what sits behind all that is people.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> I think it's a point in time, but what will happen, like a lot of things, is those things won't stick because they're not going to fit into people's lives. So unless they're based on real needs, those things won't stick, I don't think. And I think that in government, the short time I've been here, we can see a lot of just technology platforms, for example. We've got a problem, we need innovation, let's go buy a technology platform. It doesn't go anywhere. It's the people that are behind it. So I think that that we're coming maybe off the cusp of that curve, I hope.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JENNA MCCANN:<br/><br/> But I think it's just where we are in the world at the moment, that that's going to continue. But the rest of us have to realise, at the end of the day, human beings are under this and that, and if it doesn't serve a need, then it probably won't stick.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Wonderful. Now, I think we might be out of time for any further questions. But I'm sure our guests are going to be available for about half an hour after the session and are more than welcome to take any questions that you may have. So we might just open it up to\u2026 And go and get your phones out. We've just got one more polling question for you to have a look at and we'll just bring that up now. So that question, \"Has today's event encouraged you to suggest innovative ideas in your workplace in the future?\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> You now have about 20 seconds to get that response in. Thank you very much.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> Wow. I think we've achieved our outcome. Wonderful. Thank you, everyone. And thank you to our guests. So just as we start to finish up, just a couple of key points that I took away from today's discussion and then I'll ask John to come up. If you're a public servant and you go back to the office tomorrow and you do nothing differently, we haven't achieved our outcome for today. The key, really, is to try it. Try that idea, suggest that idea, and expect detours. Because a lot of the time, you're not going to get it right the first time, but persevere.<br/><br/><br/><br/> CAMERON PITT:<br/><br/> And if you're a leader and you do have people come to you with those ideas, value that idea. Value that innovative mindset and take it with you. Give them a safe environment to try that idea, even if you think it's not going to work the first time. And then, finally, be advocates for those people, because it's every single person that does that is going to move the needle on innovation within the public service and integrate excellence in innovation. So just on that, to close us off for the day, I'd like to pass it over to\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/> JOHN LLOYD:<br/><br/> Thanks, Cameron. I'm John Lloyd, the Public Service Commissioner, and I'd just like to wrap up the day. I've only got about four or five comments to make before I actually think I might do some thankyous. The overall perspective I have as Public Service Commissioner and coming here today, was particularly interested in the people dimension of what we're talking about, how innovation affects work and the workplace culture. As I go around, you'll see a variety of reactions to innovation, from apprehension through to embracing it. And I think the challenge for us is to move it along the scale, until they embrace the edge of the scale.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JOHN LLOYD:<br/><br/> So, I know we've had a very thought-provoking presentation from people with a very experienced perspective, I suppose, of introducing innovation. And in a number of the comments made, it seemed that the two Ls are very important, to link and to learn, if you're doing innovation. Change, in my view, throughout my career, has been constant. But I think, today, it's more powerful. We have more powerful tools today and we have, if you like, a workplace culture much more set up to accept that innovation is part of what we're doing, what we have to do, and of the future. And we're all in it and we all can innovate.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JOHN LLOYD:<br/><br/> And, as I think was mentioned as well, that people from diverse backgrounds contributing to this, make the innovation more effective. And I was particularly attracted by the fact that it's a way to empower people. We get real-time feedback from staff and customers and whatever and therefore, there's great opportunities to help and to improve. With ideas from a whole lot of different sources from the crowd is very important.<br/><br/><br/><br/> JOHN LLOYD:<br/><br/> And I was particularly taken by the idea that while leaders have to be attentive to how they support innovation and support you to innovate, there's also a responsibility to support our leaders as well, in doing that.<br/> In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contct: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROFFN-RPMN41387520170322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFFN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N51-VVX1-DXCW-D251-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"14302\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Premium Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"511\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 22, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX001957</classCode><className>POPULATION &amp; DEMOGRAPHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX013</classCode><className>CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

You've worked hard to promote your newsletter, gotten lots of people to sign up, and started dishing out that HTML gold. But even if your email gets delivered \u2014 where does it get delivered to, exactly? Did it get stuck in a spam filter?</p><p> Locked in a digital quarantine, set to be released too late to be useful? Or if it reaches the inbox, which inbox? 'Focused[2],' or the dreaded 'Other'? Or, for the bazillion Gmail users out there[3], has it been declared a mere 'Promotion' or 'Update'? Newly launched[4] The Markup[5] wants you to know: You're not alone.  Reporters Adrianne Jeffries, Leon Yin, and Surya Mattu ran an experiment[6] to see how Gmail dealt with one important category of messages: emails from presidential candidates or other political groups. And they found some very wide disparities: The Markup set up a new Gmail account to find out how the company filters political email from candidates, think tanks, advocacy groups, and nonprofits.  We found that few of the emails we'd signed up to receive \u2014 11 percent \u2014 made it to the primary inbox, the first one a user sees when opening Gmail and the one the company says is 'for the mail you really, really want.' Half of all emails landed in a tab called 'promotions,' which Gmail says is for 'deals, offers, and other marketing emails.' Gmail sent another 40 percent to spam.  For political causes and candidates, who get a significant amount of their donations through email, having their messages diverted into less-visible tabs or spam can have profound effects. 'The fact that Gmail has so much control over our democracy and what happens and who raises money is frightening,' said Kenneth Pennington, a consultant who worked on Beto O'Rourke's digital campaign. Okay, that's a little overheated even for me, Mr. Pennington. But the really interesting part isn't just that Gmail sends a lot of emails to Promotions or Spam \u2014 it's that the rates at which it did so differed wildly among candidates and groups. For example, 63 percent of Pete Buttigieg's emails and 47 percent of Andrew Yang's were slotting into the primary inbox \u2014 as compared to 2 percent of Bernie Sanders' and Cory Booker's, 1 percent of Amy Klobuchar's, and none of Kamala Harris', Elizabeth Warren's, or Joe Biden's.That's a huge and significant gap!  There doesn't seem to be any clear ideological thread that runs through the senders that Gmail seems to favor (though the conspiracy-friendly will note Buttigieg and Yang each overindexed on Silicon Valley supporters). Among political groups, the conservative American Enterprise Institute and Claremont Institute were top performers \u2014 but so were the Democratic Socialists of America and Avaaz. Still, it's rough to see the extremist John Birch Society (14 percent in primary inbox) have better deliverability than the American Cancer Society (3 percent) or the Sierra Club (0 percent). Of 44 swing-state House campaigns The Markup tracked, only six of them had even a single email make it to the primary inbox. Equal-opportunity disappointment. (Official House emails from currently elected officials did better \u2014 but still suffered a lot of downgrades.) I'll note that \u2014 unlike, say, a deep statistical analysis into regulated car insurance rates[7]\u2014 this is the sort of story you can probably safely try at home, building off The Markup's recipe[8]. Sign up for the email lists of your local politicians, parties, associations, interest groups \u2014 and see what happens. (Personally, I'd love to see someone do the same thing but for news organizations' newsletters. Does the Quartz Daily Obsession[9] have higher deliverability than, say, The New York Times' California Today[10]? The Wall Street Journal's The 10-Point[11] versus Vox Sentences[12]?) This scale of data is hard to draw any hard conclusions from \u2014 other than the noteworthy fact that email newsletters that seem like they should be broadly similar don't see the same kinds of results once they hit the inbox. (The Markup threw up its hands at the task[13] too: 'We did not determine why Gmail categorized certain emails or certain senders' emails the way that it did.') But in the short term, what I hope some enterprising person with time on her hands does next is download gzipped .mbox files[14] \u2014 which contain every email The Markup received \u2014 and see if you can figure out why, exactly, Mayor Pete beat Bernie 63-0. Is it all domain-specific factors \u2014 like, say, if Buttigieg emails were marked as spam by users far less often, or if they had a stellar open rate, and Gmail adjusted delivery accordingly? In other words, is it all about a sender being rewarded or punished for its past behavior? Or is it something specific to the emails themselves \u2014 the subject lines, the From: field, the structure of the HTML, CAN-SPAM compliance[15], the length, the file size, or something else in the switched packets themselves? That could help produce some useful knowledge on how news companies and others can increase deliverability, perhaps beyond what conventional wisdom holds[16].

But I think they ignore a bigger problem - the biggest technology companies were already threatening the openness of the internet, and the repeal of net neutrality is only going to make the situation worse. The internet today looks a lot different than it did in its early days. It's now dominated by a small handful of large tech companies that arguably have more power than the internet providers that the FCC regulated under its net neutrality rules. Facebook, Google, Netflix, and Amazon wield immense control over how we interact with others, get our entertainment, consume news, and shop. Chances are if you experience something online, you're likely doing it through or by way of one of those Big Tech companies.<br/> Those companies' power has grown almost unabated, thanks in large part due to the open nature of the internet. Now, the end of regulations designed to keep the internet open are likely to cement their dominance.<br/> The net neutrality provisions barred broadband providers from block, slowing, or giving preferred treatment to particular sites and services. The repeal of those rules will allow the providers to do things they basically haven't been able to do before, which will likely mean fewer choices and higher prices for you and me .<br/> But the ending of the rules likely won't just mean added costs for consumers; it's also likely to mean new fees for internet companies. In the absence of the net-neutrality provisions, one of the things broadband providers will likely attempt is to charge internet companies tolls to send their web pages or stream their videos to the providers' customers. The repeal of net neutrality could mean added costs - but more power - for Big Tech<br/> Ironically, this could be good news for Big Tech.<br/> Say, for example, Comcast starts charging streaming video providers fees to send their movies, shows, and clips over its wires. Netflixand Google-owned YouTube will likely have no problem shelling out the cash. They won't like it, mind you, but with their deep pockets, they'll be able to afford it. However, the smaller video-streaming companies - whether ones that target particular niches or nascent ones that are aiming to be the next Netflix- likely won't have things so easy. Many probably won't be able to afford such pay-to-play schemes.<br/> And that's just in video. Imagine similar fees targeting messaging providers, e-commerce outlets, or social networking services. The post-net neutrality internet could severely weaken or kill off startup or bootstrapped companies - leaving the current giants even more powerful and much more secure.<br/> To get another idea of how Big Tech could benefit from the repeal of the net neutrality rules, take a look at some of the countries in the developing world whose citizens are just now starting to connect to the internet. In some of those countries, Googleand Facebook have signed deals with particular carriers. While the carriers often charge pricey fees for access to the broader internet, those deals - which it's likely only the Big Tech companies can afford - allow their customers to access Googleand Facebook for free.<br/> Thanks to such preferential agreements, many consumers in those countries think Googleand Facebook are the internet, not realizing there is a vast universe of other sites and services online.<br/> Big Tech's silence was deafening - and revealing<br/> Big Tech has frequently mouthed its support for net neutrality. But if you want to get a sense of what those companies really think about the rules' repeal, take a look at their actions immediately prior to Thursday's vote. Most of them kept a safe distance from the controversy or were completely silent on the issue, only to release stronger statements after the repeal passed .<br/> \"For the most part, the large tech companies did not engage in the protest,\" the New York Times noted<br/> two days before the vote . \"In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules.\"<br/> Their silence was deafening.<br/> There are a lot of reasons to be upset over the FCC's decision to repeal the net neutrality rules. You should worry about your broadband provider or wireless carrier increasing prices, charging you more to use certain services, or doing other things that might degrade your internet experience. But the potential that the repeal could make Facebook, Google, Amazon, and the rest of Big Tech even more powerful is equally as troubling - and deserves just as much scrutiny.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10298398</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R6V-7T91-DYDW-70B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"788\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 18, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The repeal is good news for Facebook, Google, Amazon, and the other big internet companies that have deep pockets and can afford to pay any tolls put in place by the internet providers. The repeal could make the Big Tech companies even more powerful, because their smaller rivals will likely have less ability to afford such fees. In the wake of the Federal Communications Commission's vote Thursday to dismantle its net neutrality rules, there's been a lot of talk about how the move will destroy the free and open nature of the internet. </p><p>I'm not going to dismiss such concerns. But I think they ignore a bigger problem \u2014 the biggest technology companies were already threatening the openness of the internet, and the repeal of net neutrality is only going to make the situation worse. The internet today looks a lot different than it did in its early days. It's now dominated by a small handful of large tech companies that arguably have more power than the internet providers that the FCC regulated under its net neutrality rules. Facebook, Google, Netflix, and Amazon wield immense control over how we interact with others, get our entertainment, consume news, and shop. Chances are if you experience something online, you're likely doing it through or by way of one of those Big Tech companies.  Those companies' power has grown almost unabated, thanks in large part due to the open nature of the internet. Now, the end of regulations designed to keep the internet open are likely to cement their dominance.\u00a0 The net neutrality provisions barred broadband providers from block, slowing, or giving preferred treatment to particular sites and services. The repeal of those rules will allow the providers to do things they basically haven't been able to do before, which will likely mean fewer choices and higher prices for you and me[1]. But the ending of the rules likely won't just mean added costs for consumers; it's also likely to mean new fees for internet companies. In the absence of the net-neutrality provisions, one of the things broadband providers will likely attempt is to charge internet companies tolls to send their web pages or stream their videos to the providers' customers.The repeal of net neutrality could mean added costs \u2014 but more power \u2014 for Big TechIronically, this could be good news for Big Tech. Say, for example, Comcast starts charging streaming video providers fees to send their movies, shows, and clips over its wires. Netflix and Google-owned YouTube will likely\u00a0have no problem shelling out the cash. They won't like it, mind you, but with their deep pockets, they'll be able to afford it. However, the smaller video-streaming companies \u2014 whether ones that target particular niches or nascent ones that are aiming to be the next Netflix \u2014 likely won't have things so easy. Many probably won't be able to afford such\u00a0pay-to-play schemes. And that's just in video. Imagine similar fees targeting messaging providers, e-commerce outlets, or social networking services. The post-net neutrality internet could severely weaken or kill off startup or bootstrapped companies \u2014 leaving the current giants even more powerful and much more secure.  To get another idea of how Big Tech could benefit from the repeal of the net neutrality rules, take a look at some of the countries in the developing world whose citizens are just now starting to connect to the internet. In some of those countries, Google and Facebook have signed deals with particular carriers. While the carriers often charge pricey fees for access to the broader internet, those deals \u2014 which it's likely only the Big Tech companies can afford \u2014 allow their customers to access Google and Facebook for free. Thanks to such preferential agreements, many consumers in those countries think Google and Facebook are the internet, not realizing there is a vast universe of other sites and services online.Big Tech's silence was deafening \u2014 and revealingBig Tech has frequently mouthed its support for net neutrality. But if you want to get a sense of what those companies really think about the rules' repeal, take a look at their actions immediately prior to Thursday's vote. Most of them kept a safe distance from the controversy or were completely silent on the issue, only to release stronger statements after the repeal passed[2]. \"For the most part, the large tech companies did not engage in the protest,\" the New York Times noted[3] two days before the vote. \"In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules.\" Their silence was deafening. There are a lot of reasons to be upset over the FCC's decision to repeal the net neutrality rules. You should worry about your broadband provider or wireless carrier increasing prices, charging you more to use certain services, or doing other things that might degrade your internet experience. But the potential that the repeal could make Facebook, Google, Amazon, and the rest of Big Tech even more powerful is equally as troubling \u2014 and deserves just as much scrutiny.NOW WATCH: How much

As part of that rethinking, technology companies have been engaged in a slow-moving debate with U.S. elected officials and the public about how to make the internet less of a toxic cesspool.</p><p>If you believe that the tech superpowers will emerge largely unchanged from this more critical reassessment of the internet, Wednesday's events should put that optimism to rest. We got fresh evidence that multiple U.S. government institutions are crawling all over the tech companies and questioning what they do - increasing the odds of regulatory, legislative, legal or financial blows.</p><p>I'm not talking about the U.S. Senate hearing on Wednesday, which was a good faith effort to discuss how to prevent foreign government abuse of U.S. social media, falsified internet videos and drug dealing online. Nor am I talking about the House of Representatives session during which Twitter Inc.'s CEO was taken to task for how his company polices the internet hangout.</p><p>Those were sideshows to the biggest tech news out of Washington on Wednesday. In a statement issued between the Senate and House hearings, the Department of Justice picked up on rightwing criticisms of internet companies and implied the government is considering using its legal authority to look into the claims. The Justice Department said it would convene a meeting of state attorneys general to \"discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.\"</p><p>I wasn't sure from the statement if the Justice Department wants to examine whether tech companies are violating competition laws - a question that is a fair subject debate or investigation - as a connected or separate issue from mostly disingenuous complaints from President Donald Trump and others that internet companies are unfairly silencing conservative voices online. Either way, the country's top legal authority is hijacking serious questions about the power of internet companies and turning it into political pandering.</p><p>Maybe Attorney General <person><nameText>Jeff Sessions </nameText></person>will convene one meeting and then drop the matter. Or maybe not. Regardless, the Justice Department engaging in bad-faith inquiries of tech companies should terrify the industry and its investors.</p><p>And the statement was a jolting reminder that multiple U.S. government institutions are at various states of war with tech companies. There's the White House, of course, which has at times bashed Amazon.com Inc., Google and Twitter. The Federal Trade Commission has scheduled a series of public meetings about the digital economy and the market power of the tech giants. Senator Orrin Hatch also recently asked the FTC to reopen an antitrust investigation into Google.</p><p>At the Federal Communications Commission, the chairman has repeatedly criticized big internet companies. Members of Congress are pursuing potential legislation that would impose more restrictions on the sector. Outside the federal government, California recently passed a vigorous new law on digital data privacy, and various state attorneys general are trying to crack down.</p><p>This is not business as usual. The political scrutiny is coming from so many fronts that it seems impossible for the internet superpowers to mould the outcomes to suit their interests.</p><p>There are also signs that political backlash is contributing to shifting consumer sentiment about at least some of the U.S. internet powers. Pew Research Center in June said the vast majority of survey respondents who identify as Republicans or right-leaning independents believe social networks censor political speech that the companies find objectionable. (A majority of Democrats and left-leaning independents believed this, too.) The dominant belief that the internet powers are politically motivated censors is a dangerous phenomenon for tech companies.</p><p>In another worrisome sign, Pew this week released a survey of U.S. Facebook users that found 42 per cent had taken a break from the social network for several weeks or more during the last year. Pew said that Republicans and Democrats were equally likely to have restricted their Facebook activity in some fashion. It's one thing on which a divided nation can agree: Americans want to pull back from Facebook.</p><p>Political fights and souring feelings from users is a toxic stew for the U.S. internet powers. The last two years of technology crises have hurt the tech superpowers, and we're just beginning to see the fallout. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

DN: Naturally, any job losses are a concern. I haven't had an opportunity to meet the new company yet, but I will in the next fortnight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm anxious to see what the company's plans are and how they intend to invest in the telecoms sector in this country. But the one thing that is exciting about it is that we now have a telecoms company taking over Eir.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's the first time for a long time that the owners of Eir are in the telecoms sector themselves. This company probably wouldn't have bought Eir unless they see that there's an opportunity there for them. It'll be interesting to see exactly where they see their niche.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Obviously, Eir has changed ownership many times in its history. But after a lot of financial trouble, it has recently established a fairly sound fiscal footing and started to invest in regional infrastructure. Do you have any fear of Eir now being sweated and flipped? DN: I actually don't. The fact that the owner is a telecoms company, the fact that what they seem to be doing in other jurisdictions is building out infrastructure.</p><p>To be sure, in those other jurisdictions they're competing against the incumbent and now they're becoming the incumbent here. But they've been about building out infrastructure. I hope and believe that it will look at a new phase of investment in telecoms here. Because we haven't seen it to any great extent in Eir in the past, other than the investment in the 300,000 regional fibre homes.</p><p>Are you worried at all about the company's ability to deliver on that plan to roll out 300,000 regional fibre-broadband connections when they downsize to such a degree? DN: Well, of course I'll be asking them about the delivery of the 300,000 regional homes that they've committed to.</p><p>Do you have any indication that they'll go beyond the 300,000? DN: I've absolutely no idea. And that's why I'm anxious to meet them.</p><p>What about Enet getting access to Eir's infrastructure, to make it easier in building out the National Broadband Plan? DN: That's an issue that has been ongoing with Eir over the last number of weeks between my own officials and Eir. And it will be an issue with the new owners when I meet them early next month. We are anxious to see progress on that. It's in everyone's interest to build out this infrastructure.</p><p>Would you be willing to force that issue through the courts to ensure access for the NBP? Otherwise there is possibly a very large bill to be added to it.</p><p>DN: Everyone knows the difficulties we've had in relation to regulation via the courts in this country.</p><p>I have flagged, before Christmas, and it got Government approval, to draft legislation specifically in relation to infrastructure access for the National Broadband Plan. And that is part of the overall discussion we're having with the company at present.</p><p>Could 5G play a part in bridging the gaps? DN: I remember when Eir pulled back [from the National Broadband Plan] some people were saying that 4G was the solution for rural areas.</p><p>But we know from when the National Broadband Scheme was initially launched [in 2009], that was a 3G solution which was going to provide broadband in rural areas. But we know that the day it went live it was obsolete. Because it just doesn't have the capacity.</p><p>In fairness, we could say the same about the 30Mbs nominal limit that the Government has as its definition of highspeed broadband and which determines whether your home needs intervention via the National Broadband Plan or not. DN: Absolutely. When the 30Mbs benchmark was set, it was seen as a good target. The reality is now, you really need to be delivering a service that's at least 100Mbs. With fibre, we're talking up to 1,000Mbs. And I'm even told it's up to 10,000Mbs. Fibre is the solution, it's the only way to future-proof this network.</p><p>We were the first country in the world to bring electricity to every single home. We're now going to be the first country in the world to bring high-speed broadband to rural areas through the National Broadband Plan. But we're also aware of urban areas as well, to address those anomalies where people don't have access there, even in the centre of cities.</p><p>And we now think that in urban areas the only way to future-proof this is to come with a universal service obligation. It's worked very well for us in relation to voice services, as everyone in Ireland can get access to a landline and they have a legal right to that. The same will be there in future in relation to broadband.</p><p>So you're saying there will be a universal service obligation for broadband? DN: Yes. We have been negotiating this as part of discussions taking place at European level in relation to the European digital and social market where the state can set a minimum level of service for broadband that is a real practical level of service. At the moment you have this definition of functional broadband which is a joke. It's minuscule. So you'd have a proper threshold that would be set.</p><p>Which company would this be placed on? The existing USO for voice is on Eir. DN: That would have to be regulated as to who is deemed the company responsible for that. It will be an issue for ComReg in the future. But what we want now is the tools to be able to bring that in, to ensure that for any anomaly that is there, for any premises that doesn't have access to high-speed broadband, that there is a legal guarantee that they can get broadband in the future.</p><p>Does a legal guarantee mean they can sue? And if so, who? DN: That will be up to each member state, in this case Ireland. It could be the case that there will be a pool of money there for companies to dip into, to provide that service. But the intention is that everyone in this country, no matter how far they are from Leinster House, has access to highspeed broadband.</p><p>When do you see this coming into effect? DN: That's part of the negotiations at the moment. We have it accepted, in principle, at a European level.</p><p>That will be incorporated into the new directives which will probably be approved, we're hoping, later this year. It will then be enshrined in Irish law after that.</p><p>Is the National Broadband Plan currently on track? DN: Yes. There is significant progress now on how we're going to build it out. I'm determined that we sign that contract this year.</p><p>Do you think we could get to Christmas with no contract signed and an start to work in sight? DN: I hope that won't happen. You can never be absolute in relation to this, I wish I could be.</p><p>But I would be very surprised if we were reading [that it hasn't been signed] coming up to Christmas. But yes, it has been frustratingly slow. I'm 20 years talking about broadband, so I have been keeping the pressure on my officials and on the whole operation to make sure it happens as quickly as possible.</p><p>I know the frustration that's out there. At the moment it's mainly business that's frustrated and also families. But the opportunities that this provides are absolutely immense. I don't think we can fully comprehend it. Electrification changed the whole rural economy. I think broadband can do the same.</p><p>Now that there's one bidder, is there less pressure on them now to provide the best value given they're the only remaining bidder? DN: People tend to forget the type of contract it is. Many of these issues have already been bottomed out and signed off when there were two or three bidders in the process. There are other aspects, too.</p><p>This has to go through a value-for-money assessment and has to be signed off by the Department of Expenditure and Reform. The European Commission will also have to sign off on it, as will Cabinet.</p><p>But won't those entities obviously sign off on it? Who would block it? DN: At the end of the day, this will be assessed by the comptroller and auditor <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.general.No\">www.general.No</url> one wants to be in a situation two or three years from now where the comptroller and auditor general comes out and says this was bad value for money.</p><p>So that is something that we're all very conscious of and something that is to the fore of these discussions.</p><p>Mobile coverage is also a big issue for lots of people, particularly in rural areas. Is there any progress on a mobile coverage map? DN: Yes. Ofcom, the UK equivalent of ComReg, has a coverage map for all of the mobile phone operators in the UK.</p><p>We're currently working with ComReg to do the same thing. And by the end of this year we will have a mobile phone coverage map available. So if you live in Roscommon, you'll be able to see if operator A has better coverage in your area than operator B. One of the things we've found is that when people complain about mobile coverage, you can nearly predict which operator they're with depending on where they live.</p><p>Is this data that the operators themselves feed in? DN: Yes.</p><p>So how will we know whether they're accurate? Is there any verification? DN: Absolutely. That's one of the things we're talking about. There will be a facility on it where you can download an app that actually feeds back your actual coverage.</p><p>And this can feed back to update that map. So if operator A says there's coverage in a bit of Roscommon but actually you don't have coverage there, that's fed back into the map.</p><p>Don't apps like Speedtest already have this kind of information? DN: Yes, but this will be publicly available.</p><p>When will this be up and running? DN: ComReg expects this to be operational by year end, which will be a big boost coming into the Christmas market.</p><p>Why are electric car sales still so low? DN: There were huge targets in relation to it. We have about 4,500 registrations of electric vehicles. We're doing a lot of work.</p><p>There has been anecdotal evidence that people are importing second-hand vehicles from the UK. The big problem I'm told is that companies cannot get enough EVs to meet demand. Demand is actually outstripping supply and there is a pinch point. The changes that the Government made in last autumn's budget are actually having an impact. There are far more queries in relation to it but there is a squeeze in relation to EVs and they're hoping by the middle of the year when the second round of registrations come along, that we will see a significant increase in the numbers.</p><p>Why don't you drive more electric vehicles in government? DN: We're working on that at present. We've set aside a fund of (EURO)5m specifically to promote EVs. We're also providing funding for private companies and semistate companies to convert some of their fleet to electric. The gardai have six electric vehicles at the moment, while the defence forces are in the process of purchasing them. The OPW is looking at it and our own department are looking it.</p><p>But what about you and your own car? DN: I've a Toyota Prius. It's a hybrid. I would love to be able to get an electric vehicle but the range just isn't there at the moment. Sadly, I don't live near enough to Dublin that that isn't an issue for me.</p><p>Down the line if we do all change to EVs, how does the government replace all the taxation that we're going to lose from petrol and diesel and VRT? DN: That's a big question, not just here in Ireland, but right across the OECD. How do we replace the lost revenue? A substantial amount of revenue comes in from fossil fuels at the moment. And it is a far bigger issue than just Ireland.</p><p>To hear Mr Naughten's full interview, download or stream 'The Big Tech Show' podcast from iTunes, Soundcloud or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Independent.ie/podcasts\">www.Independent.ie/podcasts</url>.</p><p>Fibre is the solution,  ;  ;  it's the only way  ;  ;  to future-proof  ;  ;  this network ;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Denis Naughten has vowed that no matter how far people are from Leinster House they will have access to highspeed broadband</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-137199280</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7K-TGB1-JBVM-Y4TY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1928\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 3, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001010</classCode><className>LAYOFFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>N517000CC</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000214</classCode><className>BROADBAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Although Tim Cook got off relatively easy, each CEO was hammered for the specific ways in which their companies might be in violation of antitrust law.</p><p> *</p><p>Google's Sundar Pichai took the brunt of the heat in this hearing. Members of congress grilled Pichai on Google's market dominance as both a search engine and ads marketplace. Aside from any real competition in search (sorry, Bing), Pichai also had to reckon with Google surfacing results from its own products (like product or restaurant recommendations), rather than recommendation results from competitors (like Yelp).</p><p> *</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg's pale face was in as bright a spotlight as ever. A number of damning emails read aloud showed how Facebook intentionally executed a plan to crush competition by duplicating products, threatening competitors with promises that it would hurt their business through that copycating, and then acquiring businesses or taking over market share.</p><p> *</p><p> Jeff Bezos had to answer for which products Amazon privileges in both search and delivery, and how it uses data from third party sellers to inform its own Amazon-branded products.</p><p> *</p><p> Though Tim Cook spoke by far the least of any CEO, when congresspeople did actually ask Cook questions related to antitrust, they concerned the fees Apple charges developers. Developers and companies like Spotify say Apple's market dominance (or, how you say, monopoly?), leaves them with no choice but to pay \"exorbitant\" fees.</p><p> Republicans couldn't stop talking about anti-conservative bias</p><p> Congressman Matt Gaetz (R-FL)  is really concerned about Gateway Pundit's Google search ranking.</p><p> \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives:\" Today's antitrust hearing featured a not-unexpected outburst from Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the full Judiciary Committee who's become a public face of GOP complaints that Silicon Valley is biased <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/b06KZAHNY1\">https://t.co/b06KZAHNY1</url> pic.twitter.com/PtGwRill9r</p><p>  \u2014 POLITICO (@politico) July 29, 2020</p><p> Republicans like Gaetz and Jim Jordan (R-OH) repeatedly claimed Google and Facebook were biased against conservatives, and that this bias affected how Google ranked websites and Facebook moderated content. This is supposedly related to antitrust because it paints tech companies as the big liberal oppressors over the republican little guys. In fact, the evidence of these claims is anecdotal, which is to say there is no actual evidence at all.</p><p> Reps asked questions about so much that had nothing to do with antitrust - some valid, some inane</p><p> Listen, when you have four of the world's most powerful people at your disposal, it's understandable that you'd want to stray off topic from time to time. But even beyond the unjustifiable amount of time nonsense questions about political bias took up, representatives really went off book.</p><p> Some of the off-topic questions were valid. Rep. Lucy McBath took the opportunity to ask the CEOs to commit to improving diversity. How the companies were handling coronavirus information and misinformation also came up.</p><p> Other questions were clearly meant to elevate republican talking points. All four CEOs were asked whether China had been stealing their IP - a key argument in Trump's anti-China agenda.</p><p> The CEOs of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon were just asked if they believe China steals technology from U.S. firms.</p><p> Cook: We haven't experienced it.</p><p> Pichai: Neither have we.</p><p> Zuckerberg: Yes, absolutely.</p><p> Bezos: I've read that. pic.twitter.com/vbG2K1Dhq8</p><p>  \u2014 Jack Nicas (@jacknicas) July 29, 2020</p><p> Sundar Pichai and Google's \"values\" were questioned when asked why the company had canceled Pentagon contracts. Rep. Jim Jordan railed against cancel culture, and asked all the CEOs whether they thought it was a problem. Lord.</p><p> Jim Jordan lost his shit</p><p> After Jordan posited coronavirus and anti-conservative conspiracy theories as fact in one of his questions to Pichai, his house of reps colleague Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA) issued an epic burn.</p><p> \"Gentlemen, I'd like to redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories,\" Scanlon said, addressing the CEOs.</p><p> This caused Jordan to explode in response, subcommittee chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) to bang his gavel and yell at Jordan to be respectful, and Rep.

Some of it's due a general perception that big American social-media companies, amorally or immorally driven by the profit motive, are eroding our privacy and selling our data to other companies or turning it over to the government\u2014or both. Some of it's due to the perception that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms are bad for us\u2014that maybe even Google's or Microsoft's search engines are bad for us[1]\u2014and that they make us worse people or debase public discourse. Taken together, it's more than enough fodder for politicians[2] or would-be pundits[3] to stir up generalized anxiety about big tech. </p><p>But regardless of where this moral panic[4] came from, the current wave of anxiety about internet intermediaries and social-media platforms has its own momentum now. So we can expect many more calls for regulation of these internet tools and platforms in the coming months and years. Which is why it's a good idea to itemize the criticisms we've already seen, or are likely to see, in current and future public-policy debates about regulating the internet. We need to chart the kinds of arguments for new internet regulation that are going to confront us, so I've been compiling a list of them. It's a work in progress, but here are three major claims that are driving recent expressions of concern about social media and internet companies generally[5]. (1) Social media are bad for you because they use algorithms to target you, based on the data they collect about you. It's well-understood now that Facebook and other platforms gather data about what interests you in order to shape what kinds of advertising you see and what kind of news stories you see in your news feed (if you're using a service that provides one). Some part of the anxiety here is driven by the idea (more or less correct) that an internet company is gathering data about your likes, dislikes, interests, and usage patterns, which means it knows more about you in some ways than perhaps your friends (on social media and in what we now quaintly call \"real life\") know about you. Possibly more worrying than that, the companies are using algorithms\u2014computerized procedures aimed at analyzing and interpreting data\u2014to decide what ads and topics to show you. It's worth noting, however, that commercial interests have been gathering data about you since long before the advent of the internet. In the 1980s and before in the United States, if you joined one book club or ordered one winter coat on Land's End, you almost certainly ended up on mailing lists and received other offers and many, many mail-order catalogs. Your transactional information was marketed, packaged, and sold to other vendors (as was your payment and credit history). If false information was shared about you, you perhaps had some options ranging from writing remove-me-from-your-list letters to legal remedies under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act[6]. But the process was typically cumbersome, slow, and less-than-completely satisfactory (and still is when it comes to credit-bureau records). One advantage with some internet platforms is that (a) they give you options to quit seeing ads you don't like (and often to say just why you don't like them), and (b) the internet companies, anxious about regulation, don't exactly want to piss you off. (In that sense, they may be more responsive than TiVo[7] could be.) Of course it's fair\u2014and, I think, prudent\u2014to note that the combination of algorithms and \"big data\" may have real consequences for democracy and for freedom of speech. Yale's Jack Balkin has recently written an excellent law-review article that targets these issues[8]. At the same time, it seems possible for internet platforms to anonymize data they collect in ways that pre-internet commercial enterprises never could. (2) Social Media are bad for you because they allow you to create a filter bubble[9] where you see only (or mostly) opinions you agree with. (2)(a) Social media are bad for you because they foment heated arguments between you and those you disagree with. To some extent, these two arguments run against each other\u2014if you only hang out online with people who think like you, it seems unlikely that you'll have quite so many fierce arguments, right? (But maybe the arguments between people who share most opinions and backgrounds are fiercer?) In any case, it seems clear that both \"filter bubbles\" and \"flames\" can occur. But when they do, statistical research suggests, it's primarily because of user choice, not algorithms. In fact, as a study in Public Opinion Quarterly reported last year[10], the algorithmically driven social-media platforms may be both increasing polarization and increasing users' exposures to opposing views. The authors summarize their conclusions this way:\"We find that social networks and search engines are associated with an increase in the mean ideological distance between individuals. However, somewhat counterintuitively, these same channels also are associated with an increase in an individual's exposure to material from his or her less preferred side of the political spectrum.\"In contrast, the case that \"filter bubbles\" are a particular, polarizing problem relies to a large degree not on statistics but on anecdotal evidence[11]. That is, the people who don't like arguing or who can't bear too different a set of political opinions tend to curate their social-media feeds accordingly, while people who don't mind arguments (or even love them) have no difficulty encountering heterodox viewpoints on Facebook or Twitter. (At various times I've fallen into one or the other category on the internet, even before the invention of social media or the rise of Google's search engine[12].) The argument about 'filter bubbles'\u2014people self-segregating and self-isolating into like-minded online groups\u2014is an argument that predates modern social media and the dominance of modern search engines. Law professor Cass Sunstein advanced it in his 2001 book, Republic.com[13] and hosted a website forum to promote that book. I remember this well because I showed up in the forum to express my disagreement with his conclusions\u2014hoping that my showing up as a dissenter would itself raise questions about Sunstein's version of the 'filter bubble' hypothesis. I didn't imagine I'd change Sunstein's mind, though, so I was unsurprised to see the professor has revised and refined his hypothesis, first in Republic.com 2.0[14] in 2007 and now in #Republic: Divided Democracy in the Age of Social Media[15], published just this year. (3) Social media are bad for you because they are profit-centered, mostly (including the social media that don't generate profits). \"If you're not paying for the product, you're the product.\"[16] That's a maxim with real memetic resonance[17], I have to admit. This argument is related to argument number 1 above, except that instead of focusing on one's privacy concerns, it's aimed at the even-more-disturbing idea that we're being commodified and sold by the companies who give us free services. This necessarily includes Google and Facebook, which provide users with free access but which gather data that is used primarily to target ads. Both of those companies are profitable. Twitter, which also serves ads to its users, isn't yet profitable, but of course aspires to be[18]. As a former employee of the Wikimedia Foundation\u2014which is dedicated to providing Wikipedia and other informational resources to everyone in the world, for free\u2014I don't quite know what to make of this. Certainly the accounts of the early days of Google[19] or of Facebook[20] suggest that advertising as a mission typically arose after the founders realized that their new internet services needed to make money. But once any new company starts making money by the yacht-load, it's easy to dismiss the whole enterprise as essentially mercenary. (In Europe, much more ambivalent to commercial enterprises than the United States, it's far more common to encounter this dismissiveness. This helps explain some the Europe's greater willingness to regulate the online world[21]. The fact that so many successful internet companies are American also helps explain that impulse[22].) But Wikipedia has steadfastly resisted even the temptation to sell ads\u2014even though it could have become an internet commercial success just as IMDB.com has\u2014because the Wikipedia volunteers and the Wikimedia Foundation see value in providing something useful and fun to everyone regardless of whether one gets rich doing so. So do the creators of free and open-source software[23]. If creating free products and services doesn't always mean you're out to sell other people into data slavery, shouldn't we at least consider the possibility that social-media companies may really mean it when they declare their intentions to do well by doing good? ('Do Well By Doing Good' is a maxim commonly attributed to Benjamin Franklin\u2014who of course sold advertising, and even wrote advertising copy, for his Pennsylvania Gazette[24].) I think it's a good idea to follow Mike Masnick's advice to stop repeating this 'you're the product' slogan[25]\u2014unless you're ready to condemn all traditional journals that subsidize giving their content to you through advertising. So that's the current top three chart-toppers for the Social Media-Are-Bad-For-You Greatest Hits. But this is a crowded field\u2014only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to trendy criticisms of social-media platforms, search engines, and unregulated mischievous speech on the internet--and we expect to see many other competing criticisms of Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc. surface in the weeks and months to come. I'm already working on Part 2.

Now, here's Part 2. This Part should have come earlier; Part 1 was published in November. I'd hubristically[2] imagined that this is a project that might take a week or a month. But I didn't take into account the speed with which the landscape of the criticism is changing. </p><p>For example, just as you're trying to do more research into whether Google really is making us dumber[3], another pundit (Farhad Manjoo at the New York Times) comes along and argues that Apple -- a tech giant no less driven by commercial motives than Google and its parent company, Alphabet -- ought to redesign its products[4] to make us smarter (by making them less addictive). That is, it's Apple's job to save us from Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other attention-demanding internet media \u2014 which we connect to through Apple's products, as well as many others. In these same few weeks, Facebook has announced it's retooling[5] the user experience for Facebook users in ways aimed at making the experience more personal and interactive and less passive. Is this an implicit admission that Facebook, up until now, has been bad for us? If so, is it responding to the charges that many observers have leveled at social-media companies \u2014 that they're bad for us and that they're bad for democracy. And only this last week, social-media companies have responded to concerns[6] about political extremists (foreign and domestic) in Senate testimony. Although the senators had broad concerns (ISIS recruitment, bomb-making information on YouTube), there was, of course, some allocation of time on the ever-present question of Russian \"misinformation campaigns,\"[7] which may not have altered the outcome of 2016's elections but still may aim to affect 2018 mid-terms and beyond. These are recent developments, but coloring them all is a more generalized social anxiety about social media and big internet companies that is nowhere better summarized than in Senator Al Franken's last major public policy address[8]. Whatever you think of Senator Franken's tenure, I think his speech was a useful accumulation of the growing sentiment among commentators that there's something out of control[9] with social media and internet companies that needs to be brought back into control. Now, let's be clear: even if I'm skeptical here about some claims that social media and internet giants are bad for us, that doesn't mean these criticisms necessarily lack any merit at all. But it's always worth remembering that, historically, every new mass medium (and mass-medium platform) has been declared first to be wonderful for us, and then to be terrible for us. So it's always important to ask whether any particular claim about the harms of social media or internet companies is reactive, reflexive... or whether it's grounded in hard facts. Here are reasons 4, 5, and 6 to believe social media are bad for us. (Remember, reasons 1, 2, and 3 are here[10].) (4) Social media (and maybe some other internet services) are bad for us because they're super-addictive, especially on our sweet, slick handheld devices. \"It's Time for Apple to Build a Less Addictive iPhone,\" according to New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo, who published a column to that effect recently. To be sure, although \"Addictive\" is in the headline, Manjoo is careful to say upfront that, although iPhone use may leave you feeling \"enslaved,\" it's not \"not Apple's fault\" and it \"isn't the same as [the addictiveness] of drugs or alcohol.\" Manjoo's column was inspired by an open letter from an ad-hoc advocacy group[11] that included an investment-management firm and the California State Teachers Retirement System (both of which are Apple shareholders). The letter, available here at ThinkDifferentlyAboutKids.com[12] (behind an irritating agree-to-these-terms dialog) calls for Apple to add more parental-control choices for its iPhones (and other internet-connected devices, one infers). After consulting with experts, the letter's signatories argue, \"we note that Apple's current limited set of parental controls in fact dictate a more binary, all or nothing approach, with parental options limited largely to shutting down or allowing full access to various tools and functions.\" Per the letter's authors: \"we have reviewed the evidence and we believe there is a clear need for Apple to offer parents more choices and tools to help them ensure that young consumers are using your products in an optimal manner.\" Why Apple in particular? Obviously, the fact that two of the signatories own a couple of billion dollars' worth of Apple stock explains this choice to some extent. But one hard fact is that Apple's share of the smartphone market mostly stays in the 12-to-20-percent range[13]. (Market leader Samsung has held 20-30 percent of the market since 2012.) Still, the implicit argument is that Apple's software and hardware designs for the iPhone will mostly lead the way for other phone-makers going forward, as they mostly have for the first decade of the iPhone era. Still, why should Apple want to do this? The idea here is that Apple's primarily a hardware-and-devices company \u2014 which distinguishes Apple from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter, all of which primarily deliver an internet-based service. Of course, Apple's an internet company too (iTunes, Apple TV, iCloud, and so on), but the company's not hooked on the advertising revenue streams that are the primary fuel for Google, Facebook, and Twitter, or on the sales of other, non-digital merchandise (like Amazon). The ad revenue for the internet-service companies creates what Manjoo argues are \"misaligned incentives\" \u2014 when ad-driven businesses' economic interests lie in getting more users clicking on advertisements, he reasons, he's \"skeptical\" that (for example) Facebook is the going to offer any real solution to the \"addiction\" problem. Ultimately, Manjoo agrees with the ThinkDifferentlyAboutKids letter -- Apple's in the best position to fix iPhone \"addiction\" because of their design leadership and independence from ad revenue. Even so, Apple has other incentives to make iPhones addictive \u2014 notably, pleasing its other investors[14]. Still, investors may ultimately be persuaded that Apple-led fixes will spearhead improvements, rooted in our devices, of our social-media experience. (See, for example, this column: Why Investors May Be the Next to Join the Backlash Against Big Tech's Power[15].) It's worth remembering that the idea technology is addictive is itself an addictive idea \u2014 not that long ago, it was widely (although not universally) believed that television was addictive. This New York Times story from 1990 advances that argument[16], although the reporter does quote a psychiatrist who cautions that \"the broad definition\" of addiction \"is still under debate.\" (Manjoo's \"less addictive iPhone\" column inoculates itself, you'll recall, by saying iPhone addiction is \"not the same.\") \"Addiction\" of course is an attractive metaphor, and certainly those of us who like using our electronics to stay connected can see the appeal of the metaphor. And Apple, which historically has been super-aware of the degree to which its products are attractive to minors, may conclude\u2014or already have concluded, as the ThinkDifferentlyAboutKids folks admit \u2014 that more parental controls are a fine idea. But is it possible that smartphones maybe already incorporate a solution for addictiveness? Just the week before Manjoo's column, another Times writer, Nellie Bowles asked whether we can make our phones less addictive just by playing with the settings. (The headline? \"Is the Answer to Phone Addiction a Worse Phone?\"[17]) Bowles argues, based on interviews with researchers, that simply setting your phone to use grayscale instead of color inclines users to respond less emotionally and impulsively\u2014in other words, more mindfully\u2014when deciding whether to respond to their phones. Bowles says she's trying the experiment herself: \"I've gone gray, and it's great.\" At first it seems odd to focus on the device's user interface (parental settings, or color palette) if the real problem of addictiveness is internet content (social media, YouTube and other video, news updates, messages). One can imagine a Times columnist in 1962\u2014in the opening years of widespread color TV\u2014 responding to Newt Minow's famous \"vast wasteland\"[18] speech by arguing that TV-set manufacturers should redesign sets so that they're somewhat more inconvenient\u2014no remote controls, say\u2014and less colorful to watch. (So much for NBC's iconic Peacock opening logo[19]) In the interests of science, I'm experimenting with some of these solutions myself. For years already I've configured my iDevices not to bug me with every Facebook and Twitter update or new-email notice. Plus, I was worried about this grayscale thing on my iPhone X\u2014one of the major features of which is a fantastic camera. But it turns out that you can toggle between grayscale and color easily once you've set gray as the default. I kind of like the novelty of all-gray\u2014no addiction-withdrawal syndrome yet, but we'll see how that goes. (5) Social media are bad for us because they make us feel bad, alienating us from one another and causing is to be upset much of the time.  Manjoo says he's skeptical whether Facebook is going to fix the addictiveness of its content and interactions with users, thanks to those \"misaligned incentives.\" It should be said of course that Facebook's incentives\u2014to use its free services to create an audience for paying advertisers\u2014at least have the benefit of being straightforward. (Apple's not dependent on ads, but they still want new products to be attractive enough for users to want to upgrade.) Still, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has announced that the company is redesigning Facebook's user experience[20], (focusing first on its news feed) to emphasize quality time (\"time well spent\") over more \"passive\" consumption of the Facebook ads and video that may generate more hits for some advertisers. Zuckerberg maintains that Facebook, even as it has operated over the last decade-plus of general public access, had been good for many and maybe for most users:\"The research shows that when we use social media to connect with people we care about, it can be good for our well-being. We can feel more connected and less lonely, and that correlates with long term measures of happiness and health.\"Even so, Zuckerberg writes (translating what Facebook has been hearing from some social-science researchers), \"passively reading articles or watching videos -- even if they're entertaining or informative -- may not be as good.\" This is a gentler way of characterizing what some researchers have recently been arguing, which is that, for some people at least, using Facebook causes depression. This article for example, relies on sociologist Erving Goffman's conceptions[21] of how we distinguish between our public and private selves[22] as we navigate social interactions. Facebook, it's argued, \"collapses\" our public and private presentations\u2014the result is what social-media researcher danah boyd calls \"context collapse.\"[23] A central idea here is that, because what we publish on Facebook for our circle is also to some high degree public, we are stressed by the need (or inability) to switch between versions of how we present ourselves. In addition context collapse, the highly curated pages we see from other people on Facebook may suggest that their lives are happy in ways that ours are not. I think both Goffman's and boyd's contributions to our understanding of the sociology of identity (both focus on how we present ourselves in context) are extremely useful, but it's important to think clearly about any links between Facebook (and other social media) and depression. To cut to the chase: there may in fact be strong correlations between social-media use and depression, at least for some people. But it's unclear whether social media actually cause depression; it seems just as likely that causation may go in the other direction. Consider that depression has also been associated with internet use generally (prior to the rise of social-media platforms), with television watching, and even, if you go back far enough, with what is perceived to be excessive consumption of novels and other fiction[24]. Books, of course, are now regarded as redemptive diversions[25] that may actually cure your depression. So here's a reasonable alternative hypothesis: when you're depressed you seek diversion from depression\u2014which may be Facebook, Twitter, or something else, like novels or binge-watching quality TV[26]. It may be things that are genuinely good for you (books! Or The Wire![27]) or things that are unequivocally bad for you. (Don't try curing your depression with drinking!) Or it may be social media, which at least some users will testify they find energizing and inspiring rather than enervating and dispiriting. As a longtime skeptic regarding studies of internet usage (a couple of decades ago I helped expose a fraudulent article about \"cyberporn\" usage[28]), I don't think the research on social media and its potential harmful side-effects is any more conclusive than Facebook's institutional belief that its social-media platforms are beneficial. But I do think Facebook as a dominant, highly profitable social-media platform is under the gun. And, as I've written here and elsewhere, its sheer novelty may be generating a moral panic[29]. So it's no wonder\u2014especially now that the U.S. Congress (as well as European regulators) are paying more attention to social media\u2014that we're seeing so many Facebook announcements recently that are aimed at showing the company's responsiveness to public criticism. Whether you think anxiety about social-media is merited or otherwise, you may reasonably be cynical about whether a market-dominant for-profit company will refine itself to act more consistently in the public interest\u2014even in the face of public criticism or governmental impulses to regulate. But such a move is not unprecedented[30]. The key question is whether Facebook's course corrections -- steering us towards personal interactions over \"passive\" consumption of things like news reports -- really do help us. (For example, if you believe in the filter-bubble hypothesis[31], it seems possible that Facebook's privileging of personal interactions over news may make filter bubbles worse.) This brings us to Problem Number 6, below. (6) Social media are bad for us because they're bad for democracy.  There are multiple arguments that Facebook and other social media (Twitter's another frequent target) are bad for democracy. The Verge provides a good beginning list here[32]. The article notes that Facebook's own personnel\u2014including its awesomely titled \"global politics and government outreach director\" \u2014 are acknowledging the criticisms by publishing a series of blog postings[33]. The first one is from the leader of Facebook's \"civic engagement team,\" and the others are from outside observers, including Harvard law professor Cass Sunstein[34] (who's been a critic of \"filter bubbles\" since long before that term was invented\u2014his preferred term is \"information cocoons.\"). I briefly mentioned Sunstein's work in Part 1[35]. Here in Part 2 I'll note mainly that Sunstein's essay for Facebook begins by listing ways in which social-media platforms are actually good for democracy. In fact, he writes, \"they are not merely good; they are terrific.\" In spite of their goodness, Sunstein writes, they also exacerbate what he's discussed earlier (notably in a 1999 paper[36]) as \"group polarization.\" In short, he argues, the filter bubble makes like-minded people hold their shared opinions more extremely. The result? More extremism generally, unless deliberative forums are properly designed with appropriate \"safeguards.\" Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Facebook is hosting his essay, Sunstein credits Facebook with taking steps to provide those such safeguards, which in his view includes Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg's declaration[37] that the company is working to fight misinformation in its news feed. But I like Sunstein's implicit recognition that political polarization, while bad, may be no worse as a result of social media in particular, or even this century's modern media environment as a whole:\"By emphasizing the problems posed by knowing falsehoods, polarization, and information cocoons, I do not mean to suggest that things are worse now than they were in 1960, 1860, 1560, 1260, or the year before or after the birth of Jesus Christ. Information cocoons are as old as human history.\"(I made that argument, in similar form, in a debate with Farhad Manjoo[38]\u2014not then a Times columnist\u2014almost a decade ago.) Just as important, I think, is Sunstein's admission that that we don't really have unequivocal data showing that social media are a particular problem even in relation to other modern media:\"Nor do I mean to suggest that with respect to polarization, social media are worse than newspapers, television stations, social clubs, sports teams, or neighborhoods. Empirical work continues to try to compare various sources of polarization, and it would be reckless to suggest that social media do the most damage. Countless people try to find diverse topics, and multiple points of view, and they use their Facebook pages and Twitter feeds for exactly that purpose. But still, countless people don't.\"Complementing Sunstein's essay is a piece by Facebook's Samidh Chakrabarti, who underscores the company's new initiative to make News Feed contributions more transparent (so you can see who's funding a political ad or seemingly authentic \"news story). Chakrabarti also expresses the company's hope that its \"Trust Project for News On Facebook\"[39] will help users \"sharpen their social media literacy.\" And Facebook's just announced its plan to use user rankings to rate media sources' credibility[40]. I'm all for more media literacy, and I love crowd-sourcing, and I support efforts to encourage both. But I share CUNY journalism professor Jeff Jarvis's concern that other components of Facebook's comprehensive response to public criticism may unintentionally undercut support[41], financial and otherwise, for trustworthy media sources. Now, I'm aware that some critics are arguing that the data really are solidly showing that social media are undermining democracy. But I'm skeptical whether \"fake news\" on Facebook or elsewhere in social media changed the outcome of the 2016 election, not least because the Pew Research Center's study a year ago suggests that digital news sources weren't nearly as important[42] as traditional media sources. (Notably, Fox News was hugely influential among Trump voters; there was no counterpart news source for Clinton voters.) That said, there's no reason to dismiss concerns about social media, which may play an increasing role\u2014as Facebook surely has\u2014as an intermediary of the news. Facebook's Chakrabarti may want to promote \"social media literacy,\" and the company has been forced to acknowledge[43] that \"Russian entities\" tried to use Facebook as an \"information weapon.\" But Facebook doesn't want in the least to play the rule a social-media-literate citizenry should be playing for itself. Writes Chakrabart:\"In the public debate over false news, many believe Facebook should use its own judgment to filter out misinformation. We've chosen not to do that because we don't want to be the arbiters of truth, nor do we imagine this is a role the world would want for us.\"Of course some critics may disagree. As I've said above, the data are equivocal, but that hasn't made its interpreters equivocal. Take for example a couple of recent articles\u2014one academic and another aimed at popular audience\u2014that cast doubt on whether the radical democratization of internet access is a good thing\u2014or at least, whether it's as good a thing as we hoped for a couple of decades ago. One is UC Irvine professor Richard Hasen's law-review article[44] published last year (set for formal publication in the First Amendment Law Review this year), which he helpfully distilled to an LA Times op-ed here[45]. The other is Wired's February 2018 cover story: \"It's the (Democracy-Poisoning) Golden Age of Free Speech.\"[46] (The Wired article is also authored by an academic, UNC Chapel Hill sociology professor Zeynep Tufekci.) Both Hasen's and Tufekci's articles underscore that internet access has inverted an assumption that long informed free-speech law\u2014that the ability to reach mass audiences is necessarily going to be expensive and scarce. In the internet era, what we have instead is what UCLA professor Eugene Volokh memorably labelled, in a Yale Law Journal law-review article more than 20 years ago, as \"cheap speech.\"[47] Volokh correctly anticipated back then that internet-driven changes in the media landscape would lead some social critics to conclude that the First Amendment's broad protections for speech would need to be revised:\"As the new media arrive, they may likewise cause some popular sentiment for changes in the doctrine. Today, for instance, the First Amendment rules that give broad protection to extremist speakers-Klansmen, Communists, and the like-are relatively low-cost, because these groups are politically rather insignificant. Even without government regulation, they are in large measure silenced by lack of funds and by the disapproval of the media establishment. What will happen when the KKK becomes able to conveniently send its views to hundreds of thousands of supporters throughout the country, or create its own TV show that can be ordered from any infobahn-connected household?\"There, in a nutshell, is a prediction of the world we're living in now (except that we, fortunately, failed to adopt the term \"infobahn\"). Hasen believes \"non-governmental actors\"\u2014that is, Facebook and Twitter and Google and the like \u2014 may be \"best suited to counter the problems created by cheap speech.\" I think that's a bad idea, not least because corporate decision-making may be less accountable than public law and regulation and, as Manjoo puts it, they are \"misaligned incentives.\" Tufekci, I think, has the better approach. \"[I]n fairness to Facebook and Google and Twitter,\" she writes in Wired, \"while there's a lot they could do better, the public outcry demanding that they fix all these problems is mistaken.\" Because there are \"few solutions to the problems of digital discourse that don't involve huge trade-offs,\" Tufekci insists that deciding what those solutions may be is necessarily a \"deeply political decision\"\u2014involving difficult discussions what we ask the government to do... or not to do. She's got that right. She's also right that we haven't had those discussions yet. And as we begin them, we need to remember radically democratic empowerment (all that cheap speech) may be part of the problem, but it's also got to be part of the solution.

And while I could probably turn itemizing complaints about social-media companies into a perpetual gig somewhere - because there's always going to be new material - I think it's best to list only just a few more for now. After that, we ought to step back and weigh what reforms or other social responses we really need. The first six classes of complaints are detailed in Parts 1 and 2, so we begin here in Part 3 with Complaint Number 7.</p><p><br/>(7) Social media are bad for us because they're so addictive to us that they add up to a kind of deliberate mind control.<br/>As a source of that generalization we can do no better than to begin with Tristan Harris's\u00a0July 28, 2017 TED talk, titled \"How a handful of tech companies control billions of minds every day.\"<br/>Harris, a former Google employee, left Google in 2015 to start a nonprofit organization called\u00a0Time Well Spent. That effort has now been renamed the Center for Humane Technology ( <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.timewellspent.io\">http://www.timewellspent.io</url> now resolves to\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://humanetech.com\">https://humanetech.com</url>). Harris says his new effort - which also has the support of former Mozilla interface designer\u00a0Aza Raskin\u00a0and early Facebook funder\u00a0Roger McNamee\u00a0- represents a social movement aimed at making us more aware of the ways in which technology, including social media and other internet offerings, as well as our\u00a0personal devices, are continually designed and redesigned to make them more addictive.<br/>Yes, there's that notion of addictiveness again - we looked in\u00a0Part 2\u00a0at claims that smartphones are addictive and talked about how to address that problem. But regarding the \"mind control\" variation of this criticism, it's worth examining Harris's specific claims and arguments to see how they compare to other complaints about social media and big tech generally. In his June 2017 TED talk. Harris begins with the observation that social-media notifications on your smart devices, may lead you to have thoughts you otherwise wouldn't think:<br/>\"If you see a notification it schedules you to have thoughts that maybe you didn't intend to have. If you swipe over that notification, it schedules you into spending a little bit of time getting sucked into something that maybe you didn't intend to get sucked into.\"<br/>But, as I've suggested earlier in this series, this feature of continually tweaking content to attract your attention isn't unique to internet content or to our digital devices. This is something every communications company has always done - it's why ratings services for traditional broadcast radio and TV exist. Market research, together with attempts to deploy that research and to persuade or manipulate audiences, has been at the heart of the advertising industry for far longer than the internet has existed, as Vance Packard's\u00a01957 book THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS\u00a0suggested decades ago.<br/>One major theme of Packard's THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS is that advertisers increasingly relied less on consumer surveys (derisively labeled \"nose-counting\") but on \"motivational research\" - often abbreviated by 1950s practitioners as \"MR\" - to look past what consumers say they want. Instead, the goal is to\u00a0how they actually behave, and then gear their advertising content to shape or leverage consumers' unconscious desires. Packard's narratives in THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS are driven by revelations of the disturbing and even scandalous agendas of MR entrepreneurs and the advertising companies that hire them. Even so, Packard is careful in his book, in its penultimate chapter, to address what he calls \"the question of validity\" - that is, the question of whether \"hidden persuaders'\" strategies and tactics for manipulating consumers and voters are actually scientifically grounded. Quite properly, Packard acknowledges that the claims of the MR companies may have been oversold, or may have been adopted by companies who simply lack any other strategy for figuring out how to reach and engage consumers.<br/>In spite of Packard's scrupulous efforts to make sure that no claims of advertising's superpowers to sway our thinking are accepted uncritically, our culture nevertheless has accepted at least provisionally the idea that advertising (and its political cousin, propaganda), affects human beings at pre-rational levels. It is this acceptance of the idea that content somehow takes us over that Tristan Harris invokes consistently in his writings and presentations about how social media, the Facebook newsfeed, and internet advertising work on us.<br/>Harris prefers to describe how these online phenomena affect us in deterministic ways:<br/>\"Now, if this is making you feel a little bit of outrage, notice that that thought just comes over you. Outrage is a really good way also of getting your attention. Because we don't choose outrage - it happens to us.\"<br/>\"The race for attention [is] the race to the bottom of the brainstem.\"<br/>Nothing Harris says about the Facebook newsfeed would have seemed foreign to a Madison Avenue advertising executive in, say, 1957. (Vance Packard includes commercial advertising as well as political advertising as centerpieces of what he calls \"the large-scale efforts being made, often with impressive success, to channel our unthinking habits, our purchasing decisions, and our thought processes by the use of insights gleaned from psychiatry and the social sciences.\") Harris describes Facebook and other social media in ways that reflect time-honored criticisms of advertising generally, and mass media generally.<br/>But remember that what Harris says about internet advertising or Facebook notifications or the Facebook news feed is true of all communications. It is the very nature of communications among human beings that they give us thoughts we would not otherwise have. It is the very nature of hearing things or reading things or watching things that we can't unhear them, or unread them, or unwatch them. This is not something uniquely terrible about internet services. Instead it is something inherent in language and art and all communications. (You can find a good working definition of \"communications\" in Article 19 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that individuals have the right \"to seek, receive, or impart information.\") That some people study and attempt to perfect the effectiveness of internet offerings - advertising or Facebook content or anything else - is not proof that they're up to no good. (They arguably are exercising their human rights!) Similarly, the fact that writers and editors, including me, try to study how words can be more effective when it comes to sticking in your brain is not an assault on your agency.<br/>It should give us pause that so many complaints about Facebook, about social media generally, about internet information services, and about digital devices actively (if maybe also unconsciously) echo complaints that have been made about any new mass medium (or mass-media product). What's lacking in modern efforts to criticize social media in particular - and especially when it comes to big questions like whether social media are damaging to democracy - is the failure of most critics to be looking at their own hypotheses skeptically, seeking falsification (which philosopher Karl Popper\u00a0rightly notes is a better test of the robustness of a theory) rather than verification.<br/>As for all the addictive harms that are caused by combining Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and other internet services with smartphones, isn't it worth asking critics whether they've considered turning notifications off for the social-media apps?<br/>(8) Social media are bad for us because they get their money from advertising, and advertising - especially\u00a0effective\u00a0advertising - is inherently bad for us.<br/>Harris's co-conspirator Roger McNamee, whose authority to make pronouncements on what Facebook and other services are doing wrong derives primarily from his having gotten richer from them, is blunter in his\u00a0assessment of Facebook as a public-health menace:<br/>\"Relative to FB, the combination of an advertising model with 2.1 billion personalized Truman Shows on the ubiquitous smartphone is wildly more engaging than any previous platform ... and the ads have unprecedented effectiveness.\"<br/>There's a lot to make fun of here-the presumption that 2.1 billion Facebook users are just creating \"personalized Truman Shows,\" for example. Only someone who fancies himself part of an elite that's immune to what Harris calls \"persuasion\" would presume to draw that conclusion about the hoi polloi. But let me focus instead on the second part-the bit about the ads with \"unprecedented effectiveness.\" Here the idea is, obviously, that advertising may be better for us when it's less effective.<br/>Let's allow for a moment that maybe that claim is true! Even if that's so, advertising has played a central role in Western commerce for at least a couple of centuries, and in world commerce for at least a century, and the idea that we need to make advertising less effective is, I think fairly clearly, a criticism of capitalism generally. Now, capitalism may very well deserve that sort of criticism, but it seems like an odd critique coming from someone who's already profited immensely from that capitalism.<br/>And it also seems odd that it's focused particularly on social media when, as we have the helpful example of THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS to remind us, we've been theoretically aware of the manipulations of advertising for all of this century and at least half of the previous one. If you're going to go after commercialism and capitalism and advertising, you need to go big-you can't just say that advertising suddenly became a threat to us because it's more clearly targeted to us based on our actual interests. (Arguably that's a feature rather than a bug.)<br/>In responding to these criticisms, McNamee says \"I have no interest in telling people how to live or what products to use.\" (I think the meat of his and Harris's criticisms suggests otherwise.) He explains his concerns this way:<br/>\"My focus is on two things: protecting the innocent (e.g., children) from technology that harms their emotion development and protecting democracy from interference. I do not believe that tech companies should have the right to undermine public health and democracy in the pursuit of profits.\"<br/>As is so often the case with entrepreneurial moral panics, the issue ultimately devolves to \"protecting the innocent\" - some of whom surely are children but some other proportion of whom constitute the rest of us. In an earlier part of his exploration of these issues on the venerable online conferencing system The WELL, McNamee makes clear, in fact, that he really is talking about the rest of us (adults as well as children):<br/>\"Facebook has 2.1 billion Truman Shows ... each person lives in a bubble tuned to their emotions ... and FB pushes emotional buttons as needed. Once it identifies an issue that provokes your emotions, it works to get you into groups of like-minded people. Such filter bubbles intensify pre-existing beliefs, making them more rigid and extreme. In many cases, FB helps people get to a state where they are resistant to ideas that conflict with the pre-existing ones, even if the new ideas are demonstrably true.\"<br/>These generalizations wouldn't need much editing to fit 20th-century criticisms of TV or advertising or comic books or 19th-century criticisms of dime novels or 17th-century criticisms of the theater. What's left unanswered is the question of why\u00a0this\u00a0new mass medium is going to doom us when none of the other ones managed to do it.<br/>(9) Social media need to be reformed so they aren't trying to make us do anything or get anything out of us.<br/>It's possible we ultimately may reach some consensus on how social media and big internet platforms generally need to be reformed. But it's important to look closely at each reform proposal to make sure we understand what we're asking for and also that we're clear on what the reforms might take away from us. Once Harris's TED talk gets past the let-me-scare-you-about-Facebook phase, it gets better - Harris has a program for reform in mind. Specifically, he calls for what he calls \"three radical changes to our society,\" which I will paraphrase and summarize here.<br/>First, Harris says, \"we need to acknowledge that we are persuadable.\" Here, unfortunately, he elides the distinction between being persuaded (which involves evaluation and crediting of arguments or points of view) and being influenced or manipulated (which may happen at an unconscious level). (In fairness, Vance Packard's THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS is guilty of the same elision.) But this first proposition isn't radical at all - even if we're sticks-in-the-mud, we normally believe we are persuadable. It may be harder to believe that we are unconsciously swayed by how social media interact with us, but I don't think it's exactly a radical leap. We can take it as a given, I think, that internet advertising and Facebook's and Google's algorithms try to influence us in various ways, and that they sometimes succeed. The next question then becomes whether this influence is necessarily pernicious, but Harris finds passes quickly over this question, assuming the answer is yes.<br/>Second, Harris argues, we need new models and accountability systems, guaranteeing accountability and transparency for the ways in which our internet services and digital devices try to influence us. Here there's very little to argue with. Transparency about user-experience design that makes us more self-aware is all to the good. So that doesn't seem like a particularly radical goal either.<br/>It's in Harris's third proposal - \"We need a design renaissance\" - that you actually do find something radical. As Harris explains it, we need to redesign our interactions with services and devices so that we're never persuaded to do something that we may not initially want to do. He states, baldly, that \"the only form of ethical persuasion that exists is when the goals of the persuader are aligned with the goals of the persuadee.\" This is a fascinating proposition that, so far as I know, is not particularly well-grounded in fact or in the history of rhetoric or in the history of ethics. It seems clear that sometimes it's necessary to persuade people of ideas that they may be predisposed not to believe, and that, in fact, they may be more comfortable not believing.<br/>Given that fact, it follows that If we are worried about whether Facebook's algorithms lead to \"filter bubbles,\" we should call for (or design) a system around the idea of never persuading anyone whose goals aren't already aligned with yours. Arguably, such a social-media platform might be\u00a0more\u00a0prone to filter bubbles rather than less so. One doesn't get the sense, reviewing Harris's presentations or other public writings and statements from his allies like Roger McNamee, either that they've compared current internet communications with previous revolutions driven by new mass-communications platforms, or analyzed their theories in light of the centuries of philosophical inquiry regarding human autonomy, agency, and ethics.<br/>Moving past Harris's TED talk, we next must consider McNamee's recent suggestion that Facebook move from an advertising-supported to for-pay model. In a\u00a0February 21 Washington Post op-ed, McNamee wrote the following:<br/>\"The indictments brought by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III against\u00a013 individuals and three organizations\u00a0accused of interfering with the U.S. election offer perhaps the most powerful evidence yet that Facebook and its Instagram subsidiary are harming public health and democracy. The best option for the company - and for democracy - is for Facebook to change its business model from one based on advertising to a subscription service.\"<br/>In a nutshell, the idea here is that the incentives of advertisers, who want to compete for your attention, will necessarily skew how even the most well-meaning version of advertising-supported Facebook interacts with you, and not for the better. So the fix, he argues, is for Facebook to get rid of advertising altogether. \"Facebook's advertising business model is hugely profitable,\" he writes, \"but the incentives are perverse.\"<br/>It's hard to escape the conclusion that McNamee believes either (a) advertising is inherently bad, or (b) advertising made more effective by automated internet platforms is particularly bad. Or both. And maybe advertising is, in fact, bad for us. (That's certainly a theme of Vance Packard's THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS, as well as of more recent work such as Tim Wu's book 2016 book THE ATTENTION MERCHANTS.) But it's hard to escape the conclusion that McNamee, troubled by Brexit and by President Trump's election, wants to kick the economic legs out from under Facebook's (and, incidentally, Google's and Bing's and Yahoo's) economic success. Algorithm-driven serving of ads is bad for you! It creates perverse incentives! And so on.<br/>It's true, of course, that some advertising algorithms have created perverse incentives (so that Candidate Trump's provocative ads were seen as more \"engaging\" and therefore were sold cheaper - or, alternatively,\u00a0more expensively\u00a0- than Candidate Clinton's. I think the criticism of\u00a0that particular algorithmic\u00a0approach to pricing advertising\u00a0is valid. But there are other ways to design algorithmic ad service, and it seems to me that the companies that have been subject to the criticisms are being responsive to them, even in the absence of regulation. This, I think, is the proper way to interpret Mark Zuckerberg's newfound reflection (and maybe contrition) over Facebook's previous approach to its users' experience, and his resolve - honoring without mentioning Tristan Harris's longstanding critique - that\u00a0\"[o]ne of our big focus areas for 2018 is making sure the time we all spend on Facebook is time well spent.\"<br/>Some Alternative Suggestions for Reform and/or Investigation<br/>It's not too difficult, upon reflection, to wonder whether the problem of \"information cocoons\" or \"filter bubbles\" is really as terrible as some critics have maintained. If hyper-addictive filter-bubbles have historically unprecedented power to overcome our free will, surely presumably have this effect even on most assertive, independently thinking, strong-minded individuals - like Tristan Harris or Roger McNamee. Even six-sigma-degree individualists might not escape! But the evidence that this is, in fact, the case, is less than overwhelming. What seems more likely (especially in the United States and in the EU) is that people who are dismayed by the outcome of the\u00a0Brexit referendum\u00a0or\u00a0the U.S. election\u00a0are trying to find a Grand Unifying Theory to explain why things didn't work out they way they'd expected. And social media are new, and they seem to have been used by\u00a0mischievous actors\u00a0who want to skew political processes, so it follows that the problem is rooted in technology generally or in social media or in smartphones in particular.<br/>But nothing I write here should be taken as arguing that social media definitely aren't causing or magnifying harms. I can't claim to know for certain. And it may well be the case, in fact, that some large subset of human beings create \"filter bubbles\" for themselves regardless of what media technologies they're using. That's not a good thing, and it's certainly worth figuring out how to fix that problem if it's happening, but focusing on how that problem as a presumed phenomenon specific to social media perhaps focuses on a symptom of the human condition rather than a disease grounded in technology.<br/>In this context, then, the question is, what's the fix? There are some good suggestions for short-term fixes, such as the platforms' adopting transparency measures regarding political ads. That's an idea worth exploring. Earlier in this series I've written about other ideas as well (e.g.,\u00a0using grayscale on our iPhones).<br/>There are, of course, more general reforms that aren't specific to any particular platform. To start with, we certainly need to address more fundamental problems - meta-platform problems, if you will - of democratic politics, such as teaching critical thinking. We actually do know how to teach critical thinking - thanks to the ancient Greeks we've got a few thousand years of work done already on that project - but we've lacked the social will to teach it universally. It seems to me that this is the only way by which a cranky individualist minority that's not easily manipulated by social media, or by traditional media, can become the majority. Approaching all media (including radio, TV, newspapers, and other traditional media - not just internet media, or social media) with appropriate skepticism has to be part of any reform policy that will lead to lasting results.<br/>It's easy, however, to believe that education - even the rigorous kind of education that includes both traditional critical-thinking skills and awareness of the techniques that may be used in swaying our opinions - will not be enough. One may reasonably believe that education can never be enough, or that, even when education is sufficient to change behavior (consider the education campaigns that reduced smoking or led to increased use of seatbelts), education all by itself simply takes too long. So, in addition to education reforms, there probably are more specific reforms - or at least a consensus as to best practices - that Facebook, other platforms, advertisers, government, and citizens ought to consider. (It seems likely that, to the extent private companies don't strongly embrace public-spirited best-practices reforms, governments will be willing to impose such reforms in the absence of self-policing.)<br/>One of the major issues that deserve more study is the control and aggregation of user information by social-media platforms and search services. It's indisputable that online platforms have potentiated a major advance in market research - it's trivially easy nowadays for the platforms to aggregate data as to which ads are effective (e.g., by inspiring users to click through to the advertisers' websites). Surely we should be able to opt out, right?<br/>But there's an unsettled public-policy question about what opting out of Facebook means or could mean. In his testimony earlier this year at Senate and House hearings on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has consistently stressed that individual users do have some high degree of control over the data (pictures, words, videos, and so on) that they've contributed to Facebook, and that users can choose to remove the data they've contributed.\u00a0Recent updates in Facebook's privacy policy\u00a0seem to underscore users' rights in this regard.<br/>It seems clear that Facebook is committing itself at least to what I call Level 1 Privacy: you can erase your contributions from Facebook altogether and \"disappear,\" at least when it comes to information you have personally contributed to the platform. But does it also mean that even other people who've shared my stuff no longer can share it (in effect, allowing me to depart and punch holes in other people's sharing of my stuff when I depart?<br/>If Level 1 Privacy relates to the information (text, pictures, video, etc., that I've posted), that's not the end of the inquiry. There's also what I have called Level 2 Privacy, centering on what Facebook knows about me, or can infer from my having been on the service, even after I've gone. Facebook has had a proprietary interest in drawing inferences from how we interact with their service and using that to inform what content (including but not limited to ads) that Facebook serves to us. That's Facebook's data, not mine, because FB generated it, not me. If I leave Facebook, surely Facebook retains some data about me based on my interactions on the platform. (We also know, in the aftermath of Zuckerberg's testimony before Congress, that Facebook manages to collect data about people who themselves are not users of the service.)<br/>And then there's Level 3 Privacy, which is the question of what Facebook can and should do with this inferential data that it has generated. Should Facebook share it with third parties? What about sharing it with governments? If I depart and leave a resulting hole in Facebook content, are there still ways to connect the dots so that not just Facebook itself, but also third-party actors, including governments, can draw reliable inferences about the now-absent me? In the United States, there arguably may be Fourth Amendment issues involved,\u00a0as I've pointed out in a different context elsewhere. We may reasonably conclude that there should be limits on how such data can be used and on what inferences can be drawn. This is a public-policy discussion that needs to happen sooner rather than later.<br/>Apart from privacy and personal-data concerns, we ought to consider what we really think about targeted advertising. If the criticism of targeted advertising, \"motivational research,\" and the like historically has been that the ads are\u00a0pushing\u00a0us, then the criticism of internet advertising seems to be that internet-based ads are\u00a0pulling\u00a0us or even\u00a0seducing\u00a0us, based on what can be inferred about our inclinations and preferences. Here I think the immediate task has to be to assess whether the claims made by marketers and advertisers regarding the manipulative effects ads have on us are scientifically rigorous and testable. If the claims stand up to testing, then we have some hard public-policy questions we need to ask about whether and how advertising should be regulated. But if they aren't - if, in fact, our individual intuitions that we retain freedom and autonomy even in the face of internet advertising and all the data that can be gathered about us - then we need to assert that that freedom and autonomy and acknowledge that, just maybe, there's nothing categorically oppressive about being invited to engage in commercial transactions or urged to vote for a particular candidate.<br/>Both the privacy questions and the advertising questions are big, complex questions that don't easily devolve to traditional privacy talk. If in fact we need to tackle these questions pro-actively, I think we must begin by defining what the problems are in ways that all of us (or at least most of us) agree on. Singling out Facebook is the kind of single-root-cause theory of what's wrong with our culture today may appeal to us as human beings - we all like straightforward storylines - but that doesn't mean it's correct. Other internet services harvest our data too. And non-internet companies have done so (albeit in more primitive ways) for generations. It is difficult to say they never should do so, and it's difficult to frame the contours of what best practices should be.<br/>But if we're going to grapple with the question of regulating social-media platforms and other internet services, thinking seriously about what best practices should be, generally speaking, is the task that lies before us now. Offloading the public-policy questions to the platforms themselves - by calling on Facebook or Twitter or Google to censor antisocial content, for example - is the wrong approach, because it dodges the big questions that we need to answer. Plus, it would likely entrench today's well-moneyed internet incumbents.<br/>Nobody elected Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey (or Tim Cook or Sundar Pichai) to do that for us. The theory of democracy is that we decide the public-policy questions ourselves, or we elect policymakers to do that for us. But that means we each have to do the heavy lifting of figuring out what kinds of reforms we think we want, and what kind of commitments we're willing to make to get the policies right.<br/>The post Everything that's wrong with social media companies and big tech platforms, part 3 appeared first on R Street.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-27181</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRM1-F03R-W2X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 R Street Institute, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>R Street Institute</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 17, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And while I could probably turn itemizing complaints about social-media companies into a perpetual gig somewhere \u2014 because there's always going to be new material \u2014 I think it's best to list only just a few more for now. After that, we ought to step back and weigh what reforms or other social responses we really need. The first six classes of complaints are detailed in Parts 1 and 2, so we begin here in Part 3 with Complaint Number 7. (7) Social media are bad for us because they're so addictive to us that they add up to a kind of deliberate mind control.  As a source of that generalization we can do no better than to begin with Tristan Harris's July 28, 2017 TED talk[3], titled \"How a handful of tech companies control billions of minds every day.\" Harris, a former Google employee, left Google in 2015 to start a nonprofit organization called Time Well Spent[4]. That effort has now been renamed the Center for Humane Technology (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.timewellspent.io\">http://www.timewellspent.io</url> now resolves to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://humanetech.com\">https://humanetech.com</url>[5]). Harris says his new effort \u2014 which also has the support of former Mozilla interface designer Aza Raskin[6] and early Facebook funder Roger McNamee[7] \u2014 represents a social movement aimed at making us more aware of the ways in which technology, including social media and other internet offerings, as well as our personal devices[8], are continually designed and redesigned to make them more addictive. </p><p>Yes, there's that notion of addictiveness again \u2014 we looked in Part 2[9] at claims that smartphones are addictive and talked about how to address that problem. But regarding the \"mind control\" variation of this criticism, it's worth examining Harris's specific claims and arguments to see how they compare to other complaints about social media and big tech generally. In his June 2017 TED talk. Harris begins with the observation that social-media notifications on your smart devices, may lead you to have thoughts you otherwise wouldn't think:\"If you see a notification it schedules you to have thoughts that maybe you didn't intend to have. If you swipe over that notification, it schedules you into spending a little bit of time getting sucked into something that maybe you didn't intend to get sucked into.\"But, as I've suggested earlier in this series, this feature of continually tweaking content to attract your attention isn't unique to internet content or to our digital devices. This is something every communications company has always done \u2014 it's why ratings services for traditional broadcast radio and TV exist. Market research, together with attempts to deploy that research and to persuade or manipulate audiences, has been at the heart of the advertising industry for far longer than the internet has existed, as Vance Packard's 1957 book THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS[10] suggested decades ago. One major theme of Packard's THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS is that advertisers increasingly relied less on consumer surveys (derisively labeled \"nose-counting\") but on \"motivational research\" \u2014 often abbreviated by 1950s practitioners as \"MR\" \u2014 to look past what consumers say they want. Instead, the goal is to how they actually behave, and then gear their advertising content to shape or leverage consumers' unconscious desires. Packard's narratives in THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS are driven by revelations of the disturbing and even scandalous agendas of MR entrepreneurs and the advertising companies that hire them. Even so, Packard is careful in his book, in its penultimate chapter, to address what he calls \"the question of validity\" \u2014 that is, the question of whether \"hidden persuaders'\" strategies and tactics for manipulating consumers and voters are actually scientifically grounded. Quite properly, Packard acknowledges that the claims of the MR companies may have been oversold, or may have been adopted by companies who simply lack any other strategy for figuring out how to reach and engage consumers. In spite of Packard's scrupulous efforts to make sure that no claims of advertising's superpowers to sway our thinking are accepted uncritically, our culture nevertheless has accepted at least provisionally the idea that advertising (and its political cousin, propaganda), affects human beings at pre-rational levels. It is this acceptance of the idea that content somehow takes us over that Tristan Harris invokes consistently in his writings and presentations about how social media, the Facebook newsfeed, and internet advertising work on us. Harris prefers to describe how these online phenomena affect us in deterministic ways:\"Now, if this is making you feel a little bit of outrage, notice that that thought just comes over you. Outrage is a really good way also of getting your attention. Because we don't choose outrage \u2014 it happens to us.\"  \"The race for attention [is] the race to the bottom of the brainstem.\"Nothing Harris says about the Facebook newsfeed would have seemed foreign to a Madison Avenue advertising executive in, say, 1957. (Vance Packard includes commercial advertising as well as political advertising as centerpieces of what he calls \"the large-scale efforts being made, often with impressive success, to channel our unthinking habits, our purchasing decisions, and our thought processes by the use of insights gleaned from psychiatry and the social sciences.\") Harris describes Facebook and other social media in ways that reflect time-honored criticisms of advertising generally, and mass media generally. But remember that what Harris says about internet advertising or Facebook notifications or the Facebook news feed is true of all communications. It is the very nature of communications among human beings that they give us thoughts we would not otherwise have. It is the very nature of hearing things or reading things or watching things that we can't unhear them, or unread them, or unwatch them. This is not something uniquely terrible about internet services. Instead it is something inherent in language and art and all communications. (You can find a good working definition of \"communications\" in Article 19 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that individuals have the right \"to seek, receive, or impart information.\") That some people study and attempt to perfect the effectiveness of internet offerings \u2014 advertising or Facebook content or anything else \u2014 is not proof that they're up to no good. (They arguably are exercising their human rights!) Similarly, the fact that writers and editors, including me, try to study how words can be more effective when it comes to sticking in your brain is not an assault on your agency. It should give us pause that so many complaints about Facebook, about social media generally, about internet information services, and about digital devices actively (if maybe also unconsciously) echo complaints that have been made about any new mass medium (or mass-media product). What's lacking in modern efforts to criticize social media in particular \u2014 and especially when it comes to big questions like whether social media are damaging to democracy \u2014 is the failure of most critics to be looking at their own hypotheses skeptically, seeking falsification (which philosopher Karl Popper rightly notes is a better test of the robustness of a theory[11]) rather than verification. As for all the addictive harms that are caused by combining Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and other internet services with smartphones, isn't it worth asking critics whether they've considered turning notifications off for the social-media apps? (8) Social media are bad for us because they get their money from advertising, and advertising \u2014 especially effective advertising \u2014 is inherently bad for us.  Harris's co-conspirator Roger McNamee, whose authority to make pronouncements on what Facebook and other services are doing wrong derives primarily from his having gotten richer from them, is blunter in his assessment of Facebook as a public-health menace[12]:\"Relative to FB, the combination of an advertising model with 2.1 billion personalized Truman Shows on the ubiquitous smartphone is wildly more engaging than any previous platform ... and the ads have unprecedented effectiveness.\"There's a lot to make fun of here--the presumption that 2.1 billion Facebook users are just creating \"personalized Truman Shows,\" for example. Only someone who fancies himself part of an elite that's immune to what Harris calls \"persuasion\" would presume to draw that conclusion about the hoi polloi. But let me focus instead on the second part--the bit about the ads with \"unprecedented effectiveness.\" Here the idea is, obviously, that advertising may be better for us when it's less effective. Let's allow for a moment that maybe that claim is true! Even if that's so, advertising has played a central role in Western commerce for at least a couple of centuries, and in world commerce for at least a century, and the idea that we need to make advertising less effective is, I think fairly clearly, a criticism of capitalism generally. Now, capitalism may very well deserve that sort of criticism, but it seems like an odd critique coming from someone who's already profited immensely from that capitalism. And it also seems odd that it's focused particularly on social media when, as we have the helpful example of THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS to remind us, we've been theoretically aware of the manipulations of advertising for all of this century and at least half of the previous one. If you're going to go after commercialism and capitalism and advertising, you need to go big--you can't just say that advertising suddenly became a threat to us because it's more clearly targeted to us based on our actual interests. (Arguably that's a feature rather than a bug.) In responding to these criticisms, McNamee says \"I have no interest in telling people how to live or what products to use.\" (I think the meat of his and Harris's criticisms suggests otherwise.) He explains his concerns this way:\"My focus is on two things: protecting the innocent (e.g., children) from technology that harms their emotion development and protecting democracy from interference. I do not believe that tech companies should have the right to undermine public health and democracy in the pursuit of profits.\"As is so often the case with entrepreneurial moral panics, the issue ultimately devolves to \"protecting the innocent\" \u2014 some of whom surely are children but some other proportion of whom constitute the rest of us. In an earlier part of his exploration of these issues on the venerable online conferencing system The WELL, McNamee makes clear, in fact, that he really is talking about the rest of us (adults as well as children):\"Facebook has 2.1 billion Truman Shows ... each person lives in a bubble tuned to their emotions ... and FB pushes emotional buttons as needed. Once it identifies an issue that provokes your emotions, it works to get you into groups of like-minded people. Such filter bubbles intensify pre-existing beliefs, making them more rigid and extreme. In many cases, FB helps people get to a state where they are resistant to ideas that conflict with the pre-existing ones, even if the new ideas are demonstrably true.\"These generalizations wouldn't need much editing to fit 20th-century criticisms of TV or advertising or comic books or 19th-century criticisms of dime novels or 17th-century criticisms of the theater. What's left unanswered is the question of why this new mass medium is going to doom us when none of the other ones managed to do it. (9) Social media need to be reformed so they aren't trying to make us do anything or get anything out of us.  It's possible we ultimately may reach some consensus on how social media and big internet platforms generally need to be reformed. But it's important to look closely at each reform proposal to make sure we understand what we're asking for and also that we're clear on what the reforms might take away from us. Once Harris's TED talk gets past the let-me-scare-you-about-Facebook phase, it gets better \u2014 Harris has a program for reform in mind. Specifically, he calls for what he calls \"three radical changes to our society,\" which I will paraphrase and summarize here. First, Harris says, \"we need to acknowledge that we are persuadable.\" Here, unfortunately, he elides the distinction between being persuaded (which involves evaluation and crediting of arguments or points of view) and being influenced or manipulated (which may happen at an unconscious level). (In fairness, Vance Packard's THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS is guilty of the same elision.) But this first proposition isn't radical at all \u2014 even if we're sticks-in-the-mud, we normally believe we are persuadable. It may be harder to believe that we are unconsciously swayed by how social media interact with us, but I don't think it's exactly a radical leap. We can take it as a given, I think, that internet advertising and Facebook's and Google's algorithms try to influence us in various ways, and that they sometimes succeed. The next question then becomes whether this influence is necessarily pernicious, but Harris finds passes quickly over this question, assuming the answer is yes. Second, Harris argues, we need new models and accountability systems, guaranteeing accountability and transparency for the ways in which our internet services and digital devices try to influence us. Here there's very little to argue with. Transparency about user-experience design that makes us more self-aware is all to the good. So that doesn't seem like a particularly radical goal either. It's in Harris's third proposal \u2014 \"We need a design renaissance\" \u2014 that you actually do find something radical. As Harris explains it, we need to redesign our interactions with services and devices so that we're never persuaded to do something that we may not initially want to do. He states, baldly, that \"the only form of ethical persuasion that exists is when the goals of the persuader are aligned with the goals of the persuadee.\" This is a fascinating proposition that, so far as I know, is not particularly well-grounded in fact or in the history of rhetoric or in the history of ethics. It seems clear that sometimes it's necessary to persuade people of ideas that they may be predisposed not to believe, and that, in fact, they may be more comfortable not believing. Given that fact, it follows that If we are worried about whether Facebook's algorithms lead to \"filter bubbles,\" we should call for (or design) a system around the idea of never persuading anyone whose goals aren't already aligned with yours. Arguably, such a social-media platform might be more prone to filter bubbles rather than less so. One doesn't get the sense, reviewing Harris's presentations or other public writings and statements from his allies like Roger McNamee, either that they've compared current internet communications with previous revolutions driven by new mass-communications platforms, or analyzed their theories in light of the centuries of philosophical inquiry regarding human autonomy, agency, and ethics. Moving past Harris's TED talk, we next must consider McNamee's recent suggestion that Facebook move from an advertising-supported to for-pay model. In a February 21 Washington Post op-ed[13], McNamee wrote the following:\"The indictments brought by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III against 13 individuals and three organizations[14] accused of interfering with the U.S. election offer perhaps the most powerful evidence yet that Facebook and its Instagram subsidiary are harming public health and democracy. The best option for the company \u2014 and for democracy \u2014 is for Facebook to change its business model from one based on advertising to a subscription service.\"In a nutshell, the idea here is that the incentives of advertisers, who want to compete for your attention, will necessarily skew how even the most well-meaning version of advertising-supported Facebook interacts with you, and not for the better. So the fix, he argues, is for Facebook to get rid of advertising altogether. \"Facebook's advertising business model is hugely profitable,\" he writes, \"but the incentives are perverse.\" It's hard to escape the conclusion that McNamee believes either (a) advertising is inherently bad, or (b) advertising made more effective by automated internet platforms is particularly bad. Or both. And maybe advertising is, in fact, bad for us. (That's certainly a theme of Vance Packard's THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS, as well as of more recent work such as Tim Wu's book 2016 book THE ATTENTION MERCHANTS.) But it's hard to escape the conclusion that McNamee, troubled by Brexit and by President Trump's election, wants to kick the economic legs out from under Facebook's (and, incidentally, Google's and Bing's and Yahoo's) economic success. Algorithm-driven serving of ads is bad for you! It creates perverse incentives! And so on. It's true, of course, that some advertising algorithms have created perverse incentives (so that Candidate Trump's provocative ads were seen as more \"engaging\" and therefore were sold cheaper \u2014 or, alternatively, more expensively[15] \u2014 than Candidate Clinton's. I think the criticism of that particular algorithmic approach to pricing advertising is valid. But there are other ways to design algorithmic ad service, and it seems to me that the companies that have been subject to the criticisms are being responsive to them, even in the absence of regulation. This, I think, is the proper way to interpret Mark Zuckerberg's newfound reflection (and maybe contrition) over Facebook's previous approach to its users' experience, and his resolve \u2014 honoring without mentioning Tristan Harris's longstanding critique \u2014 that \"[o]ne of our big focus areas for 2018 is making sure the time we all spend on Facebook is time well spent.\"[16] Some Alternative Suggestions for Reform and/or Investigation It's not too difficult, upon reflection, to wonder whether the problem of \"information cocoons\" or \"filter bubbles\" is really as terrible as some critics have maintained. If hyper-addictive filter-bubbles have historically unprecedented power to overcome our free will, surely presumably have this effect even on most assertive, independently thinking, strong-minded individuals \u2014 like Tristan Harris or Roger McNamee. Even six-sigma-degree individualists might not escape! But the evidence that this is, in fact, the case, is less than overwhelming. What seems more likely (especially in the United States and in the EU) is that people who are dismayed by the outcome of the Brexit referendum[17] or the U.S. election[18] are trying to find a Grand Unifying Theory to explain why things didn't work out they way they'd expected. And social media are new, and they seem to have been used by mischievous actors[19] who want to skew political processes, so it follows that the problem is rooted in technology generally or in social media or in smartphones in particular. But nothing I write here should be taken as arguing that social media definitely aren't causing or magnifying harms. I can't claim to know for certain. And it may well be the case, in fact, that some large subset of human beings create \"filter bubbles\" for themselves regardless of what media technologies they're using. That's not a good thing, and it's certainly worth figuring out how to fix that problem if it's happening, but focusing on how that problem as a presumed phenomenon specific to social media perhaps focuses on a symptom of the human condition rather than a disease grounded in technology. In this context, then, the question is, what's the fix? There are some good suggestions for short-term fixes, such as the platforms' adopting transparency measures regarding political ads. That's an idea worth exploring. Earlier in this series I've written about other ideas as well (e.g., using grayscale on our iPhones[20]). There are, of course, more general reforms that aren't specific to any particular platform. To start with, we certainly need to address more fundamental problems \u2014 meta-platform problems, if you will \u2014 of democratic politics, such as teaching critical thinking. We actually do know how to teach critical thinking \u2014 thanks to the ancient Greeks we've got a few thousand years of work done already on that project \u2014 but we've lacked the social will to teach it universally. It seems to me that this is the only way by which a cranky individualist minority that's not easily manipulated by social media, or by traditional media, can become the majority. Approaching all media (including radio, TV, newspapers, and other traditional media \u2014 not just internet media, or social media) with appropriate skepticism has to be part of any reform policy that will lead to lasting results. It's easy, however, to believe that education \u2014 even the rigorous kind of education that includes both traditional critical-thinking skills and awareness of the techniques that may be used in swaying our opinions \u2014 will not be enough. One may reasonably believe that education can never be enough, or that, even when education is sufficient to change behavior (consider the education campaigns that reduced smoking or led to increased use of seatbelts), education all by itself simply takes too long. So, in addition to education reforms, there probably are more specific reforms \u2014 or at least a consensus as to best practices \u2014 that Facebook, other platforms, advertisers, government, and citizens ought to consider. (It seems likely that, to the extent private companies don't strongly embrace public-spirited best-practices reforms, governments will be willing to impose such reforms in the absence of self-policing.) One of the major issues that deserve more study is the control and aggregation of user information by social-media platforms and search services. It's indisputable that online platforms have potentiated a major advance in market research \u2014 it's trivially easy nowadays for the platforms to aggregate data as to which ads are effective (e.g., by inspiring users to click through to the advertisers' websites). Surely we should be able to opt out, right? But there's an unsettled public-policy question about what opting out of Facebook means or could mean. In his testimony earlier this year at Senate and House hearings on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has consistently stressed that individual users do have some high degree of control over the data (pictures, words, videos, and so on) that they've contributed to Facebook, and that users can choose to remove the data they've contributed. Recent updates in Facebook's privacy policy[21] seem to underscore users' rights in this regard. It seems clear that Facebook is committing itself at least to what I call Level 1 Privacy: you can erase your contributions from Facebook altogether and \"disappear,\" at least when it comes to information you have personally contributed to the platform. But does it also mean that even other people who've shared my stuff no longer can share it (in effect, allowing me to depart and punch holes in other people's sharing of my stuff when I depart? If Level 1 Privacy relates to the information (text, pictures, video, etc., that I've posted), that's not the end of the inquiry. There's also what I have called Level 2 Privacy, centering on what Facebook knows about me, or can infer from my having been on the service, even after I've gone. Facebook has had a proprietary interest in drawing inferences from how we interact with their service and using that to inform what content (including but not limited to ads) that Facebook serves to us. That's Facebook's data, not mine, because FB generated it, not me. If I leave Facebook, surely Facebook retains some data about me based on my interactions on the platform. (We also know, in the aftermath of Zuckerberg's testimony before Congress, that Facebook manages to collect data about people who themselves are not users of the service.) And then there's Level 3 Privacy, which is the question of what Facebook can and should do with this inferential data that it has generated. Should Facebook share it with third parties? What about sharing it with governments? If I depart and leave a resulting hole in Facebook content, are there still ways to connect the dots so that not just Facebook itself, but also third-party actors, including governments, can draw reliable inferences about the now-absent me? In the United States, there arguably may be Fourth Amendment issues involved, as I've pointed out in a different context elsewhere[22]. We may reasonably conclude that there should be limits on how such data can be used and on what inferences can be drawn. This is a public-policy discussion that needs to happen sooner rather than later. Apart from privacy and personal-data concerns, we ought to consider what we really think about targeted advertising. If the criticism of targeted advertising, \"motivational research,\" and the like historically has been that the ads are pushing us, then the criticism of internet advertising seems to be that internet-based ads are pulling us or even seducing us, based on what can be inferred about our inclinations and preferences. Here I think the immediate task has to be to assess whether the claims made by marketers and advertisers regarding the manipulative effects ads have on us are scientifically rigorous and testable. If the claims stand up to testing, then we have some hard public-policy questions we need to ask about whether and how advertising should be regulated. But if they aren't \u2014 if, in fact, our individual intuitions that we retain freedom and autonomy even in the face of internet advertising and all the data that can be gathered about us \u2014 then we need to assert that that freedom and autonomy and acknowledge that, just maybe, there's nothing categorically oppressive about being invited to engage in commercial transactions or urged to vote for a particular candidate. Both the privacy questions and the advertising questions are big, complex questions that don't easily devolve to traditional privacy talk. If in fact we need to tackle these questions pro-actively, I think we must begin by defining what the problems are in ways that all of us (or at least most of us) agree on. Singling out Facebook is the kind of single-root-cause theory of what's wrong with our culture today may appeal to us as human beings \u2014 we all like straightforward storylines \u2014 but that doesn't mean it's correct. Other internet services harvest our data too. And non-internet companies have done so (albeit in more primitive ways) for generations. It is difficult to say they never should do so, and it's difficult to frame the contours of what best practices should be. But if we're going to grapple with the question of regulating social-media platforms and other internet services, thinking seriously about what best practices should be, generally speaking, is the task that lies before us now. Offloading the public-policy questions to the platforms themselves \u2014 by calling on Facebook or Twitter or Google to censor antisocial content, for example \u2014 is the wrong approach, because it dodges the big questions that we need to answer. Plus, it would likely entrench today's well-moneyed internet incumbents. Nobody elected Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey (or Tim Cook or Sundar Pichai) to do that for us. The theory of democracy is that we decide the public-policy questions ourselves, or we elect policymakers to do that for us. But that means we each have to do the heavy lifting of figuring out what kinds of reforms we think we want, and what kind of commitments we're willing to make to get the policies right.Mike Godwin

The big social platforms, who were once loath to intervene in matters of political speech, are getting much more comfortable with the idea. Today let's look at what happened and why - and, for the sake of variety, let's try to rank them in order of their long-term importance.</p><p><br/>5. YouTube bans a group of far-right creators. The most remarkable thing about YouTube getting rid of Stefan Molyneux, David Duke, and Richard Spencer, among others, is that it took so long. An exhausted \"finally!\" is often exclaimed in cases like this - but here even Facebook, which faces near-constant accusations of bending over backwards to appease the far right, had removed some of these accounts years ago. Spencer was removed in 2018; Duke was removed last year. (Molyneux, a white nationalist and proponent of racist science, still has his Facebook page, for reasons I can't fathom; even MailChimp has gotten rid of him.)<br/>As Julia Alexander explained at The Verge, the bans were made possible by an update to its policies in June 2019 disallowing hate speech. Why did it take a full year to enforce this policy? Basically, it takes three strikes to get kicked off YouTube, and somehow, none of these creators had earned three strikes before the 2019 policy change. YouTube may have removed some of their videos after the change, but it doesn't retroactively issue strikes, on fairness grounds. And so it took a year for the white supremacists to strike out.<br/>Banning them now can't make up for the fact that YouTube spent years recruiting large audiences for these men and others using algorithmic recommendations, giving them power that they will carry with them to whatever platforms will still have them. On the other hand, the number of places where they can easily find new followers on the internet appears to be shrinking, and for that at least I'm grateful.<br/>4. Facebook bans a violent Boogaloo network. It was just a few days ago that I wrote this column about how the Boogaloo movement - a loose-knit collection of anti-government types, some of whom are agitating for a second civil war - had hijacked social networks to spread. Law enforcement officials say the group's adherents used Facebook to plan the murder of a federal agent. When I wrote my piece, the company told me changes were coming, and today they arrived.<br/>The gist is that a subset of the Boogaloo group has now been designated as a \"dangerous organization\" by Facebook, which triggers a variety of enforcement mechanisms. On Tuesday the company removed 220 Facebook accounts, 95 Instagram accounts, 28 Facebook pages, and 106 Facebook groups, plus more than 400 other groups and 100 other pages that were not connected to the main group but posted similar extremist content.<br/>It seems obvious that Facebook would ban any violent anti-government group that was using its services to plan murder. What makes this one a shade more interesting to watch is how diffuse the Boogaloo movement itself is. It continuously changes the names with which it refers to itself, the insignias and clothing that members wear in public, and even the ideologies it espouses. (There is some confusion as to whether adherents who have voiced support for Black Lives Matter protesters are sincere.) Even for a company with the resources of Facebook, keeping track of the Boogaloo movement promises to be a significant challenge - and given the group's alleged propensity for real-world violence, the stakes of getting it wrong are quite high.<br/>3. Reddit bans The_Donald. The practical effect of Reddit removing what was perhaps its most notorious forum is likely to be limited. Its membership, which once numbered more than 800,000, had largely decamped to another website after Reddit placed The_Donald behind a warning screen last year. But symbolically, the move represents a significant shift in philosophy for Reddit, which once counted itself a free-speech bastion in the mold of early Twitter. CEO Steve Huffman put it to me this way:<br/>\"Reddit's mission is to bring community and belonging to everybody in the world, and there is speech in the world and on Reddit that prevents other people from doing so,\" Huffman told reporters. \"Harassing speech or hateful speech prevents people from coming to Reddit and feeling safe and sharing their vulnerabilities ... So if we have speech on Reddit that's preventing people from using Reddit the way that we intend it to be used, or that prevents us from achieving our mission, then it's actually a very easy decision.\"<br/>Huffman also gave a thoughtful interview to Kevin Roose at the New York Times. Here's what he said when asked about something else I mention in my story - his statement that he had shifted his thinking around the balance between free speech and safety.<br/>\"Over the years, we've been increasingly confronted with difficult decisions, and we have to weigh these trade-offs. And so here we are, believing that free speech and free expression are really important, and that's one of the things that makes Reddit special, but at the same time, seeing that allowing everything is working against our mission.<br/>The way out, for us, has been through our mission: What are we trying to accomplish on Reddit? And what's the best path to get there?\"<br/>This strikes me as notable at a time when Facebook's mission has been recast as \"giving everyone a voice.\" Reddit says its mission is to \"bring community and belonging to everybody in the world.\" And turns out that more people feel a sense of community and belonging when you give slightly fewer people a voice.<br/>2. Twitch temporarily bans President Trump. Let's count the ways in which this is a big deal. One, even if temporary, here's an Amazon-owned streaming service de-platforming the president of the United States. Two, the company explicitly cited \"hateful conduct\" as the reason - a charge that, however accurate, other platforms have tried not to say out loud. Third, the stream that led to this de-platforming was a video from 2015 that had aired on many mainstream television stations. It was Trump's 2015 campaign kickoff rally, where he said - among other things - that \"Mexico was sending rapists to the United States,\" as Jake Kastrenakes put it at The Verge.<br/>This puts Twitch in the position of having taken a stronger position against the president's hate speech than, for example, CNN. Assuming it continues to hold Trump to this higher-than-usual standard, and Trump's divisive rhetoric escalates further over the summer, Twitch could be the first major social platform to permanently de-platform the president. And that will have implications that go far beyond Twitch.<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>India bans TikTok. Yes, it has happened before, but it feels different this time. It's one thing to regulate an app over concerns related to porn, or competition, or privacy, or some other domestic issue. It's quite another to use an app as a pawn in a geopolitical turf war - one that might accelerate the splintering of the internet into walled-off regions. India and China are in a conflict over a disputed border in the Himalayas that recently resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers. India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology responded by banning TikTok - along with WeChat and 57 other apps the country views as \"engaged in activities ... prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India.\"</p></bodyText></listItem></list>Maybe TikTok will come back to India within a week or so, as it did the first time. But it seems likely we'll see more bans like this over time, in more countries around the world. As Ben Thompson points out in a sharp piece at Stratechery, countries can use the centralization offered by the App Store - as well as old-fashioned internet service providers - to wage diplomacy in novel ways. It's one thing to ban an app for content hosted within the app - YouTube has been blocked in various countries over the years for just that reason - and quite another to ban it as part of a game of brinkmanship between nation-states. If I were another big consumer app, I would be paying very, very close attention to this.<br/>PushbackYesterday I wrote about the Facebook ad boycott, and heard back from some people who thought I had been a little too rough on the advertisers - or a little too easy on the social network. One thing I heard is that the boycott is based on advertisers' sincere belief that Facebook is going too easy on Trump - particularly over that \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\" from a few weeks back. I look at that question from the standpoint of Facebook already removing three Trump posts this year alone, which chafes against the idea that the company is too scared to act.<br/>In any case, my colleague Russell Brandom talked to Jade Magnus Ogunnaike, Color of Change's deputy senior campaign director, about what the campaign really wants. Color of Change is part of the coalition of civil rights group leading the advertiser boycott, and it's worth reading her take on the movement and this week's big bans:<br/>Jade Magnus Ogunnaike: There are no quick fixes for companies like Reddit that have been steeped in racist culture from the very beginning. We can't just cheer on the quick things. Companies need to actually undergo civil rights audits. They need to look at how racism and discrimination are showing up at every level in the company.<br/>There's no one thing you can do to fix racism in your company or to affirm that Black lives matter. What actually has to happen is that companies have to commit to a living wage for all of their employees, and then they need to invest in civil rights audits and take it step by step to implement those changes.<br/>The RatioToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.<br/>Trending up: Netflix is shifting $100 million to Black-owned banks. It's the largest company yet to pledge cash to historically underfunded financial institutions. (Lucas Shaw / Bloomberg)<br/>Trending up: Facebook is updating its News Feed algorithm to prioritize original reporting. It will also demote stories that aren't transparent about who has written them. (Sara Fischer / Axios)<br/>HotspotsOn Monday, California reached its highest single-day count of COVID-19 cases, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. More than 8,000 people were infected. Today, the state passed another marker: more than 6,000 people have died due to coronavirus-related causes.<br/>It's tempting to see the spike in cases as a result of an increase in testing. But officials say that's not it. \"Health officials have attributed the rising numbers to a combination of events: the further reopening of many businesses, mass protests over the death of George Floyd and clusters of private gatherings,\" reports the Los Angeles Times.<br/>That's despite the fact that Gov. Gavin Newsom has been cautious about reopening the state. He issued a stay-at-home for all residents on March 19th, and allowed counties to reopen only when they met certain criteria for testing and rates of infection.<br/>Then there's San Quentin. In mid-March, officials at the California state prison said there was \"no indication\" the facility had a coronavirus outbreak. As a precaution, however, the prison stopped all routine visitations and overnight family visits - a major blow to those living behind bars.<br/>Then in June, 121 inmates were transferred from a prison in Chino to San Quentin. Chino's California Institution for Men had been \"an early hotbed of coronavirus cases.\" Now, 1,059 people living at San Quentin have been infected, and a man on death row has died. \"While it is impossible to ensure the safety of people living in prisons operating well above the capacity they were designed to house, the administration at San Quentin neglected to enact even the most basic health and safety measures,\" wrote No More Tears, an organization founded by men incarcerated at San Quentin.<br/>I'm working on an article about the situation at San Quentin. If you have any information to share, please email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:zoe@theverge.com\">zoe@theverge.com</email> - Zoe Schiffer<br/>Governing\u2b50 India's unprecedented decision to ban 59 of China's largest apps could threaten the country's rise as a global tech power. It also serves as a warning to China's tech giants that have thrived behind a government-imposed Great Firewall that kept out many of America's best-known tech companies. Bloomberg has the story:<br/>The surprise moratorium hit Chinese internet companies just as they were beginning to make headway in the world's fastest-growing mobile arena, en route to going global and challenging American tech industry supremacy. TikTok had signed up 200 million users there, Xiaomi Corp. is the No. 1 smartphone brand, and Alibaba and Tencent have aggressively pushed their services.<br/>But India's policy jeopardizes all those successes, and could have wider geopolitical consequences as the U.S. seeks to rally countries to stop using Huawei Technologies Co. for 5G networks. With China's tech companies poised to become some of the most dominant in emerging industries like artificial intelligence, India's actions may spur countries around the world to weigh the extent to which they let China gain user data - and potentially economic leverage in future disputes.<br/>A growing number of internet service providers in India started to block their subscribers from accessing TikTok a day after the government banned the app. TikTok, along with 58 other Chinese apps, was banned due to security and privacy concerns. (Manish Singh / TechCrunch)<br/>Months before it's set to start reviewing content moderation decisions, Facebook's Oversight Board faces criticism from a nonprofit that says it should already be up and running.

(Kim Lyons / The Verge)<br/>People in Hong Kong are self-censoring in anticipation of Beijing's new national security laws, which outlaw activities related to \"separatism, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference\" in Hong Kong. Some are deleting their social media profiles entirely. (Kenji Kawase and Michelle Chan / Nikkei Asian Review)<br/>Liu Keqing, a Chinese opera singer, bears a striking resemblance to Xi Jinping, China's top leader. In China's increasingly authoritarian system, this resemblance has gotten the attention of Chinese authorities, who've started censoring his social media profiles. (Javier C. Hern\u00e1ndez / The New York Times)<br/>Industry\u2b50 Organizers behind the viral stunt succeeded in funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars from Silicon Valley to racial justice charities. But the campaign also drew criticism from those who felt it was making light of a serious issue. Here's Arielle Pardes at Wired:<br/>For many on the sidelines, the spectacle seemed like internet tomfoolery at its finest. The stunt had taken Silicon Valley's free-flowing capital and reinvested it in charity. The joke came at the expense of VCs and the tech elite, who had fallen for the trap of chasing the new, shiny thing, and worked for the benefit of organizations that have long struggled for funding. The \"eye mouth eye gang\" were Twitter's woke Robin Hood.<br/>Others recoiled at the joke. The longer it went on, the more it began to raise questions about the memeification of social movements. Technology moves fast-it also breaks things. For some, the emoji activism of rang hollow, especially at a time when record numbers of protesters have taken to the streets daily to support the Black Lives Matter movement and when serious conversations about diversity in tech are finally starting to happen. \"The creation of the culture of lighthearted frivolity around a serious issue turned it into a game, which has no long-term effects,\" tweeted venture capitalist Del Johnson. \"'We are building the next Clubhouse ... nevermind it's just about black lives, fooled you.' Completely disrespectful to the issue at hand.\"<br/>Discord rolled out changes to make the platform safer and more inclusive for people outside the gaming industry. It added a safety center with community guidelines meant to govern how people can act on the platform. It also raised a fresh $100 million. (Discord)<br/>Two of beauty YouTube's biggest stars, Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star, are facing cancellation over allegations of racism and the sexualization of minors. YouTube suspended monetization on Dawson's channels in the wake of the allegations. (Taylor Lorenz / The New York Times)<br/>TikTok is moving its privacy operations for European users to Ireland and the UK. The company's Irish and UK entities will take over from TikTok Inc. in the United States. (Ciara O'Brien / The Irish Times)<br/>TikTok's security measures can be \"easily circumvented\" to create fake accounts, according to security research firm Ghost Data. The firm's tests found TikTok will likely become an easier target for bots, which could make it more vulnerable to political disinformation campaigns. (Alex Heath / The Information)<br/>Google bought North, a company focused on building augmented reality glasses. The companies said North's \"technical expertise\" will help Google invest in its \"hardware efforts and ambient computing future.\" (Ashley Carman / The Verge)<br/>Google removed 25 Android applications from the Google Play Store for stealing Facebook credentials. Before being taken down the apps have collectively been downloaded more than 2.34 million times.

Among other improvements, customers will be able to download all the information Apple keeps about them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is GDPR?</p><p>The GDPR rules are designed to bring existing data protection laws into the 21st century. They give individuals the right to see what information companies hold about them, oblige business to handle data more responsibly, and put a new set of fines and regulations in place. Almost any entity that handles personal data will be impacted by the GDPR rules.</p><p>These changes may be taking place in Europe, but there is expectation most big tech firms will apply similar protections outside Europe, which will give more effective protection to most people - which is a good thing.</p><p>[ Further reading: Private by design: Why Apple's iOS meets the needs of healthcare IT ]Why it matters</p><p>Europe's tough stance on personal privacy had already prompted many in the tech industry to get their act together. The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal means many more of us now understand why such protection matters, particularly at a point in human history at which so much of what happens next will be defined by artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics. This information is powerful.</p><p>\"We've never believed that these detailed profiles of people, that have incredibly deep personal information that is patched together from several sources, should exist,\" Apple CEO TimCook recently said. They can be \"abused against our democracy,\" he observed.</p><p>What Apple has done so far</p><p>Apple recently introduced updated privacy protections across all its products, which now offer a new Data &amp; Privacy screen during setup. This explains how Apple and apps use your data and promises that the company's solutions are designed to minimize the collection and use of your data. It also describes how on-device processing is used whenever possible.</p><p>Apple explains:</p><p>\"When we use data to create better experiences for you, we work hard to do it in a way that doesn't compromise your privacy. One example is our pioneering use of Differential Privacy, where we scramble your data and combine it with the data of millions of others. So we see general patterns, rather than specifics that could be traced back to you. These patterns help us identify things like the most popular emoji, the best QuickType suggestions, and energy consumption rates in Safari.\"</p><p>Effectively this means Apple's products are private by design, which should open up interesting opportunities for the company in future.</p><p>GDPR means Apple will tell you what it knows</p><p>These aren't the only privacy enhancements we can look forward from Apple as it prepares for GDPR rules to become mandatory in May.</p><p>The company has said it plans to update its Apple ID management page with a way to let users download a copy of all the data they have stored with the company.</p><p>The company will allow users to download data across individual apps, which means data concerning your music playback choices or which news stories you've been reading will be as easy to download as information about the contents of your Contacts or Calendar apps. \u00a0</p><p>That's the equivalent of the data Facebook allows its users to download about themselves, though Apple's pre-existing commitment to privacy means we don't expect too many unpleasant surprises - however, I will be paying particular attention to Location data logs when I check my records.</p><p>GDPR also means Apple will give you more control</p><p>Apple also intends to make it much easier for its customers to control their data. That means we'll be able to:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Get a copy of our data</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Correct our data</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Temporarily deactivate our accounts</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Delete our entire Apple ID</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>That's a significant improvement. You have been able to do some of these things by contacting the company, but this takes time. These new tools will empower customers to vet and manage their own information.</p><p>Apple provides new GDPR developer tools</p><p>Apple closed out March by providing developers with an extensive set of tools to help them handle data requests made by EU users under new GDPR rules. These will enable developers to let users \"manage data that's associated with your app and stored in iCloud by using native APIs and Web APIs,\" the company said.\u00a0These will also include tools to enable a developer's own users to delete their data from a developer's app. More here.</p><p>What are the rollout plans?</p><p>Apple has already begun introducing these improvements. The most recent software updates introduced new Privacy rules and systems and a new Privacy icon that appears when an app requests your personal data. The company says the additional enhancements discussed here are scheduled for introduction in Europe when GDPR rules come into effect on May 25. The iPhone maker says it will make these features available to customers outside Europe at a later point.</p><p>Privacy is a human right</p><p>Cook has gone on record to call privacy a \"human right.\" He's highly critical of companies whose business plan is to monetize customers, saying:</p><p>\"The truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer. ... We've elected not to do that. We're not going to traffic in your personal life. Privacy to us is a human right, a civil liberty.\"</p><p>Apple as a company has an extensive privacy governance structure, which is described here.</p><p>Its employees are required to take privacy training, and the company has a Privacy Board made up of a cross-functional group of senior representatives from across the company that handles privacy-related issues.</p><p>More information</p><p>Apple details its privacy policies, tools, and reports in the Privacy section of its website.</p><p>Google+?\u00a0If you use social media and happen to be a Google+ user, why not\u00a0join\u00a0AppleHolic's Kool Aid Corner community\u00a0and get involved with the conversation as we pursue the spirit of the New Model Apple?</p><p>Got a story?

Billed as China's version of Nasdaq[2], it's overseen by the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE). Previously called the Science and Technology Innovation Board, the STAR Market mainly targets homegrown technology firms, and is modeled after a US-like IPO system. The move marks the first step towards major capital reforms in the country, and aims to boost domestic investment. It also comes amid a prolonged trade war between the US and China that has put companies like Huawei in the crosshairs[3]. Here's everything you need to know.What happened?</p><p>Last November, China's President Xi Jinping unveiled plans to launch STAR Market and test a registration-based IPO system. This has been followed by steady preparations, including framing supervisory rules, formation of listing committees, application reviews and approvals. The rules \u2014 which went into effect on March 1[4] \u2014 go into detail about the requirements for listing on the STAR Market. They were jointly set by the SSE and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CRSC). According to the regulations, red-chip companies \u2014 China-based firms incorporated and listed outside the mainland \u2014 are allowed to list on the new board.The technology board was formally launched last month on June 13.The debutUntil now, the SSE has received 141 listing applications, of which 31 companies won approval to list and 25 of them have obtained registration approval[5] from the SRC. About four million qualified retail investors with no less than 500,000 yuan ($72,672) in investment capital have registered to trade shares on the new market, reported South China Morning Post. The approved companies range from chipmakers to health care firms such as Raytron Technology and China Railway Signal ...mmunication. Also included in the list is chipmaker Montage and battery materials supplier Ronbay, both are which are making their stock market debuts. The opening day, needless to say, has been volatile[6]. All 25 debutants finished trading with gains of at least 84 percent. Semiconductor maker Anji Microelectronics got off to a flying start, opening 287 percent higher than the initial public offering (IPO) price[7]. Trading of the company's shares were halted twice to cool down frenzied buying.How is STAR Market different?The Shenzhen Stock Exchange launched its own board[8], dubbed ChiNext, in 2009 for small, faster-growing companies. This was followed by a second board called New Third Board in 2013[9]. Neither have managed to gain significant traction from investors. The STAR Market is different in that it has more lenient standards for profitability and price volatility[10] than the main exchanges. It permits companies to list before they have turned a profit. Investors, similarly, will be allowed to short-sell individual stocks[11] for the first time in mainland China.Why it's important?The STAR Market is seen as a move to keep Chinese tech firms from listing in stock markets abroad. The country has been home to high-profile companies like Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi, and JD.com. But due to stringent profitability requirements at home, they have chosen to list in New York City or Hong Kong.By providing a low barrier for entry, the development seeks to incentivize Chinese technology companies to IPO on home stock markets. The new market board is also expected to draw listing from big tech unicorns in the country, including TikTok-parent ByteDance \u2014 the world's most valuable startup[12] \u2014 and ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing.What's the future?According to state news agency Xinhua, the SSE will release a new component index on the 11th trading day[13] after the number of listed stocks and depository receipts reaches 30 on the sci-tech innovation board. The board, in its present form, is more aimed at local investors, with no scope for foreign participation. It's not immediately clear if these rules will be relaxed in the future. But according to Chicago-based law firm Baker McKenzie's Cross-Border IPO Index for 2019, the US continues to be a draw for mega tech IPOs[14]. 'In spite of the continued Sino-US trade war, there was considerable demand from Chinese issuers to list on US exchanges, with 16 Chinese companies raising over $2 billion on Nasdaq and the NYSE,' it said. Whether the new Star initiative lures investors and takesbusiness from New York and Hong Kong remains to be seen.  Read next: CHEAP: Bose's bizarre SoundWear Companion wearable speaker is HALF PRICE!

Sites including the Chicago Tribune, the New York Daily News, and the Los Angeles Times were inaccessible for millions of European users after missing the May 25 deadline to be GDPR compliant.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.liveleak.com/e/uupal_1527261000\">https://www.liveleak.com/e/uupal_1527261000</url>[4] At the time of writing, LiveLeak reports [5]that users in the European Union were met with the following message when trying to access their websites:'Unfortunately, our website is currently unavailable in most European countries. We are engaged on the issue and committed to looking at options that support our full range of digital offerings to the EU market. We continue to identify technical compliance solutions that will provide all readers with our award-winning journalism.'As boring as it might be, it's still a very important piece of legislation and it's one you should know about. With that in mind, here's everything you need to know about GDPR. As ValueWalk explains[6] Let's start with the obvious and explain just what the GDPR are. It's a piece of legislation that the European Commission passed in April 2016. Companies were given two years to comply with the legislation, which goes into effect on May 25, 2018. GDPR was designed to replace the previous law known as the Data Protection Directive and it aims to create a single set of rules for European Union member states. It aims to give consumers more control over the personal data companies collect about them. Not only does the legislation affect organizations based within the EU itself, but it also applies to companies outside of the EU if they provide services to - or monitor the activities of - EU citizens. As you can see, it's going to have a major impact felt around the world.How Did All This Come About?The GDPR is one of the latest EU parliamentary measures designed to protect personal data as much as possible. The EU Charter itself states that protection of personal data is a fundamental right associated with protection of one's natural person. While American laws tend to be in favor of businesses more so than consumers, the EU takes a consumer-first approach. The Data Protection Directive and the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OCED[7]) started the process and now the GDPR continues it. Make no bones about it; the EU cares a lot about protecting consumer privacy and they always have. It has now paved the way for this approach to be taken globally thanks to the GDPR, it's policies, and the punishments for those that break them.What are the Key Policies?A key focus of the legislation is strengthening the conditions of consent. This means that companies are no longer able to get your data out of you by using vague and confusing statements. They will also no longer be able to make users consent to several things at once. Users should be able to consent to individual things individually, rather than being presented with a list of things and then being asked to consent to everything at once. On top of this, a parent or guardian must consent to data collection on children aged under 16. Another GDPR rule says that companies must notify their data protection authority about any breaches within 72 hours of them becoming aware it happened. Those in charge of processing data must notify customers as soon as possible once the breach has been discovered. Consumers will also be given more control over their user data. They will have the right to access the personal information that companies store on them and find out what the data is being used for and where it is being kept. It also gives users the right to be forgotten. That means that you have the right to ask people to delete the information they have on you and prevent third parties from getting access to it. It also allows for people to transfer their information between service providers easily.How Will it Affect Individuals?While consumers are given more control over their information and are given the right to be forgotten, there are some gray areas about how all this applies in reality. In theory, the law would allow for people to demand that social networks such as Facebook completely delete their profile permanently. How feasible this is remains to be seen. There are also other problems, such as the freedom of expression. Laws built around the freedom of expression prevent this right to be forgotten from extending to news articles.Will There Be Punishments for Breaking GDPR?There will be some potentially major fines associated with breaking the rules of the GDPR. Organizations that breach the rules will be subject to fines of up to 4% of their annual global turnover or 20 million euros (around $25 million), whichever figure is higher. Given that sometech[8]companies such as Facebook and Google make billions of dollars each year, this could be a potentially massive fine.How Does GDPR Affect Firms?Organizations have had two years now to prepare for GDPR, so hopefully the impact won't be as big. Big tech firms such as the aforementioned Facebook and Google have already opened up about what they plan to do. These are organizations that handle huge amounts of data and so preparation has been key. Facebook in particular released a new set of privacy tools to help their organization comply with GDPR and other companies have released their own plans and tools.Is There Anything Else Businesses Should be Aware Of?The Information Commissioner's Office of the UK recently released their own set of guidelines in order to help businesses prepare for the move. One thing that they recommended was that companies should review their privacy policy notices. It's also recommended that businesses make the changes now so that they comply with the law. Many businesses are already doing this, as discussed above. Don't be too worried about the changes though. The Information Commissioner's Office insists that these new measures will retain many of the same principles and concepts as the current Data Protection Act. Not many things are going to change, but it still helps to know what is changing. Even so, most companies that already abide by the old legislation are likely already complying with the new one.

Let's start with the obvious and explain just what the GDPR are. It's a piece of legislation that the European Commission passed in April 2016. Companies were given two years to comply with the legislation, which goes into effect on May 25, 2018. GDPR was designed to replace the previous law known as the Data Protection Directive and it aims to create a single set of rules for European Union member states. It aims to give consumers more control over the personal data companies collect about them. Not only does the legislation affect organizations based within the EU itself, but it also applies to companies outside of the EU if they provide services to - or monitor the activities of - EU citizens. As you can see, it's going to have a major impact felt around the world. How Did All This Come About? The GDPR is one of the latest EU parliamentary measures designed to protect personal data as much as possible. The EU Charter itself states that protection of personal data is a fundamental right associated with protection of one's natural person. While American laws tend to be in favor of businesses more so than consumers, the EU takes a consumer-first approach. The Data Protection Directive and the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OCED[4]) started the process and now the GDPR continues it. Make no bones about it; the EU cares a lot about protecting consumer privacy and they always have. It has now paved the way for this approach to be taken globally thanks to the GDPR, it's policies, and the punishments for those that break them. What are the Key Policies? A key focus of the legislation is strengthening the conditions of consent. This means that companies are no longer able to get your data out of you by using vague and confusing statements. They will also no longer be able to make users consent to several things at once. Users should be able to consent to individual things individually, rather than being presented with a list of things and then being asked to consent to everything at once. On top of this, a parent or guardian must consent to data collection on children aged under 16. Another GDPR rule says that companies must notify their data protection authority about any breaches within 72 hours of them becoming aware it happened. Those in charge of processing data must notify customers as soon as possible once the breach has been discovered. Consumers will also be given more control over their user data. They will have the right to access the personal information that companies store on them and find out what the data is being used for and where it is being kept. It also gives users the right to be forgotten. That means that you have the right to ask people to delete the information they have on you and prevent third parties from getting access to it. It also allows for people to transfer their information between service providers easily. How Will it Affect Individuals? While consumers are given more control over their information and are given the right to be forgotten, there are some gray areas about how all this applies in reality. In theory, the law would allow for people to demand that social networks such as Facebook completely delete their profile permanently. How feasible this is remains to be seen. There are also other problems, such as the freedom of expression. Laws built around the freedom of expression prevent this right to be forgotten from extending to news articles. Will There Be Punishments for Breaking GDPR? There will be some potentially major fines associated with breaking the rules of the GDPR. Organizations that breach the rules will be subject to fines of up to 4% of their annual global turnover or 20 million euros (around $25 million), whichever figure is higher. Given that some tech[5] companies such as Facebook and Google make billions of dollars each year, this could be a potentially massive fine. How Does GDPR Affect Firms? Organizations have had two years now to prepare for GDPR, so hopefully the impact won't be as big. Big tech firms such as the aforementioned Facebook and Google have already opened up about what they plan to do. These are organizations that handle huge amounts of data and so preparation has been key. Facebook in particular released a new set of privacy tools to help their organization comply with GDPR and other companies have released their own plans and tools. Is There Anything Else Businesses Should be Aware Of? The Information Commissioner's Office of the UK recently released their own set of guidelines in order to help businesses prepare for the move. One thing that they recommended was that companies should review their privacy policy notices. It's also recommended that businesses make the changes now so that they comply with the law. Many businesses are already doing this, as discussed above. Don't be too worried about the changes though. The Information Commissioner's Office insists that these new measures will retain many of the same principles and concepts as the current Data Protection Act. Not many things are going to change, but it still helps to know what is changing. Even so, most companies that already abide by the old legislation are likely already complying with the new one. Of course, it never helps to hire a data protection officer to ensure complete compliance and have the right people ready when they are needed.

This guide will be updated as events warrant.<br/>What is Section 230?Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which was passed in 1996, says an \"interactive computer service\" can't be treated as the publisher or speaker of third-party content. This protects websites from lawsuits if a user posts something illegal, although there are exceptions for copyright violations, sex work-related material, and violations of federal criminal law.</p><p><br/>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA) crafted Section 230 so website owners could moderate sites without worrying about legal liability. The law is particularly vital for social media networks, but it covers many sites and services, including news outlets with comment sections - like The Verge. The Electronic Frontier Foundation calls it \"the most important law protecting internet speech.\"<br/>It's increasingly controversial and frequently misinterpreted, however. Critics argue that its broad protections let powerful companies ignore real harm to users. On the other hand, some lawmakers incorrectly claim that it only protects \"neutral platforms\" - a term that's irrelevant to the law.<br/>Similar legislation exists in the European Union and Australia.<br/>\u00a0<br/>What's the relationship between Section 230 and the First Amendment?In the United States, the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting most forms of speech, which would include many proposals to force tech companies to moderate content. A law that required companies to moderate content based on the political viewpoint it expresses, for example, would likely be struck down as unconstitutional.<br/>But private companies can create rules to restrict speech if they so choose. This is why Facebook and Twitter ban hate speech, for example, even though it is permitted under the First Amendment.<br/>This issue is distinct from discussions over whether platforms should be liable for what their users post, though it often gets lumped in with the 230 discussion.<br/>How is Donald Trump trying to change Section 230?In August 2019, President Donald Trump reportedly drafted an executive order that would require the Federal Communications Commission to develop rules that could limit Section 230 protections. Met with confusion from regulators and legal experts, the White House seemed to lose interest in the order, and it was tabled until May 2020 when a feud with Twitter brought the order back into active consideration.<br/>In basic terms, the order provides a pathway for regulators to strip platforms of the protections granted by Section 230. Specifically, users would be directed to file complaints of bias with the Federal Trade Commission, and the FCC would follow up on those complaints to see if they justify removing a platform's \"good faith\" provision under the law. More broadly, the order takes significant liberties in how it interprets the text of the law and orders agencies to follow that interpretation, rather than the interpretations offered by the courts or by Congress.<br/>It's unclear how all of that will hold up in court, but it has sparked significant new interest in modifying the law from Republicans in Congress.<br/>How has Section 230 been modified over the years?In April 2018, Trump signed into law the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), a bill that purports to fight sex trafficking by reducing legal protections for online platforms. (It's also sometimes referred to as the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA, after an earlier version of the bill.)<br/>FOSTA carves out a new exception to Section 230, stating that Section 230 doesn't apply to civil and criminal charges of sex trafficking or to conduct that \"promotes or facilitates prostitution.\" The rule applies retroactively to sites that violate it.<br/>What effect has FOSTA-SESTA had?Following the passage of the bills, websites began to censor parts of their platforms - not because they were currently hosting prostitution ads, but because of the faint possibility that some third party could do so in the future. The laws are why Craigslist no longer has a Personals section. Now, sex workers say that they have broadly been forced offline, making their work far less safe. Prostitution-related crime in San Francisco alone - including violence against workers - more than tripled.<br/>Democrats have called for a study of the harms created for sex workers by the law. There is little to no evidence that the law has had much of an effect on reducing online sex trafficking.<br/>An evening newsletter about Facebook, social networks, and democracy. Subscribe here!<br/>What other changes are US legislators proposing?In February 2020, the US Department of Justice held a day-long workshop to discuss ways in which Section 230 could be further amended. They're examining cases in which platforms have enabled the distribution of nonconsensual pornography, harassment, and child sexual abuse imagery.<br/>Proposals to reform the law generally fall into two categories. One is a \"carveout\" approach that removes protections from certain categories of content - like FOSTA-SESTA did for sex work-related material. The other is a \"bargaining chip\" system that ties liability protection to meeting certain standards - like the proposed Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies Act (EARN IT), which, as its name suggests, would make sites demonstrate that they are fighting child sex abuse. (This would likely have the intended side effect of weakening encryption for private messaging.) This approach is often bundled with broader data privacy and tech regulation proposals, which are covered in more detail in a separate guide.<br/>To date, legislators have paid less attention to online marketplaces like Airbnb, which also benefits from the liability shield created by Section 230.<br/>What changes are prominent Democrats proposing?Democrats have largely been concerned with getting platforms to remove more content because of the harms associated with hate speech, terrorism, and harassment.<br/>In January 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden proposed revoking Section 230 completely. \"The idea that it's a tech company is that Section 230 should be revoked, immediately should be revoked, number one. For Zuckerberg and other platforms,\" Biden said. \"It should be revoked because it is not merely an internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false.\" Biden never responded to follow-up questions about this statement.<br/>Vox asked several leading Democratic candidates to weigh in on Section 230 in December 2019. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said, \"Tech giants and online platforms should not be shielded from responsibility when they knowingly allow content on their platforms that promotes and facilitates violence.\"<br/>In August 2019, former presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke proposed amending Section 230 to make it easier to sue big tech platforms if they failed to remove hate speech and terrorist content.<br/>What changes are congressional Republicans proposing?Republicans have largely been concerned with getting platforms to remove less content over fears that tech companies will prevent them from reaching their audiences.<br/>Republicans, including Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), have popularized changes to the law, typically over claims that platforms are censoring conservative viewpoints. Members of Congress have pointed to specific examples in which posts were removed or accounts were temporarily suspended, but there is no evidence that those actions were taken out of an ideological bias. (In fact, Fox News' Facebook page has been No. 1 in monthly engagement for the entire platform.)<br/>There is no evidence of systematic censorship of any political ideology on a tech platform, but Gosar's Stop the Censorship Act sought to prevent platforms from removing content that they found \"objectionable.\" That would mean they could only remove posts that violated the law.<br/>Meanwhile, Hawley's Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act would have required platforms' content moderation teams to certified as politically \"neutral\" by a bipartisan panel in order to retain their liability protections.<br/>Neither proposal has so far advanced. Republicans are also behind the EARN IT Act described above.<br/>What do tech companies think the government should do?\u00a0Among tech platforms, Facebook has led the call for more regulation. In February 2020, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company ought to be regulated as something in between a telecommunications company and a newspaper. That same day, Facebook released a white paper laying out the approach it would prefer regulators take.<br/>The approach rests on a handful of core assumptions: that platforms are global and thus subject to many different laws and competing cultural values; that they are intermediaries for speech rather than traditional publishers; that they will change constantly for competitive reasons; and that they will always get some moderation decisions wrong. (There's another assumption buried in that last one: that they will never hire enough people to screen content in advance or in real time.)<br/>Facebook argues that the government could hold tech platforms accountable for certain key metrics: holding violating posts below a certain number of views, for example, or setting a mandatory median response time for removing them. But they note that any of these efforts could create perverse incentives. If platforms are required to remove certain posts within 24 hours, for example, they are likely to simply stop looking at older posts while they focus on posts that are still within the 24-hour window.<br/>What happens next?Section 230 reform may continue to play a role in the 2020 campaign. Sen. Bernie Sanders has said he would reexamine Section 230 if he is elected president, and Trump has previously signaled at least some desire to modify the law.<br/>Section 230 will probably be modified again. The big questions are when - and how.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1071921</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6042-MMR1-JBYT-H25D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1684\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 12, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I started my career as a Revenue Strategist for United Airlines and thought I'd be working big corporate my whole life. But several years in I got bored and quit, riding my motorcycle west and eventually settling in Colorado. There I took a job with a small family-owned manufacturer where I fell in love with small business. The speed, volatility, and humble personalities captured my heart, and I've been working with entrepreneurs[4] since then.

Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues Q2 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[5] What does your company offer? CFOshare[6]is an outsourced finance and accounting department for small businesses. That means every specialist that would exist in a corporate finance and accounting department is available to compliment a small business' existing staff, usually a bookkeeper and CPA. Our most popular services areforecasting[7], budgeting, profitability analysis,growth strategy[8], capital planning andpro forma strategy[9], and general financial strategy. Some companies also like to have our accountantssupervise their bookkeepers[10]as an extra layer of checks-and-balances. My favorite projects are merger and acquisition related - either representing the seller ordiligence[11]for the buyer. How do you make money? Most of our engagements are flat-rate monthly fees. Projects, like M...ork, are billed hourly. Do you work with small business or bigger ones? Our sweet spot is $1-$50M in revenue, but our customers range from pre-revenue startups to $500M corporations[12]. How has the 2017 tax reform impacted your space - has it been a boon for business? The biggest shift from tax reform is a reduction in the impact of double-taxation on corporations. As a result I've seen more businesses starting as corporations rather than LLC's. But generally speaking, there are other factors that steer people one way or another, so no there has not been a massive impact. Can you explain what a CFO does is it just a bean counter? We really focus on strategy and analytics, not just bookkeeping and taxes. That's a big difference from most financial services out there for small businesses. Don't get me wrong - proper accounting[13] is a critical input to analytics, so we value our CPA partners. But most entrepreneurs are asking themselves, 'How much will it cost me to grow? How can I increase profits? When can I afford to hire?' Those answers aren't in your P... they're in a forecast, a budget, or a growth model. That's what we help with. How is what you do different than advisory firms? Our strategy recommendations are rooted in data and financial analysis that have been vetted as best practices by Fortune 500 corporations. Most advisory firms use more myopic analysis - either sales or ops focused - which may ignore competing considerations or scarce resources. Financial strategy balances scarce business resources like cash and employees across all the business opportunities to help an owner achieve focus and clarity around priorities. We hear that funding ishugeissue forsmallbusiness, on the other hand,we personally reserve tons of offers - curious what your thoughts are onsmallbusinessloan environment Every business needs capital, but most entrepreneurs struggle to get it. A lot of the time that is because owners don't understand how their business fits into the financial markets[14] - are they venture capital? SBA loan? Angel? Bootstrap? Investors can sense the uncertainty in a pitch or spot inconsistency in a capital plan. As a result, the entrepreneur gets declined and doesn't understand why. One of our first steps with a startup business is building a capital plan so they know who to pitch and how, speeding up the process and facilitating a higher success rate. Another type of 'win' for us is making an entrepreneur aware that their business plan is not viable. Although disappointing, it saves them months or years of their life, not to mention thousands of dollars. That also seems to be the trend with high profile fundraises among unicorns and IPOs - thoughts? This is part of the celebrity culture of America. We love to hear about the Cenedella's that made a smashing success. What you don't read about is record numbers of loan refinancing or sales to private equity that turned a middle-class person into a multi-millionaire. Those are happening every day too. On the other hand, 70% of small businesses fail - is the issue too much debt or is it a revenue issue? The last event when a business 'fails' is when it runs out of cash, so people usually think the issue was related to revenue or capital. And often it is. But your cash is a product of the overall business structure including the team, goals, accountability, strategy, and business processes like routine financial planning[15]. So more often than not, a business fails because it did not have the team or procedures in place to grow and adapt with its market. How can a mom and pop store compete against companies like Amazon - is it still possible? Or are the big tech firms too big? Most of the growth in the US economy is driven by small businesses, not big corporations. The big tech companies got big by purchasing small businesses that grew quickly and threatened them. So the key is to turn your disadvantage - small size - into a competitive advantage: agility. What trends are seeing in the private market business environment? There's still plenty of consolidation occurring at every level. Right now a lot of baby boomers are thinking about selling their business. This is a great opportunity for gen-x and millennials tobuy great businesses[16]at a discount. What about debt are we getting to a point where private firms are taking on too much debt? I'm not seeing an over-leveraging of small closely held businesses, but the true test will be the downturn (whenever that comes.) What do you think of recent proposals to cap interest rates? I believe interest rates - even predatory rates - have use in the economy[17]. I've worked plenty of turnarounds where predatory loans saved the business. What ends up happening in regulated lending environments is the mafia and black market step in to fill the void. Somestates already have usury laws which do not seem to impact most lenders as they locate outside that state - any thoughts on how national legislation would differ? Every time I try to predict what the federal government will do I end up being wrong, so I don't spend much time speculating on it. There has been talks of changes to FICO and the big credit bureaus after the Equifax hack - do you think the current system should be changed? How important is credit for businesses? FICO matters a lot for small businesses where the owner is often a guarantor. Even larger than that is D...atings for small businesses. These affect the amount of working capital a business must maintain. So far there hasn't been a good alternative to FICO[18] or D...and I don't see significant disruption in the near-term. But I'd love to see a new comer shake things up. The post Everything You Need To Know About The State Of Small Businesses[19] appeared first on ValueWalk[20].
