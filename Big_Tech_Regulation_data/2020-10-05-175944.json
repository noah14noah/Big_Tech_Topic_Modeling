Facebook's freshly minted billionaire boss, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>28, claims he is dedicated to \"openness, connecting and sharing\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before his death last year Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, said: \"Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter. Saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters.\"</p><p>The shine is coming off Silicon Valley's finest, however.</p><p>This week the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), Britain's data watchdog, announced it was reopening its investigation into Google's Street View cars, which travel around taking photographs to create the search engine's popular mapping service.</p><p>It has emerged that Googleprogrammed the vehicles to gather private data, including email, web searches and photographs, from unsecured home wi-fi networks. It also stands accused of trying to cover up what it had been doing.</p><p>European Union regulators are examining claims that Googleis abusing its dominance in the search business by ranking its own products higher up in results than those of its rivals. A similar case in the 1990s tarnished the reputation and hit the profits of Microsoft, then the world's most fearsome tech behemoth. The ICO's move comes as Apple faces criticism over its plans, revealed last week by The Sunday Times, for an answer to Street View: an even more intrusive 3-D service using militarygrade aerial camera satellites capable of revealing objects as small as 4in across.</p><p>Facebook is having a torrid time too. Shares in the world's most successful social network have fallen sharply since it floated on the Nasdaq in New York last month. To add to its woes, figures released last week showed its hitherto phenomenal growth is beginning to slow: in April, its site had 158m unique users, up only 5% on a year earlier, according to the research firm comScore - the lowest rise since it began tracking the data in 2008.</p><p>The new figures have fuelled the anger of many disgruntled small investors who are suing Facebook over claims that it had told bankers and a select group of investors that its growth was slowing before its float - but neglected to share the information with them.</p><p>The recent setbacks mean the bosses of the big tech firms will spend a lot less time talking to their flipflopwearing staff this summer and a lot more time talking to buttoned-up lawyers. Googlefaces fines if the ICO finds its Street View cars breached data protection laws. The company could also face a police investigation.</p><p>HOW did we fall out of love with these pillars of the new economy whose services and products have so quickly become central to our lives? The simple answer is that consumers and legislators alike have finally woken up to an uncomfortable truth: despite their laid-back image, these tech giants are just as corporate, money grabbing and venal as the old-school entrepreneurs they so disdain. As Rob Cox, a leading American technology writer, puts it: \"Under the hoodies and the moral language lurk rapacious business people, robber barons, with the same profit motive that drives all businesses and a ruthlessness rivalling history's greatest industrial bullies.\"</p><p>The charge sheet against the big tech firms is long: as well as pinching the private data of unsuspecting homeowners, carrying out creepy aerial surveillance and ripping off investors, they also stand accused of violating privacy.</p><p>Each makes money by vacuuming up the digital footprint we leave online and using it to sell us advertisements or market products. Hardly a day passes without some new revelation of one of them taking a byte too far.</p><p>Googlerecently altered its computer code to circumvent the privacy settings in Apple's Safari web browser, used by hundreds of millions of people. Facebook has come under fire for allowing companies to turn users' \"likes\" into advertisements that are then sent to their own online friends.</p><p>Googleis accused of \"looking the other way\" on copyright. Newspapers and magazines say the search engine \"steals\" their content and uses it to sell lucrative advertisements. Like Google, Apple is under investigation for monopolistic practices. The US justice department is examining claims that the firm, along with several publishers, colluded to raise the price of electronic books.</p><p>Apple has also been condemned for using Chinese manufacturers with lousy working practices. Foxconn, the Chinese factory where Apple's iPhones are made, has been investigated for treating its workers so badly that many have committed suicide.</p><p>Worst of all, say critics, is the aggressive tax avoidance practised by the big three. Google, Facebook and Apple have each set up elaborate webs of overseas companies to funnel revenues away from high-tax economies, such as Britain and Germany, through tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. The complex arrangements allow them - legally - to slash their tax bills.</p><p>Google, for example paid just (EURO)2.3m in Irish corporation tax on a turnover of more than (EURO)10 billion in 2010. Facebook, a firm now worth more than $60 billion ((EURO)47 billion), paid only (EURO)250,000 in corporation tax in Ireland in the same year, despite having revenues of (EURO)250m.</p><p>At every step of the way the companies have resisted attempts to clip their wings and even allegedly frustrated investigations into their less savoury practices. In April, the US Federal Communications Commission said Googlehad \"deliberately impeded and delayed\" its inquiry into the Street View data collection.</p><p>The tech giants have fought bitterly against any restrictions on internet use, opposing government attempts to introduce filters to prevent children accessing pornographic or violent images and moves to limit cyber bullying. Such \"catch-all\" filters do not work, they insist.</p><p>Critics retort that the companies will not introduce filters because they would limit search results, reducing the adverts that could be sold.</p><p>Search enginedriven advertising is a $10 billion market. Put the charges together and some observers say tech firms are taking over from banks as the corporate villains of our times. \"Technology is replacing banking and finance as the industry most likely to worry government and the public,\" Time magazine said recently.</p><p>Googlehas apologised for harvesting data. \"We screwed up,\" said Eric Schmidt, its executive chairman. The firm denies that it engages in anti-competitive behaviour and insists it offers safe web searching to protect children.</p><p>Facebook rejects claims that it misled investors when it floated and says it is beefing up its privacy controls. Apple denies monopolistic practices, while Jobs's successor, Tim Cook, has visited Foxconn and ordered fresh checks on factory working conditions.</p><p>Understandably, the three also emphasise the positives: they have created the greatest explosion of democracy, access to information and ability to connect and communicate the world has ever seen - all of which has generated great wealth. This is undoubtedly true, yet there is a nagging doubt that, like the big banks before the financial crash, these titans of the new economy are woefully lightly regulated.</p><p>SOME people are trying to fight back. Authorities here and in America are trying to close loopholes to force the tech giants to pay more tax. Politicians are drawing up an online privacy \"bill of rights\". To protect copyright, two anti-piracy bills have been proposed in America.</p><p>Yet there is little evidence that such moves are working. Heavy lobbying by Silicon Valley, whose economic might makes it of vital importance to the American economy, has seen off proposed legislation.</p><p>Ironically, big tech's critics might find a solution in tech itself. Alarmed by the backlash against them, Google, Microsoft and Apple have indicated they might support the development of a \"do not track\" button in all web browsers. By flipping a switch, users could instruct websites not to monitor their online behaviour.</p><p>Independent tech firms are starting to offer consumers the chance to protect their data. SafetyWeb helps parents monitor their children's activities on social networking sites and is launching myID.com, a privacy protection service for adults.</p><p>Then there is the ultimate technological solution: switch off. Googleand Facebook know that if they lose the trust of their users they are only a few clicks away from extinction, such as AltaVista or Netscape. Apple has had more than enough brushes with corporate mortality to know its future is not guaranteed.</p><p>In the end it is you and me, the users, who have the real power over the big three. If we continue to log on, they will carry on growing - and doing whatever they like. If we turn against them or switch to a new operator whose products and values we prefer, they will die in a heartbeat. The choice is ours - at the click of a mouse.</p><p>'' UNDER THE HOODIES AND THE MORAL LANGUAGE LURK ROBBER BARONS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-61012729</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55X1-B8N1-DYVC-J49J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1568\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>June 17, 2012 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As the firms' youthful bosses arrive each morning at their eco-friendly offices in their T-shirts and trainers, they like to imagine they are a cut above conventional business leaders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google's mission statement is \"Don't be evil\" and its founders, Larry Page, 39, and Sergey Brin, 38, say they want to make the world a better place. Facebook's freshly minted billionaire boss, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>28, claims he is dedicated to \"openness, connecting and sharing\". Before his death last year Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, said: \"Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter. Saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters.\" The shine is coming off Silicon Valley's finest, however.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), Britain's data watchdog, announced it was reopening its investigation into Google's Street View cars, which travel around taking photographs to create the search engine's popular mapping service.</p><p>It has emerged that Googleprogrammed the vehicles to gather private data, including email, web searches and photographs, from unsecured home wi-fi networks. It also stands accused of trying to cover up what it had been doing.</p><p>European Union regulators are examining claims that Googleis abusing its dominance in the search business by ranking its own products higher up in results than those of its rivals. A similar case in the 1990s tarnished the reputation and hit the profits of Microsoft, then the world's most fearsome tech behemoth.</p><p>The latest moves come as Apple faces criticism over its plans, revealed last week by The Sunday Times, for an answer to Street View: an even more intrusive 3-D service using military-grade aerial camera satellites capable of revealing objects as small as 4in across.</p><p>Facebook is having a torrid time, too. Shares in the world's most successful social network have fallen sharply since it floated on the Nasdaq in New York last month. To add to its woes, figures released last week showed its hitherto phenomenal growth is beginning to slow: in April, its site had 158m unique users, up only 5% on a year earlier, according to the research firm comScore - the lowest rise since it began tracking the data in 2008.</p><p>The new figures have fuelled the anger of many disgruntled small investors who are suing Facebook over claims that it had told bankers and a select group of investors that its growth was slowing before its float - but neglected to share the information with them.</p><p>The recent setbacks mean the bosses of the big tech firms will spend a lot less time talking to their flipflop-wearing staff this summer and a lot more time talking to buttonedup lawyers. Googlefaces fines if the ICO finds its Street View cars breached data protection laws. The company could also face a police investigation.</p><p>HOW did we fall out of love with these pillars of the new economy whose services and products have so quickly become central to our lives? The simple answer is that consumers and legislators alike have finally woken up to an uncomfortable truth: despite their laid-back image, these tech giants are just as corporate, money-grabbing and venal as the old-school businesses they so disdain.</p><p>As Rob Cox, a leading US technology writer, puts it: \"Under the hoodies and the moral language lurk rapacious business people, robber barons, with the same profit motive that drives all businesses and a ruthlessness rivalling history's greatest industrial bullies.\"</p><p>The charge sheet against the big tech firms is long: as well as pinching the private data of unsuspecting homeowners, carrying out creepy aerial surveillance and ripping off investors, they also stand accused of violating privacy.</p><p>Each makes money by vacuuming up the digital footprint we leave online and using it to sell advertisements or market products. Hardly a day passes without some new revelation of one of them taking a byte too far.</p><p>Googlerecently altered its computer code to circumvent the privacy settings in Apple's Safari web browser, used by hundreds of millions of people. Facebook has come under fire for allowing companies to turn users' \"likes\" into advertisements that are then sent to their own online friends.</p><p>Googleis accused of \"looking the other way\" on copyright. Newspapers and magazines say the search engine \"steals\" their content and uses it to sell lucrative advertisements. Like Google, Apple is under investigation for monopolistic practices. The US justice department is examining claims that the firm, along with several publishers, colluded to raise the price of electronic books.</p><p>Apple has also been condemned for using Chinese manufacturers with lousy working practices. Foxconn, the Chinese factory where Apple's iPhones are made, has been investigated for treating its workers so badly that many have committed suicide.</p><p>Worst of all, say critics, is the aggressive tax avoidance practised by the big three. Google, Facebook and Apple have each set up elaborate webs of overseas companies to funnel revenues away from high-tax economies, such as Britain and Germany, through tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. The complex arrangements allow them - legally - to slash their tax bills.</p><p>Google, for example, paid just \u00a31.2m in British corporation tax in 2010 on sales that topped \u00a32.2 billion. Apple has stashed two-thirds of its $110 billion cash hoard overseas, out of the reach of the American taxman. Facebook, now worth more than $60 billion, paid a staggeringly low \u00a3397,000 in British corporation tax in 2010.</p><p>At every step of the way the companies have resisted attempts to clip their wings and even allegedly frustrated investigations into their less savoury practices. In April the US Federal Communications Commission said Googlehad \"deliberately impeded and delayed\" its inquiry into the Street View data collection.</p><p>The tech giants have fought bitterly against any restrictions on internet use, opposing government attempts to introduce filters to prevent children accessing pornographic or violent images and moves to limit cyber bullying.</p><p>Such \"catch-all\" filters do not work, they insist.</p><p>Critics retort that the companies will not introduce filters because they would limit search results, reducing the adverts that could be sold. Search engine-driven advertising is a $10 billion market. Put the charges together and some observers say tech firms are taking over from banks as the corporate villains of our times. \"Technology is replacing banking and finance as the industry most likely to worry government and the public,\" Time magazine said recently.</p><p>Googlehas apologised for harvesting data. \"We screwed up,\" said Eric Schmidt, its executive chairman. The firm denies that it engages in anti-competitive behaviour and insists it offers safe web searching to protect children. Facebook rejects claims that it misled investors when it floated and says it is beefing up its privacy controls. Apple denies monopolistic practices, while Jobs's successor, Tim Cook, has visited Foxconn and ordered fresh checks on factory working conditions.</p><p>Understandably, the three also emphasise the positives: they have created the greatest explosion of democracy, access to information and ability to connect and communicate that the world has ever seen - all of which has generated great wealth.</p><p>This is undoubtedly true yet there is a nagging doubt that, like the big banks before the financial crash, these titans of the new economy are woefully lightly regulated.</p><p>If an airline does something as simple and annoying as lose our luggage, we get compensation.</p><p>If a web operator pinches our data and then tries to cover its tracks, we get nothing, even though data theft can lead to identity theft. \"The web is largely unregulated,\" said Professor Peter Sommer, a Londonbased cyber expert.</p><p>SOME people are trying to fight back. Authorities here and in America are attempting to close loopholes to force the tech giants to pay more tax. Politicians are drawing up an online privacy \"bill of rights\". To protect copyright, two antipiracy bills have been proposed in the United States.</p><p>Yet there is little evidence that such moves are working. Heavy lobbying by Silicon Valley, whose economic might makes it of vital importance to the American economy, has seen off proposed legislation. While some users might make use of new privacy codes, most of us are so wedded to our iPads, smartphones and Facebook that we cannot imagine life without them and will not give them up - regardless of how the companies which own them behave. This article was prepared using Google's search engine and its suite of online word-processing products.</p><p>Ironically, big tech's critics might find a solution in tech itself. Alarmed by the backlash against them, Google, Microsoft and Apple have indicated they might support the development of a \"do not track\" button in all web browsers. By flipping a switch, users could instruct websites not to monitor their online behaviour.</p><p>Independent tech firms are starting to offer consumers the chance to protect their data. SafetyWeb helps parents monitor their children's activities on social networking sites and is launching myID.com, a privacy protection service for adults. Other firms offer consumers the chance to profit from their personal information: the London-based Allow Ltd gathers our data and lets us sell it to firms we approve of - in return for a small fee.</p><p>Then there is the ultimate technological solution: switch off. Googleand Facebook know that if they lose the trust of their users they are only a few clicks away from extinction, such as AltaVista or Netscape. Apple has had more than enough brushes with corporate mortality to know its future is not guaranteed.</p><p>In the end it is you and me, the users, who have the real power over the big three. If we continue to log on they will carry on growing - and doing whatever they like. If we turn against them or switch to a new operator whose products and values we prefer, they will die in a heartbeat. The choice is ours - at the click of a mouse.</p><p>'' UNDER THE HOODIES AND THE MORAL LANGUAGE LURK ROBBER BARONS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-61017709</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55X1-B8P1-DYVC-J0C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1719\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>June 17, 2012 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As the firms' youthful bosses arrive each morning at their eco-friendly offices in their T-shirts and trainers, they like to imagine they are a cut above conventional business leaders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google's mission statement is \"Don't be evil\" and its founders, Larry Page, 39, and Sergey Brin, 38, say they want to make the world a better place. Facebook's freshly minted billionaire boss, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>28, claims he is dedicated to \"openness, connecting and sharing\". Before his death last year Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, said: \"Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter. Saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The shine is coming off Silicon Valley's finest, however.Last week the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), Britain's data watchdog, announced it was reopening its investigation into Google's Street View cars, which travel around taking photographs to create the search engine's popular mapping service.</p><p>It has emerged that Googleprogrammed the vehicles to gather private data, including email, web searches and photographs, from unsecured home wi-fi networks. It also stands accused of trying to cover up what it had been doing.</p><p>European Union regulators are examining claims that Googleis abusing its dominance in the search business by ranking its own products higher up in results than those of its rivals. A similar case in the 1990s tarnished the reputation and hit the profits of Microsoft, then the world's most fearsome tech behemoth.</p><p>The latest moves come as Apple faces criticism over its plans, revealed last week by The Sunday Times, for an answer to Street View: an even more intrusive 3-D service using military-grade aerial camera satellites capable of revealing objects as small as 4in across.</p><p>Facebook is having a torrid time, too. Shares in the world's most successful social network have fallen sharply since it floated on the Nasdaq in New York last month. To add to its woes, figures released last week showed its hitherto phenomenal growth is beginning to slow: in April, its site had 158m unique users, up only 5% on a year earlier, according to the research firm comScore - the lowest rise since it began tracking the data in 2008.</p><p>The new figures have fuelled the anger of many disgruntled small investors who are suing Facebook over claims that it had told bankers and a select group of investors that its growth was slowing before its float - but neglected to share the information with them.</p><p>The recent setbacks mean the bosses of the big tech firms will spend a lot less time talking to their flipflop-wearing staff this summer and a lot more time talking to buttonedup lawyers. Googlefaces fines if the ICO finds its Street View cars breached data protection laws. The company could also face a police investigation.</p><p>HOW did we fall out of love with these pillars of the new economy whose services and products have so quickly become central to our lives? The simple answer is that consumers and legislators alike have finally woken up to an uncomfortable truth: despite their laid-back image, these tech giants are just as corporate, money-grabbing and venal as the old-school businesses they so disdain.</p><p>As Rob Cox, a leading US technology writer, puts it: \"Under the hoodies and the moral language lurk rapacious business people, robber barons, with the same profit motive that drives all businesses and a ruthlessness rivalling history's greatest industrial bullies.\"</p><p>The charge sheet against the big tech firms is long: as well as pinching the private data of unsuspecting homeowners, carrying out creepy aerial surveillance and ripping off investors, they also stand accused of violating privacy.</p><p>Each makes money by vacuuming up the digital footprint we leave online and using it to sell advertisements or market products. Hardly a day passes without some new revelation of one of them taking a byte too far.</p><p>Googlerecently altered its computer code to circumvent the privacy settings in Apple's Safari web browser, used by hundreds of millions of people. Facebook has come under fire for allowing companies to turn users' \"likes\" into advertisements that are then sent to their own online friends.</p><p>Googleis accused of \"looking the other way\" on copyright. Newspapers and magazines say the search engine \"steals\" their content and uses it to sell lucrative advertisements. Like Google, Apple is under investigation for monopolistic practices. The US justice department is examining claims that the firm, along with several publishers, colluded to raise the price of electronic books.</p><p>Apple has also been condemned for using Chinese manufacturers with lousy working practices. Foxconn, the Chinese factory where Apple's iPhones are made, has been investigated for treating its workers so badly that many have committed suicide.</p><p>Worst of all, say critics, is the aggressive tax avoidance practised by the big three. Google, Facebook and Apple have each set up elaborate webs of overseas companies to funnel revenues away from high-tax economies, such as Britain and Germany, through tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. The complex arrangements allow them - legally - to slash their tax bills.</p><p>Google, for example, paid just \u00a31.2m in British corporation tax in 2010 on sales that topped \u00a32.2 billion. Apple has stashed two-thirds of its $110 billion cash hoard overseas, out of the reach of the American taxman. Facebook, now worth more than $60 billion, paid a staggeringly low \u00a3397,000 in British corporation tax in 2010.</p><p>At every step of the way the companies have resisted attempts to clip their wings and even allegedly frustrated investigations into their less savoury practices. In April the US Federal Communications Commission said Googlehad \"deliberately impeded and delayed\" its inquiry into the Street View data collection.</p><p>The tech giants have fought bitterly against any restrictions on internet use, opposing government attempts to introduce filters to prevent children accessing pornographic or violent images and moves to limit cyber bullying.Such \"catch-all\" filters do not work, they insist.</p><p>Critics retort that the companies will not introduce filters because they would limit search results, reducing the adverts that could be sold. Search engine-driven advertising is a $10 billion market. Put the charges together and some observers say tech firms are taking over from banks as the corporate villains of our times. \"Technology is replacing banking and finance as the industry most likely to worry government and the public,\" Time magazine said recently.</p><p>Googlehas apologised for harvesting data. \"We screwed up,\" said Eric Schmidt, its executive chairman. The firm denies that it engages in anti-competitive behaviour and insists it offers safe web searching to protect children. Facebook rejects claims that it misled investors when it floated and says it is beefing up its privacy controls. Apple denies monopolistic practices, while Jobs's successor, Tim Cook, has visited Foxconn and ordered fresh checks on factory working conditions.</p><p>Understandably, the three also emphasise the positives: they have created the greatest explosion of democracy, access to information and ability to connect and communicate that the world has ever seen - all of which has generated great wealth.</p><p>This is undoubtedly true yet there is a nagging doubt that, like the big banks before the financial crash, these titans of the new economy are woefully lightly regulated.</p><p>If an airline does something as simple and annoying as lose our luggage, we get compensation.If a web operator pinches our data and then tries to cover its tracks, we get nothing, even though data theft can lead to identity theft. \"The web is largely unregulated,\" said Professor Peter Sommer, a Londonbased cyber expert.</p><p>SOME people are trying to fight back. Authorities here and in America are attempting to close loopholes to force the tech giants to pay more tax. Politicians are drawing up an online privacy \"bill of rights\". To protect copyright, two antipiracy bills have been proposed in the United States.</p><p>Yet there is little evidence that such moves are working. Heavy lobbying by Silicon Valley, whose economic might makes it of vital importance to the American economy, has seen off proposed legislation. While some users might make use of new privacy codes, most of us are so wedded to our iPads, smartphones and Facebook that we cannot imagine life without them and will not give them up - regardless of how the companies which own them behave. This article was prepared using Google's search engine and its suite of online word-processing products.</p><p>Ironically, big tech's critics might find a solution in tech itself. Alarmed by the backlash against them, Google, Microsoft and Apple have indicated they might support the development of a \"do not track\" button in all web browsers. By flipping a switch, users could instruct websites not to monitor their online behaviour.</p><p>Independent tech firms are starting to offer consumers the chance to protect their data. SafetyWeb helps parents monitor their children's activities on social networking sites and is launching myID.com, a privacy protection service for adults. Other firms offer consumers the chance to profit from their personal information: the London-based Allow Ltd gathers our data and lets us sell it to firms we approve of - in return for a small fee.</p><p>Then there is the ultimate technological solution: switch off. Googleand Facebook know that if they lose the trust of their users they are only a few clicks away from extinction, such as AltaVista or Netscape. Apple has had more than enough brushes with corporate mortality to know its future is not guaranteed.</p><p>In the end it is you and me, the users, who have the real power over the big three. If we continue to log on they will carry on growing - and doing whatever they like. If we turn against them or switch to a new operator whose products and values we prefer, they will die in a heartbeat. The choice is ours - at the click of a mouse.</p><p>'' UNDER THE HOODIES AND THE MORAL LANGUAGE LURK ROBBER BARONS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-61004908</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55X1-B8N1-DYVC-J562-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1719\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>June 17, 2012 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The share of women-owned bu...</p><p>The economic price paid by women entrepreneurs during the coronavirus pandemic is far higher than that paid by their male counterparts. Because entrepreneurs are increasingly women, post-pandemic economic recovery is threatened. The share of women-owned businesses soared from 4.6% in 1972 to 42% in 2019, according to the American Express 2019 State of Women-Owned Businesses .*    According to the 2019\u20132020 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), the benefits to society of entrepreneurship are better understood and appreciated. Community Revival in the Wake of Disaster Lessons in Local Entrepreneurship , finds that entrepreneurs drive economic recovery and help communities rebound after disasters. Catastrophic events such as a major hurricane, earthquake, flood, recession, or pandemic destroy, but, in their wake, entrepreneurs create. Entrepreneurs\u2014more and more of them women\u2014help communities survive and bounce back from destructive events.   Covid-19 Exposes Existing Inequities For Women   While men are still more likely to engage in Total Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA), the gender gap narrowed between 2018 and 2019 in the United States: the ratio was 7.5 to 10 and 9 to 10 respectively, according to GEM. \"TEA includes people who are thinking about starting a business, are in the process of starting a business, or have started a business in the past three years,\" said Amanda Elam, GEM researcher and Diana Research Fellow, Diana International Research Institute at Babson College.      Women held about 60% of the jobs that have been lost . \"I think we should go ahead and call this a 'shecession,'\" said C. Nicole Mason, president and chief executive of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in a New York Times article. Necessity entrepreneurship was dramatically higher for women than men during the 2007-2008 recession, according to GEM. This trend is even more likely during a shecession. Necessity entrepreneurs cannot find quality employment or are unemployed, so their only viable employment option is to start a business.    Women are more likely to leave their jobs because of childcare issues: 14% of women considered quitting their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a survey by Syndio, a pay-equity software company. More women may turn to entrepreneurship for flexibility to accommodate childcare issues. Necessity and flexibility entrepreneurs tend to be sidepreneurs . These part-time businesses are smaller than full-time businesses. Their founders are more likely to return to the workforce when they can.         Opportunity entrepreneurs see possibilities in the market that they want to exploit. They are more likely to enter the market in good economic times than in bad. After the 2007-2008 financial crisis, opportunity entrepreneurship took a back seat to necessity entrepreneurship. This pattern is likely to repeat itself now and be even more extreme.    However, even in bad times, opportunity does exist. Fear of failure is more likely to hold women back from starting a business than men, commented Elam. \"This could be because women are concerned that if they fail, they don't have a plan B.\"        Women of Color Face Greater Challenges Yet Increasingly Are Becoming Entrepreneurs   Women represent 51% of the adult population in the United States, but 42% of all business owners , and only 20% of employer businesses**. Women of color represent 40% of all women , 89% of all net new women-owned businesses , but only 24% of employer women-owned businesses**. Structural differences in personal wealth , business experience , and networks , as well as different entrepreneurial motivations and cultural expectations \u2014women do most of the household chores and are more likely to be caregivers\u2014result in an under representation of women, especially among employer**, million-dollar-plus**, and venture-backed businesses .    The Covid-19 Crisis shuttered small businesses unequally. Between February to April 2020, black-owned businesses declined by 41% according to The Impact of Covid-19 on Small Business Owners: Evidence of Early Stage Losses from the April 2020 Current Population Survey . Immigrant-owned businesses dropped by 36%, Hispanic owned businesses by 32%, Asian-owned businesses by 26%, and women-owned businesses by 25%. White-owned businesses fell only 17%. The study didn't analyze minority-women-owned businesses. However, because minority-women-owned businesses are in the sectors that were most impacted by lock-down orders\u2014personal care, retail, and restaurants\u2014and their businesses tend to be smaller than men\u2019s, their numbers may have shrunk even more.    With Covid-19 cases surging throughout the United States, and looming lock downs, even if only partial, will continue to shock the economy in waves. The pandemic will have severe consequences on small businesses, especially those owned by women of color.   Supporting Women Entrepreneurs   There are encouraging signs that federal, state, and local governments, as well as large corporations are helping small businesses recover. They have rallied to support small businesses by providing grants, forgivable loans, and low-cost loans. But more can be done. Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Conditions and Gendered National-Level Entrepreneurial Activity: a 14-year panel study of GEM finds women\u2019s entrepreneurship thrives  when there is supportive government policy towards entrepreneurship, minimal commercial and legal infrastructure, and a normative culture that supports entrepreneurship. According to GEM, the United States is weakest at:    Government entrepreneurial programs: The presence and quality of programs directly assisting small businesses at all levels of government (national, regional, municipal). For example, the federal government should increase funding to SBA Women's Business Center (or local programs), which provide entrepreneurial training, access to capital, access to markets through government and corporate supplier programs, as well as coaching and mentorship.  R &amp; D transfer: National research and development that leads to new commercial opportunities and is available to small businesses. Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are federal grant programs that provide needed investment in America's most innovative small businesses. Only a tiny percentage of funds from these programs go to female founders. Partnering with organizations such as Springboard Enterprises\u2019 Women's Health Innovation Coalition which I wrote about last week would improve the odds. The female founded companies involved in the initiative are likely to take advantage of SBIR and STTR grants.  Government policies\u2014Support and Relevance: The extent to which public policies support entrepreneurship. Whether it is local, state, or federal, all levels of government should mandate increased spending with diverse small businesses. The benefits to government agencies include: access to innovative products/services; increase in competition, resulting in better prices and service levels; highlight their commitment to diversity and inclusion, and a shared and durable prosperity; and help them be flexible, agile, and resilient. A Gendered Look at Entrepreneurship Ecosystems finds support for child care would facilitate and encourage more women to participate in entrepreneurship. Despite women entrepreneurs being ready, willing, and able to receive loans, access to them is a challenge. Tracking small business loans by gender, race and ethnicity would hold lenders accountable. Having women as venture capital decision makers, improves the odds for female founders getting funding. While more and more women are starting venture funds, these funds tend to be small. The  Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) should rethink it model to encourage and approve the new wave of female founded funds for this program. Emerging manager programs need to be rethought to enable smaller funds to qualify.  Internal market burdens or entry regulations: The burdens include entry of new and growing firms in the market and the effectiveness of antitrust legislation. For example, big tech firms such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, have been accused by smaller rivals of anti-competitive behavior and have asked Congress for protection. Congress should act.

AND STILL YOUR INTERNET WON'T BE AS FAST AS THEY PROMISE</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BY HOLLY BLACK</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TODAY, Money Mail exposes how Britain's biggest telecoms firms are hitting customers with a price rise every 16 days while misleading them about internet speeds and changes to their contracts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our investigation lays bare how households are paying more than \u00a31,000 a year for deals which cost them \u00a3750 just four years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the weekend, the Government outlined plans to make fast broadband a legal right as electricity or gas already is for all homeowners in the UK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But our probe shows that if this is to happen by 2020, the big tech firms have a long way to go, because while costs have soared, service for millions of homeowners remains diabolical.</p><p>Our investigation highlights how:</p><p>* the big four' firms have hiked prices 90 times in four years;</p><p>* line rental has increased by as much as 54 pc;</p><p>* just one-in-six homes gets their advertised broadband speed at peak times;</p><p>* complaints about telecoms firms are\u00a0soaring;</p><p>* customers are paying excessive charges because firms refuse to tell them when their contract comes to an end;</p><p>* BT customers have been lured in to paying for sport TV channels they don't want;</p><p>* Sky has been automatically making customers pay for a phone package they don't\u00a0need;</p><p>* Households are waiting days to get phonelines fixed because of a bitter industry\u00a0row.</p><p>the costs THAT KEEP ON SOARING</p><p>Over the past four years, the big four providers BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin have hiked prices on 90 separate occasions, according to figures compiled for Money Mail by comparison site Simplify Digital. There is growing anger from consumers about landline costs, which they see as unnecessary. Many modern families use mobile phones rather than a landline, and so don't want the latter.</p><p>But they're over a barrel because they can't have a broadband service from the major providers without paying for landline. This allows the telecoms firms to artificially lower the price of their internet deals while sneakily hiking landline prices.</p><p>Virgin Media, however, does allow customers to have its cable-based TV and internet service without paying for a landline.</p><p>Some 31 of the price rises were by Sky. BT had 17, with seven of these increases to its line rental. Virgin Media made 29 price increases, and TalkTalk 13. In total, it equates to one price rise every 16 days.</p><p>In four years, Sky's line rental has leapt from \u00a311.25 a month to \u00a317.40 a rise of 54 pc.</p><p>BT's has jumped from \u00a313.60 to \u00a317.99, Virgin's from \u00a311.99 to \u00a316.99, and TalkTalk's from \u00a314.95 to \u00a317.70.</p><p>Frequently, an individual firm has increased its charges twice inside six months.</p><p>But it's not just the hike in costs that annoy customers, it's the tricks firms use. Sky recently told customers that monthly line rental would increase from \u00a316.40 to \u00a317.40 from December 1.</p><p>The letter it sent customers says they'll be put on the best-value package based on how they use its service, or the nearest equivalent to what they currently have.</p><p>But some customers who don't use their landline were put on to a package which gives free evening and weekend calls and costs an additional \u00a34 per month.</p><p>However, there is a tariff which has no additional monthly cost but instead charges for every landline call a customer makes. For many households who don't use their landline, this is the perfect option, but they have been automatically dumped on to the more expensive deal.</p><p>BT has also angered customers over the way it charges for its BT Sport channels.</p><p>In May 2013, it heralded free BT Sport which now offers a mix of Champions League and Premier League football, plus other sports for those with its broadband packages.</p><p>However, the telecoms giant brought the free deal to an end earlier this year. Instead, it said the service would now cost \u00a35 a month. But customers had to opt out of the new \u00a35-a-month charge if they wanted to avoid it. This left up to five million facing a steep rise in bills from August.</p><p>Some have complained they weren't clearly told about the change or didn't even realise they'd been charged. Others who did notice the new fee have struggled to cancel BT Sport.</p><p>Furious Money Mail readers Petula Peel and Roy Hancock spent hours on the phone and writing letters trying to stop the extra monthly payment.</p><p>Petula, from Royston, Hertfordshire, says: We've been in dispute about the extra BT Sport from the start, and found the bills very confusing. It was as though BT didn't want us to realise we were paying extra for a sports add-on we don't want.'</p><p>Fed up with poor service, the couple customers of 40 years' standing have now joined Sky.</p><p>Another customer, Hugh Froggatt, brands the \u00a35-a-month rise as a stealth\u00a0charge.</p><p>He says: The charge for BT Sport was a service I never asked for, never used and did not realise I had. It will earn BT a tidy windfall from unsuspecting customers.'</p><p>Another reader branded it a form of inertia selling I find reprehensible'.</p><p>As well as price hikes, customers are seeing perks axed.</p><p>TalkTalk is removing its speedy payment discount from December 1. Until now, customers who paid by direct debit or within 24 hours of receiving a bill by email have been given 10 pc off of their bill. The discount was already reduced from 15 pc last year.</p><p>Those who want to switch to a cheaper deal also face problems. Regulator Ofcom has already told firms they should tell customers when contracts come to an end, so people know when to look for a cheaper deal. At the moment, though, this rarely happens.</p><p>Trying to compare packages between the major providers is also nigh-on impossible. Research by Broadband Choices shows that the total cost of landline and broadband from some of the major providers is up to five times as much as the advertised price. And if you stay loyal to your provider, you're punished with even higher prices.</p><p>And not all customers can get all services. Virgin cables connect to only 13.6 million homes in the country. Some people can't get Sky because their property can't be fitted with a satellite dish. And even BT does not offer its superfast broadband to all homes across the country.</p><p>Once you've decided what to buy, there can be additional charges for the technology that helps you get your internet and TV service, such as routers and boxes.</p><p>Research by uSwitch has found that those who stick with their provider after their initial deal are paying \u00a3151 a year more than they should.</p><p>HOMES HIT</p><p>THE GREAT GO-SLOW</p><p>Once you have broadband, it's likely it will be slower than you had hoped.</p><p>The speed and the amount of internet you can download are crucial to many households these days particularly those who enjoy video games, and anyone who uses internet television services such as Netflix.</p><p>A survey by consumer association Which? found 90 pc of consumers rate speed as an important factor when they picked an internet provider.</p><p>Despite this, Which? found that 15.4 million homes don't get the advertised speed. The figures are even worse in peak hours: it is estimated just 15 pc are able to get the maximum advertised speed.</p><p>Overall, fewer than one-in-three households in towns and cities is capable of getting the maximum speed; in rural areas just 4pc of homes are able to.</p><p>Part of the reason for this go-slow is that the wires which provide the internet service aren't capable of delivering the highest speeds.</p><p>To get a top service you need fibre optic cables. But only a fifth of homes in the countryside are connected to these compared with three-quarters of those in urban areas.</p><p>And even where there are fibre optic cables, these often don't run straight to your front door. Many superfast cables run only to the exchange at the end of your road. From there, copper wires which are much slower run the signal to your house.</p><p>If fibre cables are laid right the way to your home, it's possible to get speeds of up to 330 Mb per second that would mean an HD film could be downloaded in under 20 seconds. But if you just have copper wires running to your house, the maximum it would be theoretically possible to get is 80 Mb.</p><p>Yet despite providers boasting that they can produce these speeds, Ofcom research shows the typical speed achieved across the country is just 23 Mb.</p><p>Again, even this can be theoretical for homes in built-up areas where lots of households all want to use the internet at the same time.</p><p>So at peak times, typically at weekends and between 8pm and 10pm on weekday evenings, just one in 25 of TalkTalk's customers received the maximum advertised speed of 17 Mb during Which? testing.</p><p>A fifth of its customers achieved an average speed of only 5 Mb half that of Ofcom's recommended minimum speed.</p><p>Sky, BT and Plusnet customers typically achieved speeds of 10 Mb during the research. And fewer than one in five of their customers managed to get the advertised speed.</p><p>Virgin Media offers a rare glimmer of hope to internet users who want to get the fastest speeds. Research found that 98 pc of its customers get the advertised speed in off-peak hours, while more than half will get these speeds at peak times.</p><p>So how do the firms get away with advertising speeds which are just not achievable?</p><p>It is because internet providers need only to ensure 10 pc of their customers can get a certain speed. Hit this target and they can boast that there speeds up to' that level.</p><p>The requirement on other sectors are much more onerous. For example, loan and credit card firms cannot advertise a rate unless it is available to at least 51 pc of applicants.</p><p>Virgin has branded internet advertising rules outdated and misleading'.</p><p>WHY COMPLAINTS CAN BE IGNORED</p><p>While prices rise and consumers get frustrated by their plodding broadband speed, complaints are sky-high.</p><p>In June, Ofcom warned telecoms firms to improve service.

Many modern families use mobile phones rather than a landline, and so don't want the latter.</p><p>But they're over a barrel because they can't have a broadband service from the major providers without paying for landline. This allows the telecoms firms to artificially lower the price of their internet deals - while sneakily hiking landline prices.</p><p>Virgin Media, however, does allow customers to have its cable-based TV and internet service without paying for a landline.</p><p>Some 31 of the price rises were by Sky. BT had 17, with seven of these increases to its line rental. Virgin Media made 29 price increases, and TalkTalk 13. In total, it equates to one price rise every 16 days.</p><p>In four years, Sky's line rental has leapt from \u00a311.25 a month to \u00a317.40 - a rise of 54 per cent.</p><p>BT's has jumped from \u00a313.60 to \u00a317.99, Virgin's from \u00a311.99 to \u00a316.99, and TalkTalk's from \u00a314.95 to \u00a317.70.</p><p>Frequently, an individual firm has increased its charges twice inside six months.</p><p>But it's not just the hike in costs that annoy customers, it's the tricks firms use. Sky recently told customers that monthly line rental would increase from \u00a316.40 to \u00a317.40 from December 1.</p><p>The letter it sent customers says they'll be put on the best-value package based on how they use its service, or the nearest equivalent to what they currently have.</p><p>But some customers who don't use their landline were put on to a package which gives free evening and weekend calls and costs an additional \u00a34 per month.</p><p>However, there is a tariff which has no additional monthly cost - but instead charges for every landline call a customer makes.\u00a0</p><p>For many households who don't use their landline, this is the perfect option, but they have been automatically dumped on to the more expensive deal.</p><p>BT has also angered customers over the way it charges for its BT Sport channels.</p><p>In May 2013, it heralded free BT Sport - which now offers a mix of Champions League and Premier League football, plus other sports - for those with its broadband packages.</p><p>However, the telecoms giant brought the free deal to an end earlier this year. Instead, it said the service would now cost \u00a35 a month.\u00a0</p><p>But customers had to opt out of the new \u00a35-a-month charge if they wanted to avoid it. This left up to five million facing a steep rise in bills from August.</p><p>Some have complained they weren't clearly told about the change or didn't even realise they'd been charged. Others who did notice the new fee have struggled to cancel BT Sport.</p><p>Furious Money Mail readers Petula Peel and Roy Hancock spent hours on the phone and writing letters trying to stop the extra monthly payment.</p><p>Petula, from Royston, Hertfordshire, says: 'We've been in dispute about the extra BT Sport from the start, and found the bills very confusing. It was as though BT didn't want us to realise we were paying extra for a sports add-on we don't want.'</p><p>Fed up with poor service, the couple - customers of 40 years' standing - have now joined Sky.</p><p>Another customer, Hugh Froggatt, brands the \u00a35-a-month rise as a stealth charge.</p><p>He says: 'The charge for BT Sport was a service I never asked for, never used and did not realise I had. It will earn BT a tidy windfall from unsuspecting customers.'</p><p>Another reader branded it 'a form of inertia selling I find reprehensible'.</p><p>As well as price hikes, customers are seeing perks axed.</p><p>TalkTalk is removing its speedy payment discount from December 1. Until now, customers who paid by direct debit or within 24 hours of receiving a bill by email have been given 10 per cent off of their bill. The discount was already reduced from 15 per cent last year.</p><p>Those who want to switch to a cheaper deal also face problems. Regulator Ofcom has already told firms they should tell customers when contracts come to an end, so people know when to look for a cheaper deal. At the moment, though, this rarely happens.</p><p>Trying to compare packages between the major providers is also nigh-on impossible. Research by Broadband Choices shows that the total cost of landline and broadband from some of the major providers is up to five times as much as the advertised price. And if you stay loyal to your provider, you're punished with even higher prices.</p><p>And not all customers can get all services. Virgin cables connect to only 13.6 million homes in the country. Some people can't get Sky because their property can't be fitted with a satellite dish. And even BT does not offer its superfast broadband to all homes across the country.</p><p>Once you've decided what to buy, there can be additional charges for the technology that helps you get your internet and TV service, such as routers and boxes.</p><p>Research by uSwitch has found that those who stick with their provider after their initial deal are paying \u00a3151 a year more than they should.</p><p>Homes hit by the great go slow\u00a0</p><p>Once you have broadband, it's likely it will be slower than you had hoped.</p><p>The speed and the amount of internet you can download are crucial to many households these days - particularly those who enjoy video games, and anyone who uses internet television services such as Netflix.</p><p>A survey by consumer association Which? found 90 per cent of consumers rate speed as an important factor when they picked an internet provider.</p><p>Despite this, Which? found that 15.4 million homes don't get the advertised speed. The figures are even worse in peak hours: it is estimated just 15 per cent are able to get the maximum advertised speed.</p><p>Overall, fewer than one-in-three households in towns and cities is capable of getting the maximum speed; in rural areas just 4 per cent of homes are able to.</p><p>Part of the reason for this go-slow is that the wires which provide the internet service aren't capable of delivering the highest speeds.</p><p>To get a top service you need fibre optic cables. But only a fifth of homes in the countryside are connected to these compared with three-quarters of those in urban areas.</p><p>And even where there are fibre optic cables, these often don't run straight to your front door. Many superfast cables run only to the exchange at the end of your road. From there, copper wires - which are much slower - run the signal to your house.</p><p>If fibre cables are laid right the way to your home, it's possible to get speeds of up to 330 Mb per second - that would mean an HD film could be downloaded in under 20 seconds.\u00a0</p><p>But if you just have copper wires running to your house, the maximum it would be theoretically possible to get is 80 Mb.</p><p>Yet despite providers boasting that they can produce these speeds, Ofcom research shows the typical speed achieved across the country is just 23 Mb.</p><p>Again, even this can be theoretical for homes in built-up areas where lots of households all want to use the internet at the same time.</p><p>So at peak times, typically at weekends and between 8pm and 10pm on weekday evenings, just one in 25 of TalkTalk's customers received the maximum advertised speed of 17 Mb during Which? testing.</p><p>A fifth of its customers achieved an average speed of only 5 Mb - half that of Ofcom's recommended minimum speed.</p><p>Sky, BT and Plusnet customers typically achieved speeds of 10 Mb during the research. And fewer than one in five of their customers managed to get the advertised speed.</p><p>Virgin Media offers a rare glimmer of hope to internet users who want to get the fastest speeds. Research found that 98 per cent of its customers get the advertised speed in off-peak hours, while more than half will get these speeds at peak times.</p><p>So how do the firms get away with advertising speeds which are just not achievable?</p><p>It is because internet providers need only to ensure 10 per cent of their customers can get a certain speed. Hit this target and they can boast that there speeds 'up to' that level.</p><p>The requirement on other sectors are much more onerous. For example, loan and credit card firms cannot advertise a rate unless it is available to at least 51 per cent of applicants.</p><p>Virgin has branded internet advertising rules 'outdated and misleading'.</p><p>Why complaints can be ignored\u00a0</p><p>While prices rise and consumers get frustrated by their plodding broadband speed, complaints are sky-high.</p><p>In June, Ofcom warned telecoms firms to improve service. In particular, it says people still find it too difficult to change provider and cancel contracts.</p><p>Ofcom data shows that some of the biggest firms are generating complaints which are way over the industry average of 16 per 100,000 customers.</p><p>TalkTalk received 27 complaints per 100,000 customers. BT and Plusnet received 22 and 20 complaints respectively. Virgin Media saw just seven complaints, and Sky had the fewest at just five for every 100,000 of its broadband customers.</p><p>But in August the regulator announced it would be investigating Sky over concerns that it was ignoring customers' cancellation requests or making it difficult for them to leave their contract.</p><p>The communications watchdog also introduced a strengthened code of practice on broadband speeds, allowing customers to exit a contract if speeds fall below acceptable levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, many providers say they are limited in how much they can improve their services because BT controls the network which runs all the wires - this is run by a BT-owned company called Openreach.</p><p>Rival internet providers either pay a fee to use Openreach equipment and run their service through that, or install their own equipment in Openreach exchanges and rent a copper line to run to customers' homes.</p><p>Sky is petitioning Ofcom to change this system, arguing that they rely on it to provide a service to customers and it is wrong that they have no control over it.</p><p>BT argues that disrupting the status quo would delay improvements. Meanwhile, as these big firms bicker, service continues to be disrupted for ordinary consumers.</p><p>A Virgin spokesman says: 'Virgin is the only widely available provider to consistently deliver its advertised speeds, let alone exceed them.</p><p>'This is because we have our own fibre-optic broadband network while other providers are reliant on BT's copper cable.'</p><p>A TalkTalk spokesman says: 'TalkTalk is the only provider to offer unlimited broadband as standard on every single package, with no hidden charges or download caps.

Many modern families use mobile phones rather than a landline, and so don't want the latter.</p><p>But they're over a barrel because they can't have a broadband service from the major providers without paying for landline. This allows the telecoms firms to artificially lower the price of their internet deals - while sneakily hiking landline prices.</p><p>Virgin Media, however, does allow customers to have its cable-based TV and internet service without paying for a landline.</p><p>Some 31 of the price rises were by Sky. BT had 17, with seven of these increases to its line rental. Virgin Media made 29 price increases, and TalkTalk 13. In total, it equates to one price rise every 16 days.</p><p>In four years, Sky's line rental has leapt from \u00a311.25 a month to \u00a317.40 - a rise of 54 per cent.</p><p>BT's has jumped from \u00a313.60 to \u00a317.99, Virgin's from \u00a311.99 to \u00a316.99, and TalkTalk's from \u00a314.95 to \u00a317.70.</p><p>Frequently, an individual firm has increased its charges twice inside six months.</p><p>But it's not just the hike in costs that annoy customers, it's the tricks firms use. Sky recently told customers that monthly line rental would increase from \u00a316.40 to \u00a317.40 from December 1.</p><p>The letter it sent customers says they'll be put on the best-value package based on how they use its service, or the nearest equivalent to what they currently have.</p><p>But some customers who don't use their landline were put on to a package which gives free evening and weekend calls and costs an additional \u00a34 per month.</p><p>However, there is a tariff which has no additional monthly cost - but instead charges for every landline call a customer makes.\u00a0</p><p>For many households who don't use their landline, this is the perfect option, but they have been automatically dumped on to the more expensive deal.</p><p>BT has also angered customers over the way it charges for its BT Sport channels.</p><p>In May 2013, it heralded free BT Sport - which now offers a mix of Champions League and Premier League football, plus other sports - for those with its broadband packages.</p><p>However, the telecoms giant brought the free deal to an end earlier this year. Instead, it said the service would now cost \u00a35 a month.\u00a0</p><p>But customers had to opt out of the new \u00a35-a-month charge if they wanted to avoid it. This left up to five million facing a steep rise in bills from August.</p><p>Some have complained they weren't clearly told about the change or didn't even realise they'd been charged. Others who did notice the new fee have struggled to cancel BT Sport.</p><p>Furious Money Mail readers Petula Peel and Roy Hancock spent hours on the phone and writing letters trying to stop the extra monthly payment.</p><p>Petula, from Royston, Hertfordshire, says: 'We've been in dispute about the extra BT Sport from the start, and found the bills very confusing. It was as though BT didn't want us to realise we were paying extra for a sports add-on we don't want.'</p><p>Fed up with poor service, the couple - customers of 40 years' standing - have now joined Sky.</p><p>Another customer, Hugh Froggatt, brands the \u00a35-a-month rise as a stealth charge.</p><p>He says: 'The charge for BT Sport was a service I never asked for, never used and did not realise I had. It will earn BT a tidy windfall from unsuspecting customers.'</p><p>Another reader branded it 'a form of inertia selling I find reprehensible'.</p><p>As well as price hikes, customers are seeing perks axed.</p><p>TalkTalk is removing its speedy payment discount from December 1. Until now, customers who paid by direct debit or within 24 hours of receiving a bill by email have been given 10 per cent off of their bill. The discount was already reduced from 15 per cent last year.</p><p>Those who want to switch to a cheaper deal also face problems. Regulator Ofcom has already told firms they should tell customers when contracts come to an end, so people know when to look for a cheaper deal. At the moment, though, this rarely happens.</p><p>Trying to compare packages between the major providers is also nigh-on impossible. Research by Broadband Choices shows that the total cost of landline and broadband from some of the major providers is up to five times as much as the advertised price. And if you stay loyal to your provider, you're punished with even higher prices.</p><p>And not all customers can get all services. Virgin cables connect to only 13.6 million homes in the country. Some people can't get Sky because their property can't be fitted with a satellite dish. And even BT does not offer its superfast broadband to all homes across the country.</p><p>Once you've decided what to buy, there can be additional charges for the technology that helps you get your internet and TV service, such as routers and boxes.</p><p>Research by uSwitch has found that those who stick with their provider after their initial deal are paying \u00a3151 a year more than they should.</p><p>Homes hit by the great go slow\u00a0</p><p>Once you have broadband, it's likely it will be slower than you had hoped.</p><p>The speed and the amount of internet you can download are crucial to many households these days - particularly those who enjoy video games, and anyone who uses internet television services such as Netflix.</p><p>A survey by consumer association Which? found 90 per cent of consumers rate speed as an important factor when they picked an internet provider.</p><p>Despite this, Which? found that 15.4 million homes don't get the advertised speed. The figures are even worse in peak hours: it is estimated just 15 per cent are able to get the maximum advertised speed.</p><p>Overall, fewer than one-in-three households in towns and cities is capable of getting the maximum speed; in rural areas just 4 per cent of homes are able to.</p><p>Part of the reason for this go-slow is that the wires which provide the internet service aren't capable of delivering the highest speeds.</p><p>To get a top service you need fibre optic cables. But only a fifth of homes in the countryside are connected to these compared with three-quarters of those in urban areas.</p><p>And even where there are fibre optic cables, these often don't run straight to your front door. Many superfast cables run only to the exchange at the end of your road. From there, copper wires - which are much slower - run the signal to your house.</p><p>If fibre cables are laid right the way to your home, it's possible to get speeds of up to 330 Mb per second - that would mean an HD film could be downloaded in under 20 seconds.\u00a0</p><p>But if you just have copper wires running to your house, the maximum it would be theoretically possible to get is 80 Mb.</p><p>Yet despite providers boasting that they can produce these speeds, Ofcom research shows the typical speed achieved across the country is just 23 Mb.</p><p>Again, even this can be theoretical for homes in built-up areas where lots of households all want to use the internet at the same time.</p><p>So at peak times, typically at weekends and between 8pm and 10pm on weekday evenings, just one in 25 of TalkTalk's customers received the maximum advertised speed of 17 Mb during Which? testing.</p><p>A fifth of its customers achieved an average speed of only 5 Mb - half that of Ofcom's recommended minimum speed.</p><p>Sky, BT and Plusnet customers typically achieved speeds of 10 Mb during the research. And fewer than one in five of their customers managed to get the advertised speed.</p><p>Virgin Media offers a rare glimmer of hope to internet users who want to get the fastest speeds. Research found that 98 per cent of its customers get the advertised speed in off-peak hours, while more than half will get these speeds at peak times.</p><p>So how do the firms get away with advertising speeds which are just not achievable?</p><p>It is because internet providers need only to ensure 10 per cent of their customers can get a certain speed. Hit this target and they can boast that there speeds 'up to' that level.</p><p>The requirement on other sectors are much more onerous. For example, loan and credit card firms cannot advertise a rate unless it is available to at least 51 per cent of applicants.</p><p>Virgin has branded internet advertising rules 'outdated and misleading'.</p><p>Why complaints can be ignored\u00a0</p><p>While prices rise and consumers get frustrated by their plodding broadband speed, complaints are sky-high.</p><p>In June, Ofcom warned telecoms firms to improve service. In particular, it says people still find it too difficult to change provider and cancel contracts.</p><p>Ofcom data shows that some of the biggest firms are generating complaints which are way over the industry average of 16 per 100,000 customers.</p><p>TalkTalk received 27 complaints per 100,000 customers. BT and Plusnet received 22 and 20 complaints respectively. Virgin Media saw just seven complaints, and Sky had the fewest at just five for every 100,000 of its broadband customers.</p><p>But in August the regulator announced it would be investigating Sky over concerns that it was ignoring customers' cancellation requests or making it difficult for them to leave their contract.</p><p>The communications watchdog also introduced a strengthened code of practice on broadband speeds, allowing customers to exit a contract if speeds fall below acceptable levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, many providers say they are limited in how much they can improve their services because BT controls the network which runs all the wires - this is run by a BT-owned company called Openreach.</p><p>Rival internet providers either pay a fee to use Openreach equipment and run their service through that, or install their own equipment in Openreach exchanges and rent a copper line to run to customers' homes.</p><p>Sky is petitioning Ofcom to change this system, arguing that they rely on it to provide a service to customers and it is wrong that they have no control over it.</p><p>BT argues that disrupting the status quo would delay improvements. Meanwhile, as these big firms bicker, service continues to be disrupted for ordinary consumers.</p><p>A Virgin spokesman says: 'Virgin is the only widely available provider to consistently deliver its advertised speeds, let alone exceed them.</p><p>'This is because we have our own fibre-optic broadband network while other providers are reliant on BT's copper cable.'</p><p>A TalkTalk spokesman says: 'TalkTalk is the only provider to offer unlimited broadband as standard on every single package, with no hidden charges or download caps. We provide customers with a speed estimate before they sign a contract with us.'</p><p>A BT spokesman says: 'In common with the rest of the industry, BT's standard line rental has increased since 2008, but that stat only tells part of the story. We're very clear that customers should not rely on headline claims for broadband speeds but use the personal speed quote we give them at the point of sale, which is based on their own line.</p><p>'If they aren't happy with this personalised speed, they can decide not to buy from us. If they are happy with the speed, but find they don't achieve it, we allow them to end their contracts in line with the Ofcom code of practice.'</p><p>A Sky spokesman says: 'Our line rental price remains competitive and we continue to invest in our service. When customers sign up to broadband we estimate the speed they can expect, and they can cancel their broadband if we're unable to deliver a guaranteed minimum.'\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-34861662</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HBT-YSY1-F021-627K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2097\"/><timeReceived>12:10 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Many modern families use mobile phones rather than a landline, and so don't want the latter.</p><p>But they're over a barrel because they can't have a broadband service from the major providers without paying for landline. This allows the telecoms firms to artificially lower the price of their internet deals - while sneakily hiking landline prices.</p><p>Virgin Media, however, does allow customers to have its cable-based TV and internet service without paying for a landline.</p><p>Some 31 of the price rises were by Sky. BT had 17, with seven of these increases to its line rental. Virgin Media made 29 price increases, and TalkTalk 13. In total, it equates to one price rise every 16 days.</p><p>In four years, Sky's line rental has leapt from \u00a311.25 a month to \u00a317.40 - a rise of 54 per cent.</p><p>BT's has jumped from \u00a313.60 to \u00a317.99, Virgin's from \u00a311.99 to \u00a316.99, and TalkTalk's from \u00a314.95 to \u00a317.70.</p><p>Frequently, an individual firm has increased its charges twice inside six months.</p><p>But it's not just the hike in costs that annoy customers, it's the tricks firms use. Sky recently told customers that monthly line rental would increase from \u00a316.40 to \u00a317.40 from December 1.</p><p>The letter it sent customers says they'll be put on the best-value package based on how they use its service, or the nearest equivalent to what they currently have.</p><p>But some customers who don't use their landline were put on to a package which gives free evening and weekend calls and costs an additional \u00a34 per month.</p><p>However, there is a tariff which has no additional monthly cost - but instead charges for every landline call a customer makes.\u00a0</p><p>For many households who don't use their landline, this is the perfect option, but they have been automatically dumped on to the more expensive deal.</p><p>BT has also angered customers over the way it charges for its BT Sport channels.</p><p>In May 2013, it heralded free BT Sport - which now offers a mix of Champions League and Premier League football, plus other sports - for those with its broadband packages.</p><p>However, the telecoms giant brought the free deal to an end earlier this year. Instead, it said the service would now cost \u00a35 a month.\u00a0</p><p>But customers had to opt out of the new \u00a35-a-month charge if they wanted to avoid it. This left up to five million facing a steep rise in bills from August.</p><p>Some have complained they weren't clearly told about the change or didn't even realise they'd been charged. Others who did notice the new fee have struggled to cancel BT Sport.</p><p>Furious Money Mail readers Petula Peel and Roy Hancock spent hours on the phone and writing letters trying to stop the extra monthly payment.</p><p>Petula, from Royston, Hertfordshire, says: 'We've been in dispute about the extra BT Sport from the start, and found the bills very confusing. It was as though BT didn't want us to realise we were paying extra for a sports add-on we don't want.'</p><p>Fed up with poor service, the couple - customers of 40 years' standing - have now joined Sky.</p><p>Another customer, Hugh Froggatt, brands the \u00a35-a-month rise as a stealth charge.</p><p>He says: 'The charge for BT Sport was a service I never asked for, never used and did not realise I had. It will earn BT a tidy windfall from unsuspecting customers.'</p><p>Another reader branded it 'a form of inertia selling I find reprehensible'.</p><p>As well as price hikes, customers are seeing perks axed.</p><p>TalkTalk is removing its speedy payment discount from December 1. Until now, customers who paid by direct debit or within 24 hours of receiving a bill by email have been given 10 per cent off of their bill. The discount was already reduced from 15 per cent last year.</p><p>Those who want to switch to a cheaper deal also face problems. Regulator Ofcom has already told firms they should tell customers when contracts come to an end, so people know when to look for a cheaper deal. At the moment, though, this rarely happens.</p><p>Trying to compare packages between the major providers is also nigh-on impossible. Research by Broadband Choices shows that the total cost of landline and broadband from some of the major providers is up to five times as much as the advertised price. And if you stay loyal to your provider, you're punished with even higher prices.</p><p>And not all customers can get all services. Virgin cables connect to only 13.6 million homes in the country. Some people can't get Sky because their property can't be fitted with a satellite dish. And even BT does not offer its superfast broadband to all homes across the country.</p><p>Once you've decided what to buy, there can be additional charges for the technology that helps you get your internet and TV service, such as routers and boxes.</p><p>Research by uSwitch has found that those who stick with their provider after their initial deal are paying \u00a3151 a year more than they should.</p><p>Homes hit by the great go slow\u00a0</p><p>Once you have broadband, it's likely it will be slower than you had hoped.</p><p>The speed and the amount of internet you can download are crucial to many households these days - particularly those who enjoy video games, and anyone who uses internet television services such as Netflix.</p><p>A survey by consumer association Which? found 90 per cent of consumers rate speed as an important factor when they picked an internet provider.</p><p>Despite this, Which? found that 15.4 million homes don't get the advertised speed. The figures are even worse in peak hours: it is estimated just 15 per cent are able to get the maximum advertised speed.</p><p>Overall, fewer than one-in-three households in towns and cities is capable of getting the maximum speed; in rural areas just 4 per cent of homes are able to.</p><p>Part of the reason for this go-slow is that the wires which provide the internet service aren't capable of delivering the highest speeds.</p><p>To get a top service you need fibre optic cables. But only a fifth of homes in the countryside are connected to these compared with three-quarters of those in urban areas.</p><p>And even where there are fibre optic cables, these often don't run straight to your front door. Many superfast cables run only to the exchange at the end of your road. From there, copper wires - which are much slower - run the signal to your house.</p><p>If fibre cables are laid right the way to your home, it's possible to get speeds of up to 330 Mb per second - that would mean an HD film could be downloaded in under 20 seconds.\u00a0</p><p>But if you just have copper wires running to your house, the maximum it would be theoretically possible to get is 80 Mb.</p><p>Yet despite providers boasting that they can produce these speeds, Ofcom research shows the typical speed achieved across the country is just 23 Mb.</p><p>Again, even this can be theoretical for homes in built-up areas where lots of households all want to use the internet at the same time.</p><p>So at peak times, typically at weekends and between 8pm and 10pm on weekday evenings, just one in 25 of TalkTalk's customers received the maximum advertised speed of 17 Mb during Which? testing.</p><p>A fifth of its customers achieved an average speed of only 5 Mb - half that of Ofcom's recommended minimum speed.</p><p>Sky, BT and Plusnet customers typically achieved speeds of 10 Mb during the research. And fewer than one in five of their customers managed to get the advertised speed.</p><p>Virgin Media offers a rare glimmer of hope to internet users who want to get the fastest speeds. Research found that 98 per cent of its customers get the advertised speed in off-peak hours, while more than half will get these speeds at peak times.</p><p>So how do the firms get away with advertising speeds which are just not achievable?</p><p>It is because internet providers need only to ensure 10 per cent of their customers can get a certain speed. Hit this target and they can boast that there speeds 'up to' that level.</p><p>The requirement on other sectors are much more onerous. For example, loan and credit card firms cannot advertise a rate unless it is available to at least 51 per cent of applicants.</p><p>Virgin has branded internet advertising rules 'outdated and misleading'.</p><p>Why complaints can be ignored\u00a0</p><p>While prices rise and consumers get frustrated by their plodding broadband speed, complaints are sky-high.</p><p>In June, Ofcom warned telecoms firms to improve service. In particular, it says people still find it too difficult to change provider and cancel contracts.</p><p>Ofcom data shows that some of the biggest firms are generating complaints which are way over the industry average of 16 per 100,000 customers.</p><p>TalkTalk received 27 complaints per 100,000 customers. BT and Plusnet received 22 and 20 complaints respectively. Virgin Media saw just seven complaints, and Sky had the fewest at just five for every 100,000 of its broadband customers.</p><p>But in August the regulator announced it would be investigating Sky over concerns that it was ignoring customers' cancellation requests or making it difficult for them to leave their contract.</p><p>The communications watchdog also introduced a strengthened code of practice on broadband speeds, allowing customers to exit a contract if speeds fall below acceptable levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, many providers say they are limited in how much they can improve their services because BT controls the network which runs all the wires - this is run by a BT-owned company called Openreach.</p><p>Rival internet providers either pay a fee to use Openreach equipment and run their service through that, or install their own equipment in Openreach exchanges and rent a copper line to run to customers' homes.</p><p>Sky is petitioning Ofcom to change this system, arguing that they rely on it to provide a service to customers and it is wrong that they have no control over it.</p><p>BT argues that disrupting the status quo would delay improvements. Meanwhile, as these big firms bicker, service continues to be disrupted for ordinary consumers.</p><p>A Virgin spokesman says: 'Virgin is the only widely available provider to consistently deliver its advertised speeds, let alone exceed them.</p><p>'This is because we have our own fibre-optic broadband network while other providers are reliant on BT's copper cable.'</p><p>A TalkTalk spokesman says: 'TalkTalk is the only provider to offer unlimited broadband as standard on every single package, with no hidden charges or download caps. We provide customers with a speed estimate before they sign a contract with us.'</p><p>A BT spokesman says: 'In common with the rest of the industry, BT's standard line rental has increased since 2008, but that stat only tells part of the story. We're very clear that customers should not rely on headline claims for broadband speeds but use the personal speed quote we give them at the point of sale, which is based on their own line.</p><p>'If they aren't happy with this personalised speed, they can decide not to buy from us. If they are happy with the speed, but find they don't achieve it, we allow them to end their contracts in line with the Ofcom code of practice.'</p><p>A Sky spokesman says: 'Our line rental price remains competitive and we continue to invest in our service. When customers sign up to broadband we estimate the speed they can expect, and they can cancel their broadband if we're unable to deliver a guaranteed minimum.'\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-34863173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HBV-GR11-JCJY-G23C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2150\"/><timeReceived>7:20 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Many modern families use mobile phones rather than a landline, and so don't want the latter.</p><p>But they're over a barrel because they can't have a broadband service from the major providers without paying for landline. This allows the telecoms firms to artificially lower the price of their internet deals - while sneakily hiking landline prices.</p><p>Virgin Media, however, does allow customers to have its cable-based TV and internet service without paying for a landline.</p><p>Some 31 of the price rises were by Sky. BT had 17, with seven of these increases to its line rental. Virgin Media made 29 price increases, and TalkTalk 13. In total, it equates to one price rise every 16 days.</p><p>In four years, Sky's line rental has leapt from \u00a311.25 a month to \u00a317.40 - a rise of 54 pc.</p><p>BT's has jumped from \u00a313.60 to \u00a317.99, Virgin's from \u00a311.99 to \u00a316.99, and TalkTalk's from \u00a314.95 to \u00a317.70.</p><p>Frequently, an individual firm has increased its charges twice inside six months.</p><p>But it's not just the hike in costs that annoy customers, it's the tricks firms use. Sky recently told customers that monthly line rental would increase from \u00a316.40 to \u00a317.40 from December 1. The letter it sent customers says they'll be put on the best-value package based on how they use its service, or the nearest equivalent to what they currently have.</p><p>But some customers who don't use their landline were put on to a package which gives free evening and weekend calls and costs an additional \u00a34 per month.</p><p>However, there is a tariff which has no additional monthly cost - but instead charges for every landline call a customer makes. For many households who don't use their landline, this is the perfect option, but they have been automatically dumped on to the more expensive deal.</p><p>BT has also angered customers over the way it charges for its BT Sport channels.</p><p>In May 2013, it heralded free BT Sport - which now offers a mix of Champions League and Premier League football, plus other sports - for those with its broadband packages.</p><p>However, the telecoms giant brought the free deal to an end earlier this year. Instead, it said the service would now cost \u00a35 a month. But customers had to opt out of the new \u00a35-a-month charge if they wanted to avoid it. This left up to five million facing a \u00a3What the season pheasant other steep rise in bills from August.</p><p>worth UK Some have complained they weren't clearly told about the change or didn't even realise they'd been charged. Others who did notice the new fee have struggled to cancel BT Sport.</p><p>Furious Money Mail readers Petula Peel and Roy Hancock spent hours on the phone and writing letters trying to stop the extra monthly payment.</p><p>Petula, from Royston, Hertfordshire, says: 'We've been in dispute about the extra BT Sport from the start, and found the bills very confusing. It was as though BT didn't want us to realise we were paying extra for a sports add-on we don't want.' Fed up with poor service, the couple - customers of 40 years' standing - have now joined Sky.</p><p>Another customer, Hugh Froggatt, brands the \u00a35-a-month rise as a stealth charge.</p><p>He says: 'The charge for BT Sport was a service I never asked for, never used and did not realise I had. It will earn BT a tidy windfall from unsuspecting customers.' Another reader branded it 'a form of inertia selling I find reprehensible'.</p><p>As well as price hikes, customers are seeing perks axed.</p><p>TalkTalk is removing its speedy payment discount from December 1. Until now, customers who paid by direct debit or within 24 hours of receiving a bill by email have been given 10 pc off of their bill. The discount was already reduced from 15pc last year.</p><p>Those who want to switch to a cheaper deal also face problems. Regulator Ofcom has already told firms they should tell customers when contracts come to an end, so people know when to look for a cheaper deal. At the moment, though, this rarely happens.</p><p>Trying to compare packages between the major providers is also nigh-on impossible. Research by Broadband Choices shows that the total cost of landline and broadband from some of the major providers is up to five times as much as the advertised price. And if you stay loyal to your provider, you're punished with even higher prices.</p><p>And not all customers can get all services. Virgin cables connect to only 13.6million homes in the country. Some people can't get Sky because their property can't be fitted with a satellite dish. And even BT does not offer its superfast broadband to all homes across the country.</p><p>Once you've decided what to buy, there can be additional charges for the technology that helps you get your internet and TV service, such as routers and boxes.</p><p>Research by uSwitch has found that those who stick with their provider after their initial deal are paying \u00a3151 a year more than they should.</p><p>HOMES HIT BY THE GREAT GO-SLOW</p><p>ONCE you have broadband, it's likely it will be slower than you had hoped.</p><p>The speed and the amount of internet you can download are crucial to many households these days - particularly those who enjoy video games, and anyone who uses internet television services such as Netflix.</p><p>A survey by consumer association Which</p><p>found 90 pc of consumers rate speed as an important factor when they picked an internet provider.</p><p>Despite this, Which</p><p>found that 15.4 million homes don't get the advertised speed. The figures are even worse in peak hours: it is estimated just 15 pc are able to get the maximum advertised speed.</p><p>Overall, fewer than one-in-three households in towns and cities is capable of getting the maximum speed; in rural areas just 4pc of homes are able to.</p><p>Part of the reason for this go-slow is that the wires which provide the internet service aren't capable of delivering the highest speeds.</p><p>To get a top service you need fibre optic cables. But only a fifth of homes in the countryside are connected to these compared with three-quarters of those in urban areas.</p><p>And even where there are fibre optic cables, these often don't run straight to your front door. Many superfast cables run only to the exchange at the end of your road. From there, copper wires - which are much slower - run the signal to your house.</p><p>1.6bn shooting for and game is to the economy If fibre cables are laid right the way to your home, it's possible to get speeds of up to 330 Mb per second - that would mean an HD film could be downloaded in under 20 seconds. But if you just have copper wires running to your house, the maximum it would be theoretically possible to get is 80 Mb.</p><p>Yet despite providers boasting that they can produce these speeds, Ofcom research shows the typical speed achieved across the country is just 23 Mb.</p><p>Again, even this can be theoretical for homes in built-up areas where lots of households all want to use the internet at the same time.</p><p>So at peak times, typically at weekends and between 8pm and 10pm on weekday evenings, just one in 25 of TalkTalk's customers received the maximum advertised speed of 17 Mb during Which? testing.</p><p>A fifth of its customers achieved an average speed of only 5 Mb - half that of Ofcom's recommended minimum speed.</p><p>Sky, BT and Plusnet customers typically achieved speeds of 10Mb during the research. And fewer than one in five of their customers managed to get the advertised speed.</p><p>Virgin Media offers a rare glimmer of hope to internet users who want to get the fastest speeds. Research found that 98pc of its customers get the advertised speed in off-peak hours, while more than half will get these speeds at peak times.</p><p>So how do the firms get away with advertising speeds which are just not achievable</p><p>It is because internet providers need only to ensure 10 pc of their customers can get a certain speed. Hit this target and they can boast that there speeds 'up to' that level.</p><p>The requirement on other sectors are much more onerous. For example, loan and credit card firms cannot advertise a rate unless it is available to at least 51 pc of applicants. Virgin has branded internet advertising rules 'outdated and misleading'.</p><p>WHY COMPLAINTS CAN BE IGNORED</p><p>WHILE prices rise and consumers get frustrated by their plodding broadband speed, complaints are sky-high.</p><p>In June, Ofcom warned telecoms firms to improve service. In particular, it says people still find it too difficult to change provider and cancel contracts.</p><p>Ofcom data shows that some of the biggest firms are generating complaints which are way over the industry average of 16 per 100,000 customers.</p><p>TalkTalk received 27 complaints per 100,000 customers. BT and Plusnet received 22 and 20 complaints respectively. Virgin Media saw just seven complaints, and Sky had the fewest at just five for every 100,000 of its broadband customers.</p><p>But in August the regulator announced it would be investigating Sky over concerns that it was ignoring customers' cancellation requests or making it difficult for them to leave their contract.</p><p>The communications watchdog also introduced a strengthened code of practice on broadband speeds, allowing customers to exit a contract if speeds fall below acceptable levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, many providers say they are limited in how much they can improve their services because BT controls the network which runs all the wires - this is run by a BT-owned company called Openreach.</p><p>Rival internet providers either pay a fee to use Openreach equipment and run their service through that, or install their own equipment in Openreach exchanges and rent a copper line to run to customers' homes.</p><p>Sky is petitioning Ofcom to change this system, arguing that they rely on it to provide a service to customers and it is wrong that they have no control over it.</p><p>BT argues that disrupting the status quo would delay improvements. Meanwhile, as these big firms bicker, service continues to be disrupted for ordinary consumers.</p><p>A Virgin spokesman says: 'Virgin is the only widely available provider to consistently deliver its advertised speeds, let alone exceed them.</p><p>'This is because we have our own fibre-optic broadband network while other providers are reliant on BT's copper cable.' A TalkTalk spokesman says: 'TalkTalk is the only provider to offer unlimited broadband as standard on every single package, with no hidden charges or download caps. We provide customers with a speed estimate before they sign a contract with us.' A BT spokesman says: 'In common with the rest of the industry, BT's standard line rental has increased since 2008, but that stat only tells part of the story. We're very clear that customers should not rely on headline claims for broadband speeds but use the personal speed quote we give them at the point of sale, which is based on their own line.</p><p>'If they aren't happy with this personalised speed, they can decide not to buy from us. If they are happy with the speed, but find they don't achieve it, we allow them to end their contracts in line with the Ofcom code of practice.' A Sky spokesman says: 'Our line rental price remains competitive and we continue to invest in our service. When customers sign up to broadband we estimate the speed they can expect, and they can cancel their broadband if we're unable to deliver a guaranteed minimum.' <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:h.black@dailymail.co.uk\">h.black@dailymail.co.uk</email> Escape your broadband deal early and find a better one <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/escape\">www.thisismoney.co.uk/escape</url></p><p>]</p><p>\u00a31.6bn What the shooting season for pheasant and other game is worth to the UK economy told</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCMAIL-106054103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCMAIL2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HBV-B1S1-DY9P-N2DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2146\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

This allows the telecoms firms to artificially lower the price of their internet deals - while sneakily hiking landline prices.</p><p>Virgin Media, however, does allow customers to have its cable-based TV and internet service without paying for a landline.</p><p>Some 31 of the price rises were by Sky.\u00a0</p><p>BT had 17, with seven of these increases to its line rental.\u00a0</p><p>Virgin Media made 29 price increases, and TalkTalk 13.\u00a0</p><p>In total, it equates to one price rise every 16 days.</p><p>In four years, Sky's line rental has leapt from \u00a311.25 a month to \u00a317.40 - a rise of 54 per cent.</p><p>BT's has jumped from \u00a313.60 to \u00a317.99, Virgin's from \u00a311.99 to \u00a316.99, and TalkTalk's from \u00a314.95 to \u00a317.70.</p><p>Frequently, an individual firm has increased its charges twice inside six months.</p><p>The tricks used to bump up bills\u00a0</p><p>But it's not just the hike in costs that annoy customers, it's the tricks firms use. Sky recently told customers that monthly line rental would increase from \u00a316.40 to \u00a317.40 from December 1.</p><p>The letter it sent customers says they'll be put on the best-value package based on how they use its service, or the nearest equivalent to what they currently have.</p><p>But some customers who don't use their landline were put on to a package which gives free evening and weekend calls and costs an additional \u00a34 per month.</p><p>However, there is a tariff which has no additional monthly cost - but instead charges for every landline call a customer makes.\u00a0</p><p>For many households who don't use their landline, this is the perfect option, but they have been automatically dumped on to the more expensive deal.</p><p>BT has also angered customers over the way it charges for its BT Sport channels.</p><p>In May 2013, it heralded free BT Sport - which now offers a mix of Champions League and Premier League football, plus other sports - for those with its broadband packages.</p><p>However, the telecoms giant brought the free deal to an end earlier this year. Instead, it said the service would now cost \u00a35 a month.\u00a0</p><p>But customers had to opt out of the new \u00a35-a-month charge if they wanted to avoid it. This left up to five million facing a steep rise in bills from August.</p><p>Some have complained they weren't clearly told about the change or didn't even realise they'd been charged. Others who did notice the new fee have struggled to cancel BT Sport.</p><p>We spent hours trying to stop our BT Sport payment\u00a0</p><p>Furious Money Mail readers Petula Peel and Roy Hancock spent hours on the phone and writing letters trying to stop the extra monthly payment.</p><p>Petula, from Royston, Hertfordshire, says: 'We've been in dispute about the extra BT Sport from the start, and found the bills very confusing. It was as though BT didn't want us to realise we were paying extra for a sports add-on we don't want.'</p><p>Fed up with poor service, the couple - customers of 40 years' standing - have now joined Sky.</p><p>Another customer, Hugh Froggatt, brands the \u00a35-a-month rise as a stealth charge.</p><p>He says: 'The charge for BT Sport was a service I never asked for, never used and did not realise I had. It will earn BT a tidy windfall from unsuspecting customers.'</p><p>Another reader branded it 'a form of inertia selling I find reprehensible'.</p><p>Extra charges, axed perks and difficulty switching\u00a0</p><p>As well as price hikes, customers are seeing perks axed.</p><p>TalkTalk is removing its speedy payment discount from December 1. Until now, customers who paid by direct debit or within 24 hours of receiving a bill by email have been given 10 per cent off of their bill. The discount was already reduced from 15 per cent last year.</p><p>Those who want to switch to a cheaper deal also face problems. Regulator Ofcom has already told firms they should tell customers when contracts come to an end, so people know when to look for a cheaper deal. At the moment, though, this rarely happens.</p><p>Trying to compare packages between the major providers is also nigh-on impossible. Research by Broadband Choices shows that the total cost of landline and broadband from some of the major providers is up to five times as much as the advertised price.\u00a0</p><p>And if you stay loyal to your provider, you're punished with even higher prices.</p><p>And not all customers can get all services. Virgin cables connect to only 13.6 million homes in the country. Some people can't get Sky because their property can't be fitted with a satellite dish. And even BT does not offer its superfast broadband to all homes across the country.</p><p>Once you've decided what to buy, there can be additional charges for the technology that helps you get your internet and TV service, such as routers and boxes.</p><p>Research by uSwitch has found that those who stick with their provider after their initial deal are paying \u00a3151 a year more than they should.</p><p>Homes hit by the great internet go slow\u00a0</p><p>Once you have broadband, it's likely it will be slower than you had hoped.</p><p>The speed and the amount of internet you can download are crucial to many households these days - particularly those who enjoy video games, and anyone who uses internet television services such as Netflix.</p><p>A survey by consumer association Which? found 90 per cent of consumers rate speed as an important factor when they picked an internet provider.</p><p>Despite this, Which? found that 15.4 million homes don't get the advertised speed. The figures are even worse in peak hours: it is estimated just 15 per cent are able to get the maximum advertised speed.</p><p>Overall, fewer than one-in-three households in towns and cities is capable of getting the maximum speed; in rural areas just 4 per cent of homes are able to.</p><p>Part of the reason for this go-slow is that the wires which provide the internet service aren't capable of delivering the highest speeds.</p><p>To get a top service you need fibre optic cables. But only a fifth of homes in the countryside are connected to these compared with three-quarters of those in urban areas.</p><p>And even where there are fibre optic cables, these often don't run straight to your front door. Many superfast cables run only to the exchange at the end of your road. From there, copper wires - which are much slower - run the signal to your house.</p><p> Many superfast cables run only to the exchange at the end of your road\u00a0 </p><p>If fibre cables are laid right the way to your home, it's possible to get speeds of up to 330 Mb per second - that would mean an HD film could be downloaded in under 20 seconds.\u00a0</p><p>But if you just have copper wires running to your house, the maximum it would be theoretically possible to get is 80 Mb.</p><p>Yet despite providers boasting that they can produce these speeds, Ofcom research shows the typical speed achieved across the country is just 23 Mb.</p><p>Again, even this can be theoretical for homes in built-up areas where lots of households all want to use the internet at the same time.</p><p>So at peak times, typically at weekends and between 8pm and 10pm on weekday evenings, just one in 25 of TalkTalk's customers received the maximum advertised speed of 17 Mb during Which? testing.</p><p>A fifth of its customers achieved an average speed of only 5 Mb - half that of Ofcom's recommended minimum speed.</p><p>Sky, BT and Plusnet customers typically achieved speeds of 10 Mb during the research. And fewer than one in five of their customers managed to get the advertised speed.</p><p>Virgin Media offers a rare glimmer of hope to internet users who want to get the fastest speeds. Research found that 98 per cent of its customers get the advertised speed in off-peak hours, while more than half will get these speeds at peak times.</p><p>So how do the firms get away with advertising speeds which are just not achievable?</p><p>It is because internet providers need only to ensure 10 per cent of their customers can get a certain speed. Hit this target and they can boast that there speeds 'up to' that level.</p><p>The requirement on other sectors are much more onerous. For example, loan and credit card firms cannot advertise a rate unless it is available to at least 51 per cent of applicants.</p><p>Virgin has branded internet advertising rules 'outdated and misleading'.</p><p>Why complaints can be ignored\u00a0</p><p>While prices rise and consumers get frustrated by their plodding broadband speed, complaints are sky-high.</p><p>In June, Ofcom warned telecoms firms to improve service. In particular, it says people still find it too difficult to change provider and cancel contracts.</p><p>Ofcom data shows that some of the biggest firms are generating complaints which are way over the industry average of 16 per 100,000 customers.</p><p>TalkTalk received 27 complaints per 100,000 customers. BT and Plusnet received 22 and 20 complaints respectively. Virgin Media saw just seven complaints, and Sky had the fewest at just five for every 100,000 of its broadband customers.</p><p>But in August the regulator announced it would be investigating Sky over concerns that it was ignoring customers' cancellation requests or making it difficult for them to leave their contract.</p><p>The communications watchdog also introduced a strengthened code of practice on broadband speeds, allowing customers to exit a contract if speeds fall below acceptable levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, many providers say they are limited in how much they can improve their services because BT controls the network which runs all the wires - this is run by a BT-owned company called Openreach.</p><p>Rival internet providers either pay a fee to use Openreach equipment and run their service through that, or install their own equipment in Openreach exchanges and rent a copper line to run to customers' homes.</p><p>Sky is petitioning Ofcom to change this system, arguing that they rely on it to provide a service to customers and it is wrong that they have no control over it.</p><p>BT argues that disrupting the status quo would delay improvements. Meanwhile, as these big firms bicker, service continues to be disrupted for ordinary consumers.</p><p>A Virgin spokesman says: 'Virgin is the only widely available provider to consistently deliver its advertised speeds, let alone exceed them.</p><p>'This is because we have our own fibre-optic broadband network while other providers are reliant on BT's copper cable.'</p><p>A TalkTalk spokesman says: 'TalkTalk is the only provider to offer unlimited broadband as standard on every single package, with no hidden charges or download caps. We provide customers with a speed estimate before they sign a contract with us.'</p><p>A BT spokesman says: 'In common with the rest of the industry, BT's standard line rental has increased since 2008, but that stat only tells part of the story. We're very clear that customers should not rely on headline claims for broadband speeds but use the personal speed quote we give them at the point of sale, which is based on their own line.</p><p>'If they aren't happy with this personalised speed, they can decide not to buy from us. If they are happy with the speed, but find they don't achieve it, we allow them to end their contracts in line with the Ofcom code of practice.'</p><p>A Sky spokesman says: 'Our line rental price remains competitive and we continue to invest in our service. When customers sign up to broadband we estimate the speed they can expect, and they can cancel their broadband if we're unable to deliver a guaranteed minimum.'\u00a0</p><p>The news you need to know about.... listen to the This is Money podcast</p><p>( Or download it on iTunes here )\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-34865306</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HBW-00W1-F021-605V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2190\"/><timeReceived>10:15 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The discount was already reduced from 15 per cent last year.</p><p>Those who want to switch to a cheaper deal also face problems.

Research by Broadband Choices shows that the total cost of landline and broadband from some of the major providers is up to five times as much as the advertised price.

Some people can't get Sky because their property can't be fitted with a satellite dish. And even BT does not offer its superfast broadband to all homes across the country.</p><p>Once you've decided what to buy, there can be additional charges for the technology that helps you get your internet and TV service, such as routers and boxes.</p><p>Research by uSwitch has found that those who stick with their provider after their initial deal are paying \u00a3151 a year more than they should.</p><p>Homes hit by the great go slow\u00a0</p><p>Once you have broadband, it's likely it will be slower than you had hoped.</p><p>The speed and the amount of internet you can download are crucial to many households these days - particularly those who enjoy video games, and anyone who uses internet television services such as Netflix.</p><p>A survey by consumer association Which? found 90 per cent of consumers rate speed as an important factor when they picked an internet provider.</p><p>Despite this, Which? found that 15.4 million homes don't get the advertised speed. The figures are even worse in peak hours: it is estimated just 15 per cent are able to get the maximum advertised speed.</p><p>Overall, fewer than one-in-three households in towns and cities is capable of getting the maximum speed; in rural areas just 4 per cent of homes are able to.</p><p>Part of the reason for this go-slow is that the wires which provide the internet service aren't capable of delivering the highest speeds.</p><p>To get a top service you need fibre optic cables. But only a fifth of homes in the countryside are connected to these compared with three-quarters of those in urban areas.</p><p>And even where there are fibre optic cables, these often don't run straight to your front door. Many superfast cables run only to the exchange at the end of your road. From there, copper wires - which are much slower - run the signal to your house.</p><p>If fibre cables are laid right the way to your home, it's possible to get speeds of up to 330 Mb per second - that would mean an HD film could be downloaded in under 20 seconds.\u00a0</p><p>But if you just have copper wires running to your house, the maximum it would be theoretically possible to get is 80 Mb.</p><p>Yet despite providers boasting that they can produce these speeds, Ofcom research shows the typical speed achieved across the country is just 23 Mb.</p><p>Again, even this can be theoretical for homes in built-up areas where lots of households all want to use the internet at the same time.</p><p>So at peak times, typically at weekends and between 8pm and 10pm on weekday evenings, just one in 25 of TalkTalk's customers received the maximum advertised speed of 17 Mb during Which? testing.</p><p>A fifth of its customers achieved an average speed of only 5 Mb - half that of Ofcom's recommended minimum speed.</p><p>Sky, BT and Plusnet customers typically achieved speeds of 10 Mb during the research. And fewer than one in five of their customers managed to get the advertised speed.</p><p>Virgin Media offers a rare glimmer of hope to internet users who want to get the fastest speeds. Research found that 98 per cent of its customers get the advertised speed in off-peak hours, while more than half will get these speeds at peak times.</p><p>So how do the firms get away with advertising speeds which are just not achievable?</p><p>It is because internet providers need only to ensure 10 per cent of their customers can get a certain speed. Hit this target and they can boast that there speeds 'up to' that level.</p><p>The requirement on other sectors are much more onerous. For example, loan and credit card firms cannot advertise a rate unless it is available to at least 51 per cent of applicants.</p><p>Virgin has branded internet advertising rules 'outdated and misleading'.</p><p>Why complaints can be ignored\u00a0</p><p>While prices rise and consumers get frustrated by their plodding broadband speed, complaints are sky-high.</p><p>In June, Ofcom warned telecoms firms to improve service. In particular, it says people still find it too difficult to change provider and cancel contracts.</p><p>Ofcom data shows that some of the biggest firms are generating complaints which are way over the industry average of 16 per 100,000 customers.</p><p>TalkTalk received 27 complaints per 100,000 customers. BT and Plusnet received 22 and 20 complaints respectively. Virgin Media saw just seven complaints, and Sky had the fewest at just five for every 100,000 of its broadband customers.</p><p>But in August the regulator announced it would be investigating Sky over concerns that it was ignoring customers' cancellation requests or making it difficult for them to leave their contract.</p><p>The communications watchdog also introduced a strengthened code of practice on broadband speeds, allowing customers to exit a contract if speeds fall below acceptable levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, many providers say they are limited in how much they can improve their services because BT controls the network which runs all the wires - this is run by a BT-owned company called Openreach.</p><p>Rival internet providers either pay a fee to use Openreach equipment and run their service through that, or install their own equipment in Openreach exchanges and rent a copper line to run to customers' homes.</p><p>Sky is petitioning Ofcom to change this system, arguing that they rely on it to provide a service to customers and it is wrong that they have no control over it.</p><p>BT argues that disrupting the status quo would delay improvements. Meanwhile, as these big firms bicker, service continues to be disrupted for ordinary consumers.</p><p>A Virgin spokesman says: 'Virgin is the only widely available provider to consistently deliver its advertised speeds, let alone exceed them.</p><p>'This is because we have our own fibre-optic broadband network while other providers are reliant on BT's copper cable.'</p><p>A TalkTalk spokesman says: 'TalkTalk is the only provider to offer unlimited broadband as standard on every single package, with no hidden charges or download caps. We provide customers with a speed estimate before they sign a contract with us.'</p><p>A BT spokesman says: 'In common with the rest of the industry, BT's standard line rental has increased since 2008, but that stat only tells part of the story. We're very clear that customers should not rely on headline claims for broadband speeds but use the personal speed quote we give them at the point of sale, which is based on their own line.</p><p>'If they aren't happy with this personalised speed, they can decide not to buy from us. If they are happy with the speed, but find they don't achieve it, we allow them to end their contracts in line with the Ofcom code of practice.'</p><p>A Sky spokesman says: 'Our line rental price remains competitive and we continue to invest in our service. When customers sign up to broadband we estimate the speed they can expect, and they can cancel their broadband if we're unable to deliver a guaranteed minimum.'\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-34864781</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HBW-00W1-F021-605T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2143\"/><timeReceived>9:53 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Many modern families use mobile phones rather than a landline, and so don't want the latter.</p><p>But they're over a barrel because they can't have a broadband service from the major providers without paying for landline. This allows the telecoms firms to artificially lower the price of their internet deals - while sneakily hiking landline prices.</p><p>Virgin Media, however, does allow customers to have its cable-based TV and internet service without paying for a landline.</p><p>Some 31 of the price changes were by Sky.</p><p>BT had 17, with seven of these increases to its line rental.\u00a0</p><p>Virgin Media made 29 price changes, and TalkTalk 13.</p><p>In total, it equates to one price rise every 16 days.</p><p>In four years, Sky's line rental has leapt from \u00a311.25 a month to \u00a317.40 - a rise of 54 per cent.</p><p>BT's has jumped from \u00a313.60 to \u00a317.99, Virgin's from \u00a311.99 to \u00a316.99, and TalkTalk's from \u00a314.95 to \u00a317.70.</p><p>Frequently, an individual firm has increased its charges twice inside six months.</p><p>The tricks used to bump up bills\u00a0</p><p>But it's not just the hike in costs that annoy customers, it's the tricks firms use.

From there, copper wires - which are much slower - run the signal to your house.</p><p> Many superfast cables run only to the exchange at the end of your road\u00a0 </p><p>If fibre cables are laid right the way to your home, it's possible to get speeds of up to 330 Mb per second - that would mean an HD film could be downloaded in under 20 seconds.\u00a0</p><p>But if you just have copper wires running to your house, the maximum it would be theoretically possible to get is 80 Mb.</p><p>Yet despite providers boasting that they can produce these speeds, Ofcom research shows the typical speed achieved across the country is just 23 Mb.</p><p>Again, even this can be theoretical for homes in built-up areas where lots of households all want to use the internet at the same time.</p><p>So at peak times, typically at weekends and between 8pm and 10pm on weekday evenings, just one in 25 of TalkTalk's customers received the maximum advertised speed of 17 Mb during Which? testing.</p><p>A fifth of its customers achieved an average speed of only 5 Mb - half that of Ofcom's recommended minimum speed.</p><p>Sky, BT and Plusnet customers typically achieved speeds of 10 Mb during the research. And fewer than one in five of their customers managed to get the advertised speed.</p><p>Virgin Media offers a rare glimmer of hope to internet users who want to get the fastest speeds. Research found that 98 per cent of its customers get the advertised speed in off-peak hours, while more than half will get these speeds at peak times.</p><p>So how do the firms get away with advertising speeds which are just not achievable?</p><p>It is because internet providers need only to ensure 10 per cent of their customers can get a certain speed. Hit this target and they can boast that there speeds 'up to' that level.</p><p>The requirement on other sectors are much more onerous. For example, loan and credit card firms cannot advertise a rate unless it is available to at least 51 per cent of applicants.</p><p>Virgin has branded internet advertising rules 'outdated and misleading'.</p><p>Why complaints can be ignored\u00a0</p><p>While prices rise and consumers get frustrated by their plodding broadband speed, complaints are sky-high.</p><p>In June, Ofcom warned telecoms firms to improve service. In particular, it says people still find it too difficult to change provider and cancel contracts.</p><p>Ofcom data shows that some of the biggest firms are generating complaints which are way over the industry average of 16 per 100,000 customers.</p><p>TalkTalk received 27 complaints per 100,000 customers. BT and Plusnet received 22 and 20 complaints respectively. Virgin Media saw just seven complaints, and Sky had the fewest at just five for every 100,000 of its broadband customers.</p><p>But in August the regulator announced it would be investigating Sky over concerns that it was ignoring customers' cancellation requests or making it difficult for them to leave their contract.</p><p>The communications watchdog also introduced a strengthened code of practice on broadband speeds, allowing customers to exit a contract if speeds fall below acceptable levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, many providers say they are limited in how much they can improve their services because BT controls the network which runs all the wires - this is run by a BT-owned company called Openreach.</p><p>Rival internet providers either pay a fee to use Openreach equipment and run their service through that, or install their own equipment in Openreach exchanges and rent a copper line to run to customers' homes.</p><p>Sky is petitioning Ofcom to change this system, arguing that they rely on it to provide a service to customers and it is wrong that they have no control over it.</p><p>BT argues that disrupting the status quo would delay improvements. Meanwhile, as these big firms bicker, service continues to be disrupted for ordinary consumers.</p><p>A Virgin spokesman says: 'Virgin is the only widely available provider to consistently deliver its advertised speeds, let alone exceed them.</p><p>'This is because we have our own fibre-optic broadband network while other providers are reliant on BT's copper cable.'</p><p>A TalkTalk spokesman says: 'TalkTalk is the only provider to offer unlimited broadband as standard on every single package, with no hidden charges or download caps. We provide customers with a speed estimate before they sign a contract with us.'</p><p>A BT spokesman says: 'In common with the rest of the industry, BT's standard line rental has increased since 2008, but that stat only tells part of the story. We're very clear that customers should not rely on headline claims for broadband speeds but use the personal speed quote we give them at the point of sale, which is based on their own line.</p><p>'If they aren't happy with this personalised speed, they can decide not to buy from us. If they are happy with the speed, but find they don't achieve it, we allow them to end their contracts in line with the Ofcom code of practice.'</p><p>A Sky spokesman says: 'Our line rental price remains competitive and we continue to invest in our service. When customers sign up to broadband we estimate the speed they can expect, and they can cancel their broadband if we're unable to deliver a guaranteed minimum.'\u00a0</p><p>The news you need to know about.... listen to the This is Money podcast</p><p>( Or download it on iTunes here )\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-34964202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HC9-XB91-JCJY-G2R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2190\"/><timeReceived>2:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

He is the head of healthcare investing and is the president of private equity for the firm. Matt, I am delighted to be speaking with you. Given your wealth of knowledge, passion, and investments in the space, we will be talking today about private equity (PE) investments in healthcare and where it goes from here. What attracted you to healthcare investing over the last 18 years? And what has kept you excited?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt Holt:</emphasis> I joined New Mountain Capital 18 years ago in 2001, about a year into the founding of the firm. I joined Steve Klinsky and we really began our effort to evaluate sectors for proactive analysis. Healthcare really jumped out at us in the very early days for a number of reasons.</p><p>We were interested in the scale of the industry, the regulated nature of the industry, and as a result of that, the corresponding complexity. And further, the dynamic nature of the industry including the ultimate penetration of technology, we felt that it would open up a lot of investment opportunities. And that if we studied the large complexities of the market, that we could develop competitive advantages over time, which we've now been working on for 18 years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> And by \"healthcare,\" do you define it broadly as services and life sciences with the whole ecosystem, in terms of your investment portfolio?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> From a scope standpoint, we look across provider markets, payer markets, [and] life sciences markets. There's a lot of convergence across themes. And we've invested across all of those categories over our history.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> If you look at trends, private equity continues to play an increasing role in the healthcare industry. If you think about investor interest and from an investor point of view, what makes it an interesting market to play in?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> First off, it's very large. Healthcare has a lot of different pockets. It represents, over 18 percent of US GDP. Two of the major trends in the investment world and in the business world at large are impact investing-being responsible from a social, environmental, and governance standpoint.</p><p>In addition to that, technology investing. You know, healthcare really represents a market where both of those major trends are converging and having a very big impact on the industry and its evolution. And it's creating a lot of opportunity to invest with those two tailwinds really behind our investors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Those are important tailwinds on a macro basis. Let's convert this from trends to impact. What do you think has been the tangible impact of just private market investing and PE investment in the space? Are there a few examples you could share to illustrate?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> Two key themes that we're very focused on relate to really investing in businesses that can deploy technology to reduce inefficiencies and thereby cost. But at the same time, improve quality. The second big trend that we're very focused on [is] a tectonic shift in the overall ecosystem which we call the \"shift to value.\"</p><p>Alternative payment models-the way that hospitals get paid-are obvious examples of the shift to value. But there's a lot of other ways of playing this shift, including for example in the pharmaceutical industry, we're seeing pharmaceutical companies trying to over time evolve their own business models to be on the right side of outcomes.</p><p>And we have a couple of examples of investments that are really playing at the forefront of this. One would be a business called Cytel, which is a leader in data analytics and in particular data management around optimization of research and development. That's a business that takes data from its customers, does a lot of number crunching [and] really help[s] to drive productivity of R&amp;D spend for pharmaceutical customers. And there's a lot of underlying regulatory trends that are opening up that market opportunity for Cytel.</p><p>Another example would be our investment in Signify Health which is leveraging technology in and around scheduling in logistics to drive efficiencies as they deploy doctors and clinicians into the homes of members on behalf of health plans and in particular Medicare Advantage.</p><p>It's really an example of taking a technology that we're all using every day with our iPhones via food delivery apps and transportation apps [and] applying that underlying architecture to the healthcare market but focusing on work flow and bringing those same efficiencies into the enterprise market at scale.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Those are very interesting examples. When you think about the ownership model of private ownership and private markets more broadly is there a tangible impact from this structure and the ownership model? Or is it just more about the strategy and the thesis around the investment? Do you see the model helping?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> The ownership model is an enabling factor with respect to driving results. So, one of the key things that we've been focused on in the healthcare investing effort here is really driving technology and innovation into the work flows [and] into the service offerings of our businesses.</p><p>A private ownership structure has allowed us to execute on that playbook faster than the typical public company ownership model, just to pick an alternative. We can make investments on the basis of long-term return on investment characteristics.</p><p>We can make significant investments in the P&amp;Ls of our businesses to enable faster digital transformations to execute faster on the underlying opportunities as we see them. And we think the private ownership model has [an] additional advantage. There's a talent and recruitment advantage that we have. By bringing world-class leadership into the businesses that we're backing has been really important to drive results. The private model allows us and gives us an advantage when it comes to talent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> What are some markers of success and pre-conditions that you look for during the thesis phase or the diligence phase?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> We've made 12 investments in what we call health-tech platforms to date. And all of them really map into one underlying investment framework which I describe as having three pillars. Number one, investing in a model where we can bring technology to bear to reduce administration cost and make the system more efficient.</p><p>That's pillar number one that we always look for.</p><p>Pillar number two, we want to make sure that we're investing in businesses that are enabling the underlying shift to value. We want to be on the right side of the change with respect to the alignment of incentives. That's a critical pillar number two.</p><p>And then number three, as we execute on number one and apply technology and apply digital process in automation, over time, we create a lot of data. And that's really central to investment pillar number three [as] we end up building significant data assets. And those assets can drive exponential value creation at exit if we get it right.</p><p>That's really the framework that we've used. And we've applied that to payer services, to provider services, [and] to life sciences services, all of which are converging. And that's generally how we look at the market.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> That's technology on the front, align[ing] against [the] shift to value. And then I presume by data you also mean intellectual property and content that you create beyond just the underlying data sets?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> That's exactly right. But the data sets themselves have a lot of value, not only to other businesses that we're building but to partners that we can find over time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Given the expanding role of private equity in the healthcare space, as you said on the payer-provider services, life sciences side, what are the implications and interactions that you have with what we would call strategics-large incumbent players who are in the business? How [do] you see that playing out?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> Well, one of the things that we're doing at the front lines is driving innovation and building models. I call it the building out the tip of the spear with respect to leveraging technology to drive productivity [to] create new innovation models.</p><p>We are very open to partnering with strategics along the way. We can drive a lot of value into the larger strategic platforms which doesn't need to only happen when we sell a business. Along the way, we've been very successful [at not only] securing investments but also strategic commercial partnerships with larger players who can guide us as to our own roadmaps and participate in the value creation as a partner. And that's been a model we've continued to hone as investors. And it's been paying some early dividends for us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> [Do] you view this more as a partnership and collaboration approach relative to competing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> Yeah, absolutely. And I'll give you an example. We're building a business called CIOX where we work across the ecosystem bringing technology to optimize the movement in medical records around the industry. We work with the largest providers in the country, the largest health plans in the country.</p><p>And we were building a lot of data and information that had a great application in the pharmaceutical industry. So, we were approached by a number of pharmaceutical companies, one of which made an investment in our business, who really helped us understand the value of the data and the services in their work flow [and] in their environment.</p><p>It allows us to close the loop with respect to building out an innovation pathway that we can execute against. That's been a successful model that we're looking to replicate across other investments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Great. So, what is your view on the impact of analytics and digital beyond technology, on the marketplace?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> I think that it's a tremendous opportunity. The healthcare industry broadly is wildly inefficient. And if you just look at the embedded administration cost in business processes, very basic business processes like the billing function you have huge, huge costs, a lot of manual labor, [and] a lot of paper-based documentation.</p><p>And we're still really 20 years behind at best. If you look at the way businesses transacted in the space, between providers, across providers, between [payers] and providers as well as all of the medical device and pharmaceutical companies. A lot of what we're doing is bringing standard basic technology that has been used in for example the financial services end market for 15, 20 years.</p><p>We're bringing that into the healthcare business process. And the beauty of it is we don't really need to invent bleeding-edge technology. We're really bringing technology and modern business process from other industries into the healthcare market. And there's many years to go.</p><p>There's tremendous opportunity if we can take out the inefficiencies. And we're really still at the stage of basic building blocks in terms of converting manual to digital [and] driving automation. We're still really in the very early days. And over time we believe the healthcare industry will follow the same roadmap of other industries which means that there are likely decades of opportunity ahead of us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> The term \"ecosystems\" has been thrown around and discussed quite extensively over the last year or two. What's your view on the impact of ecosystems in healthcare and the value they can create?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> You know, my view here and this is playing out on our investment strategy, the ecosystem approach is fundamental to really cracking the code on the major business problems in the US healthcare system. We have a system that is immense. It's hugely complex.</p><p>If you look at the ecommerce or the media [or] technology markets, you've seen a model of innovation adoption where you've effectively had a winner-take-all market play out. Where early stage venture capitalists have funded infinitely scalable IT-enabled models.</p><p>You've literally had one or two players run the table on everybody else. As we look at the innovation patterns and the industry patterns within healthcare, that's not what's happening. The barriers to commercial adoption are significant. And we're talking about very, very large and complex problems.</p><p>These are problems that are best solved through working with each other. And as a result of that that's how we invest.</p><p>There's a model that Athena Health has put forth which was very successful for many years. They started a program called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">More Disruption Please</emphasis> where they invited other innovators to come into their ecosystem and really partner. That's a model that we think could be replicated at scale. And we're looking at ways of doing that across the categories of industries that we're messing in.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> [In terms of] the \"winner takes all\" model that has disrupted other markets-ecommerce, retail, or technology for sure-do you think that it's a softer version of that where the collaboration is much more intense than that structure?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> Collaboration is the only way that we're going to solve some of the major issues and we're going to break the system which is what's needed here. Payers have to work with providers. You're going to see convergence.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies need to work with providers and payers. And all of the service providers, technology, and products, as well as service companies, they need to be able to work with each other. It's such a large segmented market, that collaboration has really been a faster path to growth versus going it alone or maintaining closed systems. From a technology standpoint, open system architecture is a much better model for the US healthcare system versus one company trying to do everything for everybody.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> That makes sense. What is your view on platforms in healthcare then? We said we probably won't have a single platform option [like in] retail or in technology in terms of the scale or for at least single platform for a particular use case. But what's your view on platforms as they evolve?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> The way we think about platforms, we're starting with operations-facing technology and working to create a better mousetrap that solves an inefficiency at the operational level. And that's really the core advantage of any of our given platforms.</p><p>It may be data processing and data mining in our Equian business which we apply across claims feeds which can work for health insurance companies or employers or anybody processing a payment. We have a Signify business, which I mentioned earlier, where we've taken the scheduling and logistics technology platform delivering last mile services into the home.</p><p>And we become more efficient there driving more productivity. That's a platform that can be applied to the health plan market. But it can equally apply to the provider market. If providers are looking to deploy clinicians in the home, particularly as they take on more risk.</p><p>Lastly, that model as a platform could also apply to the pharmaceutical market. The way we think about platforms is the platform gets built at the operations-facing technology layer. But then [it is] our job to map the advantage of that platform [which] brings us into the range of commercial markets as they're changing. That's how we think about the concept of a platform.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Basically, these platforms will link together to form part of the ecosystem in terms of building blocks and imports?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> That's exactly right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> So, another big topic discussion both on the commercial side and on the regulatory and legislative side is interoperability. What is your view [on] both the potential impact on your assets and potential impact on the future?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> Interoperability is a big theme. It's been a pain point in the healthcare industry since 1985. So, this is an old idea. We've been betting on interoperability. And we've been investing in businesses that are really trying to enable interoperability.</p><p>We have a set of companies that are working in different parts of the market. Ultimately there's a massive data opportunity in the US healthcare space. We've seen the value of data in the consumer markets. We've seen the value in data in the large enterprise markets outside of healthcare.</p><p>We know it exists. It may be the single largest economic opportunity in the US economy. Interoperability is the skeleton key to unlock that value. So, we have a set of businesses that are working toward this. This is not an easy problem and requires government intervention.</p><p>And we have had discussions with the government and tried to give them the private-market perspective, because ultimately the private market will also play a role here. So, it's something that we're focused on and we think can represent a significant value unlock across the whole ecosystem.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> This could look like financial services and how they manage data and infrastructure and platforms [etc.], information services types of businesses and how they've improved effectiveness, [and] efficiency. Do you think it could look like that in ten, 20 years?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> I think that the financial services market and the way that data is used and managed is a great example. I would also point out the media and marketing industry or the retail industry. There's tremendous amount of data that we're all generating in what we call the digital trail. But what's not included in the data that's mapped into all of us as US consumers is our health data, which may actually be the most valuable data of all.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Do you think it could get even more valuable or better than the other segments just given the centrality of this?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> It could ultimately enable a bigger market opportunity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> How do you see the evolving role of big tech?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> I think that big tech has been a really interesting market to watch. We've been tracking the large US technology companies for over a decade. Now recently, we've seen activity from major players-Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft all have significant efforts now. And each of them [is] pursuing the market in a very different way.</p><p>We're starting to see a real change in the openness of the traditional players to deploy technology under their environments. One of the main reasons in my view that this is playing out is that if we look at the gap of the consumer experience via technology outside of healthcare and you look at the experience of consumers being able to tap their financial information with the click of a button on their telephone. Versus today, entering the US healthcare system, there's no information. It's a less than ideal consumer experience. I think the consumers are tired of it. And the new external players are seeing this as a business opportunity.</p><p>I think they're here to stay this time. I think the traction will take longer than a lot of people expect. But it will ultimately come. And I think it's a good thing ultimately for the system.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> I think it goes without saying, but ecosystems, platforms, and interoperability are massive tailwinds for multi-sector players to enter. Because they know how to do those three things really well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> The rules are different in the healthcare market. I believe that each of these large tech players will need to partner with each other and with the players in the system to really crack the code.</p><p>My strong view is that of the large US tech players, the ones that approach the market as an ecosystem, that they're willing to participate in, [be] an enabler of, will ultimately be successful. The ones that take a closed-system approach and try to do everything and bully the traditional players around will be shut out of the system and will achieve little to no traction.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> In the event of an economic downturn, can you talk about some of the traits that you'd look for in new investments?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> As a general matter, we're looking for investments whose performance is really independent of the business industrial cycle. That said, there are discrete cycles in the markets that we're looking for and watching.</p><p>The economy does impact the healthcare industry with respect to who the payer is, what can companies or individuals afford, [and] what can the government afford. So, we're watching that very carefully. As a general matter, we're looking for businesses that can take cost out of the system and make the system more efficient which should be a successful model in all economic cycles.</p><p>But the other thing I'd point out is there's another cycle that we need to be aware of which is the regulatory cycle. You know, there are industries that grow. And then we see a pattern of the regulations catching up. And that's something that we watch.</p><p>Regulation can be a good thing. And it is a good thing in the US healthcare system. But there's also areas where industry-when there's big changes playing out-can get ahead of itself. And then there tends to be a period of catch up. And we're all constantly watching those regulatory cycles as well as economic cycles.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> How do you see the interplay between the various actors, payers, providers, services, from PBMs [pharmacy benefit managers] and life sciences? How do you see that playing out?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> I think we're seeing a massive convergence of a lot of these categories. Providers are becoming payers by taking on risk. Payers are becoming providers by taking on clinicians and taking on the enablement of direct care.</p><p>So, you're seeing unparalleled convergence across categories. The other market that is really converging is the pharmaceutical market. I happen to think that convergence is a big theme that we're looking for. It's a big investment opportunity.</p><p>We're building, for example, businesses that serve and build infrastructure for the health plans. A lot of that same infrastructure generates data and information that's valuable in the pharmaceutical ecosystem. And as a private equity investor, as a private company owner, we can enable that convergence by bringing on corporate partners [and] strategic partners with this ecosystem approach. So ultimately the convergence presents investment opportunities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Thank you so much for your time today, Matt.

He is the head of healthcare investing and co-leads private equity for the firm. Matt, I am delighted to be speaking with you. Given your wealth of knowledge, passion, and investments in the space, we will be talking today about private equity (PE) investments in healthcare and where it goes from here. What attracted you to healthcare investing over the last 18 years? And what has kept you excited?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt Holt:</emphasis> I joined New Mountain Capital 18 years ago in 2001, about a year into the founding of the firm. I joined Steve Klinsky and we really began our effort to evaluate sectors for proactive analysis. Healthcare really jumped out at us in the very early days for a number of reasons.</p><p>We were interested in the scale of the industry, the regulated nature of the industry, and as a result of that, the corresponding complexity. And further, the dynamic nature of the industry including the ultimate penetration of technology, we felt that it would open up a lot of investment opportunities. And that if we studied the large complexities of the market, that we could develop competitive advantages over time, which we've now been working on for 18 years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> And by \"healthcare,\" do you define it broadly as services and life sciences with the whole ecosystem, in terms of your investment portfolio?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> From a scope standpoint, we look across provider markets, payer markets, [and] life sciences markets. There's a lot of convergence across themes. And we've invested across all of those categories over our history.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> If you look at trends, private equity continues to play an increasing role in the healthcare industry. If you think about investor interest and from an investor point of view, what makes it an interesting market to play in?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> First off, it's very large. Healthcare has a lot of different pockets. It represents, over 18 percent of US GDP. Two of the major trends in the investment world and in the business world at large are impact investing-being responsible from a social, environmental, and governance standpoint.</p><p>In addition to that, technology investing. You know, healthcare really represents a market where both of those major trends are converging and having a very big impact on the industry and its evolution. And it's creating a lot of opportunity to invest with those two tailwinds really behind our investors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Those are important tailwinds on a macro basis. Let's convert this from trends to impact. What do you think has been the tangible impact of just private market investing and PE investment in the space? Are there a few examples you could share to illustrate?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> Two key themes that we're very focused on relate to really investing in businesses that can deploy technology to reduce inefficiencies and thereby cost. But at the same time, improve quality. The second big trend that we're very focused on [is] a tectonic shift in the overall ecosystem which we call the \"shift to value.\"</p><p>Alternative payment models-the way that hospitals get paid-are obvious examples of the shift to value. But there's a lot of other ways of playing this shift, including for example in the pharmaceutical industry, we're seeing pharmaceutical companies trying to over time evolve their own business models to be on the right side of outcomes.</p><p>And we have a couple of examples of investments that are really playing at the forefront of this. One would be a business called Cytel, which is a leader in data analytics and in particular data management around optimization of research and development. That's a business that takes data from its customers, does a lot of number crunching [and] really help[s] to drive productivity of R&amp;D spend for pharmaceutical customers. And there's a lot of underlying regulatory trends that are opening up that market opportunity for Cytel.</p><p>Another example would be our investment in Signify Health which is leveraging technology in and around scheduling in logistics to drive efficiencies as they deploy doctors and clinicians into the homes of members on behalf of health plans and in particular Medicare Advantage.</p><p>It's really an example of taking a technology that we're all using every day with our iPhones via food delivery apps and transportation apps [and] applying that underlying architecture to the healthcare market but focusing on work flow and bringing those same efficiencies into the enterprise market at scale.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Those are very interesting examples. When you think about the ownership model of private ownership and private markets more broadly is there a tangible impact from this structure and the ownership model? Or is it just more about the strategy and the thesis around the investment? Do you see the model helping?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> The ownership model is an enabling factor with respect to driving results. So, one of the key things that we've been focused on in the healthcare investing effort here is really driving technology and innovation into the work flows [and] into the service offerings of our businesses.</p><p>A private ownership structure has allowed us to execute on that playbook faster than the typical public company ownership model, just to pick an alternative. We can make investments on the basis of long-term return on investment characteristics.</p><p>We can make significant investments in the P&amp;Ls of our businesses to enable faster digital transformations to execute faster on the underlying opportunities as we see them. And we think the private ownership model has [an] additional advantage. There's a talent and recruitment advantage that we have. By bringing world-class leadership into the businesses that we're backing has been really important to drive results. The private model allows us and gives us an advantage when it comes to talent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> What are some markers of success and pre-conditions that you look for during the thesis phase or the diligence phase?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> We've made 12 investments in what we call health-tech platforms to date. And all of them really map into one underlying investment framework which I describe as having three pillars. Number one, investing in a model where we can bring technology to bear to reduce administration cost and make the system more efficient.</p><p>That's pillar number one that we always look for.</p><p>Pillar number two, we want to make sure that we're investing in businesses that are enabling the underlying shift to value. We want to be on the right side of the change with respect to the alignment of incentives. That's a critical pillar number two.</p><p>And then number three, as we execute on number one and apply technology and apply digital process in automation, over time, we create a lot of data. And that's really central to investment pillar number three [as] we end up building significant data assets. And those assets can drive exponential value creation at exit if we get it right.</p><p>That's really the framework that we've used. And we've applied that to payer services, to provider services, [and] to life sciences services, all of which are converging. And that's generally how we look at the market.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> That's technology on the front, align[ing] against [the] shift to value. And then I presume by data you also mean intellectual property and content that you create beyond just the underlying data sets?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> That's exactly right. But the data sets themselves have a lot of value, not only to other businesses that we're building but to partners that we can find over time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Given the expanding role of private equity in the healthcare space, as you said on the payer-provider services, life sciences side, what are the implications and interactions that you have with what we would call strategics-large incumbent players who are in the business? How [do] you see that playing out?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> Well, one of the things that we're doing at the front lines is driving innovation and building models. I call it the building out the tip of the spear with respect to leveraging technology to drive productivity [to] create new innovation models.</p><p>We are very open to partnering with strategics along the way. We can drive a lot of value into the larger strategic platforms which doesn't need to only happen when we sell a business. Along the way, we've been very successful [at not only] securing investments but also strategic commercial partnerships with larger players who can guide us as to our own roadmaps and participate in the value creation as a partner. And that's been a model we've continued to hone as investors. And it's been paying some early dividends for us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> [Do] you view this more as a partnership and collaboration approach relative to competing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> Yeah, absolutely. And I'll give you an example. We're building a business called CIOX where we work across the ecosystem bringing technology to optimize the movement in medical records around the industry. We work with the largest providers in the country, the largest health plans in the country.</p><p>And we were building a lot of data and information that had a great application in the pharmaceutical industry. So, we were approached by a number of pharmaceutical companies, one of which made an investment in our business, who really helped us understand the value of the data and the services in their work flow [and] in their environment.</p><p>It allows us to close the loop with respect to building out an innovation pathway that we can execute against. That's been a successful model that we're looking to replicate across other investments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Great. So, what is your view on the impact of analytics and digital beyond technology, on the marketplace?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> I think that it's a tremendous opportunity. The healthcare industry broadly is wildly inefficient. And if you just look at the embedded administration cost in business processes, very basic business processes like the billing function you have huge, huge costs, a lot of manual labor, [and] a lot of paper-based documentation.</p><p>And we're still really 20 years behind at best. If you look at the way businesses transacted in the space, between providers, across providers, between [payers] and providers as well as all of the medical device and pharmaceutical companies. A lot of what we're doing is bringing standard basic technology that has been used in for example the financial services end market for 15, 20 years.</p><p>We're bringing that into the healthcare business process. And the beauty of it is we don't really need to invent bleeding-edge technology. We're really bringing technology and modern business process from other industries into the healthcare market. And there's many years to go.</p><p>There's tremendous opportunity if we can take out the inefficiencies. And we're really still at the stage of basic building blocks in terms of converting manual to digital [and] driving automation. We're still really in the very early days. And over time we believe the healthcare industry will follow the same roadmap of other industries which means that there are likely decades of opportunity ahead of us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> The term \"ecosystems\" has been thrown around and discussed quite extensively over the last year or two. What's your view on the impact of ecosystems in healthcare and the value they can create?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> You know, my view here and this is playing out on our investment strategy, the ecosystem approach is fundamental to really cracking the code on the major business problems in the US healthcare system. We have a system that is immense. It's hugely complex.</p><p>If you look at the ecommerce or the media [or] technology markets, you've seen a model of innovation adoption where you've effectively had a winner-take-all market play out. Where early stage venture capitalists have funded infinitely scalable IT-enabled models.</p><p>You've literally had one or two players run the table on everybody else. As we look at the innovation patterns and the industry patterns within healthcare, that's not what's happening. The barriers to commercial adoption are significant. And we're talking about very, very large and complex problems.</p><p>These are problems that are best solved through working with each other. And as a result of that that's how we invest.</p><p>There's a model that Athena Health has put forth which was very successful for many years. They started a program called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">More Disruption Please</emphasis> where they invited other innovators to come into their ecosystem and really partner. That's a model that we think could be replicated at scale. And we're looking at ways of doing that across the categories of industries that we're messing in.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> [In terms of] the \"winner takes all\" model that has disrupted other markets-ecommerce, retail, or technology for sure-do you think that it's a softer version of that where the collaboration is much more intense than that structure?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> Collaboration is the only way that we're going to solve some of the major issues and we're going to break the system which is what's needed here. Payers have to work with providers. You're going to see convergence.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies need to work with providers and payers. And all of the service providers, technology, and products, as well as service companies, they need to be able to work with each other. It's such a large segmented market, that collaboration has really been a faster path to growth versus going it alone or maintaining closed systems. From a technology standpoint, open system architecture is a much better model for the US healthcare system versus one company trying to do everything for everybody.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> That makes sense. What is your view on platforms in healthcare then? We said we probably won't have a single platform option [like in] retail or in technology in terms of the scale or for at least single platform for a particular use case. But what's your view on platforms as they evolve?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> The way we think about platforms, we're starting with operations-facing technology and working to create a better mousetrap that solves an inefficiency at the operational level. And that's really the core advantage of any of our given platforms.</p><p>It may be data processing and data mining in our Equian business which we apply across claims feeds which can work for health insurance companies or employers or anybody processing a payment. We have a Signify business, which I mentioned earlier, where we've taken the scheduling and logistics technology platform delivering last mile services into the home.</p><p>And we become more efficient there driving more productivity. That's a platform that can be applied to the health plan market. But it can equally apply to the provider market. If providers are looking to deploy clinicians in the home, particularly as they take on more risk.</p><p>Lastly, that model as a platform could also apply to the pharmaceutical market. The way we think about platforms is the platform gets built at the operations-facing technology layer. But then [it is] our job to map the advantage of that platform [which] brings us into the range of commercial markets as they're changing. That's how we think about the concept of a platform.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Basically, these platforms will link together to form part of the ecosystem in terms of building blocks and imports?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> That's exactly right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> So, another big topic discussion both on the commercial side and on the regulatory and legislative side is interoperability. What is your view [on] both the potential impact on your assets and potential impact on the future?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> Interoperability is a big theme. It's been a pain point in the healthcare industry since 1985. So, this is an old idea. We've been betting on interoperability. And we've been investing in businesses that are really trying to enable interoperability.</p><p>We have a set of companies that are working in different parts of the market. Ultimately there's a massive data opportunity in the US healthcare space. We've seen the value of data in the consumer markets. We've seen the value in data in the large enterprise markets outside of healthcare.</p><p>We know it exists. It may be the single largest economic opportunity in the US economy. Interoperability is the skeleton key to unlock that value. So, we have a set of businesses that are working toward this. This is not an easy problem and requires government intervention.</p><p>And we have had discussions with the government and tried to give them the private-market perspective, because ultimately the private market will also play a role here. So, it's something that we're focused on and we think can represent a significant value unlock across the whole ecosystem.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> This could look like financial services and how they manage data and infrastructure and platforms [etc.], information services types of businesses and how they've improved effectiveness, [and] efficiency. Do you think it could look like that in ten, 20 years?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> I think that the financial services market and the way that data is used and managed is a great example. I would also point out the media and marketing industry or the retail industry. There's tremendous amount of data that we're all generating in what we call the digital trail. But what's not included in the data that's mapped into all of us as US consumers is our health data, which may actually be the most valuable data of all.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Do you think it could get even more valuable or better than the other segments just given the centrality of this?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> It could ultimately enable a bigger market opportunity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> How do you see the evolving role of big tech?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> I think that big tech has been a really interesting market to watch. We've been tracking the large US technology companies for over a decade. Now recently, we've seen activity from major players-Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft all have significant efforts now. And each of them [is] pursuing the market in a very different way.</p><p>We're starting to see a real change in the openness of the traditional players to deploy technology under their environments. One of the main reasons in my view that this is playing out is that if we look at the gap of the consumer experience via technology outside of healthcare and you look at the experience of consumers being able to tap their financial information with the click of a button on their telephone. Versus today, entering the US healthcare system, there's no information. It's a less than ideal consumer experience. I think the consumers are tired of it. And the new external players are seeing this as a business opportunity.</p><p>I think they're here to stay this time. I think the traction will take longer than a lot of people expect. But it will ultimately come. And I think it's a good thing ultimately for the system.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> I think it goes without saying, but ecosystems, platforms, and interoperability are massive tailwinds for multi-sector players to enter. Because they know how to do those three things really well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> The rules are different in the healthcare market. I believe that each of these large tech players will need to partner with each other and with the players in the system to really crack the code.</p><p>My strong view is that of the large US tech players, the ones that approach the market as an ecosystem, that they're willing to participate in, [be] an enabler of, will ultimately be successful. The ones that take a closed-system approach and try to do everything and bully the traditional players around will be shut out of the system and will achieve little to no traction.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> In the event of an economic downturn, can you talk about some of the traits that you'd look for in new investments?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> As a general matter, we're looking for investments whose performance is really independent of the business industrial cycle. That said, there are discrete cycles in the markets that we're looking for and watching.</p><p>The economy does impact the healthcare industry with respect to who the payer is, what can companies or individuals afford, [and] what can the government afford. So, we're watching that very carefully. As a general matter, we're looking for businesses that can take cost out of the system and make the system more efficient which should be a successful model in all economic cycles.</p><p>But the other thing I'd point out is there's another cycle that we need to be aware of which is the regulatory cycle. You know, there are industries that grow. And then we see a pattern of the regulations catching up. And that's something that we watch.</p><p>Regulation can be a good thing. And it is a good thing in the US healthcare system. But there's also areas where industry-when there's big changes playing out-can get ahead of itself. And then there tends to be a period of catch up. And we're all constantly watching those regulatory cycles as well as economic cycles.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> How do you see the interplay between the various actors, payers, providers, services, from PBMs [pharmacy benefit managers] and life sciences? How do you see that playing out?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt:</emphasis> I think we're seeing a massive convergence of a lot of these categories. Providers are becoming payers by taking on risk. Payers are becoming providers by taking on clinicians and taking on the enablement of direct care.</p><p>So, you're seeing unparalleled convergence across categories. The other market that is really converging is the pharmaceutical market. I happen to think that convergence is a big theme that we're looking for. It's a big investment opportunity.</p><p>We're building, for example, businesses that serve and build infrastructure for the health plans. A lot of that same infrastructure generates data and information that's valuable in the pharmaceutical ecosystem. And as a private equity investor, as a private company owner, we can enable that convergence by bringing on corporate partners [and] strategic partners with this ecosystem approach. So ultimately the convergence presents investment opportunities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prashanth:</emphasis> Thank you so much for your time today, Matt.

These are massive businesses that have cultivated brand loyalty and have vast resources to potentially throw at a new venture should they choose to branch into wealth management.</p><p>The answer is in cultivating the existing relationships wealth managers have with asset owners to transform their existing client relationships into true brand loyalty. By expanding their offerings to integrate digital experiences with the human touch, wealth managers have an opportunity to foster stronger bonds with their clients and grow brand loyalty at the same time.</p><p>With (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/29/preparing-for-the-30-trillion-great-wealth-transfer.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/29/preparing-for-the-30-trillion-great-wealth-transfer.html</url>) $30 trillion of assets  in the U.S. alone set to pass from baby boomers to their children in the next few decades, wealth managers must take significant action to hold the attention of investors while money is on the move. In particular, the younger generation is an audience accustomed to having their lives run by apps and digital services, from Instagram to Uber.</p><p>How can the sector advance and innovate to ensure it is not drowned out by the presence of big technology firms? The answer lies in going hybrid 6 combining digital and traditional.</p><p>D-day for digital</p><p>Digital has quickly become the watch-word in finance, particularly in retail banking, evidenced by the proliferation of chatbots and money transfer apps, just to name two relevant technologies. FinTech innovation in these areas has been spurred by regulation. Europe's Revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2) and the push for open banking has forced banks to create open APIs and to innovate in payments. This has paved the way for new entrants into the market to offer different products to the end-consumer.</p><p>The tide of regulation has just begun to truly impact wealth management in a similar way. As MiFID II and GDPR force wealth managers to adapt to new data requirements in Europe, opportunities are made available by the introduction of new savings schemes like the Lifetime ISA (LISA) in the UK.</p><p>As consumer expectations shift, with investors expecting more digital and on-demand engagement, wealth managers have been slow to innovate. This is largely due to their reliance on legacy IT systems that require significant amounts of their budget to be dedicated to maintenance rather than innovation.</p><p>The rise of robo-advisors in the past decade has proven to be another salvo that further forces the sector towards technology innovation. By automating the investment management process, these digital startups have targeted the growing mass affluent sector. This ensures they can operate at larger scale and offer a quality experience at a lower price point than traditional players.</p><p>This has not only squeezed investment managers, but forced them to re-think strategies. While it is true that the current approval ratings for pure robo advice amongst the HWNI segment hovers around (<url normalizedValue=\"http://citywire.co.uk/wealth-manager/news/why-don-t-high-net-worth-investors-trust-robo-advice/a1051358\">http://citywire.co.uk/wealth-manager/news/why-don-t-high-net-worth-investors-trust-robo-advice/a1051358</url>) 12 percent , it's worth remembering it's still in its infancy. As it becomes proven, more HNWIs 6 particularly younger generations 6 will potentially flock towards it.</p><p>The human touch</p><p>This is where investment managers can combine the latest technology with their own unique selling point 6 human expertise.</p><p>While investment managers might be put off by the perceived popularity of large technology companies, the incumbents actually have the advantage. Investment managers have decades of experience behind their advice. This is something that the big four technology firms do not have, and wouldn't be able develop without considerable acquisitions.</p><p>But as the travel and grocery industries will submit, this does not guarantee success against such a threat. Services need to suit the needs of the customer today and tomorrow. By using the existing personal relationships they have built and incorporating a digital experience that furthers their brand and investment ethos, wealth managers can create a moat around their existing business. This future-proofs the business, allowing managers to focus on growing the customer relationship and the client base.</p><p>Hybrid means that the client experience is intuitive, involved and individual. Reports shouldn't just be sent as PDF attachments 6 they should be digitally interactive and personalized to the client. A hybrid approach provides a digital experience that a client can access at any time, from any place and on any device. The experience must be designed to speak to the specific client's persona and feel truly individualized.</p><p>Reality check</p><p>So, does the fact that more than half of HNWIs state that they'd prefer GAFA over their existing wealth managers provide such an existential threat to the industry? Yes and no.</p><p>No, because none of the GAFA companies have expressed any interest in offering such services. To date, they have shown their interest is in gaining investment rather than investing themselves. It may well be the robo-advisors who would suffer the most 6 with automated investing more likely to be targeted at the mass affluent rather than primarily focused on HNWIs.</p><p>But at the same time, it shows the threat and opportunity digital services represent to investment management. HNWIs are clearly open to the idea of receiving investing services from technology pioneers.</p><p>Digital is the new standard operating procedure for investors. Firms that invest now will future-proof their businesses against the new competition and potentially open new revenue streams by offering new products and gaining exposure to new markets.</p><p>Going hybrid will give the wealth management industry more tools to attract the next generation of investors, while improving the experience for current clients. It empowers them to engage more with their wealth and improving transparency.</p><p>In today's world, digital is no longer optional 6 it is now a necessity to ensure investment management's future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-517622791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 517622791</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R49-6DX1-DYTM-92S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1115\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 IBT Media, formerly dba International Business Times</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times - US ed.</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 12, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Consumer Behavior</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>News, opinion and commentary</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Consumer behavior</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>High technology industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Investment management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Investments</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Planning</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology application</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Strategy &amp;

When considered against a backdrop of\u00a0only just over a third of HNWIs[2]\u00a0saying they would recommend their current investment manager, the report can be viewed as \"doom and gloom\" for the investment management sector.

Photo: Newsweek Media Group       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.structureconf.com\">https://www.structureconf.com</url>/ One may initially wonder, how can the industry plan to compete against the likes of Google, Amazon, Facebook or Apple (GAFA)?</p><p> These are massive businesses that have cultivated brand loyalty and have vast resources to potentially throw at a new venture should they choose to branch into wealth management. The answer is in cultivating the existing relationships wealth managers have with asset owners to transform their existing client relationships into true brand loyalty. By expanding their offerings to integrate digital experiences with the human touch, wealth managers have an opportunity to foster stronger bonds with their clients and grow brand loyalty at the same time. With\u00a0$30tn of assets[3]\u00a0in the US alone set to pass from baby boomers to their children in the next few decades, wealth managers must take significant action to hold the attention of investors while money is on the move. In particular, the younger generation is an audience accustomed to having their lives run by apps and digital services, from Instagram to Uber. How can the sector advance and innovate to ensure it is not drowned out by the presence of big technology firms? The answer lies in going hybrid - combining digital and traditional.D-day for digitalDigital has quickly become the watch-word in finance, particularly in retail banking, evidenced by the proliferation of chatbots and money transfer apps, just to name two relevant technologies. FinTech innovation in these areas has been spurred by regulation. Europe's Revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2) and the push for open banking has forced banks to create open APIs and to innovate in payments. This has paved the way for new entrants into the market to offer different products to the end-consumer. The tide of regulation has just begun to truly impact wealth management in a similar way. As MiFID II and GDPR force wealth managers to adapt to new data requirements in Europe, opportunities are made available by the introduction of new savings schemes like the Lifetime ISA (LISA) in the UK. As consumer expectations shift, with investors expecting more digital and on-demand engagement, wealth managers have been slow to innovate. This is largely due to their reliance on legacy IT systems that require significant amounts of their budget to be dedicated to maintenance rather than innovation. The rise of robo-advisors in the past decade has proven to be another salvo that further forces the sector towards technology innovation. By automating the investment management process, these digital startups have targeted the growing mass affluent sector. This ensures they can operate at larger scale and offer a quality experience at a lower price point than traditional players. This has not only squeezed investment managers, but forced them to re-think strategies. While it is true that the current approval ratings for pure robo advice amongst the HWNI segment hovers around\u00a012%[4], it's worth remembering it's still in its infancy. As it becomes proven, more HNWIs - particularly younger generations - will potentially flock towards it.The human touchThis is where investment managers can combine the latest technology with their own unique selling point - human expertise. While investment managers might be put off by the perceived popularity of large technology companies, the incumbents actually have the advantage. Investment managers have decades of experience behind their advice. This is something that the big four technology firms do not have, and wouldn't be able develop without considerable acquisitions. But as the travel and grocery industries will submit, this does not guarantee success against such a threat. Services need to suit the needs of the customer today and tomorrow. By using the existing personal relationships they have built and incorporating a digital experience that furthers their brand and investment ethos, wealth managers can create a moat around their existing business. This future-proofs the business, allowing managers to focus on growing the customer relationship and the client base. Hybrid means that the client experience is intuitive, involved and individual. Reports shouldn't just be sent as PDF attachments - they should be digitally interactive and personalized to the client. A hybrid approach provides a digital experience that a client can access at any time, from any place and on any device. The experience must be designed to speak to the specific client's persona and feel truly individualized.Reality checkSo, does the fact that more than half of HNWIs state that they'd prefer GAFA over their existing wealth managers provide such an existential threat to the industry? Yes and no. No, because none of the GAFA companies have expressed any interest in offering such services. To date, they have shown their interest is in gaining investment rather than investing themselves. It may well be the robo-advisors who would suffer the most - with automated investing more likely to be targeted at the mass affluent rather than primarily focused on HNWIs. But at the same time, it shows the threat and opportunity digital services represent to investment management. HNWIs are clearly open to the idea of receiving investing services from technology pioneers. Digital is the new standard operating procedure for investors. Firms that invest now will future-proof their businesses against the new competition and potentially open new revenue streams by offering new products and gaining exposure to new markets. Going hybrid will give the wealth management industry more tools to attract the next generation of investors, while improving the experience for current clients. It empowers them to engage more with their wealth and improving transparency. In today's world, digital is no longer optional - it is now a necessity to ensure investment management's future.

Most of them have worked in the sector, or related sectors, before. They tend to be more sophisticated than your standard IT start-up,\u201d said Conlon. </p><p>Fintech start-ups tend to come to Leman Solicitors and say: \u2018We think that this will trigger regulation, can we look at it, how much will it cost?\u2019 and so on. Leman then asks them to detail, in an executive summary, what they do and take it from there. </p><p>Banks are hot-housing fintech start-ups, said Conlon, noting that a major attraction is developing new services without interfering with the continuity of existing systems. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve acted for the banks since 1998 on payment projects. What you have to appreciate is that the banks are behemoths and have, for many years, built really secure systems. Most of the banks in Ireland are sitting on legacy systems: they have a big engine that is really powerful, but smoke is coming off it. They\u2019re not nimble and their systems need to be up all the time, so they\u2019re afraid to make changes.\u201d </p><p>There is also an instinctive desire to be in control. Senior executives may not want to outsource core business functions, but most IT experts, both internal and external, feel fintech can\u2019t be done in-house. </p><p>\u201cQuite a lot of these companies are hoping to work with the financial institutions.

Case in point: One-third of the smart TVs sold in the world today contain an essential piece of technology made by Tel Aviv start-up Giraffic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"As of this year, both Samsung and LG are using our Adaptive Video Acceleration (AVA) technology to ensure flawless playback of streaming content on their Internet-connected televisions,\" said Giraffic co-founder and CEO Yoel Zanger. \"Right now we are the industry standard for client-side video acceleration and stabilization technology. It's pretty cool.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The folks at the world's biggest smart TV makers certainly think so. Televisions today are very much commodity items, manufactured in China and other Far East lands and sold at small mark-ups; even TVs that are sold as \"high definition\" (HD) can be had for barely $200 \u2013 far less than the price Samsung and LG, among others, seek to sell their top-of-the-line TVs for.</p><p>Giraffic's technology, said Zanger, makes it possible for television makers to distinguish themselves from among the pack by offering superior video display and content streaming uninterrupted by network glitches and slowdowns.</p><p>\"Not only do we offer a buffer- and interruption-free video experience for streamed content, we do it at the highest video quality level available commercially. If the standard for TV display today is full HD (high-definition) of 1080p, our system allows for flawless playback at 4K. And we do it without requiring anyone to install any software or device anywhere along the network \u2013 all the quality control is done inside the television itself, using our software. Technologically, it's a pretty unique accomplishment.\"</p><p>With the world's biggest tech event, CES, set to begin next week, Giraffic is expanding its offering beyond TVs \u2013 with a system that will allow for uninterrupted streaming on smartphones and tablets, even of live streaming content.</p><p>\"4K is not an issue on phones, because most devices can't display it yet, but uninterrupted streaming is a huge deal for consumers and content providers alike. Our new system for devices promises to put an end to the problem of pausing during content streaming,\" said Zanger.</p><p>Video tech for streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime movies, HD digital broadcasts, and other Internet-connected content services is becoming a crucial selling point for high-end televisions. With HD sets now the standard and cheaper than ever, why should a consumer shell out $600 and upwards for a \"good\" TV? What makes a television set \"good\" anyway?</p><p>Part of the answer is a device's feature set. For televisions, the ability to connect to the Internet and stream content is an important distinguishing feature. But you can do that on a computer or a tablet, too; what sets apart high-quality TVs is their high-quality display, allowing users to see content in crystal-clear, high resolution video.</p><p>The top level video display available commercially today is 4K, referring to the 4,000 pixels density of a display, nearly four times more dense than full HD's 1080p (the more pixels, the more \"intense\" the image). The difference in quality is immediately noticeable to anyone \u2013 which is why 4K display TVs are the fastest-growing segment of the quality television market.</p><p>Visual shows how Giraffic's technology wotks (Courtesy)</p><p>4K enables viewers to watch broadcast channels via cable or satellite in state-of-the-art quality. But as more consumers \"cut the cord,\" relying on streaming services for their TV fix, the issue of streaming content quality becomes much more important \u2013 and much more difficult to achieve.</p><p>Streaming video is usually compressed, meaning that it almost never shows up on displays, whether it be a phone, tablet, or TV, in full quality; and even that lower-quality video often freezes, forcing viewers to wait long seconds until the buffer frees up and the show proceeds.</p><p>That's not going to be good enough to get consumers to part with the kind of money Samsung, LG, and other high-end TV makers want for their systems \u2013 and in order to solve the pregnant pause problem, TV and device makers, as well as content providers, have been working overtime. It's become a sort of holy grail in the video business: How can we deliver the highest quality video, uncompressed, without streaming interruptions?</p><p>A plethora of solutions have been suggested, developed, and tried \u2013 all to no avail, viewers of online content can attest, as streaming content pauses as often as ever. But for owners of Samsung and LG smart TVs with Giraffic's AVA built in, it's a problem that's been solved, said Zanger.</p><p>\"We don't use compression/decompression, network regulation, or any of the other tricks that have been tried to solve this. Instead we have an embedded software solution that sits on a chip inside a smart TV that does real-time analytics to determine the ideal way to download and display content, so there are no interruptions. And, our analytics make sure that the video is displayed at the highest resolution available \u2013 so content that is broadcast in 4K ends up being displayed in 4K on TVs capable of that.\"</p><p>Yoel Zanger (Courtesy)</p><p>Giraffic's secret: Recalibrating video content downloading to match the criteria of the HTTP protocol.</p><p>\"One of the reasons content providers and deliverers get into trouble is that they end up 'choking' the download pipe by trying to send too much data at once,\" said Zanger.</p><p>\"As long as we are streaming video via HTTP, a protocol that is designed not for video but for text, that choking is always going to be an issue. Our system breaks down the content into much smaller chunks, making it easier for the video data to flow through \u2013 and then we reassemble it on the TV itself.\"</p><p>While others have tried this model before, said Zanger, they didn't have Giraffic's advanced algorithms and analytics \u2013 \"so if they were able to enhance throughput by 20% or 30%, independent tests show that we enhance it by 200%.\"</p><p>What works for TVs will work for devices as well, and at CES, Giraffic plans to peddle its no-interruption streaming solution to companies in the device business.</p><p>\"We have already been speaking to some giants in the industry, and they have expressed strong interest in this technology,\" said Zanger \u2013 who would not confirm that one of those giants was Samsung, which, after all, makes not only TVs, but phones and tablets as well.</p><p>\"It certainly sounds logical, but you have to remember that Samsung is a huge conglomerate, and the TV and phone divisions really act as separate companies, so the fact that the TV people are enthusiastic about what we are doing does not automatically mean that the phone people will be.\"</p><p>But given the issues plaguing streaming on devices, chances are that some \u2013 if not many \u2013 device makers will be interested in what Giraffic is offering.</p><p>Based in the Tel Aviv Port area, Giraffic is privately held (obviously at revenue stage; the company gets a cut of every smart TV sold that uses its tech), and has grown by hundreds of percent over the last two years, when it pivoted from a networking technology firm to the streaming video business.</p><p>A technology like this sounds like just the thing for a big tech firm like Samsung or others to acquire outright, and while Zanger won't rule out the possibility \u2013 \"if someone offers us a billion dollars I'm not sure I won't say yes,\" he said \u2013 the plan is to continue on its current path, bringing the message of AVA to more manufacturers. In 2015, about 120 million 4K-capable smart TVs were sold worldwide, with Giraffic's solution on about 30 million of them. But sales for these TVs are expected to rise dramatically in the coming few years \u2013 and within less than a decade, 4k will be the standard, much as 1080p is now, with the high-end TVs displaying 8K and beyond.</p><p>\"We're ready for that market too,\" said Zanger.</p><p>\"It's pretty clear that client-side tech like this is not only the best solution to high-quality streaming content, but the only practical solution,\" added Zanger. I can tell you that there is not a major device maker that is not trying to nail this down, and we've seen some imitators trying to duplicate what we are doing. But I think it's like that old saying \u2013 tell me who your friends are, and I'll tell you about who you are. The fact that the likes of Samsung and LG are working with us tells you about who we are, as well.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/87/145161631563.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/87/145161631563.jpg</url></p><p>A Samsung Smart TV (Photo credit: Courtesy)<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/48/145161631575.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/48/145161631575.jpg</url></p><p>Visual shows how Giraffic's technology wotks (Courtesy)<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/58/145161631585.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/58/145161631585.jpg</url></p><p>Yoel Zanger (Courtesy)<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIMISR-63737582</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIMISR2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HRP-MHR1-JDJN-64BY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428572</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1463\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Times of Israel.

Bangnitou, which translates to \"help you invest,\" applies algorithms that automatically reallocate investment portfolios. The minimum investment is 800 yuan ($118).

Now that service forms the backbone of Ant Group, a financial behemoth that could be worth more than $200 billion.  How China's Ant Group built a $17 trillion payments machine Named after a bug because of its founder's belief that \"small is beautiful, small is powerful,\" Ant Group is anything but tiny in China. It's gearing up for a highly anticipated public offering in Hong Kong and Shanghai that could mark the second time Ma sets a record for the biggest IPO ever. \"Ant Group really is the crown jewel of Jack Ma and ... of China's internet industry,\" said Edith Yeung, general partner at Race Capital. It is one of the biggest technology firms in the world and the biggest online payments platform in China. The app has established its presence in every aspect of financial life in China, from investment accounts and micro savings products to insurance, credit scores and even dating profiles. But it all started out as a side project to plug a hole in China's nascent online shopping industry. Back in 2004, very few people had debit or credit cards, and buyers and sellers using Ali's () e-commerce platform needed a reliable way to handle payments. Ma tasked Ali's finance team to create Alipay. The service would act as a trusted third party, holding money from buyers in escrow and only releasing it to sellers after the goods had been received and buyers confirmed they were happy with what they got. \"When I started [Alipay], everyone said: 'Jack, this is the most stupid model we've ever seen, nobody will use it,'\" Ma said in a 2014 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" \"I said I don't care if this model is scientific, whether it's fancy-looking, or not. As long as it works, it helps [to] build up the trust,\" he said. Money supermarket And work it did. Today, Alipay has 711 million monthly active users, and it handled 118 trillion yuan ($17.2 trillion) in payments in the 12 months through June, Ant Group reported in regulatory filings. The Alipay mobile app, which debuted in 2009, accounted for more than 55% of China's mobile payments market in the first three months of this year, while rival Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat Pay and QQ wallet accounted for about 40%, according to market research firm eMarketer. The app also connects millions of people to a ton of financial services. Alipay users can browse and select insurance products, pay bills, get loans, pay staff and invest in money markets. Yeung compares it to \"a financial supermarket.\" \"Anything you want to do in financial markets\" you can do through Alipay, she said. Alipay was spun off from Ali into a separate entity in 2011, and became part of Ant Group in 2014. Ma, who took Ali public in 2014 in a world record IPO, retains overall control of Ant, according to regulatory filings. Ant now offers so many financial services and products that it \"has become part of the everyday life of hundreds of millions of individuals and businesses across China,\" said Zennon Kapron, founder of financial technology consulting and research firm Kapronasia. \"It's very difficult to overstate the impact the company has had on Chinese individuals,\" he added. Alipay users can use the app to order food, apply for credit, invest in money markets and more. One of the most popular services is Yu'e Bao, a wealth management product launched in 2013 that allows users to invest money left over in their digital wallets. The minimum amount to invest is just 1 yuan (15 cents). Within six months, Yu'e Bao \u2014 which means \"leftover treasure\" \u2014 had 49 million users and deposits of 250 billion yuan ($36.5 billion), according to state-run newspaper China Daily. At the time, most wealth management products offered by traditional banks required minimum investments of 50,000 yuan ($7,300), according to the newspaper. It lauded Yu'e Bao as \"an instant hit, especially among young people whose driblet savings are largely ignored by banks.\" At its peak in March 2018, Yu'e Bao's assets under management topped 1.69 trillion yuan (about $267 billion at the time), according to Fitch Ratings. Chinese regulators have subsequently forced Yu'e Bao to shed assets over concerns about systemic risk \u2014 if the massive fund failed for some reason, it could wreak havoc on China's economy. But it remains China's largest money market fund with 1.26 trillion yuan ($184 billion) as of March this year, according to Fitch Ratings. The Alipay and Ant ecosystem has allowed many individuals and small merchants \"to borrow money, accept payments online, to really provide economic empowerment for themselves, for their workers and their families,\" said Kapron. Huge trove of data With hundreds of millions of people tapping into its financial products, Ant has access to incredibly valuable data on Chinese consumer behavior. Unlike the United States, China doesn't have a reliable credit scoring system. In 2015, Ant launched Sesame Credit to fill the gap. The company describes Sesame Credit as a \"trust score,\" a way for businesses and consumers to assess people's willingness and ability to pay for goods or book services. It is the country's largest credit rating system, according to Yeung, of Race Capital. But it is used for much more than just getting preferential loan rates. \"I actually have seen the Sesame score used for online dating. You can actually choose for your credit score to be displayed in your dating profile,\" said Yeung. Sesame scores are also shared on Chinese social media platforms by people who want to show off their purchasing power. An example of the digital finance services available in the Alipay app. People with low scores can find themselves locked out of services and prevented from buying stuff. In 2015, Chinese courts starting sharing with Ant lists containing the names of people who had failed to pay off debts. A couple of years later, Chinese state news agency Xinhua commended Ant for using the data to punish 1.2 million debt defaulters by lowering their Sesame scores and restricting certain purchases using Alipay. The moves encouraged 126,000 of the defaulters to repay debts, according to Xinhua. Social shaming aside, Chinese internet users are growing increasingly uncomfortable with how much data is being hoovered up by big tech firms, and they are keeping an eye on what Ant is accessing. In 2018, the company apologized for misleading Alipay users in an effort to expand Sesame Credit's user base. Ant had launched a new service which allowed users to look up how often they had used Alipay over the last year. But the landing page of the report had a box that was checked by default, which meant people were agreeing to use Sesame Credit's services, according to Xinhua. Users were upset that they were automatically giving Sesame license to harvest their data and share the analysis with partner institutions. Ant apologized and changed the default option to an unchecked box. Going all in on tech Earlier this year, the firm changed its name from Ant Financial to Ant Group because it is \"reinventing itself\" as a provider of tech services to other financial companies, according Sunny Tian, a researcher with market research firm R3. In the past, Ant offered loans, investments, or insurance products directly to consumers and companies. In recent years, however, Ant has turned itself into a platform that charges banks and insurers fees to connect them with potential customers, Tian wrote in a report this month. Ant's lending platform, for example, offers a \"three-one-zero\" service \u2014 three minutes to apply, one second to get a credit decision, and zero people involved in the decision \u2014 but the loan is syndicated out to a mainstream bank. The debt sits on the bank's books, with Ant taking a fee, according to Tian. \"This moves Ant off the path of becoming a replacement to mainstream finance companies, enabling it to return to its roots as a less capital-intensive technology business,\" she said. Ant has also launched Bangnitou, an AI-powered investment advisory service through a joint venture with Vanguard. Bangnitou, which translates to \"help you invest,\" applies algorithms that automatically reallocate investment portfolios. The minimum investment is 800 yuan ($118). In a little over three months after its April launch, Bangnitou had attracted approximately 200,000 new customers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Now that service forms the backbone of Ant Group, a financial behemoth that could be worth more than $200 billion.    Named after a bug because of its founder's belief that \"small is beautiful, small is powerful,\" Ant Group is anything but tiny in China. It's gearing up for a highly anticipated public offering in Hong Kong and Shanghai that could mark the second time Ma sets a record for the biggest IPO ever.    \"Ant Group really is the crown jewel of Jack Ma and ... of China's internet industry,\" said Edith Yeung, general partner at Race Capital.    It is one of the biggest technology firms in the world and the biggest online payments platform in China. The app has established its presence in every aspect of financial life in China, from investment accounts and micro savings products to insurance, credit scores and even dating profiles.    But it all started out as a side project to plug a hole in China's nascent online shopping industry. Back in 2004, very few people had debit or credit cards, and buyers and sellers using Alibaba's (BABA) e-commerce platform needed a reliable way to handle payments.    Ma tasked Alibaba's finance team to create Alipay. The service would act as a trusted third party, holding money from buyers in escrow and only releasing it to sellers after the goods had been received and buyers confirmed they were happy with what they got.    \"When I started [Alipay], everyone said: 'Jack, this is the most stupid model we've ever seen, nobody will use it,'\" Ma said in a 2014 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\"    \"I said I don't care if this model is scientific, whether it's fancy-looking, or not. As long as it works, it helps [to] build up the trust,\" he said.    And work it did. Today, Alipay has 711 million monthly active users, and it handled 118 trillion yuan ($17.2 trillion) in payments in the 12 months through June, Ant Group reported in regulatory filings. The Alipay mobile app, which debuted in 2009, accounted for more than 55% of China's mobile payments market in the first three months of this year, while rival Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat Pay and QQ wallet accounted for about 40%, according to market research firm eMarketer.    The app also connects millions of people to a ton of financial services. Alipay users can browse and select insurance products, pay bills, get loans, pay staff and invest in money markets.    Yeung compares it to \"a financial supermarket.\"    \"Anything you want to do in financial markets\" you can do through Alipay, she said.    Alipay was spun off from Alibaba into a separate entity in 2011, and became part of Ant Group in 2014. Ma, who took Alibaba public in 2014 in a world record IPO, retains overall control of Ant, according to regulatory filings.    Ant now offers so many financial services and products that it \"has become part of the everyday life of hundreds of millions of individuals and businesses across China,\" said Zennon Kapron, founder of financial technology consulting and research firm Kapronasia.    \"It's very difficult to overstate the impact the company has had on Chinese individuals,\" he added.    One of the most popular services is Yu'e Bao, a wealth management product launched in 2013 that allows users to invest money left over in their digital wallets. The minimum amount to invest is just 1 yuan (15 cents).    Within six months, Yu'e Bao \u2014 which means \"leftover treasure\" \u2014 had 49 million users and deposits of 250 billion yuan ($36.5 billion), according to state-run newspaper China Daily.    At the time, most wealth management products offered by traditional banks required minimum investments of 50,000 yuan ($7,300), according to the newspaper. It lauded Yu'e Bao as \"an instant hit, especially among young people whose driblet savings are largely ignored by banks.\"    At its peak in March 2018, Yu'e Bao's assets under management topped 1.69 trillion yuan (about $267 billion at the time), according to Fitch Ratings. Chinese regulators have subsequently forced Yu'e Bao to shed assets over concerns about systemic risk \u2014 if the massive fund failed for some reason, it could wreak havoc on China's economy. But it remains China's largest money market fund with 1.26 trillion yuan ($184 billion) as of March this year, according to Fitch Ratings.    The Alipay and Ant ecosystem has allowed many individuals and small merchants \"to borrow money, accept payments online, to really provide economic empowerment for themselves, for their workers and their families,\" said Kapron.    With hundreds of millions of people tapping into its financial products, Ant has access to incredibly valuable data on Chinese consumer behavior.    Unlike the United States, China doesn't have a reliable credit scoring system. In 2015, Ant launched Sesame Credit to fill the gap. The company describes Sesame Credit as a \"trust score,\" a way for businesses and consumers to assess people's willingness and ability to pay for goods or book services. It is the country's largest credit rating system, according to Yeung, of Race Capital.    But it is used for much more than just getting preferential loan rates. \"I actually have seen the Sesame score used for online dating. You can actually choose for your credit score to be displayed in your dating profile,\" said Yeung.    Sesame scores are also shared on Chinese social media platforms by people who want to show off their purchasing power.    People with low scores can find themselves locked out of services and prevented from buying stuff. In 2015, Chinese courts starting sharing with Ant lists containing the names of people who had failed to pay off debts. A couple of years later, Chinese state news agency Xinhua commended Ant for using the data to punish 1.2 million debt defaulters by lowering their Sesame scores and restricting certain purchases using Alipay. The moves encouraged 126,000 of the defaulters to repay debts, according to Xinhua.    Social shaming aside, Chinese internet users are growing increasingly uncomfortable with how much data is being hoovered up by big tech firms, and they are keeping an eye on what Ant is accessing.    In 2018, the company apologized for misleading Alipay users in an effort to expand Sesame Credit's user base.    Ant had launched a new service which allowed users to look up how often they had used Alipay over the last year. But the landing page of the report had a box that was checked by default, which meant people were agreeing to use Sesame Credit's services, according to Xinhua. Users were upset that they were automatically giving Sesame license to harvest their data and share the analysis with partner institutions. Ant apologized and changed the default option to an unchecked box.    Earlier this year, the firm changed its name from Ant Financial to Ant Group because it is \"reinventing itself\" as a provider of tech services to other financial companies, according Sunny Tian, a researcher with market research firm R3.    In the past, Ant offered loans, investments, or insurance products directly to consumers and companies. In recent years, however, Ant has turned itself into a platform that charges banks and insurers fees to connect them with potential customers, Tian wrote in a report this month.    Ant's lending platform, for example, offers a \"three-one-zero\" service \u2014 three minutes to apply, one second to get a credit decision, and zero people involved in the decision \u2014 but the loan is syndicated out to a mainstream bank. The debt sits on the bank's books, with Ant taking a fee, according to Tian.    \"This moves Ant off the path of becoming a replacement to mainstream finance companies, enabling it to return to its roots as a less capital-intensive technology business,\" she said.    Ant has also launched Bangnitou, an AI-powered investment advisory service through a joint venture with Vanguard. Bangnitou, which translates to \"help you invest,\" applies algorithms that automatically reallocate investment portfolios. The minimum investment is 800 yuan ($118). In a little over three months after its April launch, Bangnitou had attracted approximately 200,000 new customers.

How China's An...</p><p>When Jack Ma launched an obscure payment service to boost his online shopping empire 16 years ago, few expected it to succeed. Now that service forms the backbone of Ant Group, a financial behemoth that could be worth more than $200 billion.  How China's Ant Group built a $17 trillion payments machine How Jack Ma built China's money supermarket into a $200 billion company Named after a bug because of its founder's belief that \"small is beautiful, small is powerful,\" Ant Group is anything but tiny in China. It's gearing up for a highly anticipated public offering in Hong Kong and Shanghai that could mark the second time Ma sets a record for the biggest IPO ever. \"Ant Group really is the crown jewel of Jack Ma and ... of China's internet industry,\" said Edith Yeung, general partner at Race Capital. It is one of the biggest technology firms in the world and the biggest online payments platform in China. The app has established its presence in every aspect of financial life in China, from investment accounts and micro savings products to insurance, credit scores and even dating profiles. But it all started out as a side project to plug a hole in China's nascent online shopping industry. Back in 2004, very few people had debit or credit cards, and buyers and sellers using Ali's () e-commerce platform needed a reliable way to handle payments. Ma tasked Ali's finance team to create Alipay. The service would act as a trusted third party, holding money from buyers in escrow and only releasing it to sellers after the goods had been received and buyers confirmed they were happy with what they got. \"When I started [Alipay], everyone said: 'Jack, this is the most stupid model we've ever seen, nobody will use it,'\" Ma said in a 2014 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" \"I said I don't care if this model is scientific, whether it's fancy-looking, or not. As long as it works, it helps [to] build up the trust,\" he said. Money supermarket And work it did. Today, Alipay has 711 million monthly active users, and it handled 118 trillion yuan ($17.2 trillion) in payments in the 12 months through June, Ant Group reported in regulatory filings. The Alipay mobile app, which debuted in 2009, accounted for more than 55% of China's mobile payments market in the first three months of this year, while rival Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat Pay and QQ wallet accounted for about 40%, according to market research firm eMarketer. The app also connects millions of people to a ton of financial services. Alipay users can browse and select insurance products, pay bills, get loans, pay staff and invest in money markets. Yeung compares it to \"a financial supermarket.\" \"Anything you want to do in financial markets\" you can do through Alipay, she said. Alipay was spun off from Ali into a separate entity in 2011, and became part of Ant Group in 2014. Ma, who took Ali public in 2014 in a world record IPO, retains overall control of Ant, according to regulatory filings. Ant now offers so many financial services and products that it \"has become part of the everyday life of hundreds of millions of individuals and businesses across China,\" said Zennon Kapron, founder of financial technology consulting and research firm Kapronasia. \"It's very difficult to overstate the impact the company has had on Chinese individuals,\" he added. Alipay users can use the app to order food, apply for credit, invest in money markets and more. One of the most popular services is Yu'e Bao, a wealth management product launched in 2013 that allows users to invest money left over in their digital wallets. The minimum amount to invest is just 1 yuan (15 cents). Within six months, Yu'e Bao \u2014 which means \"leftover treasure\" \u2014 had 49 million users and deposits of 250 billion yuan ($36.5 billion), according to state-run newspaper China Daily. At the time, most wealth management products offered by traditional banks required minimum investments of 50,000 yuan ($7,300), according to the newspaper. It lauded Yu'e Bao as \"an instant hit, especially among young people whose driblet savings are largely ignored by banks.\" At its peak in March 2018, Yu'e Bao's assets under management topped 1.69 trillion yuan (about $267 billion at the time), according to Fitch Ratings. Chinese regulators have subsequently forced Yu'e Bao to shed assets over concerns about systemic risk \u2014 if the massive fund failed for some reason, it could wreak havoc on China's economy. But it remains China's largest money market fund with 1.26 trillion yuan ($184 billion) as of March this year, according to Fitch Ratings. The Alipay and Ant ecosystem has allowed many individuals and small merchants \"to borrow money, accept payments online, to really provide economic empowerment for themselves, for their workers and their families,\" said Kapron. Huge trove of data With hundreds of millions of people tapping into its financial products, Ant has access to incredibly valuable data on Chinese consumer behavior. Unlike the United States, China doesn't have a reliable credit scoring system. In 2015, Ant launched Sesame Credit to fill the gap. The company describes Sesame Credit as a \"trust score,\" a way for businesses and consumers to assess people's willingness and ability to pay for goods or book services. It is the country's largest credit rating system, according to Yeung, of Race Capital. But it is used for much more than just getting preferential loan rates. \"I actually have seen the Sesame score used for online dating. You can actually choose for your credit score to be displayed in your dating profile,\" said Yeung. Sesame scores are also shared on Chinese social media platforms by people who want to show off their purchasing power. An example of the digital finance services available in the Alipay app. People with low scores can find themselves locked out of services and prevented from buying stuff. In 2015, Chinese courts starting sharing with Ant lists containing the names of people who had failed to pay off debts. A couple of years later, Chinese state news agency Xinhua commended Ant for using the data to punish 1.2 million debt defaulters by lowering their Sesame scores and restricting certain purchases using Alipay. The moves encouraged 126,000 of the defaulters to repay debts, according to Xinhua. Social shaming aside, Chinese internet users are growing increasingly uncomfortable with how much data is being hoovered up by big tech firms, and they are keeping an eye on what Ant is accessing. In 2018, the company apologized for misleading Alipay users in an effort to expand Sesame Credit's user base. Ant had launched a new service which allowed users to look up how often they had used Alipay over the last year. But the landing page of the report had a box that was checked by default, which meant people were agreeing to use Sesame Credit's services, according to Xinhua. Users were upset that they were automatically giving Sesame license to harvest their data and share the analysis with partner institutions. Ant apologized and changed the default option to an unchecked box. Going all in on tech Earlier this year, the firm changed its name from Ant Financial to Ant Group because it is \"reinventing itself\" as a provider of tech services to other financial companies, according Sunny Tian, a researcher with market research firm R3. In the past, Ant offered loans, investments, or insurance products directly to consumers and companies. In recent years, however, Ant has turned itself into a platform that charges banks and insurers fees to connect them with potential customers, Tian wrote in a report this month. Ant's lending platform, for example, offers a \"three-one-zero\" service \u2014 three minutes to apply, one second to get a credit decision, and zero people involved in the decision \u2014 but the loan is syndicated out to a mainstream bank. The debt sits on the bank's books, with Ant taking a fee, according to Tian. \"This moves Ant off the path of becoming a replacement to mainstream finance companies, enabling it to return to its roots as a less capital-intensive technology business,\" she said. Ant has also launched Bangnitou, an AI-powered investment advisory service through a joint venture with Vanguard. Bangnitou, which translates to \"help you invest,\" applies algorithms that automatically reallocate investment portfolios. The minimum investment is 800 yuan ($118). In a little over three months after its April launch, Bangnitou had attracted approximately 200,000 new customers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43169437795</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XN-R781-JCSC-J50F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1462\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 26, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Naturally Splendid Enterprises Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Naturally Splendid Enterprises Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Naturally Splendid Enterprises Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Naturally Splendid Enterprises Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Naturally Splendid Enterprises Ltd</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>50N</className><className>FRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>50N</className><className>MUN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>50N</className><className>STU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NSPDF</className><className>PINX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NSP</className><className>TSX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Consumer Credit Scores</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0I5NUVFOTY5RTRCNDNGMkFEMTE0NjZEN0YxN0UzQjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI5M0E4NDRFRTc0NDQ2N0JGODJGNkQyMUZBQjgyMDg</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Money Market Pricing</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDFENUFENTlCOUZDNDg0OEFEMjg4MTJFOEVDMDNDQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjhBODUyMzhBNzc4NDZDNEE4RjRCRUQ2QzJDMDg2QjM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

She hasn't been shy about her targets either \u2014 calling out Amazon, Facebook and Google by name and even threatening to undo past acquisitions like Facebook's 2012 purchase of Instagram. A similar story is now playing out in the U.K., following the release of a white paper[3] that calls for tech giants to exercise a 'duty of care' for their users. In the midst of this controversy, Chris and I debate what responsibility social platforms should bear for the content on their platforms and how they can be held accountable.

In particular, we point out that social platforms encourage extremism because their business models are predicated on digital advertising, which is fueled by audience viewership and engagement. 'In some ways, social media has enabled some incredible things,' I argue. 'It's brought people together, allowed people to stay in touch, [and] it's fostered senses of community among people who might be geographically isolated. On the other hand, it can be used as a weapon.' Some social platforms seem to be aware of this fact and are taking corrective action, while others feign ignorance or shirk responsibility. As Chris asserts, 'The muted removal of the likes and retweets metrics on Twitter to me seems like actually a really good idea because it keeps the conversation open in a way that Facebook seems to be shying away from. But it's also reducing (as we talked about) that need to be more extreme in your viewpoints or to pick arguments.'

For the first time in history, Chris proclaims, 'We live in a political world in which facts are up for debate' due to a 'lack of oversight in some way on social media.' As a result, public trust in news media and government is incredibly low \u2014 a sentiment Chris sums up perfectly in what he calls his 'primal scream' at social media platforms: 'Why have you not in 14 years woken up to the fact that you have a major impact on society?' Throughout our discussion, Chris also shares some findings from his upcoming book, 'YouTubers: How YouTube Shook up TV and Created a New Generation of Stars[6].' Despite the relatively young age of the world's largest video platform, 'we're quite actually a mature market,' Chris contends. As a result, 'YouTube has a vested interest in making sure advertisers continue to view the platform as brand safe and will spend money there,' but its approach to policy creation and enforcement tends to be very reactive. Ultimately, YouTube and other ad-supported social platforms often put short-term economic incentives ahead of long-term consideration for creators and audiences. Chris also advances the idea of six or seven generations of evolution among online creators and explains why he considers Jake Paul 'the first postmodern YouTuber.' According to Chris, 'He's very transparent about the fact that this is all done to game the algorithm and make a business out of it.' I take this argument a step further, characterizing Jake Paul and similar creators as social 'shock artists' who understand that such wild behavior is what generates their appeal: 'They are the reality stars of YouTube. They draw attention by being extreme. And a lot of these social platforms are geared toward rewarding that type of behavior because whether you love them or you hate them, they're still getting views.' Finally, we consider what happens when creators outgrow the content their audience enjoys. In the course of his research, Chris discovered that many creators 'feel trapped in a gilded cage' as they grow older and lose interest in their primary video topics. Not only are many creators feeling burned out by the demands of an always-on social media lifestyle, but they're growing up and discovering that 'they are no longer the people that they pretend to be on camera, and they are desperately, desperately looking for a way out.' <url

Here\u2019s what happened:</p><p> Hiep Tuong, the owner of Tom\u2019s One Hour Photo, is a very happy man. An immigrant from Vietnam, he came to the United States in 1979 and worked as a wedding and birthday photographer, eventually saving enough money to open a small portrait studio, where customers can also develop film.</p><p>But now that every cellphone has a camera \u2014 and every smartphone, a profusion of photo filters \u2014 times are tough for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">these kinds of establishments</url>. Tom\u2019s One Hour Photo still has a loyal clientele, but business had slowed drastically in recent years.</p><p>That is until Kacey Musgraves decided to show the Koreatown shop some love recently. She and her sister, a professional photographer named Kelly Christine Sutton, went to the store to develop some disposable camera film while they were in town for Ms. Musgraves\u2019s tour, and ended up coming back with a makeup artist later that afternoon to take glamour shots. </p><p>[Read more about the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">slow fade of Glamour Shots</url>, once the coolest store in every mall.]</p><p>Ms. Musgraves posted a glowing recommendation for the place on her Instagram \u2014 \u201cLet\u2019s keep this charming business afloat!\u201d she wrote in the caption \u2014 and the sisters started a separate Instagram account for the business, which they are still running. (As of Sunday, it had 66,700 followers.)</p><p>The post went viral and a micro media blitz ensued. Customers flooded to Mr. Tuong\u2019s shop for portraits, as did plenty of news outlets that chronicled the boost in business and Mr. Tuong\u2019s personal story.</p><p>\u201cI was very lucky to meet her,\u201d Mr. Tuong said last week, while arranging a display in the back of his store. \u201cShe brought a lot of new people from Instagram and she promised she would help me.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Tuong said that other people had promised that they would help him over the years. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">He told The Los Angeles Times</url> that some months, business was so bad that his wife, who works at a West Hollywood nail salon, had to give the store a cash infusion from her own earnings.</p><p>\u201cEveryone always says that they can help, but they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cKacey is the only one that has done something.\u201d</p><p>Now that the initial flurry is over, Mr. Tuong and his wife, Le, are taking a breath and hoping the excitement over the store lasts. </p><p>The place has withstood many changes since the 1990s; the front of the shop is covered with photos taken over the past few decades \u2014 an archive of different eras and styles. Mr. Tuong\u2019s greatest hope is that his work there continues, and he can keep supporting his family.</p><p>On Thursday, he was at work with an assistant.

In past campaigns \u2014 her two elections to be attorney general, her successful run for the Senate and her failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 she relied on Silicon Valley\u2019s tech elite for donations. And her network of family, friends and former political aides has fanned throughout the tech world.Read: Those close industry ties have coincided with a largely hands-off approach to companies that have come under increasing scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world. As California\u2019s attorney general, critics say, Harris did little to curb the power of tech giants as they gobbled up rivals and muscled into new industries. As a senator, consumer advocacy groups said, she has often moved in lock step with tech interests.  Now that she is the running mate to Joe Biden, tech industry critics worry that a Biden administration with Harris would mean a return to the cozy relationship that Silicon Valley enjoyed with the White House under President Barack Obama.  Although vice presidents rarely set policy, as a former state attorney general, Harris is expected to have a say in Biden\u2019s political appointments at the Justice Department, including officials who oversee antitrust enforcement. She could also have a significant influence on tech policy in a Biden administration, since Biden has largely focused on other issues.  \"This is good news\" for tech companies, said Hal Singer, an economist who specializes in antitrust and a managing director at Econ One, a consulting firm. \"They probably feel like they have one of their own and that at the margin this is going to help push back against any reform.\"Also Read: A spokeswoman for Harris declined to comment for this story.  Silicon Valley\u2019s Democratic power brokers have been enthusiastic backers of Harris. In her first statewide campaign, she raised 36% more money than her Republican opponent with the help of large donations from prominent tech investors like billionaire John Doerr, who was an early investor in Google, and Ron Conway, a venture capitalist who is active in Democratic politics.  In her reelection bid, donations poured in from big players in tech, like Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer; Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s former top design executive, and Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.  She also hobnobbed with Silicon Valley heavyweights. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs and an influential philanthropist, hosted a fundraiser for Harris in the backyard of her Palo Alto home in 2013. That same year, Harris attended the lavish wedding of Sean Parker, an early Facebook executive.  In addition, her family, friends, and former staff members are part of the revolving door between government and the tech industry.  Lartease Tiffith left his position as a senior counsel in Harris\u2019 Senate office in late 2018 and became an in-house lobbyist for Amazon, focusing on privacy and security issues. Rebecca Prozan, who ran Harris\u2019 first campaign for district attorney in San Francisco, is a top government affairs official for Google in California. Tony West, Harris\u2019 brother-in-law and a former Justice Department official, is the chief legal officer for Uber.  \"There are familial connections and a level of mutual affection with Silicon Valley that goes above and beyond the fact that she is a San Francisco politician,\" said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a left-leaning watchdog group that has criticized Harris\u2019 ties to Big Tech and other corporate interests.Read: A decade ago, the perception of the tech industry was very different. It was a bright spot in an economy still recovering from the financial crisis. A campaign stop at the Google campus helped politicians raise their profile \u2014 and perhaps, a little money \u2014 while benefiting from an association with a company recognized as an engine of innovation.  Addressing Google\u2019s employees in 2010, Harris presented herself not as a potential foe with the power to rein in Google but as a pragmatic ally who could speak the language of the tech industry. She said she was an innovator, seeking to disrupt the status quo in government.  Harris danced around sensitive issues. With online privacy, she said, she wanted to strike a balance between what\u2019s good for business and protecting consumers. When asked about antitrust enforcement, she said it was important not to be shortsighted. A state on the verge of bankruptcy, as California was then, \"cannot stand in the way of business growth and development,\" she said.  That month, David Drummond, then Google\u2019s top lawyer, personally donated $6,500, the maximum allowed at the time, to her campaign. Google also kicked in another $6,500. Backed by tech money, Harris eked out a victory in one of the closest statewide races in California history, setting her career on the trajectory that has now catapulted her to being the first Black woman on the presidential ticket of a major political party.  Harris rarely challenged the major tech companies after she became California\u2019s attorney general.Also read: Jamie Court, president of the California-based Consumer Watchdog, said his group lobbied Harris in 2011 to support legislation that would force companies to stop monitoring the online activity of users if they clearly stated that they did not want to be tracked. She refused to sponsor the bill or support it, he said.  Two years later, Harris sponsored \u2014 and California enacted \u2014 a less stringent law, requiring companies to post in privacy policies whether they abide by do-not-track requests and what personally identifiable information they collect.  \"She presided over this era of great consolidation and power in the hands of these tech giants and she didn\u2019t do a thing,\" Court said.  But Harris\u2019 supporters said that when she did act, her familiarity with the technology industry helped her prod the companies into action. Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at Boston University, said she saw that firsthand when she worked with Harris in early 2015 to fight so-called revenge pornography \u2014 a term for posting explicit images or videos of a person without their permission.  Harris pressured the companies to act without threatening legal action by calling a round table with top executives and policy advocates. Twitter and Reddit started to ban such photos and videos, and then Google agreed to remove explicit pictures from search results if a victim had made a request to do so.  \"She was not afraid to take them on,\" said Citron, who thinks the companies were more attentive because she \"was not some gadfly.\"Also Read: When Harris arrived on Capitol Hill in 2017, activists expected her to be a vocal supporter of a Senate billed called SESTA, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, reducing the immunity protection that shielded companies like Backpage.com, a major classified advertising website that was repeatedly accused of enabling the sex trafficking of minors.  The Internet Association, a trade group representing internet companies, opposed key parts of the bill out of concern that it would weaken the liability protections for big online sites. Harris eventually signed onto the bill, after it was watered down, and the same day the Internet Association gave its stamp of approval.  Citron, who advised Harris in the Senate about the bill, said Harris had initially been reluctant because of flaws in the legislation. But her hesitance was a letdown to groups that had been relying on her early support.  \"Her absence as a vocal advocate on behalf of SESTA was glaring and it\u2019s very suspect,\" said Lisa Thompson, who then was in charge of policy for the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, in 2019.  Supporters of tough regulations governing autonomous vehicles felt similarly let down by Harris. As attorney general in California, she threatened legal action against Uber unless the company removed its driverless cars from San Francisco roads. Activists hoped she would be a champion on Capitol Hill for autonomous car regulation.  In 2017, proposed legislation called the AV Start Act concerned safety groups, because a provision of the bill established federal regulations for autonomous vehicles that would have preempted the tougher rules already in place in California. The bill failed, and Harris\u2019 office stayed out of the debate, despite repeated requests from safety groups for her involvement, said Joan Claybrook, a consumer activist.  \"They weren\u2019t cooperative and we never knew why,\" said Claybrook, who was working with the organization Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.Also Read: On the campaign trail, Biden has been critical of major technology companies. In a December interview with the editorial board of The New York Times, he attacked Facebook as \"totally irresponsible\" for its handling of misinformation and said liability protection for social media companies from what users post to their sites should be revoked.  But a crackdown on Big Tech is not a public pillar of his agenda. Of the 46 policy papers listed on the campaign\u2019s website, none directly address his plan for the industry. And employees and allies of the major technology companies are prominent within the nearly 700-person committee advising the campaign on tech policy.  When progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for a breakup of big tech companies during a debate in October, Harris took a more moderate stance. She called for action from the Justice Department.  \"We need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies,\" Harris said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42884643755</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MX-BPH1-F07F-82DP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1735\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Deccan Herald</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In past campaigns \u2014 her two elections to be attorney general, her successful run for the Senate and her failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 she relied on Silicon Valley\u2019s tech elite for donations. And her network of family, friends and former political aides has fanned throughout the tech world.    Those close industry ties have coincided with a largely hands-off approach to companies that have come under increasing scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world. As California\u2019s attorney general, critics say, Ms. Harris did little to curb the power of tech giants as they gobbled up rivals and muscled into new industries. As a senator, consumer advocacy groups said, she has often moved in lockstep with tech interests.     ALSO READ: Kamala Harris' dual identities pose challenge to America's race labels    Now that she is the running mate of Joseph R. Biden Jr., tech industry critics worry that a Biden administration with Ms. Harris would mean a return to the cozy relationship that Silicon Valley enjoyed with the White House under President Barack Obama.    Although vice presidents rarely set policy, as a former state attorney general Ms. Harris is expected to have a say in Mr. Biden\u2019s political appointments at the Justice Department, including officials who oversee antitrust enforcement. She could also have a significant influence on tech policy in a Biden administration, since Mr. Biden has largely focused on other issues.    \u201cThis is good news\u201d for tech companies, said Hal Singer, an economist who specializes in antitrust and a managing director at Econ One, a consulting firm. \u201cThey probably feel like they have one of their own and that at the margin this is going to help push back against any reform.\u201d    A spokeswoman for Ms. Harris declined to comment for this article.    Silicon Valley\u2019s Democratic power brokers have been enthusiastic backers of Ms. Harris. In her first statewide campaign, she raised 36 percent more money than her Republican opponent with the help of large donations from prominent tech investors like the billionaire John Doerr, who was an early investor in Google, and Ron Conway, a venture capitalist who is active in Democratic politics.    In her re-election bid, donations poured in from big players in tech, like Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer; Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s former top design executive; and Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.    She also hobnobbed with Silicon Valley heavyweights. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs and an influential philanthropist, hosted a fund-raiser for Ms. Harris in the backyard of her Palo Alto home in 2013. That same year, Ms. Harris attended the lavish wedding of Sean Parker, an early Facebook executive.    In addition, her family, friends and former staff members are part of the revolving door between government and the tech industry.    Lartease Tiffith left his position as a senior counsel in Ms. Harris\u2019s Senate office in late 2018 and became an in-house lobbyist for Amazon, focusing on privacy and security issues. Rebecca Prozan, who ran Ms. Harris\u2019s first campaign for district attorney in San Francisco, is a top government affairs official for Google in California. Tony West, Ms. Harris\u2019s brother-in-law and a former Justice Department official, is the chief legal officer for Uber.    \u201cThere are familial connections and a level of mutual affection with Silicon Valley that goes above and beyond the fact that she is a San Francisco politician,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a left-leaning watchdog group that has criticized Ms. Harris\u2019s ties to Big Tech and other corporate interests.    A decade ago, the perception of the tech industry was very different. It was a bright spot in an economy still recovering from the financial crisis. A campaign stop at the Google campus helped politicians raise their profile \u2014 and, perhaps, a little money \u2014 while benefiting from an association with a company recognized as an engine of innovation.    Addressing Google\u2019s employees in 2010, Ms. Harris presented herself not as a potential foe with the power to rein in Google but as a pragmatic ally who could speak the language of the tech industry. She said she was an innovator, seeking to disrupt the status quo in government.    Ms. Harris danced around sensitive issues. With online privacy, she said, she wanted to strike a balance between what\u2019s good for business and protecting consumers. When asked about antitrust enforcement, she said it was important not to be shortsighted. A state on the verge of bankruptcy, as California was then, \u201ccannot stand in the way of business growth and development,\u201d she said.    That month, David Drummond, then Google\u2019s top lawyer, personally donated $6,500, the maximum allowed at the time, to her campaign.   Google kicked in another $6,500. Backed by tech money, Mr. Harris eked out a victory in one of the closest statewide races in California history, setting her career on the trajectory that has catapulted her to being the first Black woman on the presidential ticket of a major political party.    Ms. Harris rarely challenged the major tech companies after she became California\u2019s attorney general.    Jamie Court, president of the California-based Consumer Watchdog, said his group lobbied Ms. Harris in 2011 to support legislation that would force companies to stop monitoring the online activity of users if they clearly stated that they did not want to be tracked. She refused to sponsor the bill or support it, he said.    Two years later, Ms. Harris sponsored \u2014 and California enacted \u2014 a less stringent law, requiring companies to post in privacy policies whether they abide by do-not-track requests and what personally identifiable information they collect.    \u201cShe presided over this era of great consolidation and power in the hands of these tech giants and she didn\u2019t do a thing,\u201d Mr. Court said.    But Ms. Harris\u2019s supporters said that when she did act, her familiarity with the technology industry helped her prod the companies into action. Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at Boston University, said she saw that firsthand when she worked with Ms. Harris in early 2015 to fight so-called revenge pornography \u2014 a term for posting explicit images or videos of a person without that person\u2019s permission.    Ms. Harris pressured the companies to act without threatening legal action by calling a round table with top executives and policy advocates. Twitter and Reddit started to ban such photos and videos, and then Google agreed to remove explicit pictures from search results if a victim had made a request to do so.    \u201cShe was not afraid to take them on,\u201d said Ms. Citron, who thinks the companies were more attentive because she \u201cwas not some gadfly.\u201d    When Ms. Harris arrived on Capitol Hill in 2017, activists expected her to be a vocal supporter of a Senate bill called SESTA, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, reducing the immunity protection that shielded companies like Backpage.com, a major classified advertising website that was repeatedly accused of enabling the sex trafficking of minors.    The Internet Association, a trade group representing internet companies, opposed key parts of the bill out of concern that it would weaken the liability protections for big online sites. Ms. Harris eventually signed on to the bill, after it was watered down, and the same day the Internet Association gave its stamp of approval.    Ms. Citron, who advised Ms. Harris in the Senate about the bill, said Ms. Harris had initially been reluctant because of flaws in the legislation. But her hesitance was a letdown to groups that had been relying on her early support.    \u201cHer absence as a vocal advocate on behalf of SESTA was glaring, and it\u2019s very suspect,\u201d said Lisa Thompson, who was in charge of policy for the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, in 2019.    Supporters of tough regulations governing autonomous vehicles felt similarly let down by Ms. Harris. As attorney general in California, she threatened legal action against Uber unless the company removed its driverless cars from San Francisco roads. Activists hoped she would be a champion on Capitol Hill for autonomous car regulation.    In 2017, proposed legislation called the AV Start Act worried safety groups because a provision establishing federal regulations for autonomous vehicles that would have pre-empted the tougher rules already in place in California. The bill failed, and Ms. Harris\u2019s office stayed out of the debate, despite repeated requests from safety groups for her involvement, said Joan Claybrook, a consumer activist.    \u201cThey weren\u2019t cooperative, and we never knew why,\u201d said Ms. Claybrook, who was working with the organization Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.    On the campaign trail, Mr. Biden has been critical of major technology companies. In a December interview with the editorial board of The New York Times, he attacked Facebook as \u201ctotally irresponsible\u201d for its handling of misinformation and said liability protection for social media companies from what users post to their sites should be revoked.    But a crackdown on Big Tech is not a public pillar of his agenda. Of the 46 policy papers listed on the campaign\u2019s website, none directly address his plan for the industry. And employees and allies of the major technology companies are prominent within the nearly 700-person committee advising the campaign on tech policy.

When Kamala Harris, then San Francisco's district attorney, was running to become California's attorney general in 2010, she did not hide her excitement about speaking at Google's Silicon Valley campus.   \"I've been wanting to come to the Google campus for a year and a half,\" she said. \"I've been wanting to come because I want these relationships and I want to cultivate them.\"   For Harris, a Bay Area politician, connections to tech have been essential and perhaps inescapable. In past campaigns \u2014 her two elections to be attorney general, her successful run for the Senate and her failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 she relied on Silicon Valley's tech elite for donations. And her network of family, friends and former political aides has fanned throughout the tech world.   Those close industry ties have coincided with a largely hands-off approach to companies that have come under increasing scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world. As California's attorney general, critics say, Harris did little to curb the power of tech giants as they gobbled up rivals and muscled into new industries. As a senator, consumer advocacy groups said, she has often moved in lock step with tech interests.   Now that she is the running mate to Joe Biden, tech industry critics worry that a Biden administration with Harris would mean a return to the cozy relationship that Silicon Valley enjoyed with the White House under President Barack Obama.   Although vice presidents rarely set policy, as a former state attorney general, Harris is expected to have a say in Biden's political appointments at the Justice Department, including officials who oversee antitrust enforcement. She could also have a significant influence on tech policy in a Biden administration, since Biden has largely focused on other issues.   \"This is good news\" for tech companies, said Hal Singer, an economist who specializes in antitrust and a managing director at Econ One, a consulting firm. \"They probably feel like they have one of their own and that at the margin this is going to help push back against any reform.\"   A spokeswoman for Harris declined to comment for this article.   Silicon Valley's Democratic power brokers have been enthusiastic backers of Harris. In her first statewide campaign, she raised 36 percent more money than her Republican opponent with the help of large donations from prominent tech investors like billionaire John Doerr, who was an early investor in Google, and Ron Conway, a venture capitalist who is active in Democratic politics.   In her re-election bid, donations poured in from big players in tech, like Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer; Jony Ive, Apple's former top design executive, and Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.   She also hobnobbed with Silicon Valley heavyweights. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs and an influential philanthropist, hosted a fundraiser for Harris in the backyard of her Palo Alto home in 2013. That same year, Harris attended the lavish wedding of Sean Parker, an early Facebook executive.   In addition, her family, friends, and former staff members are part of the revolving door between government and the tech industry.   Lartease Tiffith left his position as a senior counsel in Harris' Senate office in late 2018 and became an in-house lobbyist for Amazon, focusing on privacy and security issues. Rebecca Prozan, who ran Harris' first campaign for district attorney in San Francisco, is a top government affairs official for Google in California. Tony West, Harris\u2019 brother-in-law and a former Justice Department official, is the chief legal officer for Uber.   \"There are familial connections and a level of mutual affection with Silicon Valley that goes above and beyond the fact that she is a San Francisco politician,\" said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a left-leaning watchdog group that has criticized Harris' ties to Big Tech and other corporate interests.   A decade ago, the perception of the tech industry was very different. It was a bright spot in an economy still recovering from the financial crisis. A campaign stop at the Google campus helped politicians raise their profile \u2014 and perhaps, a little money \u2014 while benefiting from an association with a company recognized as an engine of innovation.   Addressing Google's employees in 2010, Harris presented herself not as a potential foe with the power to rein in Google but as a pragmatic ally who could speak the language of the tech industry. She said she was an innovator, seeking to disrupt the status quo in government.   Harris danced around sensitive issues. With online privacy, she said, she wanted to strike a balance between what's good for business and protecting consumers. When asked about antitrust enforcement, she said it was important not to be shortsighted. A state on the verge of bankruptcy, as California was then, \"cannot stand in the way of business growth and development,\" she said.   That month, David Drummond, then Google's top lawyer, personally donated $6,500, the maximum allowed at the time, to her campaign. Google kicked in another $6,500. Backed by tech money, Harris eked out a victory in one of the closest statewide races in California history, setting her career on the trajectory that has catapulted her to being the first Black woman on the presidential ticket of a major political party.   Harris rarely challenged the major tech companies after she became California\u2019s attorney general.   Jamie Court, president of the California-based Consumer Watchdog, said his group lobbied Harris in 2011 to support legislation that would force companies to stop monitoring the online activity of users if they clearly stated that they did not want to be tracked. She refused to sponsor the bill or support it, he said.   Two years later, Harris sponsored \u2014 and California enacted \u2014 a less stringent law, requiring companies to post in privacy policies whether they abide by do-not-track requests and what personally identifiable information they collect.   \"She presided over this era of great consolidation and power in the hands of these tech giants and she didn't do a thing,\" Court said.   But Harris' supporters said that when she did act, her familiarity with the technology industry helped her prod the companies into action. Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at Boston University, said she saw that firsthand when she worked with Harris in early 2015 to fight so-called revenge pornography \u2014 a term for posting explicit images or videos of a person without that person\u2019s permission.   Harris pressured the companies to act without threatening legal action by calling a round table with top executives and policy advocates. Twitter and Reddit started to ban such photos and videos, and then Google agreed to remove explicit pictures from search results if a victim had made a request to do so.   \"She was not afraid to take them on,\" said Citron, who thinks the companies were more attentive because she \"was not some gadfly.\"   When Harris arrived on Capitol Hill in 2017, activists expected her to be a vocal supporter of a Senate bill called SESTA, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, reducing the immunity protection that shielded companies like Backpage.com, a major classified advertising website that was repeatedly accused of enabling the sex trafficking of minors.   The Internet Association, a trade group representing internet companies, opposed key parts of the bill out of concern that it would weaken the liability protections for big online sites. Harris eventually signed onto the bill, after it was watered down, and the same day the Internet Association gave its stamp of approval.   Citron, who advised Harris in the Senate about the bill, said Harris had initially been reluctant because of flaws in the legislation. But her hesitance was a letdown to groups that had been relying on her early support.   \"Her absence as a vocal advocate on behalf of SESTA was glaring and it's very suspect,\" said Lisa Thompson, who was in charge of policy for the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, in 2019.   Supporters of tough regulations governing autonomous vehicles felt similarly let down by Harris. As attorney general in California, she threatened legal action against Uber unless the company removed its driverless cars from San Francisco roads. Activists hoped she would be a champion on Capitol Hill for autonomous car regulation.   In 2017, proposed legislation called the AV Start Act worried safety groups, because a provision establishing federal regulations for autonomous vehicles that would have preempted the tougher rules already in place in California. The bill failed, and Harris' office stayed out of the debate, despite repeated requests from safety groups for her involvement, said Joan Claybrook, a consumer activist.   \"They weren't cooperative and we never knew why,\" said Claybrook, who was working with the organization Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.   On the campaign trail, Biden has been critical of major technology companies. In a December interview with the editorial board of The New York Times, he attacked Facebook as \"totally irresponsible\" for its handling of misinformation and said liability protection for social media companies from what users post to their sites should be revoked.   But a crackdown on Big Tech is not a public pillar of his agenda. Of the 46 policy papers listed on the campaign\u2019s website, none directly address his plan for the industry. And employees and allies of the major technology companies are prominent within the nearly 700-person committee advising the campaign on tech policy.   When progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for a breakup of big tech companies during a debate in October, Harris took a more moderate stance. She called for action from the Justice Department.  \"We need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies,\" Harris said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42891034541</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N0-TR71-F07F-8485-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Moneycontrol.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In past campaigns \u2014 her two elections to be attorney general, her successful run for the Senate and her failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 she relied on Silicon Valley\u2019s tech elite for donations. And her network of family, friends and former political aides has fanned throughout the tech world.</p><p>Those close industry ties have coincided with a largely hands-off approach to companies that have come under increasing scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world. As California\u2019s attorney general, critics say, Ms. Harris did little to curb the power of tech giants as they gobbled up rivals and muscled into new industries. As a senator, consumer advocacy groups said, she has often moved in lockstep with tech interests.</p><p>Now that she is the running mate of Joseph R. Biden Jr., tech industry critics worry that a Biden administration with Ms. Harris would mean a return to the cozy relationship that Silicon Valley enjoyed with the White House under President Barack Obama.</p><p>Although vice presidents rarely set policy, as a former state attorney general Ms. Harris is expected to have a say in Mr. Biden\u2019s political appointments at the Justice Department, including officials who oversee antitrust enforcement. She could also have a significant influence on tech policy in a Biden administration, since Mr. Biden has largely focused on other issues.</p><p>\u201cThis is good news\u201d for tech companies, said Hal Singer, an economist who specializes in antitrust and a managing director at Econ One, a consulting firm. \u201cThey probably feel like they have one of their own and that at the margin this is going to help push back against any reform.\u201d</p><p>A spokeswoman for Ms. Harris declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Silicon Valley\u2019s Democratic power brokers have been enthusiastic backers of Ms. Harris. In her first statewide campaign, she raised 36 percent more money than her Republican opponent with the help of large donations from prominent tech investors like the billionaire John Doerr, who was an early investor in Google, and Ron Conway, a venture capitalist who is active in Democratic politics.</p><p>In her re-election bid, donations poured in from big players in tech, like Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer; Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s former top design executive; and Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.</p><p>She also hobnobbed with Silicon Valley heavyweights. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs and an influential philanthropist, hosted a fund-raiser for Ms. Harris in the backyard of her Palo Alto home in 2013. That same year, Ms. Harris attended <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJllQ9d3pYM\">the lavish wedding</url> of Sean Parker, an early Facebook executive.</p><p>In addition, her family, friends and former staff members are part of the revolving door between government and the tech industry.</p><p>Lartease Tiffith left his position as a senior counsel in Ms. Harris\u2019s Senate office in late 2018 and became an in-house lobbyist for Amazon, focusing on privacy and security issues. Rebecca Prozan, who ran Ms. Harris\u2019s first campaign for district attorney in San Francisco, is a top government affairs official for Google in California. Tony West, Ms. Harris\u2019s brother-in-law and a former Justice Department official, is the chief legal officer for Uber.</p><p>\u201cThere are familial connections and a level of mutual affection with Silicon Valley that goes above and beyond the fact that she is a San Francisco politician,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a left-leaning watchdog group that has criticized<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJllQ9d3pYM\">Ms. Harris\u2019s ties to Big Tech</url> and other corporate interests.</p><p>A decade ago, the perception of the tech industry was very different. It was a bright spot in an economy still recovering from the financial crisis. A campaign stop at the Google campus helped politicians raise their profile \u2014 and, perhaps, a little money \u2014 while benefiting from an association with a company recognized as an engine of innovation.</p><p>Addressing Google\u2019s employees in 2010, Ms. Harris presented herself not as a potential foe with the power to rein in Google but as a pragmatic ally who could speak the language of the tech industry. She said she was an innovator, seeking to disrupt the status quo in government.</p><p>Ms. Harris danced around sensitive issues. With online privacy, she said, she wanted to strike a balance between what\u2019s good for business and protecting consumers. When asked about antitrust enforcement, she said it was important not to be shortsighted. A state on the verge of bankruptcy, as California was then, \u201ccannot stand in the way of business growth and development,\u201d she said.</p><p>That month, David Drummond, then Google\u2019s top lawyer, personally donated $6,500, the maximum allowed at the time, to her campaign. Google kicked in another $6,500. Backed by tech money, Ms. Harris <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJllQ9d3pYM\">eked out a victory</url> in one of the closest statewide races in California history, setting her career on the trajectory that has catapulted her to being the first Black woman on the presidential ticket of a major political party.</p><p>Ms. Harris rarely challenged the major tech companies after she became California\u2019s attorney general.</p><p>Jamie Court, president of the California-based Consumer Watchdog, said his group lobbied Ms. Harris in 2011 to support legislation that would force companies to stop monitoring the online activity of users if they clearly stated that they did not want to be tracked. She refused to sponsor the bill or support it, he said.</p><p>Two years later, Ms. Harris sponsored \u2014 and California enacted \u2014 a less stringent law, requiring companies to post in privacy policies whether they abide by do-not-track requests and what personally identifiable information they collect.</p><p>\u201cShe presided over this era of great consolidation and power in the hands of these tech giants and she didn\u2019t do a thing,\u201d Mr. Court said.</p><p>But Ms. Harris\u2019s supporters said that when she did act, her familiarity with the technology industry helped her prod the companies into action. Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at Boston University, said she saw that firsthand when she worked with Ms. Harris in early 2015 to fight so-called revenge pornography \u2014 a term for posting explicit images or videos of a person without that person\u2019s permission.</p><p>Ms. Harris pressured the companies to act without threatening legal action by calling a round table with top executives and policy advocates. Twitter and Reddit started to ban such photos and videos, and then Google agreed to remove explicit pictures from search results if a victim had made a request to do so.</p><p>\u201cShe was not afraid to take them on,\u201d said Ms. Citron, who thinks the companies were more attentive because she \u201cwas not some gadfly.\u201d</p><p>When Ms. Harris arrived on Capitol Hill in 2017, activists expected her to be a vocal supporter of a Senate bill called SESTA, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, reducing the immunity protection that shielded companies like Backpage.com, a major classified advertising website that was repeatedly accused of enabling the sex trafficking of minors.</p><p>The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJllQ9d3pYM\">Internet Association</url>, a trade group representing internet companies, opposed key parts of the bill out of concern that it would weaken the liability protections for big online sites. Ms. Harris eventually signed on to the bill, after it was watered down, and the same day the Internet Association gave its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJllQ9d3pYM\">stamp of approval</url>.</p><p>Ms. Citron, who advised Ms. Harris in the Senate about the bill, said Ms. Harris had initially been reluctant because of flaws in the legislation. But her hesitance was a letdown to groups that had been relying on her early support.</p><p>\u201cHer absence as a vocal advocate on behalf of SESTA was glaring, and it\u2019s very suspect,\u201d said Lisa Thompson, who was in charge of policy for the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, in 2019.</p><p>Supporters of tough regulations governing autonomous vehicles felt similarly let down by Ms. Harris. As attorney general in California, she threatened legal action against Uber unless the company removed its driverless cars from San Francisco roads. Activists hoped she would be a champion on Capitol Hill for autonomous car regulation.</p><p>In 2017, proposed legislation called the AV Start Act worried safety groups because a provision establishing federal regulations for autonomous vehicles that would have pre-empted the tougher rules already in place in California. The bill failed, and Ms. Harris\u2019s office stayed out of the debate, despite repeated requests from safety groups for her involvement, said Joan Claybrook, a consumer activist.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t cooperative, and we never knew why,\u201d said Ms. Claybrook, who was working with the organization Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.</p><p>On the campaign trail, Mr. Biden has been critical of major technology companies. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJllQ9d3pYM\">a December interview</url> with the editorial board of The New York Times, he attacked Facebook as \u201ctotally irresponsible\u201d for its handling of misinformation and said liability protection for social media companies from what users post to their sites should be revoked.</p><p>But a crackdown on Big Tech is not a public pillar of his agenda. Of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJllQ9d3pYM\">46 policy papers listed</url> on the campaign\u2019s website, none directly address his plan for the industry. And employees and allies of the major technology companies are prominent within the nearly 700-person committee <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJllQ9d3pYM\">advising the campaign</url> on tech policy.</p><p>When progressives like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for a breakup of big tech companies<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJllQ9d3pYM\">during a debate</url> in October, Ms. Harris took a more moderate stance. She called for action from the Justice Department.</p><p>\u201cWe need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies,\u201d Ms. Harris said.</p><p>PHOTOS: Senator Kamala Harris, then California\u2019s attorney general, speaking at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in 2015.

And he stillwouldbe the host of the 2019 Academy Awards, had he not violated one of the sacrosanct rules of life online: never tweet. Shortly after he was named host,BuzzFeed's Michael Blackmon reviewed some of the tweets that Hart was frantically deleting: Hart's anti-gay ideology wasn't exactly a secret before now. AsLee noted in a piece for theGuardian,Hart devoted part of a 2010 stand-up special to describing his terror that his son would turn out to be gay \u2014 and his intention to prevent it however he could. ('I'm not homophobic, Hart added.) </p><p>And after the year that Hollywood has had, you might think the academy might have done a Twitter search before naming its host. It was barely three months ago that James Gunn, the high-profile director of theGuardians of the Galaxymovies,was fired amid a spurious campaign to link him to pedophiliaover 2010-era Twitter jokes. Given a choice of apologizing or doubling down on being an anti-gay idiot, Hart chose the latter,Brian Raftery reported inWired: Inan Instagram postfrom that morning, Hart appeared bratty, defensive, and completely dismissive of the growing pushback (he also seemed kind of drowsy, possibly because he filmed it from a bed). 'Our world is becoming beyond crazy, Hart complained, 'and I'm not gonna let the craziness frustrate me hellip; if you don't believe people change, grow, evolve as they get older, then I don't know what to tell you. In the accompanying caption, he wrote, 'If u want to search my history or past and anger yourselves with what u find that is fine with me. I'm almost 40 years old and I'm in love with the man I am becoming. Apparently, in Hart's world, it's OK for a man to love a man \u2014 as long as that man is yourself. Obviously Hart's brief tenure as Oscar host-to-be is a dumb story that we all will have forgotten about by happy hour tonight. But it reminded me of a good essay about Twitter behavior that I saw recently onMotherboard: 'The internet doesn't need civility, it needs ethics, by communications professors Whitney Phillips and Ryan M. Milner. In the piece, the professors encourage us to think about Twitter as an ecosystem in which users have varying degrees of 'biomass (followers). In biology, biomass pyramids chart the relative number or weight of one class of organism compared to another organism within the same ecosystem. For a habitat to support one lion, the biomass pyramid shows, it needs a whole lot of insects. When applied to questions of online toxicity, biomass pyramids speak to the fact that there are far more everyday, relatively low-level cases of harmful behavior than there are apex predator cases\u2014the kinds of actions that are explicitly and wilfully harmful, from coordinated hate and harassment campaigns to media manipulation tactics designed to sow chaos and confusion. Phillips and Milner argue that the collective bad behavior of the insects is at least as important to the overall health of Twitter as that of the lions; This bottom strata includes posting snarky jokes about an unfolding news story, tragedy, or controversy; retweeting hoaxes and other misleading narratives ironically, to condemn them, make fun of the people involved, or otherwise assert superiority over those who take the narratives seriously; making ambivalent inside jokes because your friends will know what you mean (and for white people in particular, that your friends will know you're not arealracist); @mentioning the butts of jokes, critiques, or collective mocking, thus looping the target of the conversation into the discussion; and easiest of all, jumping into conversations mid-thread without knowing what the issues are. Regarding visual media, impactive everyday behaviors include responding to a thread with a GIF or reaction image featuring random everyday strangers, or posting (and/or remixing) the latest meme to comment on the news of the day. Unfortunately, the authors' proposed solution basically boils down to 'be nicer \u2014 great advice, but unlikely to be heeded at scale. Still, it's worth thinking about \u2014 especially for someone like me, who enjoys both posting snarky jokes about unfolding news stories and making ambivalent inside jokes because my friends will know what I mean. Anyway, I thought of the piece in relation to Hart because his tweets showed him to be a lion eating insects \u2014 using his enormous platform to go after a large and harmless group of people who are just trying to live! Talk about punching down. I can't help but wonder what would have happened if Twitter had been monitoring the accounts of lions like his for ugly anti-gay slurs eight years ago. Perhaps he could have learned his lesson then, and hosted the Oscars in 2019. As it is, the show is much better off without him. Democracy Google Hearing to Preview Democrats' Strategy on Big Tech Cecilia Kang and Daisuke Wakabayashi say we should watch next week's hearing with Sundar Pichai for signs of how the Democrats intend to wield their new powers in the House of Representatives: The hearing will provide an early glimpse of how Democrats plan to approach Silicon Valley giants in the coming year as they assume control of the House of Representatives. And the testimony from Mr. Pichai, who is appearing before lawmakers after initially resisting, may provide clues about how he and the company will approach them. Democratic lawmakers, angry about Russian misinformation online during the 2016 campaign and concerned about the expanding influence of tech's biggest companies, are expected to target the industry in the next Congress. Some have already raised concerns about potential antitrust and privacy violations, showing more willingness than Republicans to regulate an industry viewed as an engine of economic growth. Crowdfunding site Patreon is purging far-right figures Patreon is removing more high-profile far-right figures from the service, David Gilbert reports: The accounts of British conspiracy theorist YouTuber Carl Benjamin, better known as Sargon of Akkad, and U.S. far-right political commentator James Allsup, were removed Thursday. The ban will be a particular blow for Benjamin, who was earning more than $12,000 a month from the crowdfunding site. Cambridge Analytica's administrators misled judge, High Court told Here is an extremely dense story about a hearing today on the dissolution of Cambridge Analytica. Honestly it is so dense that I can't tell you what it means, but it felt important that I note the hearing happened here for posterity. A gold star and free newsletter mention in the Monday edition to anyone who can translate this into American English: Responding, Watson-Gandy told the court that Carroll 'was not a qualifying floating chargeholder, he had not served a winding-up petition, he was not any of those who are the traditional respondents to an applicationfor administration. Surprise! Two-thirds of U.S. residents would have been happy to have their city win Amazon's HQ2 Recodepolled Americans about Amazon's Regional Office 1 and 2 gambit and found that most people had a positive impression of the project, Rani Molla reports: Of those who were aware of Amazon's decision, 67 percent of respondents in the U.S. said they would have been happy if Amazon had chosen their home area for an HQ2. Those people overwhelmingly cited jobs (92 percent) as the reason for their approval, while nearly 60 percent said investment in public works and infrastructure improvements was their reason. Some 44 percent had a favorable view of Amazon's decision to split its new headquarters between two cities, while 47 percent were indifferent and just 9 percent had a negative opinion. Revealed: the hidden global network behind Tommy Robinson The Guardian finds that a far-right activist had been using Facebook's fundraising tools to crowdfund a British Infowars clone: He says he has raised several hundred thousand pounds via online donations, some of which were solicited via the Facebook donate button. Robinson has said he plans to use the money to launch a European version of the rightwing conspiracy website Infowars, and to sue the British government over his prison treatment. But the tool is meant for charities alone. When the Guardian alerted Facebook to this, the social media company switched off the function within hours. Launching Revolution: Social Media and the Egyptian Uprising The Arab Spring is often cited as the event that convinced big tech platforms that they would primarily be used for good. But I haven't seen much academic research on how, exactly, they contributed to the cause. Here's a new paper from Killian Clarke and Korhan Koccedil;ak at Princeton University that attempts to put some rigor behind that idea. (They also use the word 'mobilizational. Academia!) Drawing on evidence from the 2011 Egyptian uprising, we demonstrate how the use of two social media platforms Facebook and Twitter contributed to a discrete mobilizational outcome: the staging of a successful first protest in a revolutionary cascade, or, what we call 'first mover mobilization. Specifically, we argue that these two platforms facilitated the staging of a large, nationwide, and seemingly leaderless protest on January 25, 2011, which signaled to hesitant but sympathetic Egyptians that a revolution might be in the making. Using qualitative and quantitative evidence, including interviews, social media data, and surveys, we analyze three mechanisms that linked these platforms to the success of the January 25 protest: 1) protester recruitment, 2) protest planning and coordination, and 3) live updating about protest logistics. The paper not only contributes to debates about the role of the Internet in the Arab Spring and other recent waves of mobilization, but also demonstrates how scholarship on the Internet in politics might move toward making more discrete, empirically grounded causal claims. Elsewhere Facebook's 2018 Year In Review Facebook posted a year-end round up 'highlighting the top ways people around the world connected with their communities on Facebook. It leaves out a few things! Lean In's Sheryl Sandberg Problem OUCH, from Nellie Bowles: Inside, surrounded by wall art reminding women to be bold, the Lean In staff has a singular message: Ms. Sandberg now has little to do with the group she founded. 'I don't want to take anything away \u2014 how could I? \u2014 from Sheryl as the inspiration for the work that we do, said Rachel Thomas, the president ofLeanIn.org. 'But the book came out six years ago. It's become less and less about Sheryl with every passing year. ByteDance in Talks to Raise $1.45 Billion for Startup Shopping Spree ($) The maker of TikTok is planning to go invest in, and acquire, a slew of new apps, Yunan Zhang and Juro Osawa report: In China, ByteDance is a media and content powerhouse that operates more than 10 apps, including two blockbusters\u2014personalized news-feed app Jinri Toutiao and short-form video app Douyin. The new venture fund could help the company build new strategic alliances with startups, expanding its platform further beyond its own products. It could enable ByteDance to gain access to new technologies and content instead of relying entirely on its own teams to develop them. ByteDance executives and investors have attributed the company's success to its heavy emphasis on AI technology that connects users with personalized streams of articles and videos as well as ads. But as the company tries to attract more users and expand its platform globally, it needs to accumulate a broader range of content covering its users' diverse interests. Investments in startups could play a role in such efforts. SoftBank Hires First Female Partner to Help Manage $100 Billion Vision Fund Kirthiga Reddy was Facebook's first employee in India. Now she's the first woman to become partner at SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund. Predictim Claims Its AI Can Flag \u2018Risky' Babysitters. So I Tried It on the People Who Watch My Kids. Predictim, which got in trouble with Facebook and Twitter for misusing their APIs, tries to explain to Brian Merchant why it thinks his babysitter is 'risky. (The short answer seems to be: racism!) My wife and my son's grandmother, who, apart from the occasional incensed political post, have very clean profiles\u2014they both work at universities, where they interact with research subjects and students, and are both white\u2014got the \u2018Lowest Risk' ratings on each of the four categories.

People Are Stacking Too Many Stones Dammit, people: The photograph in the Facebook post is pretty: piles of red rocks balanced at the edge of a cliff, suggesting a miniature mirror of the jagged rock face opposite. The stacks look like small shrines to mountain solitude, carefully balanced at the edge of a precipice. But when Zion National Parkposted the photo, in September, the social-media coouml;rdinators for the park included a plea: 'Please, enjoy the park but leave rocks and all natural objects in place. The post noted the 'curious but destructive practice of building small stone towers, and said, 'stacking up stones is simply vandalism. Launches YouTube Rewind hides its community's biggest moments to appease advertisers YouTube Rewind is an annual video about the most famous videos on YouTube posted that year. But this year, the most famous things all got omitted, Julia Alexander reports: Most creators would probably point toLogan Paul's controversysurrounding his time in Japan's Aokigahara forest, amultimillion-dollar boxing matchbetween some of YouTube's most prolific individuals, and the seemingly never-endingbattle between PewDiePie and Bollywood production company T-Series. There were also multiplebreakups between adored YouTubers, the rise ofJohnny Johnny Yes Papaas a phenomenon, andShane Dawson ruling the digital spaceby reimagining what YouTubers could create. None of these moments appear in YouTube Rewind, the streaming service's year-end wrap-up video, but that isn't too surprising. YouTube Rewind is an annual look back at the trends, creators, and moments that YouTube executives and employees consider the most noteworthy. It's a presentation of what makes YouTube unique, specifically designed to market its creators to advertisers in the hopes of securing large deals. The lack of these moments reiterates the divide between how the platform wants to be seen and the actual culture that creators participate in. Takes The \u2018Next America' Tom Friedman says regulating the big tech platforms should be a central issue of the 2020 presidential campaign: Just one person \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 controls Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. The fact that he has shown himself to be much more interested in scaling his platforms than combating those who abused them for political and economic gain \u2014 and that his lieutenants were ready to go after their high-profile critics, like George Soros \u2014 should make breaking up or regulating Facebook a front-and-center issue in 2020. But just the raw political weight of behemoths like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple needs a closer look. The Internet Is Getting Small And Boring. Long Live Tumblr. Cates Holderness celebrates Tumblr and predicts it will be fine even without the world's largest collection of online erotica: The 2018 internet is dominated by three giant platforms \u2014 Twitter (Do you like Nazis and being harassed for having the audacity to exist? Have I got a site for for you!), Facebook (Your elementary school best friend is getting divorced and your uncle just learned to take selfies, enjoy!), and Instagram (Here's what your friends were doing without you three days ago when everyone said they just wanted 'a quiet night in, buy this laxative tea while you weep about how lonely you are, then feel guilty for laughing at this meme that got reposted without attribution.). And the joke's on you \u2014 you HAVE to be on all three of them! Happy 2018!!! This internet feels small, and it's shrinking every day as its algorithms make everything feel increasingly the same. Amid all this, Tumblr has been a safe harbor of delightful, weird, and deeply human stuff, presented using the radical system known as reverse chronological order. This shouldn't be rocket science, and yet here we are: Somehow, Tumblr is the only social media platform I use that just shows me the posts from people I follow, in order of when they were posted. The further I scroll, the older posts get. And that's beautiful. Algorithms don't try to anticipate what I want to see, and neither is my feed determined by the whims of a random group of people who can up- or downvote things into oblivion. Facebook's New \u2018Supreme Court' Could Revolutionize Online Speech I can't get enough speculative discussion about Facebook's Supreme Court, and Evelyn Douek has a nice piece on the many, many questions surrounding how it will work: Though Zuckerberg appears to be seriously pursuing the idea, currently his conception of the independent body is more soundbite than substance. When he says that the SCOF will 'ultimately make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community that reflects the social norms and values of people all around the world, he sets an impossible goal. There is no homogenous global community whose norms can be reflected in the decisions of a single body deciding contentious issues. But that doesn't mean the proposed body cannot be an important development in online governance, creating a venue for appeal and redress, transparency and dialogue, and through which the idea of free speech in the online global community develops a greater substantive meaning than simply 'whatever the platform says it is. How the independent body is set up will determine whether it furthers or hinders rights to freedom of expression and due process. There is a rich literature in comparative law showing that decisions of institutional design can have significant impacts not only on outcomes but the entire stability and legitimacy of a governance structure. These choices givesubstanceto the idea that the body is 'independent. The question of how Facebook defines the body's jurisdiction is particularly important. Presumably it will cover any take-down decision, but what about the decision to demote content and limit its distribution and engagement, a tool Facebookhas saidit is using to deal withmore and moreproblematic content? These decisions are particularly opaque and controversial and havegenerated controversy. If the independent body cannot review these decisions as well, Facebook will be left with a large degree of control over what claims get ventilated and reviewed, and will be able to determine the ambit of the body's promise of due process. And finally #8230; Tumblr's announcement that it will ban adult content beginning later this month has set up a new an exciting game in which bloggers attempt to determine exactly where the Verizon-owned network will draw the line. Today's finding, via Chappell Ellison on Twitter, is that a hot naked man chest is acceptableonlyif accompanied by an owl wearing a hat. Please add that to your content moderation guidelines and update your blogging strategy accordingly.

A former law clerk to archconservative justice Antonin Scalia on the supreme court, he served as deputy chief of staff for policy under former president George W Bush from 2006 to 2009, joining Facebook two years later.</p><p>Warren noted on Twitter this week: \"Since he was hired, Facebook spent over $71 million on lobbying-nearly 100 times what it had spent before Kaplan joined.\"</p><p>She added: \"Facebook is now spending millions on lobbying amid antitrust scrutiny-and Kaplan is flexing his DC rolodex to help Mark Zuckerbeg [sic] wage a closed-door charm offensive with Republican lawmakers.\"</p><p>In one telling incident last year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/02/a-new-antitrust-frontier-the-issue-closing-partisan-divides-in-the-name-of-policing-big-tech\">Kaplan sat behind Brett Kavanaugh</url>, who had been accused of sexual assault, during his bitterly divisive supreme court nomination hearing, prompting an angry backlash from Facebook staff.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/02/a-new-antitrust-frontier-the-issue-closing-partisan-divides-in-the-name-of-policing-big-tech\">According to the New York Times</url>, Kaplan wrote to them: \"I want to apologize. I recognize this moment is a deeply painful one - internally and externally.\"</p><p>Yet he still <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/02/a-new-antitrust-frontier-the-issue-closing-partisan-divides-in-the-name-of-policing-big-tech\">threw a celebratory party</url> for Kavanaugh once he was confirmed.</p><p>Kaplan has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/02/a-new-antitrust-frontier-the-issue-closing-partisan-divides-in-the-name-of-policing-big-tech\">reportedly advocated</url> for rightwing sites such as Breitbart and the Daily Caller, which earlier this year       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/02/a-new-antitrust-frontier-the-issue-closing-partisan-divides-in-the-name-of-policing-big-tech\">became a partner</url> in Facebook's factchecking program.

She has been the principal defender of the company's decision to allow political adverts, even those including blatantly misleading claims, a move that earned a sharp rebuke <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/02/a-new-antitrust-frontier-the-issue-closing-partisan-divides-in-the-name-of-policing-big-tech\">from the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin</url> among others and put it at odds with Twitter, which announced this week that it will refuse such ads.</p><p>Brock said: \"I think Twitter did the right thing here and the only solution, really, is to do what Twitter did, but Facebook is in the opposing camp there.\"</p><p>Facebook's failure to filter out far-right hate speech and misinformation is a running controversy. Its decision to include Breitbart in its news tab's algorithmic selections was widely condemned. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/02/a-new-antitrust-frontier-the-issue-closing-partisan-divides-in-the-name-of-policing-big-tech\">In another report</url>, Popular Information said it uncovered a network of 14 big Facebook pages that, violating the company's rules, pretend to be independent but exclusively promote content from the conservative site the Daily Wire, which it described as \"a cesspool of misogyny, bigotry, and misinformation\".</p><p>Several Democrats have raised the prospect of regulating Facebook, with Warren the most outspoken. The senator has said she would nominate regulators to unwind anti-competitive mergers such as its deals for WhatsApp and Instagram. Last month she mocked the Facebook's failure to factcheck politicians by running ads containing the false claim that Zuckerberg is endorsing Trump's re-election.</p><p>Warren's ascent in the polls has set off alarm bells at Facebook. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/02/a-new-antitrust-frontier-the-issue-closing-partisan-divides-in-the-name-of-policing-big-tech\">In a leaked audio recording</url> last month, Zuckerberg could be heard telling employees: \"But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\"</p><p>Critics suggest that he therefore sees currying favor with Republicans who, for all their suspicion of big tech companies, are generally against regulation, as an act of self-preservation. There are fears that, four years after Trump exploited Facebook to get elected, the platform might again tilt in his favor.</p><p>Zuckerberg \"has to be worried about what happens to Facebook if there's a Democratic president\", Brock added. \"I don't think the answer to that is the way he's behaving because all he's doing is riling up Democratic opposition to Facebook policies, so I'm not sure what the logic is catering to the conservatives if he's scared of Democratic regulation.\"</p><p>But for the Facebook founder, who has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/02/a-new-antitrust-frontier-the-issue-closing-partisan-divides-in-the-name-of-policing-big-tech\">reportedly held a series of meetings</url> with Republican politicians and conservative commentators, it might be a case of be careful what you wish for.

Who would even be able to find out whether they did that?\"</p><p>But Stoller, author of Goliath: The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy, added: \"I'm not saying that they are just for Republicans. I think that they are as likely to try to destroy Josh Hawley or to try to promote Kamala Harris or Pete Buttigieg or other candidates they like as they are to help Trump.</p><p>\"They're authoritarians.

Continue reading How leaked court documents reveal Facebook s fundamental paranoia</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oh fine, let's talk about some ancient Facebook history.</p><p>Once upon a time there was an atrocious company called Six4Three. It made an app called Pikinis that found photos of your Facebook friends in their swimsuits and organized them all in one place. It was basically the living embodiment of contemporary fears over misuses of Facebook's developer platform, and few mourned it when Facebook shut down the company's API access during the big third-party developer purges of 2014 and 2015.</p><p>The memory of Pikinis might have faded away, but the company's founder, Ted Kramer, decided to sue Facebook in 2015, alleging that its behavior had been anticompetitive. Four years later, the lawsuit endures, and it might be one of the stranger cases in the history of Silicon Valley. The app at the heart of it looks less sympathetic with each passing year   but its chief contention, that Facebook has used its stranglehold on personal information to harm competition, is now very much in vogue.</p><p>Even still, we probably wouldn't be hearing much about the case had it not produced thousands of pages of legal discovery that speak to executives' mindset about competition throughout the first half of the last decade. British Parliament, which is conducting its own inquiries into various matters surrounding Facebook, famously pressured Kramer to hand over the discovery documents while he was visiting England last year, and made public 250 pages last December.</p><p>Then, on Wednesday, NBC News released another 7,000 pages of documents for our perusal. Reporters Olivia Solon and Cyrus Farivar summarize them for us:</p><p>Taken together, they show how Zuckerberg, along with his board and management team, found ways to tap Facebook users' data   including information about friends, relationships and photos   as leverage over the companies it partnered with. In some cases, Facebook would reward partners by giving them preferential access to certain types of user data while denying the same access to rival companies.</p><p>For example, Facebook gave Amazon special access to user data because it was spending money on Facebook advertising. In another case the messaging app MessageMe was cut off from access to data because it had grown too popular and could compete with Facebook.</p><p>All the while, Facebook planned to publicly frame these moves as a way to protect user privacy, the documents show.</p><p>On one hand, we already know the broad outlines of what these documents describe. Facebook once granted very broad permissions to developers, which helped to promote the company's interests and spur its growth; it horse-traded with some of those developers when it suited its needs, and it ratcheted developer permissions down over time as the company achieved a dominant position and scrutiny over its data practices increased.</p><p>On the other, there's a boldness in some of the newly revealed documents that I found striking.</p><p>There is, for example, the matter of the switcharoo. Here's Katie Paul and Mark Hosenball in Reuters:</p><p>Some executives at the world's biggest social network appeared to refer to the strategy of promoting a privacy-focused explanation for the change as the  Switcharoo Plan,  internal emails included in sealed California court filings show.</p><p>The Switcharoo Plan turned out to be an idea whereby Facebook executives would deprecate various APIs that its developer partners depended on for fear that those developers would one day compete with Facebook directly, while publicly announcing that the changes were intended to promote privacy. Reuters again:</p><p>As thousands of developers lost access to user data, the executives decided to announce the changes publicly. They elected to link what they referred to as the   bad stuff' of PS12N  to an unrelated update of the Facebook login system which gave people greater control over their privacy.</p><p>The  narrative  for the announcement  will focus on quality and the user experience which will potentially provide a good umbrella to fold in some of the API deprecations,  one executive wrote in an email.</p><p>Another invited colleagues in a February 2014 email to review the  Switcharoo Plan,  calling it  a good compromise  that will enable them  to tell a story that makes sense. </p><p>Oh, I'd say the story makes sense, all right. Competition: scary. How to fix it: Switcharoo Plan.</p><p>The gift of these newly leaked documents is to shed even more light on Facebook's full-fledged dread of competition. Mark Zuckerberg is one of the most paranoid leaders in Silicon Valley history, and I almost mean that as a compliment. (I suspect he might take it as one; he's an Andy Grove guy.)</p><p>Anyway, the documents are full of things that Zuckerberg is paranoid about.</p><p>For example, he's paranoid about dating apps, as Rich Nieva points out here:</p><p>Facebook has been thinking about a dating app since at least 2014, but at the time, Zuckerberg wasn't particularly excited about it pic.twitter.com/McK6BciQJp</p><p>  Richard Nieva (@richardjnieva) November 6, 2019</p><p>And he was paranoid about messaging apps, as Sam Schechner and Parmy Olson cover in theWall Street Journal:</p><p> Those companies are trying to build social networks and replace us,  Mr. Zuckerberg said of a trio of Chinese and Korean messaging apps that he had decided should be blocked from advertising on the social network in a January 2013 email thread that included more than a dozen senior executives including Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer.</p><p>In the same thread, Javier Olivan, the company's head of growth, said chat-app firms were dangerous because they could  morph into Facebook,  then pointed to a recent announcement from WhatsApp that it had processed 18 billion messages in a day on Dec. 31, 2012.</p><p>The same story details the concerns of one executive paranoid about the growth of WhatsApp, which Facebook would ultimately spend $19 billion to acquire.</p><p>All of this gets at the single biggest difference between how the world sees Facebook and how Facebook sees Facebook. To outsiders, it's a monolith that steamrolls entire industries and nation-states as it pursues its business goals. To insiders, it's a premature baby stuck forever in intensive care, never more than a few bad breaks away from oblivion. This is a document leak that reads like a hospital chart.</p><p>Even hardcore anti-Facebook partisans would understand the company better, I think, if they spent some time looking at it through that frame. So many of the qualities people resent most about Facebook   its speed of development, its shameless copying of rivals, its ruthless treatment of partners   are all born out of mortal fear. (Greed, too! But fear reigns supreme.) If you ever find yourself confused by something Facebook does, try changing your perspective   see whether it can't be explained by paranoia.</p><p>Call it a Switcharoo Plan.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Ratio</emphasis></h><p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trending up:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twitter</emphasis>is launching a series of experiments to try to get people to quote-tweet, reply, and retweet in nondestructive ways.

David McCabe atThe New York Timesexplains the rationale:</p><p>Some of the conservatives resisting the push for antitrust action say many problems with large Silicon Valley companies have nothing to do with competition. They point, for example, to concerns about privacy and accuse Big Tech's critics of applying antitrust laws to solve a problem better suited to new data regulations.</p><p>Others say efforts to change how the government polices competition are moving too fast. Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, has written a draft paper arguing that the movement to change the law  has emerged out of virtually nowhere to claim a position at the bargaining table over antitrust reform and the future of the antitrust enterprise.  Thibault Schrepel, a professor at the Utrecht University School of Law, has said human flourishing  should be enhanced by applying reason to antitrust law; not fears, not feelings, not sentiments, not intuitions. </p><p>A misleading story about a British politician's husband went viral, thanks to a network of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis>pages and trolls.

The first will add an emoji to a retweet, giving people the chance to quote-tweet without going into the compose field. The second will automatically suggest people use an emoji in their replies. Alex Kantrowitz atBuzzFeedexplains why these minor-seeming changes might help:</p><p>Twitter's experiments may seem small, but they could add up to big changes by the time the company is done with them, likely sometime in 2020.  We have big ambitions here. We're definitely serious about changing how conversations happen on Twitter,  Gasca said.</p><p>The emoji tests come amid a sitewide push to rethink aspects of the service. Last week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said the company will ban political ads, with some exceptions. Twitter will also start allowing people to follow topics, not just people, a feature announced Wednesday that will go live later this month. Earlier this week, Twitter research VP Dantley Davis laid out a series of possible experiments the company might run, including giving people a chance to prevent retweets of their tweets and removing themselves from a conversation.</p><p>A ton of people received text messages overnight that were originally sent on Valentine's Day, for seemingly inexplicable reasons.

Futures are in the red by triple-digits 45 minutes ahead of Friday's opening bell.There is plenty to like about our current economic position, globally and historically. We're at half-century highs in the U.S. labor market. </p><p>We saw 3.5% growth in Q3 GDP, on our way to the first full year of 3% growth in recent memory. Although political plates are shifting in different regions around the world, we're not seeing more than a recognizable amount of global strife these days. The U.S.'s position leading the world from its economic meltdown a decade ago remains a shining beacon to the rest of the world's economies, to which we've rightly grown accustomed.BUT what's going to happen in our trade war in China? Will we descend further into pain on both sides of the Pacific or will we reach a new agreement of fairness that will benefit one or both of us? Debt \u2014 on both corporation and individual scales \u2014 is like a dark cloud looming on the horizon. Does this mean a hard rain is gonna fall (to appropriate Bob Dylan), and if so, how? And when, and by how much?The question marks regarding the midterm elections that consumed much of 2018 have dissipated, but to what end? Will Wall Street firms \u2014 banks, Big Tech, Big Pharma, et. al. \u2014 be expected to reign in current business behaviors by way of regulations and increased accountability, and will that somehow generate another down-leg for equities markets?So many questions. And often, whichever answer materializes may not be what investors consider optimum.Perhaps a shift in expectations is what's being asked of us currently. If so, it's important to recognize it's nothing we can't deal with; in fact, coming to terms with the headwinds we might be expected to face will help us avoid some of the worst problems that may otherwise develop. We had Goldilocks living in our house for a good year or more \u2014 perhaps it's time she moved on.Industrial Productionfor October reached 0.1% ahead of today's opening bell, lower than the 0.2% expected, which was also the downwardly revised total for September. Still positive, so that's something. OctoberCapacity Utilizationwas better, reporting 78.4% which beat expectations by 20 basis points. September numbers were ratcheted up significantly to 78.5% \u2014 the highest we've seen in nearly three years.

That's because this distribution center, opening its doors with a burst of fanfare and even a few visits from nearby politicians, isn't a jumping-off point for Macy's or Target. Instead, the warehouse is the latest in a series of new locations being opened by retail technology giant Amazon.com.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://trk.caseyresearch.com/f/?content_id=452code=EQIeditorial=amazon.com-creates-5000-jobs-destroys-25000-in-the-process\">http://trk.caseyresearch.com/f/?content_id=452code=EQIeditorial=amazon.com-creates-5000-jobs-destroys-25000-in-the-process</url>[2]<br/><br/> The jobs this new mega-warehouse is purported to create: 5,000.<br/><br/> The politicians who made the quick trip to Tennessee to get in front of the cameras included one President Barack Obama, who gave a rousing speech not just about the importance of the 5,000 jobs promised at this one facility (and another 2,000 corollary positions at customer service centers elsewhere in the country), but also about the \"need\" to raise taxes on the businesses that are creating them and use those taxes to fund \"infrastructure\" jobs in green energy and natural gas, among other areas.<br/><br/> The politically charged speech and the press conference from Amazon.comtouting its job-creation abilities have understandably drawn quite the skeptical reaction from some. But surprisingly, in all the talk I've heard in the media these past few days, most of the fury seems directed not at the proposed tax hikes, but at Amazon itself for creating what might be fewer jobs than it claims\u2026 and possibly for destroying more jobs than it creates.<br/><br/> Along with its jobs announcement, Amazon's PR department was ready for the utterly predictable media criticism that the jobs are nothing more than menial, low-wage shop floor jobs. Its retort? These new jobs will pay on average 30% higher than typical retail jobs. That's a good thing for the employed, no doubt, to be paid more for a similar skill-level job.<br/><br/> But with its emphasis on low prices, how can Amazon afford to boost those wages so much? It all boils down to efficiency. Think about Amazon versus another retailing giant without the same level of sales, but with a similar \"low prices\" kind of push: TJX companies (owners of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods). Last year, Amazon had retail sales of over $60 billion globally (up from $47 billion in 2011); TJX brought in about half that, at almost $26 billion globally (up from $23 billion in 2011).<br/><br/> Whatever the companies' similarities, the differences between the two couldn't be bigger; and those differences have profound impacts for investors, as well as for the future of our economy.<br/><br/> On one hand, you have companies like TJX\u2014so-called \"bricks and mortar\" retailers\u2014which in order to do business every day must staff a few thousand stores, and keep them open for 10, 12, or even 24 hours per day. That means greeters, checkers, security, customer service, and stockroom employees, plus bright lighting, catchy displays, and other ordinary features of a quality retail facility.<br/><br/> Companies like Amazon have bricks and mortar too, of course, as displayed on the recent junket in Tennessee. But that's about all they have. Amazon can operate in facilities far off the beaten path, with nothing but wire shelves and cement floors, and they can serve just as many customers from only a fraction of the locations\u2014and a fraction of the manpower\u2014that their competitors require. On just about every front, the company is more efficient than its peers. But let's look specifically at two of the top expenses for virtually any retail company: its plant and its people.<br/> Facilities<br/> Last year, TJX ended with 3,055 stores, making it one of the most prolific clothing and home goods retailers in the US. It pegs its sales at a respectable $8.5 million annually per store. That's not a big-box retailer like Best Buy, which racked up $25 million per store in 2011, but it's solid compared to many other clothing and home goods retailers (like Sears, with much larger stores and only $9.5 million in per location sales, or the Gap, with smaller, mall-style stores and only $5 million per outlet).<br/><br/>Amazon doesn't have stores, of course. It has \"fulfillment centers,\" just like the new one in Tennessee that the POTUS visited. As of May 2013, a few dozen such centers are scattered across the world, including 37 in the US and 2 in Canada, and another dozen plus in Europe:<br/><br/><br/><br/> Of course, it's unfair to count only fulfillment centers, as the company handles customer service at separate locations, something a retailer like TJX would normally handle mostly onsite in the stores (excepting the separate online sales division, but that constitutes only a small fraction of TJX's business). Add in those locations, plus the newest centers Amazon plans to open, and you still have fewer than 100 retail operations centers globally.<br/><br/> If we round up just to be fair, that pegs Amazon's sales per location for the past year at $660 million, or about 80 times the sales per location of a TJX.<br/><br/> In addition to the amount of dollars per square foot in revenue that Amazon can push out its doors, the company can strike deals to grab land in otherwise desolate areas for its facilities, so long as UPS and FedEx will service them\u2014no need for high-rent districts with lots of shopper traffic. This means that not only does the company have to support fewer square feet of space and make each square foot less glamorous, it can also push into districts willing to offer it big tax savings, or where construction costs are highly depressed (often one and the same). Amazon's negotiation power and economies of scale are both significantly higher than the average multi-thousand storefront retailer.<br/> Employment<br/> Of course, having more sales per location means less if you have to fill that location with just as many people to get the goods out the door. Sure, you save on the overhead from electricity to property taxes, but you can only gain so much efficiency in a labor-intensive business. But here too, Amazon's differences are broadly apparent.<br/><br/>TJX Companies Inc. has approximately 179,000 employees: as with any retailer, it's a mix of full-time, part-time, and seasonal workers.<br/><br/>Amazon's demand is just as cyclical as any other retailer. When queried at the press conference in Tennessee, a company rep wouldn't specify how many of the 5,000 promised new jobs are part-time and seasonal. He instead jumped back to the pre-approved talking point about pay being 30% higher on average. The spokesman did acknowledge that a good number of them would not be full-time, year-round positions.<br/><br/> (Amazon is able to staff much more efficiently than most retailers during non-holiday seasons, thanks to real-time, around-the-clock operations management and the ability to pull staff in for extra shifts and on short notice\u2014a more difficult task for traditional storefront retailers, because having 10 extra people show up tomorrow from midnight to 6 a.m. doesn't help move any more product. So it's reasonable to assume Amazon will have more seasonal help as a percentage than most other retailers.)<br/><br/> In all, though, Amazon has managed to grow to its current level with just about 89,000 employees, or almost exactly half of TJX's workforce. To do that yet pull down 150% more revenue makes Amazon about five times more efficient than TJX, measured by retail sales per staffer.<br/><br/>Amazon is able to do so because the number of shoppers who can be served per warehouse employee is much higher than at a typical retail location\u2014especially the smaller stores that TJX mostly uses. The same goes for all the servers the company operates: one IT guy can take the midnight shift and keep a few thousand servers up and running, but one janitor cannot clean the floors at two locations, let alone 400\u2014and many other aspects of the business share this limitation.<br/> Stacking Up Against Retail's Big Boys<br/>TJX wasn't cherry-picked as a counterexample\u2014there are many retailers with far worse operating margins than TJX to pick on if that was the goal. Amazon stands out head and shoulders above nearly all other retailers in efficiency. Even when stacked up against larger competitors which can bring more scale to the business than TJX can, such as retail megastore Walmart, whose $470 billion in sales don't put a dent in the revenue-per-employee figure:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> As is obvious above, Amazon's revenue per employee is leaps and bounds above its competition. The only other one on our short list that comes close is CVS, but despite the public perception of the company as a retailer, it now generates the overwhelming majority of its revenues from its insurance programs, so it's partially miscategorized. Even so, it still doesn't come close to Amazon in terms of revenue efficiency; CVS would need to grow its sales by greater than 50% without adding a single staffer in order to catch up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Walmart? It would have to lay off over two-thirds of its employees or triple its same-store sales to even come close.<br/><br/>Amazon's revenue efficiency is remarkable by virtually any standard. And it's one of the reasons that despite a long track record of underperforming on earnings, the company has generally stayed in the market's good graces and been granted a hefty valuation relative to its peers. The market sees Amazon for what it is\u2014a technology company with leverage that can grow revenues in a big way\u2014and not a more traditional retailer.<br/><br/> But this also means that for every jar of Crazy Aaron's Thinking Putty[3] that is shipped out the door, the number of people on the payroll is only one-fourth that of Walmart or Target\u2026 or one-fifth that of TJX.<br/> What Does This Mean for the President's Jobs Plan?<br/> Does this mean that Barack Obama is right? Does the government need to step in, tax these efficient companies harder, and spend that money on solar farms, wind turbines, and transport infrastructure? After all, you cannot efficiently deliver tens of millions of packages when roads are choked and bridges are crumbling.<br/><br/> At first glance, it would be easy to jump to that conclusion. That's the direction I heard quite a few of Tuesday and Wednesday's commentators heading with their questions, even on business-oriented stations like my morning commute companion, Bloomberg Radio.<br/><br/> And yes, in some senses, for every job Amazon \"creates,\" four other jobs go away at a company like TJX.<br/><br/> But it's not that simple. First, with any efficiency comes inefficiency on another point. The relative competitiveness of two business models is driven by the economic weight of those items in contrast to each other\u2014an equation that changes over time. For instance, Clayton Christensen eloquently pointed out years ago in his book The Innovator's Dilemma[4] (available at Amazon.com, of course) that at one point the commonplace hydraulic backhoes and diggers that litter every construction site in the modern world were once considered vastly inferior to their cable-actuated big brothers. Per foot, they couldn't\u2014and still can't\u2014dig nearly as wide a moat per pass. But it didn't matter. They won the overall market on convenient smaller sizes, easier maintenance, and better safety. Their inefficiencies were simply smaller than the value of their improvements.<br/><br/> Much the same, while you can argue about Amazon's relative efficiency to TJX, you must be careful not to discount its INefficiency. For instance, at a store like TJMaxx, one truckload of goods can restock the place for weeks. To deliver the orders of a few dozen Amazon customers might require dozens of individual packages, shipped to half a dozen different sort facilities, and put on a few dozen different trucks.<br/><br/>TJX benefits from all the dinosaur dung burned by its customers coming to the store and driving goods back home for it. Amazon, on the other hand, takes those nearly countless millions of extra miles and absorbs them into its business model. Compared in this way, Amazon is incredibly inefficient.<br/><br/> What Amazon doesn't spend hiring direct employees, the company outsources to others, and the sum of those expenses is enormous.<br/><br/> In fact, the company is so good at spending that gross margin per staffer, that it usually manages to spend it all. Just look at this graph of Amazon's gross revenue and its profits for the past five years\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/> You might have to squint to find the red bars that represent profits. The difference between those two sets of colored bars is the amount Amazon spends on not just its 89,000 employees, but all of its operations and marketing. All of those dollars flow into the economy, be it through FedEx drivers and pilots, outsourced programmers, content licensing agreements, purchases of inventory to keep its unimaginable selection of goods growing, or any of hundreds of other paths. And each path is itself a series of jobs generated and a series of taxes that eventually do flow to the government to fund all of its activities\u2014from building fences to keep out Mexicans to staffing the IRS to collect all that money.<br/><br/> Even if the company was profitable, the same would be true. Those people who made more money would be inclined to invest and spend it. The higher the relative profitability, the more free cash flow, and the more likely it is to turn into additional spending.<br/><br/> Any company whose technology improves efficiency in these ways is going to reduce employment in the affected industry. That's the breaks. But it does not necessarily mean those jobs are gone forever.<br/><br/> A time will come when the amount of efficiency gained by automation, aggregation, logistics, and other techniques puts another significant and serious dent in the demand for labor\u2014we've already seen it with low-skill manufacturing jobs, and we are seeing it take hold now in retail sales. But that does not have to mean the end of the economy or an economy of no jobs. Instead, the efficiency flows outward to create new opportunities surrounding the new business and its investors.<br/><br/> Revenue efficiency creates demand for business services. What is not done in house gets pushed to other networks of suppliers\u2014services contracted by the sellers or by the buyers. Also, profit efficiency creates income for investors, which gets reinvested into more new businesses. Just look to the Silicon Valley venture-capital scene, and you'll see years of investment gains flowing back into the markets to the tune of multiple billions of dollars per year in investments into companies bent on reinventing every area of the economy, from entertainment to building supplies to biotechnology to car rental, through technology.<br/><br/> The biggest risk to our economy and employment is not innovation, which speeds up the flow of capital. Rather, the risks to be on the lookout for are the ones that compromise the ability of businesses to innovate, or which otherwise impede the flow of capital\u2014i.e., those that restrict lending, cause people or companies to hoard cash, or generate fear and distrust among trading partners.<br/><br/> Fears over banking failures in 2008 showed just how serious this risk can be. And while the short-term reaction of shoring up liquidity in financial markets may look to have been a smart one in retrospect, the long-term lack of consequences for outright criminal activity in that sector are damning for the future of the economy. Trust in our government, bankers, and currency continues to be at all-time lows, a factor that can only be slowing the return of economic growth.<br/><br/> If Barack Obama and camp want to generate more government revenues, they should consider backing off on the new taxes and focus instead on limiting the regulations that impede the flow of capital. They should help secure confidence in the economy, not just through buoying up the stock markets, but through justice and prudent oversight over the value of our money and security of our savings.<br/><br/> Companies like Amazon thankfully continue to invest and grow despite the rising tide of operational regulations (for all the deregulation in banking over the past 20 years, the same cannot be said of any other sector) and the continued political immunity of the banking class. As it does so, its innovations are making life better for the majority of people. While the industry-wide shift of employment will be painful to some, over time the economy will adjust, as it always has, and other employment opportunities will fill the gaps created.<br/><br/> Plus, it's not like Amazon has a lock on retail efficiency. After all, Costco\u2014the star quarterback of the big-box store movement\u2014generates over $975,000 in sales per employee. Yes, it seems like even Amazon could still learn a few things.<br/><br/> As for the question of whether more efficient companies\u2014which employ software and even robots (as Amazon does in its warehouses increasingly every year) to save on labor\u2014destroy more jobs than they create\u2026 it's not as simple as it might seem at first.

I'll spare you the suspense. Just about everyone thought Zuckerberg was still the right man for the job, if not the only man for the job. This included people who work at Facebook, people who used to work at Facebook, financial analysts, venture capitalists, tech-skeptic activists, ardent critics of the company and its giddiest supporters. The consensus went like this: Even if Zuckerberg - as Facebook's founder, chief executive, chairman and most powerful shareholder - bore most of the responsibility for the company's cataclysmic recent history, he alone possessed the stature to fix it. </p><p>More than one of his supporters told me it was bad faith to even broach the subject - that Zuckerberg's indispensability was so plain that the only reason I might have to ask whether he should still run the company was the clicks I would get on this article. But even critics were not that excited about the idea of Zuckerberg's removal. Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, an organization that fights monopoly power, argued that Facebook's problems grew out of its business model and the legal and regulatory vacuum in which it has operated - not the man who runs it. \"To be blunt, if we took Mark Zuckerberg out and we replaced him with Mahatma Gandhi, I don't think the corporation would change in any significant way,\" Lynn said. That few can imagine a Facebook without Zuckerberg, 34, underscores how unaccountable our largest tech companies have become. Zuckerberg, thanks to his own drive and brilliance, has become one of the most powerful unelected people in the world. Like an errant oil company or sugar-pumping food company, Facebook makes decisions that create huge consequences for society - and he has profited handsomely from the chaos. Yet because of Facebook's ownership structure - in which Zuckerberg's shares have 10 times the voting power of ordinary shares - he is omnipotent there, answering basically to no one. This fits a pattern. Over the past two decades, the largest tech companies have created a system in which executives suffer few personal or financial consequences for their mistakes. Big tech has turned founders into fixtures - when their companies are working well, they get all the credit, and when their companies are doing badly, they are the only heroes who can fix them. There's another way to put this: For better or worse, Zuckerberg has become too big to fail. In America, it's not unusual for executives to escape punishment for how they steer their corporations (see Wall Street after the 2008 financial crisis). Still, when companies step in it badly, there are often at least calls for their leaders' dismissal. The chief executives of Equifax and Target were pushed out after data breaches. The chief executive of Wells Fargo was ousted after a scandal involving sham accounts. Even in Silicon Valley, where company founders are revered as money-laying rainbow unicorns, there is some limit to corporate patience. In the 1980s, Apple fired Steve Jobs. Last year, Uber ousted Travis Kalanick, who was as closely aligned with his company's culture as Zuckerberg is with his. Facebook's problems have not reached the level of lawlessness we saw at Uber, but they have been far more consequential. Besides the breach, Facebook has been implicated in a global breakdown of democracy, including its role as a vector for Russian disinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Investigators for the United Nations have said Facebook was instrumental to genocide in Myanmar; it has also been tied to violence in India, South Sudan and Sri Lanka. There have been privacy scandals (Cambridge Analytica most recently), advertising scandals (discriminatory ads, fishy metrics), multiple current federal inquiries, and an admission that using Facebook can be detrimental to your mental health. Even though Zuckerberg has apologized and vowed again and again and again to fix Facebook, the company's fixes often need fixing. In the past week, reporters showed that the company's recent move to clamp down on political ads has not worked - Vice News bought Facebook ads falsely stating that they were \"paid for\" by Vice President Mike Pence and ISIS. So given such failures, another question might be: Why haven't any heads rolled at Facebook? Although there have been some high-profile defections - the co-founders of WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus, all companies bought by Facebook, left in the past few months - Zuckerberg's most loyal executives have been with him through thick and thin, many for more than a decade. If Facebook admits now that its problems were caused by a too-idealistic, move-fast culture, and if it is conceding now that its culture must change, how can we be sure that's happening if most of the people who run Facebook remain the same? When I asked Facebook about this, the company argued that things were changing. It just hired Nick Clegg, a former deputy prime minister of Britain, as head of global affairs - a move that the company said imbued it with a serious outsider's perspective. The social network also put me on the phone with a top executive who argued boisterously for Zuckerberg's leadership, but declined to do so on the record. The executive explained that fixing Facebook would involve deep costs. The company is hiring more people to review content, for example, and it might have to slow down some of its most ambitious projects to address its impact on the world. The executive argued that Zuckerberg's total domination of Facebook's equity, plus the reverence in which employees hold him, allowed him to weather the financial consequences of these changes better than any other leader. Facebook's stock price plunged nearly 20 percent on a single day this summer after it reported slowing revenue growth and increased operational costs. This week, Facebook repeated its slower-growth warning. A \"professional CEO,\" one without such a huge stake in the company, would be tempted to try the easy way out, the executive suggested. But Zuckerberg was free to do what's right. Zuckerberg's supporters argued that he has shown a deep capacity to understand and address Facebook's problems. After the company went public in 2012, its stock price languished for months because it had no plan to make money from consumers' shift to mobile devices. \"Mark would tell you that he was too late in understanding the importance of mobile - but when that became apparent, Mark understood its gravity and he understood how to fix it,\" said Don Graham, a former Facebook board member and former publisher of The Washington Post. \"He changed the direction of that company incredibly fast, in detail, not by one action but by 20 actions - and if you looked at the quarter-by-quarter numbers of what percentage of Facebook's revenue was coming from mobile, I couldn't believe how fast it changed.\" The question at Facebook now is whether Zuckerberg has similarly seen the light on its current problems. He has said fixing Facebook was his personal challenge for 2018. But there are signs that its culture remains the same. Consider its promise that a new home-hub device, Portal, which it unveiled last month, would not collect information on users that could be used in ads. It had to swiftly walk back that promise because Facebook's data-collection system is so pervasive that even some of its employees don't seem to understand it. \"I think he has demonstrably failed over the last two years, and the reason he's failed is because he's unaccountable,\" said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook employee who is now chief strategy officer for the Center of Humane Technology, an activist organization. \"Given a scenario where shareholders and board members had more influence, it's hard to imagine that there would not have been changes faster.\" One fix for Facebook might be to give the board greater power over the company. Trillium Asset Management, an investment firm, recently put forward a shareholder resolution supported by several state funds that would require Zuckerberg to step down as Facebook's chairman, though he would still maintain majority voting control of the company. \"I think by taking the step to relinquish the position of the board chair, it's a very important structural change so that he would not have a completely free hand to muscle his way through decisions,\" said Jonas Kron, a Trillium senior vice president. A Facebook spokesman said the company had not yet taken a position on the resolution. In the past, similar measures have been voted down by Zuckerberg and his allies. Which leaves us here: Either Zuckerberg fixes Facebook, or no one does. That's the choice we face, like it or not.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN61576475</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNP-F9P1-JC8S-D36W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1494\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Just about everyone thought Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was still the right man for the job, if not the only man for the job. This included people who currently work at Facebook, people who used to work at Facebook, financial analysts, venture capitalists, tech-skeptic activists, ardent critics of the company and its giddiest supporters. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The consensus went like this: Even if Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>-- as Facebook's founder, chief executive, chairman and most powerful shareholder -- bore most of the responsibility for the company's cataclysmic recent history, he alone possessed the stature to fix it.</p><p>  More than one of his supporters told me it was bad faith to even broach the subject -- that Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>indispensability was so plain that the only reason I might have to ask whether he should still run the company was the clicks I would get on this article. But even critics were not that excited about the idea of Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>removal. Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, an organization that fights monopoly power, argued that Facebook's problems grew out of its business model and the legal and regulatory vacuum in which it has operated -- not the man who runs it.</p><p>  ''To be blunt, if we took <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>out and we replaced him with Mahatma Gandhi, I don't think the corporation would change in any significant way,'' Mr. Lynn said.</p><p>  That few can imagine a Facebook without Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>34, underscores how unaccountable our largest tech companies have become. Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>thanks to his own drive and brilliance, has become one of the most powerful unelected people in the world. Like an errant oil company or sugar-pumping food company, Facebookmakes decisions that create huge consequences for society -- and he has profited handsomely from the chaos.</p><p>  Yet because of Facebook's ownership structure -- in which Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>shares have 10 times the voting power of ordinary shares -- he is omnipotent there, answering basically to no one.</p><p>  This fits a pattern. Over the last two decades, the largest tech companies have created a system in which executives suffer few personal or financial consequences for their mistakes. Big tech has turned founders into fixtures -- when their companies are working well, they get all the credit, and when their companies are doing badly, they are the only heroes who can fix them.</p><p>  There's another way to put this: For better or worse, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has become too big to fail.</p><p>  In America, it's not unusual for executives to escape punishment for how they steer their corporations (see Wall Street after the 2008 financial crisis). Still, when companies step in it badly, there are often at least calls for their leaders' dismissal. The chief executives of Equifax and Target were pushed out after data breaches. The chief executive of Wells Fargo was ousted after a scandal involving sham accounts.</p><p>  Even in Silicon Valley, where company founders are revered as money-laying rainbow unicorns, there is some limit to corporate patience. In the 1980s, Apple fired Steve Jobs. Last year, Uber ousted Travis Kalanick, who was as closely aligned with his company's culture as Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is with his.</p><p>Facebook's problems have not reached the level of lawlessness we saw at Uber, but they have been far more consequential. Besides the breach, Facebookhas been implicated in a global breakdown of democracy, including its role as a vector for Russian disinformation during the 2016 American presidential election.</p><p>  Investigators for the United Nations have said Facebookwas instrumental to genocide in Myanmar; it has also been tied to violence in India, South Sudan and Sri Lanka. There have been privacy scandals (Cambridge Analytica most recently), advertising scandals (discriminatory ads, fishy metrics), multiple current federal inquiries, and an admission that using Facebookcan be detrimental to your mental health.</p><p>  Even though Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has apologized and vowed again and again and again to fix Facebook, the company's fixes often need fixing. In the last week, reporters showed that the company's recent move to clamp down on political ads has not worked -- Vice News bought Facebookads falsely stating that they were ''paid for'' by Vice President Mike Pence and ISIS.</p><p>  So given such failures, another question might be: Why haven't any heads rolled at Facebook? Although there have been some high-profile defections -- the co-founders of WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus, all companies bought by Facebook, left in the last few months -- Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>most loyal executives have been with him through thick and thin, many for more than a decade.</p><p>  If Facebookadmits now that its problems were caused by a too-idealistic, move-fast culture, and if it is conceding now that its culture must change, how can we be sure that's happening if most of the people who run Facebookremain the same?</p><p>  When I asked Facebookabout this, the company argued that things were changing. It just hired Nick Clegg, a former deputy prime minister of Britain, as head of global affairs -- a move that the company said imbued it with a serious outsider's perspective.</p><p>  The social network also put me on the phone with a top executive who argued boisterously for Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>leadership, but declined to do so on the record. The executive explained that fixing Facebookwould involve deep costs. The company is hiring more people to review content, for example, and it might have to slow down some of its most ambitious projects to address its impact on the world. The executive argued that Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>total domination of Facebook's equity, plus the reverence in which employees hold him, allowed him to weather the financial consequences of these changes better than any other leader.</p><p>Facebook's stock price plunged nearly 20 percent on a single day this summer after it reported slowing revenue growth and increased operational costs. This week, Facebookrepeated its slower-growth warning. A ''professional C.E.O.,'' one without such a huge stake in the company, would be tempted to try the easy way out, the executive suggested. But Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was free to do what's right.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>supporters also argued that he has shown a deep capacity to understand and address Facebook's problems. After the company went public in 2012, its stock price languished for months because it had no plan to make money from consumers' shift to mobile devices.</p><p>  ''Mark would tell you that he was too late in understanding the importance of mobile -- but when that became apparent, Mark understood its gravity and he understood how to fix it,'' said Don Graham, a former Facebookboard member and former publisher of The Washington Post. ''He changed the direction of that company incredibly fast, in detail, not by one action but by 20 actions -- and if you looked at the quarter-by-quarter numbers of what percentage of Facebook's revenue was coming from mobile, I couldn't believe how fast it changed.''</p><p>  The question at Facebooknow is whether Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has similarly seen the light on its current problems. He has said fixing Facebookwas his personal challenge for 2018. But there are signs that its culture remains the same.</p><p>  Consider its promise that a new home-hub device, Portal, which it unveiled this month, would not collect information on users that could be used in ads. It had to swiftly walk back that promise because Facebook's data-collection system is so pervasive that even some of its employees don't seem to understand it.</p><p>  ''I think he has demonstrably failed over the last two years, and the reason he's failed is because he's unaccountable,'' said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebookemployee who is now chief strategy officer for the Center of Humane Technology, an activist organization. ''Given a scenario where shareholders and board members had more influence, it's hard to imagine that there would not have been changes faster.''</p><p>  One fix for Facebookmight be to give the board greater power over the company. Trillium Asset Management, an investment firm, recently put forward a shareholder resolution supported by several state funds that would require Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to step down as Facebook's chairman, though he would still maintain majority voting control of the company.</p><p>  ''I think by taking the step to relinquish the position of the board chair, it's a very important structural change so that he would not have a completely free hand to muscle his way through decisions,'' said Jonas Kron, a Trillium senior vice president.</p><p>  A Facebook spokesman said the company had not yet taken a position on the resolution. In the past, similar measures have been voted down by Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and his allies.</p><p>  Which leaves us here: Either Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>fixes Facebook, or no one does. That's the choice we face, like it or not.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Because <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>Facebookshares have 10 times the voting power of ordinary shares, he is omnipotent there, answering basically to no one.

Just about everyone thought Mr. Zuckerberg was still the right man for the job, if not the only man for the job. This included people who currently work at Facebook, people who used to work at Facebook, financial analysts, venture capitalists, tech-skeptic activists, ardent critics of the company and its giddiest supporters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The consensus went like this: Even if Mr. Zuckerberg - as Facebook's founder, chief executive, chairman and most powerful shareholder - bore most of the responsibility for the company's cataclysmic recent history, he alone possessed the stature to fix it.</p><p>More than one of his supporters told me it was bad faith to even broach the subject - that Mr. Zuckerberg's indispensability was so plain that the only reason I might have to ask whether he should still run the company was the clicks I would get on this article. But even critics were not that excited about the idea of Mr. Zuckerberg's removal. Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, an organization that fights monopoly power, argued that Facebook's problems grew out of its business model and the legal and regulatory vacuum in which it has operated - not the man who runs it.</p><p>\"To be blunt, if we took Mark Zuckerberg out and we replaced him with Mahatma Gandhi, I don't think the corporation would change in any significant way,\" Mr. Lynn said.</p><p>That few can imagine a Facebook without Mr. Zuckerberg, 34, underscores how unaccountable our largest tech companies have become. Mr. Zuckerberg, thanks to his own drive and brilliance, has become one of the most powerful unelected people in the world. Like an errant oil company or sugar-pumping food company, Facebook makes decisions that create huge consequences for society - and he has profited handsomely from the chaos.</p><p>Yet because of Facebook's ownership structure - in which Mr. Zuckerberg's shares have 10 times the voting power of ordinary shares - he is omnipotent there, answering basically to no one.</p><p>This fits a pattern. Over the last two decades, the largest tech companies have created a system in which executives suffer few personal or financial consequences for their mistakes. Big tech has turned founders into fixtures - when their companies are working well, they get all the credit, and when their companies are doing badly, they are the only heroes who can fix them.</p><p>There's another way to put this: For better or worse, Mr. Zuckerberg has become too big to fail.</p><p>In America, it's not unusual for executives to escape punishment for how they steer their corporations (see Wall Street after the 2008 financial crisis). Still, when companies step in it badly, there are often at least calls for their leaders' dismissal. The chief executives of Equifax and Target were pushed out after data breaches. The chief executive of Wells Fargo was ousted after a scandal involving sham accounts.</p><p>Even in Silicon Valley, where company founders are revered as money-laying rainbow unicorns, there is some limit to corporate patience. In the 1980s, Apple fired Steve Jobs. Last year, Uber ousted Travis Kalanick, who was as closely aligned with his company's culture as Mr. Zuckerberg is with his.</p><p>Facebook's problems have not reached the level of lawlessness we saw at Uber, but they have been far more consequential. Besides the breach, Facebook has been implicated in a global breakdown of democracy, including its role as a vector for Russian disinformation during the 2016 American presidential election.</p><p>Investigators for the United Nations have said Facebook was instrumental to genocide in Myanmar; it has also been tied to violence in India, South Sudan and Sri Lanka. There have been privacy scandals (Cambridge Analytica most recently), advertising scandals (discriminatory ads, fishy metrics), multiple current federal inquiries, and an admission that using Facebook can be detrimental to your mental health.</p><p>Even though Mr. Zuckerberg has apologized and vowed again and again and again to fix Facebook, the company's fixes often need fixing. In the last week, reporters showed that the company's recent move to clamp down on political ads has not worked - Vice News bought Facebook ads falsely stating that they were \"paid for\" by Vice President Mike Pence and ISIS.</p><p>So given such failures, another question might be: Why haven't any heads rolled at Facebook? Although there have been some high-profile defections - the co-founders of WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus, all companies bought by Facebook, left in the last few months - Mr. Zuckerberg's most loyal executives have been with him through thick and thin, many for more than a decade.</p><p>If Facebook admits now that its problems were caused by a too-idealistic, move-fast culture, and if it is conceding now that its culture must change, how can we be sure that's happening if most of the people who run Facebook remain the same?</p><p>When I asked Facebook about this, the company argued that things were changing.

That's the choice we face, like it or not.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com\">farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com</email>; Twitter: @fmanjoo.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006190399</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TMG-XHW1-DYR7-C00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1547\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 2, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Welcome to this weekly roundup of Business Insider stories from executive editor Matt Turner.Subscribe here to get this newsletter in your inbox every Sunday.[1] Read on for news on how Facebook turned it into a haven for misinformation and conspiracy theories[2], McDonald's worst nightmare[3], and former employees of Tanya Zuckerbrot's popular F-Factor diet speaking out.[4] How Facebook turned it into a haven for misinformation and conspiracy theories From Rob Price:In recent months, posts and pages with misinformation about voting by mail and inflammatory allegations about politicians, as well as posts promoting armed right-wing militias and nazi symbolism, have spread across the social network, sometimes racking up millions of views.To anyone who visited Facebook in its earlier, more innocent years, the new tone of Facebook might come as a shock.For most of its 16-year existence the company has been better known for its ability to dredge up ex-school friends and its catalogue of embarrassing old photos than for any monumental political influence and societal controversy.So how did Facebook become an integral part of the modern American right-wing machine?It happened gradually over a period of several years, enabled by a competitive urge to own the conversations that fuel social media, a pattern of tuning out warning signs and a need to stay in the good graces of politicians and government regulators.And of course, it involves an $80 billion advertising business that grows larger the more that users of the social network stay active and engaged \u2014 regardless of what drives the engagement.Read the story in full here: How Mark Zuckerberg's competitiveness and attempts to keep Facebook politically neutral turned it into a haven for misinformation and conspiracy theories that can swing elections[5]McDonald's worst nightmare From Kate Taylor:McDonald's sued Steve Easterbrook in August, alleging the former CEO covered up sexual relationships with three female employees during his last year at the helm of the fast-food giant.Easterbrook had been fired from McDonald's in November 2019, after the company investigated a different relationship between the then-CEO and an employee that reportedly included exchanging sexually explicit text messages and photographs, but not physical contact.Business Insider spoke with more than half a dozen McDonald's insiders \u2014 including corporate employees, franchisees, and Easterbrook's ex-girlfriend \u2014 about the former CEO's rise and fall.Some insiders saw Easterbrook as a flirt who enjoyed his status as a bachelor, especially as he found success turning around McDonald's business.Read the story in full: Insiders reveal how former McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook went from the chain's savior to its worst nightmare as sex-scandal accusations threaten to envelop the fast-food giant[6]Former employees of Tanya Zuckerbrot's popular F-Factor diet say she fat-shamed colleagues From Dana Schuster:The popular F-Factor diet has come under fire, with some users claiming it's made them sick.Now former employees tell Insider that its founder, Tanya Zuckerbrot, policed their meals and told sexual jokes in the office that made them uncomfortable.One ex-employee said she was \"fat shamed\" for bringing whole-wheat pasta and homemade turkey meatballs to work for lunch.Zuckerbrot has denied the allegations, saying they're part of a smear campaign against her and F-Factor.Read the story in full: Former employees of Tanya Zuckerbrot's popular F-Factor diet say she fat-shamed colleagues and policed their eating, causing terrified staffers to snack in secret[7]ICYMI: Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings explains the company's controversial policies Netflix is famous for its unusual corporate policies \u2014 including unlimited vacation, direct and candid performance feedback, and the so-called \"Keeper Test,\" which encourages managers to constantly evaluate whether they should keep or fire lackluster employees.Netflix cofounder and co-CEO Reed Hastings has written a new book \u2014 \"No Rules Rules\" \u2014 all about how those controversial policies have made Netflix one of the world's most innovative companies. </p><p>He talked to Insider global editor-in-chief Nich Carlson about its controversial policies.You can listen to the interview here: LISTEN: Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings explains the company's controversial policies, including that managers should fire everyone they wouldn't fight to keep on their team[8] You can also read an op-ed from Hastings himself right here: Netflix CEO Reed Hastings says workplace rules are dead and credits much of the company's success to scrapping strict office policies[9]SIGN UP: How to be a smarter investor now Before I go, I want to highlight two upcoming events.

Subscribe here to get this newsletter in your inbox every Sunday.  Read on for news on how Facebook turned it into a haven for misinformation and conspiracy theories , McDonald's worst nightmare , and former employees of Tanya Zuckerbrot's popular F-Factor diet speaking out.  How Facebook turned it into a haven for misinformation and conspiracy theories   Hello!  I still remember the first time I heard about Facebook. It was late 2005, and I was catching up with old friends who both attended a different university in the UK where the site had already established a following. They joked about their classmates who would post there all the time.15 years later, it's easy to wonder how Facebook morphed from that early iteration into what it has become today.  From Rob Price:   In recent months, posts and pages with misinformation about voting by mail and inflammatory allegations about politicians, as well as posts promoting armed right-wing militias and nazi symbolism, have spread across the social network, sometimes racking up millions of views.    To anyone who visited Facebook in its earlier, more innocent years, the new tone of Facebook might come as a shock.   For most of its 16-year existence the company has been better known for its ability to dredge up ex-school friends and its catalogue of embarrassing old photos than for any monumental political influence and societal controversy.  So how did Facebook become an integral part of the modern American right-wing machine?  It happened gradually over a period of several years, enabled by a competitive urge to own the conversations that fuel social media, a pattern of tuning out warning signs and a need to stay in the good graces of politicians and government regulators.    And of course, it involves an $80 billion advertising business that grows larger the more that users of the social network stay active and engaged \u2014 regardless of what drives the engagement.  Read the story in full here: McDonald's worst nightmare  Mike Nudelman/Business Insider   From Kate Taylor:    McDonald's sued Steve Easterbrook in August, alleging the former CEO covered up sexual relationships with three female employees during his last year at the helm of the fast-food giant.   Easterbrook had been fired from McDonald's in November 2019, after the company investigated a different relationship between the then-CEO and an employee that reportedly included exchanging sexually explicit text messages and photographs, but not physical contact. Business Insider spoke with more than half a dozen McDonald's insiders \u2014 including corporate employees, franchisees, and Easterbrook's ex-girlfriend \u2014 about the former CEO's rise and fall.   Some insiders saw Easterbrook as a flirt who enjoyed his status as a bachelor, especially as he found success turning around McDonald's business.  Read the story in full:  Insiders reveal how former McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook went from the chain's savior to its worst nightmare as sex-scandal accusations threaten to envelop the fast-food giant   Former employees of Tanya Zuckerbrot's popular F-Factor diet say she fat-shamed colleagues  Tanya Zuckerbrot at the SoulCycle Wellness &amp; Nutrition Panel in Bridgehampton, NY. (Photo by ADRIEL REBOH/Patrick McMullan via )   From Dana Schuster:   The popular F-Factor diet has come under fire, with some users claiming it's made them sick.  Now former employees tell Insider that its founder, Tanya Zuckerbrot, policed their meals and told sexual jokes in the office that made them uncomfortable.  One ex-employee said she was \"fat shamed\" for bringing whole-wheat pasta and homemade turkey meatballs to work for lunch.    Zuckerbrot has denied the allegations, saying they're part of a smear campaign against her and F-Factor.  Read the story in full:  Former employees of Tanya Zuckerbrot's popular F-Factor diet say she fat-shamed colleagues and policed their eating, causing terrified staffers to snack in secret   ICYMI: Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings explains the company's controversial policies  Reed Hastings discussed his new book. (Photo by Jacopo Raule/)   Netflix is famous for its unusual corporate policies \u2014 including unlimited vacation, direct and candid performance feedback, and the so-called \"Keeper Test,\" which encourages managers to constantly evaluate whether they should keep or fire lackluster employees.    Netflix cofounder and co-CEO Reed Hastings has written a new book \u2014 \"No Rules Rules\" \u2014 all about how those controversial policies have made Netflix one of the world's most innovative companies. He talked to Insider global editor-in-chief Nich Carlson about its controversial policies.

Read on for news on how Facebook became a haven for misinformation and conspiracy theories , McDonald's worst nightmare , and former employees of Tanya Zuckerbrot's popular F-Factor diet speaking out.   How Facebook became a haven for misinformation  Hello!I still remember the first time I heard about Facebook. It was late 2005, and I was catching up with old friends who both attended a different university in the UK where the site had already established a following. They joked about their classmates who would post there all the time.  15 years later, it's easy to wonder how Facebook morphed from that early iteration into what it has become today.  From Rob Price:    In recent months, posts and pages with misinformation about voting by mail and inflammatory allegations about politicians, as well as posts promoting armed right-wing militias and nazi symbolism, have spread across the social network, sometimes racking up millions of views.   To anyone who visited Facebook in its earlier, more innocent years, the new tone of Facebook might come as a shock.  For most of its 16-year existence the company has been better known for its ability to dredge up ex-school friends and its catalogue of embarrassing old photos than for any monumental political influence and societal controversy.  So how did Facebook become an integral part of the modern American right-wing machine?    It happened gradually over a period of several years, enabled by a competitive urge to own the conversations that fuel social media, a pattern of tuning out warning signs and a need to stay in the good graces of politicians and government regulators.   And of course, it involves an $80 billion advertising business that grows larger the more that users of the social network stay active and engaged \u2014 regardless of what drives the engagement.

They are an increasingly important channel to help raise capital.</p><p>The ASX, which regulates company disclosure and polices keeping the market properly informed, is increasingly focused on the sector.</p><p>\"We have had cause to take action on fronts that are more unusual than traditional over the last six to 12 months, such as sponsored content and use of social media, even though they have long been areas we've monitored,\" ASX spokesman Matthew Gibbs said, noting advertorials in newspapers including The Australian Financial Review were a popular platform earlier in the year.</p><p>\"ASX is very alert to promoters using various social and other media platforms to 'promote' or 'pump up' stocks to which they're connected. And we're also alive to the issue of 'independent' research funded by companies themselves.\"</p><p>A spokesman for The Australian Securities and Investment Commission, which is focused on real-time market surveillance for investigating alleged market manipulation, said they were alert to the rising trend.</p><p>Within the industry there is also concern, as well as recognition, that there are few other effective ways to get the word out about micro-cap stocks, some of which have been outstanding performers.</p><p>In June of this year, Stocks Digital, one of the earliest and largest online stock promotion websites, wrote to now prime minister Scott Morrison to outline their concerns.</p><p>\"Businesses such as ours who are disadvantaged in the marketplace by the same unauthorised and unlicensed persons. These persons continue to offer and promise 'Riches' to investors with seeming impunity,\" wrote StocksDigital in the letter.</p><p>The letter called out five competitors it felt the regulator should be paying more attention to, although in a copy of the letter seen by AFR Weekend the names were redacted.</p><p>StocksDigital asked Morrison \"to direct the attention of ASIC and its investigators at these organisations and ensure Australian investors ... are protected from those who publicly and defiantly fail to comply with the law and manipulate the market with snake oil promotions\".</p><p>As one of the earlier movers in this market, it's a bold step for StocksDigital - which has many of its own critics in an increasingly snipey, but booming area where news is blurred with promotion.</p><p>Just months ago, StocksDigital was weighing up the merits of its own sharemarket listing, telling potential investors it was generating profits of about $2 million a year.</p><p>As micro-cap companies rush to market, the cottage industry that had been restricted to those with a moderate social media following has institutionalised and professionalised. But for many, it's still a relatively opaque world that is forging a different set of rules.</p><p>Businesses have been built to cash in on the paid promotion of small companies, many of which are seeking ways to market directly to retail investors who can be critical in getting an IPO over the line, due to the \"spread\" rule, which requires 300 or more investors to invest a minimum of $2000.</p><p>\"Their simple premise is 'the days of going to brokers is gone so why don't you come to us. We know where the investors are and we can help you find them',\" says a corporate adviser. \"But they are not [all] licensed, not regulated under the Corporations Act and are just promoting stocks willy-nilly.\"</p><p>StocksDigital said regulators were \"having a bit of trouble keeping up\" with the new breed of stock promoters.</p><p>\"The new wave of unlicensed stock promotion via social media, blogs and news websites is the wild west and difficult to police,\" it said, adding StocksDigital operates under an Australian Financial Services Licence with accompanying regulation.</p><p>\"Helping investors make informed decisions is about cross-checking facts, intelligent interpretation, and full disclosure ... These days anyone can spin up a $30 website and try to charge thousands of dollars to promote a stock with little accountability to either investors or the companies.\"</p><p>It can be hard to tell what is paid for and what isn't. Mainstream media publications, including The Australian Financial Review, regularly run paid-for advertorials that are used by companies to promote their businesses.</p><p>Sometimes, they too can overstep.</p><p>In presentations to market participants, the ASX has highlighted issues with disclosure of customer contracts, including announcing contracts without any details, disclosing revenue projections that do not have a proper basis. More relevant to social media promoters or newsletter writers is the use of commissioned research reports to publish \"objectional material\", including forward estimates that haven't been released to the market.</p><p>It's an industry that has helped propel a hashtag: #DYOR - do your own research - to a whole new level.</p><p>StocksDigital, which lists Big Un, Creso Pharma, Lithium Australia, Orinoco, MMJ Phyotech and Milestone Sports as clients on its website, charges $19,500 for a typical three-month \"engagement\", according to one quote, and the client would be expect to reach 11,000 \"targeted and engaged investors\".</p><p>Sometimes this can be paid for in company scrip, sometimes cash. StocksDigital breaks down the three-month fee into $5000 for the initial engagement and $3500 for each month after that. And it says the \"large, in-depth article\" guarantees 5000 readers with a minimum view time of 4.37 seconds. Additional investor articles are $7500 for one or $20,000 for four. There's also booster packages - for an extra fee.</p><p>Another service that blurs the lines between promotion and news is Bulls N Bears, a joint venture involving Business News. It says its point of difference is that it \"guarantees coverage in The West Australian\", including a daily breaking news email bulletin loaded on to The West Australian's website, posted to the The West Australian's Twitter account and The West Australian Facebook account. The cost? $1575 a month. The same monthly fee also covers managing the company's Twitter account.</p><p>\"Our stories go out under the banner of existing mainstream news media outlets, which adds considerable news credibility to them\" is part of the pitch, according to an email.</p><p>When contacted by the AFR Weekend, Bulls N Bears said: \"Our clients do not pay us for the news content of the articles but rather they pay us to ensure their ASX news is actually covered - how we cover it [is] how we see it.\" It said the company would not take stock or options for its services.</p><p>\"For whatever reason the mainstream media has gravitated towards large-cap stories over the last decade ... there is still a very strong market interest in the activities of small-cap companies that are doing interesting things.</p><p>\"Bulls N Bears exists to ensure that the news relating to the next big tech play or the next massive biotech breakthrough or the next big lithium find is covered along the way before it becomes obvious to the wider news audience. We can smell a beat-up a mile away too and, whilst it doesn't happen all that often, we won't hesitate to walk away from those companies who are just relentlessly trying to whip the donkey that won't move because it has no ability.\"</p><p>Also in the mix is Stockhead, which has told potential clients it is targeting coverage of two positive articles for every 1.5 negative articles across the site, which the company denied.</p><p>\"There is not - and has never been - a ratio or any policy regarding 'positive' to 'negative' stories on Stockhead. Editorial decision-making is based solely on newsworthiness,\" Stockhead said. The company does not accept scrip as payment.</p><p>The cost of working with the platform is variable; the offering starts at $4000 a month.</p><p>Stockhead is owned by AG Media Investments, which has some common shareholders with investor relations firm Media &amp; Capital Partners. Like more mainstream publications, the pitch to clients is that the sponsored content is labelled \"special report\" and interspersed with news stories. The claim is 75 per cent of the website's content is independent. (The website says 100 per cent of the journalism is independent, presumably excluding sponsored content).</p><p>And, despite these newer upstarts, stock forum HotCopper is a stayer in the spruiker infrastructure. The influential platform listed on the ASX in 2016.</p><p>The company says in its marketing pitch that it is the largest financial news site with more page views than Google Finance, the ASX, news.com.au and The Australian Financial Review per Nielsen ratings. It says the $12,000 spend for its Corporate Spotlight package - effectively a banner advert on the company's forum home page - will increase its audience by 3.5 times.</p><p>Hot Copper charges $12,500 a time for an email blast to its large base of registered users. A few years ago that was closer to $20,000. The company says that reduction is due to increased competition, as well as a move away from the so-called \"sugar hit\" or one-off promotion to more sustained campaigns that roll out over a year. The site gets about 10,000 posts a day, with about 150 reported for moderating and 40 per cent of that number cleared.</p><p>HotCopper said that, while the company doesn't take shares or options for services, it sometimes will take a \"matching stake\" in an equity raise. In other words, it will invest the cash it has been paid for services in the company. The company said the shares were voluntarily escrowed for six months, and the portfolio managed by Perth broker Euroz. The board therefore doesn't make portfolio decisions, removing potential conflicts of interest.</p><p>But last year regulators demanded that the company disclose that these were paid advertisements from the company and that HotCopper did \"not endorse, approve or have responsibility\" for the offers and statements.</p><p>\"We see our biggest competitor as Twitter,\" HotCopper said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc71znl96pidzg8dmrhhr</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T9R-2JW1-F0J6-J2GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1780\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission are considering industrywide antitrust investigations.</p><p>But Microsoft has been left out of the antitrust conversation. Investors don't appear to be nervous at all about antitrust concerns for Microsoft despite its growing clout in the cloud software market. </p><p>Microsoft is currently the most valuable company in the world, worth $1.06 trillion. The stock is up more than 35% this year. </p><p>Although tech investors are mostly shrugging their shoulders about regulation --- Alphabet is up 7% this year, Amazon and Apple have each soared more than 25%, and Facebook has skyrocketed nearly 50% --- all four stocks have pulled back a bit in the past few months because of legal worries. </p><p>Microsoft, on the other hand, is the only Big Tech company still trading near an all-time high. It's the best performer in the Dow.</p><p>Microsoft has already faced antitrust concerns</p><p>Microsoft may be more immune to any regulatory or legislative threats from the Trump administration and Congress this year than other tech companies, as well as from whomever is calling the shots in Washington after the 2020 elections. </p><p>Why is this the case? It's partly because Microsoft already had its antitrust day of reckoning back in the 1990s and 2000s. </p><p>Microsoft paid big fines in the United States and European Union to settle various charges that it engaged in monopolistic practices related to its dominant position in the business software market through its ownership of Windows and the Internet Explorer web browser. But it avoided the worst-case scenario: being broken up.</p><p>In other words, Microsoft has been there and done that. </p><p>Microsoft also built up a gigantic hoard of cash to protect itself from litigation worries. And even after paying numerous fines, Microsoft still has $131.6 billion in cash now --- more than enough to pay a healthy dividend, buy back stock and keep acquiring companies.</p><p>That's a big reason why the company continued to thrive even as it fought with the government. </p><p>\"Over the 10+ years of wrangling with the DOJ, the stock appreciated approximately 900%,\" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill pointed out in a report this month. That, Thill noted, was a 23% compound annual return. </p><p>While Microsoft was engaged in its long legal battle over the course of a decade, competitors such as Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook emerged as competitive threats. </p><p>So Microsoft may no longer be in regulatory crosshairs because the government has newer --- if not necessarily bigger --- fish to fry.</p><p>Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this report. </p><p>But Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said in a speech at the DC Economic Club on Monday that \"the government needs to get involved.\" Gates, who retired from day-to-day work at Microsoft more than a decade ago and stepped down as chairman in 2014, added that \"there will be more regulation of the tech sector, things like privacy.\" </p><p>Gates also said he thinks that \"the technology companies, partly because of the lesson of Microsoft\" are now \"very engaged\" with regulators.</p><p>Focus on cloud has paid off - and then some</p><p>Microsoft has adeptly pivoted to a cloud-based model for its Office suite of software under CEO Satya Nadella, and it has launched Azure for cloud hosting. The company made a series of smart acquisitions to get even bigger in various parts of the enterprise software market too; buying Skype and LinkedIn, for example.</p><p>It also doesn't hurt that Microsoft isn't really much of a consumer tech company, which has tended to be a more fickle part of the market. </p><p>\"Microsoft has been through this before. The spotlight is on all these other players. Plus, Microsoft is so centered on business customers while the rest are focused on consumers,\" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager with Synovus Trust Company. </p><p>Microsoft is a leader in many markets but now has several big rivals</p><p>Microsoft has also avoided regulatory scrutiny because it isn't as dominant in its many businesses as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are in online retail, music and mobile apps, social networking and search.</p><p>Microsoft's Azure faces tough competitive challenges from Amazon's AWS cloud unit, as well as cloud offerings from rival firms Oracle, IBM and SAP.</p><p>\"Bezos and AWS continue to clearly be a major force in the emerging cloud shift over the coming years,\" said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a report this month.</p><p>In gaming, Microsoft has to contend with both Sony and Nintendo. And Microsoft's Skype has numerous rivals, including Google's Hangouts, Apple's FaceTime and Facebook-owned WhatsApp. </p><p>And even Microsoft's new Teams office collaboration tool is a bit of an underdog in the market, competing with newly public Slack. </p><p>Although Microsoft is a market leader in more markets than it was during the 1990s, it's hard to make the case that Microsoft is the only dominant game in town like it was when consumers and businesses were largely held hostage by Windows and IE. </p><p>That's why Microsoft may continue to avoid the glare of regulators, even as Trump and Congress target Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Assuming the mantle of Brandeis gives the neo-Brandeisians a historically grounded brand but also comes with some baggage. Among other things, the neo-Brandeisians need to be prepared to answer the following questions: (1) Will they follow Brandeis in seeing bigness as a curse not only in business but also in government? (2) Will they break cleanly with welfarism and adhere to a moral, social, and political theory of anti-bigness, even at the cost of efficiency? and (3) Will they commit themselves genuinely to Brandeis\u2019s empiricism\u2014that facts on the ground trump theories, wherever the facts may lead?</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the last two years, the self-styled neo-Brandeis movement has emerged out of virtually nowhere to claim a position at the bargaining table over antitrust reform and the future of the antitrust enterprise. Unlike the Chicago School, which spent more than two decades laying the intellectual framework for its assault on the structuralist status quo before it emerged as an influential force in the courts and, among political elites, the neo-Brandeisians are just beginning to articulate their agenda on a scholarly basis even as they are already at the center of antitrust reform discussions in Washington. The simultaneity of the neo-Brandeisians\u2019 efforts to articulate their agenda on a scholarly basis with their political influence may not be an obstacle in this case, since the neo-Brandeisians seem mostly to be courting the expressly political branches of government\u2014the President (mostly presidential candidates) and especially Congress\u2014rather than the courts, which typically take a longer incubation period to bring on board a movement. Nonetheless, to skeptics of the movement like myself, the lack of a significant body of work articulating the movement\u2019s views creates a framing difficulty\u2014how does one critique a movement without a canon of literature or, to date, any tangible political or judicial achievements?</p><p>The fortunate answer is that the neo-Brandeisians are not purportedly creating their movement from whole cloth but instead are seeking to return to an antitrust school of the past\u2014the one, of course, associated with Justice Louis Brandeis and his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Curse of Bigness</emphasis>. 1  By styling themselves as neo-Brandeisians rather than simple Brandeisians, the neo-Brandeisians have left themselves the wiggle room to take those aspects of Brandeis that they find congenial and to dismiss those superseded by the passage of time or their own finer sensibilities. Nonetheless, it seems only fair to hold the neo-Brandeisians to the core views of their patron saint. In that spirit, this essay shall review three key aspects of the original Brandeis and his immediate followers and inquire whether the neo-Brandeisians are willing to go along. They are: (1) Brandeis\u2019 abhorrence not only of big business but also of big government, and particularly of the centralizing tendencies of President Franklin Delano Roosvelt\u2019s New Deal, which Brandeis voted sharply to curtail as a Justice of the Supreme Court; (2) the candid admission by Brandeis, or at least various of Brandeis\u2019s followers, that implementation of an anti-bigness ideology would entail losses of productive efficiencies and hence impose costs on consumer interests; and (3) Brandeis\u2019s insistence that facts should always trump theories, wherever the facts might lead.</p><h>I. The Curse of Bigness\u2014In Everything</h><p>Perhaps the most comprehensive articulation of the neo-Brandeisian agenda to date can be found in Tim Wu\u2019s eloquent monograph <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age</emphasis>. 2  In chapters that cover the history of the monopolization movement, Brandeis\u2019 anti-bigness vision for a \u201cright to live and not merely exist,\u201d Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s trustbusting \u201cbig cases,\u201d the rise and triumph of the Chicago School, and Big Tech\u2019s invidious rise to dominance, Wu presents a lively picture of the world of concentrated power that Brandeis fought to overcome through law and that was tragically recreated once Brandeis\u2019s influence waned. In conclusion, Wu prescribes a stern dose of Brandeisianism in the form of reinvigorated merger review, a democratic process for merger control, boldness to bring \u201cbig cases\u201d and break up big firms, institutional processes for market investigations, and a \u201cprotection of competition\u201d test to replace the consumer welfare standard. 3 </p><p>Similarly, neo-Brandeisians Zephyr Teachout and Lina Khan\u2019s paper on the politics of market structure argues that \u201cmarket structure is deeply political\u201d and presents a taxonomy of ways in which market power translates into political power. 4  After describing three conventional categories\u2014setting policy, regulating markets, and taxing\u2014in which companies with market power appropriate conventionally governmental functions, Teachout and Khan propose a fourth Brandeisian category\u2014dominance, which represents a catchall of invidious ways in which dominant companies arrogate political power to themselves. 5  Bigness is a curse not only to consumers but also to citizens in democratic societies.</p><p>Brandeis surely would have agreed with much of Wu, Khan, and Teachout\u2019s analysis, but he would not have stopped his harangue against bigness with industry. When Brandeis imagined bigness as a curse, he did not limit his indictment to big business. He also included big government or at least a big federal government. That Brandeis was egalitarian in his abhorrence of bigness in government, and business is a central theme of Jeffrey Rosen\u2019s recent work on Brandeis. As Rosen writes, \u201cDenouncing big banks as well as big government as symptoms of what he called a \u2018curse of bigness,\u2019 Brandeis was determined to diminish concentrated financial and federal power, which he viewed as a menace to liberty and democracy.\u201d 6 </p><p>Brandeis\u2019s crusade against bigness in government was not limited to rhetoric. As a Supreme Court Justice, Brandeis not only voted to strike down key pieces of New Deal legislation, he also served up personal warnings to the President that further aggrandizements of federal power would meet resistance at the Supreme Court. Brandeis detested the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration because they created too much centralized power in the federal government. 7  In January 1935, he joined the majority in striking down the \u201chot oil\u201d section of the NIRA that allowed the president to ban shipment in interstate commerce of oil that exceeded state-set production limits. 8  On \u201cBlack Monday,\u201d May 27, 1935, Brandeis again joined the majority in three opinions striking down key elements of the New Deal concerning debt relief, 9  the President\u2019s removal power over Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioners, 10  and industry codes under the NIRA. 11  President Roosevelt was purportedly so incensed with the latter decision and its limitations on the federal commerce clause power that he compared it to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dred Scott</emphasis> and warned that it would have dire consequences for the nation. 12  Unperturbed by the wrath of the President and his New Deal coalition, Brandeis conveyed the following message to the White House: \u201cThis is the end of this business of centralization, and I want you to go back and tell the President that we\u2019re not going to let this government centralize everything. It\u2019s come to an end.\u201d 13 </p><p>Can one seriously style herself a Brandeisian if she adopts Brandeis\u2019s abhorrence of bigness in industry but not in government? At least some of the neo-Brandeisians seems to think so. Senator Elizabeth Warren has wrapped herself in the mantle of Brandeis, arguing against a concentration of business power that \u201ccrushes competition\u201d and aggrandizes monopolists. 14  But she also supports vast expansions of the federal government, such as the Green New Deal, which calls for immense federal works projects in electricity, transportation, Internet, and housing that would dwarf the New Deal. 15  This is surely quite selective anti-bigness.</p><p>Of course, nothing says that as a general matter one must be anti-bigness as to both industry and government, or not at all. Over the course of American history, a range of attitudes toward bigness have developed. For simplicity, we may organize them in the following two-by-two matrix:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"176\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"208\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">Against Big Business</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">For Big Business</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Against big government</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Thomas Jefferson, Louis Brandeis</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Ronald Reagan, Robert Bork</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For big government</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Franklin Roosevelt, Elizabeth Warren</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Alexander Hamilton, Theodore Roosevelt</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Of the four combinations shown, only the Jefferson/Brandeis qualifies as pervasively anti-bigness. The other three embrace some aspect of bigness, in government, business, or both. One can choose to align oneself with any of these traditions, or chose some other option\u2014it\u2019s a free country! But it is questionable whether the mantle of Brandeis should be worn by those not fitting into the first box, into the Jeffersonian tradition with which Brandeis himself so strongly associated. It was that tradition that exalted the yeoman farmer and small-scale local government, while abhorring the \u201cMonster Bank\u201d and the bloated federal government that spawned it, that Brandeis saw as his lineage.</p><p>Beyond the question of whether those in the big government/small business camp can rightly call themselves Brandeisian, there is a substantive question to engage about the relationship between scale in government and scale in business. Arguably, the anti-bigness strand in the American psyche finds its most fertile ground for political expression when bigness of one kind grows out of proportion to bigness of other kinds. The anti-bigness sentiment may be most of all one of balance: no institution or sector should grow so large as to swamp its countervailing forces. Writing in the mid-1960s, historian Richard Hofstadter observed that \u201cAmericans have always had to balance their love of bigness and efficiency against their fear of power and their regard for individualism and competition.\u201d 16  During the sixties, Hofstadter noted, Americans ranked their concerns about the bigness of big business behind their concerns about the bigness of the federal government and labor unions. 17  Today, the popular resurgence of antitrust sentiment may have something to do with the continual retreat of both the federal government and organized labor influence since the 1980s, leading to a feeling that big business is increasingly unconstrained by offsetting social and political forces. See the growing calls for more antitrust enforcement to counter employer monopsony power in labor markets. 18 </p><p>That the strongest inclination of the anti-bigness sentiment may be a demand for checks and balances rather than an abhorrence of bigness per se should be instructive to the neo-Brandeisians. The rising contemporary antitrust movement does not exist in isolation from other social and political currents. Arresting bigness in business today while promoting a continued growth in the federal government is not a sustainable long-run solution.</p><h>II. Candor on the Costs of Anti-Bigness</h><p>The core of the Brandeisian critique of business power is not welfarist in the contemporary economic sense, which is to say it does not seek to quantify, and then to maximize, the welfare of society through rules of the road that optimize the allocation of social resources. Rather, it is a social critique of power that understands economic dominance as deeply corrosive to a broad set of liberal democratic values. 19  That said, the neo-Brandeisians have grown up in a welfarist world where contestants over the direction of antitrust law, and legal policy more generally, are accustomed to presenting their arguments in welfarist terms. Further, the idea that antitrust law should promote consumer welfare enjoyed broad bi-partisan acceptance for a long time (although, of course, there was intense contestation over the meaning and scope of the consumer welfare standard) and grew rhetorically not only out of the Chicago School right but also the Naderian left. 20  It is therefore understandable that, although their real interest is in advancing a social critique of power, the neo-Brandeisians often couch their arguments in at least partially welfarist terms.</p><p>Consider Lina Khan\u2019s recent article advocating a return to legal rules requiring the separation of platforms and commerce. 21  Khan argues that her proposed separation rules could be justified solely in consumer welfare terms: \u201cEven within a framework where only welfare-based harms justify regulatory interventions, the likely innovation harms stemming from platform appropriation and discrimination invite serious consideration of structural limits.\u201d 22  But Khan considers conventional welfarism too limiting a standard and goes on to identify a \u201chost of functional goals that motivated previous separations regimes, ranging from fair competition and system resiliency to media diversity and administrability.\u201d 23  Khan argues that \u201c[t]hese concerns register in a normatively pluralistic framework: While some are cognizable in terms of welfare economics, others appeal to a broader set of democratic and institutionalist values.\u201d 24  Finally, she candidly admits that, in some circumstances, pursuing these \u201cdemocratic and institutionalist\u201d values comes at the expense of efficiency and consumer welfare: \u201cIn the context of business and market structure, these distinct values sometimes align\u2014such that a separation that promotes a robust marketplace of ideas also promotes dynamic efficiency\u2014while in other instances they are in tension.\u201d 25 </p><p>Khan\u2019s potpourri approaches to the goals of antitrust law is certainly in line with the Brandeisian tradition. The sum of Brandeis\u2019s teaching on bigness is well encapsulated by Justice Douglas in his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Standard Stations</emphasis> dissent: 26 The lessons Brandeis taught on the curse of bigness have largely been forgotten in high places. Size is allowed to become a menace to existing and putative competitors. Price control is allowed to escape the influences of the competitive market and to gravitate into the hands of the few. But beyond all that there is the effect on the community when independents are swallowed up by the trusts and entrepreneurs become employees of absentee owners. Then there is a serious loss in citizenship. Local leadership is diluted. He who was a leader in the village becomes dependent on outsiders for his action and policy. Clerks responsible to a superior in a distant place take the place of resident proprietors beholden to no one. These are the prices which the nation pays for the almost ceaseless growth in bigness on the part of industry. Douglas went on to raise, and dismiss, the potential conflict between efficiency and anti-bigness social values that Khan identified in her separation paper: The only argument that has been seriously advanced in favor of private monopoly is that competition involves waste, while the monopoly prevents waste and leads to efficiency. This argument is essentially unsound. The wastes of competition are negligible. The economies of monopoly are superficial and delusive. The efficiency of monopoly is at the best temporary. 27  Douglas then supported his claim that monopolies do not generate efficiency with a quote from Brandeis in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Curse of Bigness</emphasis>: Undoubtedly competition involves waste. What human activity does not? The wastes of democracy are among the greatest obvious wastes, but we have compensations in democracy which far outweigh that waste and make it more efficient than absolutism. So it is with competition. The waste is relatively insignificant. There are wastes of competition which do not develop, but kill. These the law can and should eliminate, by regulating competition. 28  For the Brandeisian Justices on the Supreme Court, it became gospel that Brandeis had shown that monopolies did not generate efficiencies and hence that there was no social welfare cost implicated in adopting an antitrust policy hostile to bigness. The four dissenting Justices (Douglas, Black, Murphy, and Rutledge) in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">U.S. v. Columbia Steel Co.</emphasis> 29  cited from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Curse of Bigness</emphasis> again in insisting that any efficiencies resulting from the merger were \u201clargely illusory.\u201d 30  Justice Douglas repeated this observation in his dissent in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co. v. U.S.</emphasis>, 31  where he disputed the premise that a railroad merger could be justified on the grounds that it would result in improved service. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">FTC v. Procter &amp; Gamble</emphasis>, Justice Douglas finally got a majority sign off on the doctrine that efficiencies cannot justify a merger that may increase dominance, 32  an issue with which antitrust law has continued to wrestle ever since. 33 </p><p>And yet, Brandeis himself was not quite so emphatic in dismissing the possibility that an anti-bigness antitrust policy would impose costs of social welfare by suppressing certain economies of scale or scope. He acknowledged that a \u201cunit in business may be too small to be efficient,\u201d although \u201cthe unit may be too large to be efficient, and this is no uncommon incidence of monopoly.\u201d 34  Yet more candidly, he argued that although the trusts had sometimes achieved efficiencies, \u201ctheir fruits have been absorbed almost wholly by the trusts themselves\u201d and \u201cthe community has gained substantially nothing.\u201d 35  This observation presages the later debate between the consumer welfare and total welfare standards 36 ; the important point is the admission that large scale has, in fact, produced efficiencies on at least some occasions. It follows, of course, that an anti-bigness antitrust policy will, in at least some cases, entail a loss of efficiency (even if Brandeis thought that any systemic efficiency losses would be slight).</p><p>Other Brandeisian jurists admitted even more clearly that the potential loss of efficiency was a deliberate aspect of antitrust policy. Perhaps the clearest such statement can be found in Learned Hand\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alcoa</emphasis> opinion: \u201cThroughout the history of these statutes it has been constantly assumed that one of their purposes was to perpetuate and preserve, for its own sake and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">in spite of possible cost</emphasis>, an organization of industry in small units which can effectively compete with each other.\u201d 37  The Supreme Court endorsed this language in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Von\u2019s Grocery</emphasis> 38  and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brown Shoe</emphasis>, 39  opinions that even post-Chicagoans generally recognize did not promote consumerist interests. 40 </p><p>In the near term, the neo-Brandeisians may not have to come to grips with the possibility that their anti-bigness crusade will entail losses of economic efficiencies, for which consumers will have to pay. There is plenty of low-hanging fruit to be picked by both post-Chicagoans, who believe that antitrust has gotten badly off track even on consumer welfare terms, and neo-Brandeisians, who want to pursue an antitrust policy much grander than consumer welfare. But, eventually, the conflicts between efficiency and antidominance that Brandeis weakly admitted a century ago and that Khan cautiously anticipates today will arise. That will be the moment of truth for the neo-Brandeisians: Are they prepared to stick to their guns and oppose mergers that clearly will benefit consumers but create excessive bigness? Will they pursue antimonopolization rules that handcuff dominant firms from exploiting efficiency advantages in the name of protecting the \u201clittle guy\u201d and promoting a level playing field? Or, will the neo-Brandeisians maintain their anti-bigness rhetoric, but slip quietly into a post-Chicago regime characterized by vigorous antitrust enforcement, but on some version of the consumer welfare standard?</p><p>If the neo-Brandeisians do stick to their guns and pursue an antitrust policy \u201cin spite of its possible cost\u201d to efficiency, query whether they will gain enough political traction to maintain their seat at the table in Congress, the White House, and especially the courts. The American people may be motivated to embrace an antitrust policy promised simultaneously to protect consumer welfare many of the other values advanced by Brandeis and his contemporary acolytes\u2014anti-bigness, antidominance, democratic integrity\u2014but it is far from clear that, even at this moment of antitrust excitement, there is much of an appetite for an antitrust policy that would raise consumer prices or impair innovation.</p><p>There is also the possibility that the neo-Brandeisians will find themselves consciously or unconsciously pursuing a strategy similar to that of which Robert Bork has long been accused\u2014obfuscating terms in order to pursue one policy wrapped in the guise of a very different policy. Bork allegedly committed a nefarious two-step by first contorting the Sherman Act\u2019s legislative history to produce a \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d standard and then defining consumer welfare as solely concerned with allocative efficiency such that even wealth transfers from consumers to producers in the form of higher prices did not count as losses of consumer welfare. 41  These semantic machinations were ostensibly necessary because consumer welfare was a politically palatable standard whereas allocative efficiency was not. If the Brandeisians find themselves in a similar position\u2014favoring an anti-bigness policy entailing losses of efficiency but realizing that overtly embracing such a standard could be a political nonstarter\u2014will they do a Bork and conceal their true standard in a more palatable form of words? Or will they advance their position with forthrightness and candor and go down with their ship?</p><p>Contra to Learned Hand, the neo-Brandeisians may dispute that the choice between anti-bigness and efficiency will ever be that stark. Perhaps it will not be. Or perhaps that very argument is the first step down the Borkian road.</p><h>III. Empiricism Above A Priori Theory</h><p>Of all of Brandeis\u2019s many distinguished contributions to the law, none is more important than the idea that facts trump theories. It was Brandeis\u2019s brief in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Muller v. Oregon</emphasis> 42  compiling voluminous empirical evidence on the deleterious effects on women\u2019s health, safety, and morals from working excessive hours that created the archetype of the \u201cBrandeis brief\u201d that would contribute to importantly to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brown v. Board of Education</emphasis> 43  and the realist shift in law in the mid-20th century. 44  It was Brandeis\u2019s theories of federalism that created the idea that the states should serve as \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d testing new laws and policies through experimentation, success, and failure. 45  And it was Brandeis\u2019s vision that constituted the FTC as a fact-gathering organization with the power to collect information from across the nation, inform Congress about the true functioning of markets, and collaborate with industry and civil society to improve market conditions for the good of all. 46  Brandeis was the first great American juridical empiricist; his methodological influence on American law has been unparalleled.</p><p>Of course, Brandeis made his contributions before the rise of contemporary empirical methods, which have greatly increased the complexity and sophistication of empirical studies. One consequence of this rarification of empirical claims in or concerning law is that judges and lawyers\u2014never mind the jurors\u2014often find themselves struggling to keep up with the conflicting expert witness testimony. Whereas in Brandeis\u2019s day, the lawyers were the stars of antitrust cases, that role which been largely ceded to the highly credentialed (and highly paid) economists who swoop into the antitrust agencies to present their multivariate regressions showing that the merger in question will lower (or raise) prices or that the defendant\u2019s prices were above or below average variable cost.</p><p>The paradox for the neo-Brandeisians is this: to be a genuine Brandeisian means to be an empiricist, to prefer inductive fact-based reasoning to a priori generalization or deduction. Today, antitrust empiricism is owned by an economics profession that deploys complex tools on which most lawyers are not qualified to opine and judges outcomes based on welfarist criteria. Therefore, to be a contemporary, Brandeisian on empiricism is to cede the field straight back to the very economists who supposedly have been asleep at the wheel for the last forty years and are unlikely to be sympathetic on average to Brandeisian social and political ideology.</p><p>What are the alternatives for the neo-Brandeisians? One is to scuttle Brandeis\u2019s empiricism and proceed instead with a set of a priori rules or principles designed to reduce market dominance and create a level playing field, as the European Union largely did during its \u201cform based\u201d years, before its more recent turn to \u201ceffects based\u201d economics. 47  That carries the distinctive disadvantages of simultaneously disregarding the most Brandeisian aspect of Brandeis and appropriating a formalistic mode of legal reasoning that eventually became too formal for even the formalistic Europeans. The other is to prise antitrust empiricism away from the economists or to appropriate modes of empiricism\u2014such as qualitative empiricism\u2014that do not have as their outputs dollars and cents. In that case, the rising cohort of Brandeisians will need to master a set of empirical skills as robust as any associated with the economics profession today.</p><p>Another implication of a commitment to induction and empiricism rather than a prior formal reasoning is the willingness to shift course when the facts so dictate. Critics of the Chicago School frequently note that the Chicagoans initially embarked on a needed course correction based on empirical observations about the excesses of antitrust law but eventually settled into a set of rigid ideological dogmas at odds with the mounting evidence that their overly laissez faire approach was jeopardizing market competitiveness. 48  Are the neo-Brandeisians committed to eschewing a similar course by genuinely following the facts wherever they lead? If it turns out that vertical integration between dominant platforms and marketplace participants does not, in fact, jeopardize democratic and social values but instead promotes market participation and pluralism by a wide variety of social actors, will the neo-Brandeisians concede that \u201cfair is fair\u201d and back off antitrust enforcement against vertical mergers? If the evidence shows that Google, Facebook, and Amazon are not nearly as dominant as they might seem because entry barriers are actually quite low and nascent firms with a realistic chance to innovate and compete are a dime a dozen, will the neo-Brandeisians take off their boxing gloves and shake hands with Sundar Pichi, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos? In other words, are the neo-Brandeisians genuinely open to fact-based, empirical antitrust, regardless of its outcomes?</p><p>The answer may well be \u201cof course we are, with the caveat that we are likely to interpret the empirical outcomes differently than you do.\u201d Fair enough. For now, it is enough to ask that, in the spirit of Brandeis himself, the neo-Brandeisians show a bona fide willingness to prioritize facts over theories.</p><h>IV. Conclusion</h><p>Congratulations to the neo-Brandeisians! A small cadre of committed scholars and activists have succeeded in fundamentally changing the terms of the antitrust debate in a very short period of time. It remains to be seen, of course, whether they will be able to move from a seat at the table to regime change. I offer no prediction. What I have offered instead is a set of questions, neither friendly nor hostile, about the relationship of this current movement to its original patron. Hopefully, the answers to these questions will help to clarify the direction and appeal of the budding neo-Brandeisian movement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGEABX-1011770003603X19875039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGEABX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJF-KG91-JBMY-H031-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470049</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sage Publications, Inc.

Assuming the mantle of Brandeis gives the neo-Brandeisians a historically grounded brand but also comes with some baggage. Among other things, the neo-Brandeisians need to be prepared to answer the following questions: (1) Will they follow Brandeis in seeing bigness as a curse not only in business but also in government? (2) Will they break cleanly with welfarism and adhere to a moral, social, and political theory of anti-bigness, even at the cost of efficiency? and (3) Will they commit themselves genuinely to Brandeis\u2019s empiricism\u2014that facts on the ground trump theories, wherever the facts may lead?</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the last two years, the self-styled neo-Brandeis movement has emerged out of virtually nowhere to claim a position at the bargaining table over antitrust reform and the future of the antitrust enterprise. Unlike the Chicago School, which spent more than two decades laying the intellectual framework for its assault on the structuralist status quo before it emerged as an influential force in the courts and, among political elites, the neo-Brandeisians are just beginning to articulate their agenda on a scholarly basis even as they are already at the center of antitrust reform discussions in Washington. The simultaneity of the neo-Brandeisians\u2019 efforts to articulate their agenda on a scholarly basis with their political influence may not be an obstacle in this case, since the neo-Brandeisians seem mostly to be courting the expressly political branches of government\u2014the President (mostly presidential candidates) and especially Congress\u2014rather than the courts, which typically take a longer incubation period to bring on board a movement. Nonetheless, to skeptics of the movement like myself, the lack of a significant body of work articulating the movement\u2019s views creates a framing difficulty\u2014how does one critique a movement without a canon of literature or, to date, any tangible political or judicial achievements?</p><p>The fortunate answer is that the neo-Brandeisians are not purportedly creating their movement from whole cloth but instead are seeking to return to an antitrust school of the past\u2014the one, of course, associated with Justice Louis Brandeis and his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Curse of Bigness</emphasis>. 1  By styling themselves as neo-Brandeisians rather than simple Brandeisians, the neo-Brandeisians have left themselves the wiggle room to take those aspects of Brandeis that they find congenial and to dismiss those superseded by the passage of time or their own finer sensibilities. Nonetheless, it seems only fair to hold the neo-Brandeisians to the core views of their patron saint. In that spirit, this essay shall review three key aspects of the original Brandeis and his immediate followers and inquire whether the neo-Brandeisians are willing to go along. They are: (1) Brandeis\u2019 abhorrence not only of big business but also of big government, and particularly of the centralizing tendencies of President Franklin Delano Roosvelt\u2019s New Deal, which Brandeis voted sharply to curtail as a Justice of the Supreme Court; (2) the candid admission by Brandeis, or at least various of Brandeis\u2019s followers, that implementation of an anti-bigness ideology would entail losses of productive efficiencies and hence impose costs on consumer interests; and (3) Brandeis\u2019s insistence that facts should always trump theories, wherever the facts might lead.</p><h>I. The Curse of Bigness\u2014In Everything</h><p>Perhaps the most comprehensive articulation of the neo-Brandeisian agenda to date can be found in Tim Wu\u2019s eloquent monograph <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age</emphasis>. 2  In chapters that cover the history of the monopolization movement, Brandeis\u2019 anti-bigness vision for a \u201cright to live and not merely exist,\u201d Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s trustbusting \u201cbig cases,\u201d the rise and triumph of the Chicago School, and Big Tech\u2019s invidious rise to dominance, Wu presents a lively picture of the world of concentrated power that Brandeis fought to overcome through law and that was tragically recreated once Brandeis\u2019s influence waned. In conclusion, Wu prescribes a stern dose of Brandeisianism in the form of reinvigorated merger review, a democratic process for merger control, boldness to bring \u201cbig cases\u201d and break up big firms, institutional processes for market investigations, and a \u201cprotection of competition\u201d test to replace the consumer welfare standard. 3 </p><p>Similarly, neo-Brandeisians Zephyr Teachout and Lina Khan\u2019s paper on the politics of market structure argues that \u201cmarket structure is deeply political\u201d and presents a taxonomy of ways in which market power translates into political power. 4  After describing three conventional categories\u2014setting policy, regulating markets, and taxing\u2014in which companies with market power appropriate conventionally governmental functions, Teachout and Khan propose a fourth Brandeisian category\u2014dominance, which represents a catchall of invidious ways in which dominant companies arrogate political power to themselves. 5  Bigness is a curse not only to consumers but also to citizens in democratic societies.</p><p>Brandeis surely would have agreed with much of Wu, Khan, and Teachout\u2019s analysis, but he would not have stopped his harangue against bigness with industry. When Brandeis imagined bigness as a curse, he did not limit his indictment to big business. He also included big government or at least a big federal government. That Brandeis was egalitarian in his abhorrence of bigness in government, and business is a central theme of Jeffrey Rosen\u2019s recent work on Brandeis. As Rosen writes, \u201cDenouncing big banks as well as big government as symptoms of what he called a \u2018curse of bigness,\u2019 Brandeis was determined to diminish concentrated financial and federal power, which he viewed as a menace to liberty and democracy.\u201d 6 </p><p>Brandeis\u2019s crusade against bigness in government was not limited to rhetoric. As a Supreme Court Justice, Brandeis not only voted to strike down key pieces of New Deal legislation, he also served up personal warnings to the President that further aggrandizements of federal power would meet resistance at the Supreme Court. Brandeis detested the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration because they created too much centralized power in the federal government. 7  In January 1935, he joined the majority in striking down the \u201chot oil\u201d section of the NIRA that allowed the president to ban shipment in interstate commerce of oil that exceeded state-set production limits. 8  On \u201cBlack Monday,\u201d May 27, 1935, Brandeis again joined the majority in three opinions striking down key elements of the New Deal concerning debt relief, 9  the President\u2019s removal power over Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioners, 10  and industry codes under the NIRA. 11  President Roosevelt was purportedly so incensed with the latter decision and its limitations on the federal commerce clause power that he compared it to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dred Scott</emphasis> and warned that it would have dire consequences for the nation. 12  Unperturbed by the wrath of the President and his New Deal coalition, Brandeis conveyed the following message to the White House: \u201cThis is the end of this business of centralization, and I want you to go back and tell the President that we\u2019re not going to let this government centralize everything. It\u2019s come to an end.\u201d 13 </p><p>Can one seriously style herself a Brandeisian if she adopts Brandeis\u2019s abhorrence of bigness in industry but not in government? At least some of the neo-Brandeisians seems to think so. Senator Elizabeth Warren has wrapped herself in the mantle of Brandeis, arguing against a concentration of business power that \u201ccrushes competition\u201d and aggrandizes monopolists. 14  But she also supports vast expansions of the federal government, such as the Green New Deal, which calls for immense federal works projects in electricity, transportation, Internet, and housing that would dwarf the New Deal. 15  This is surely quite selective anti-bigness.</p><p>Of course, nothing says that as a general matter one must be anti-bigness as to both industry and government, or not at all. Over the course of American history, a range of attitudes toward bigness have developed. For simplicity, we may organize them in the following two-by-two matrix:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"176\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"208\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">Against Big Business</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">For Big Business</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Against big government</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Thomas Jefferson, Louis Brandeis</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Ronald Reagan, Robert Bork</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For big government</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Franklin Roosevelt, Elizabeth Warren</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Alexander Hamilton, Theodore Roosevelt</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Of the four combinations shown, only the Jefferson/Brandeis qualifies as pervasively anti-bigness. The other three embrace some aspect of bigness, in government, business, or both. One can choose to align oneself with any of these traditions, or chose some other option\u2014it\u2019s a free country! But it is questionable whether the mantle of Brandeis should be worn by those not fitting into the first box, into the Jeffersonian tradition with which Brandeis himself so strongly associated. It was that tradition that exalted the yeoman farmer and small-scale local government, while abhorring the \u201cMonster Bank\u201d and the bloated federal government that spawned it, that Brandeis saw as his lineage.</p><p>Beyond the question of whether those in the big government/small business camp can rightly call themselves Brandeisian, there is a substantive question to engage about the relationship between scale in government and scale in business. Arguably, the anti-bigness strand in the American psyche finds its most fertile ground for political expression when bigness of one kind grows out of proportion to bigness of other kinds. The anti-bigness sentiment may be most of all one of balance: no institution or sector should grow so large as to swamp its countervailing forces. Writing in the mid-1960s, historian Richard Hofstadter observed that \u201cAmericans have always had to balance their love of bigness and efficiency against their fear of power and their regard for individualism and competition.\u201d 16  During the sixties, Hofstadter noted, Americans ranked their concerns about the bigness of big business behind their concerns about the bigness of the federal government and labor unions. 17  Today, the popular resurgence of antitrust sentiment may have something to do with the continual retreat of both the federal government and organized labor influence since the 1980s, leading to a feeling that big business is increasingly unconstrained by offsetting social and political forces. See the growing calls for more antitrust enforcement to counter employer monopsony power in labor markets. 18 </p><p>That the strongest inclination of the anti-bigness sentiment may be a demand for checks and balances rather than an abhorrence of bigness per se should be instructive to the neo-Brandeisians. The rising contemporary antitrust movement does not exist in isolation from other social and political currents. Arresting bigness in business today while promoting a continued growth in the federal government is not a sustainable long-run solution.</p><h>II. Candor on the Costs of Anti-Bigness</h><p>The core of the Brandeisian critique of business power is not welfarist in the contemporary economic sense, which is to say it does not seek to quantify, and then to maximize, the welfare of society through rules of the road that optimize the allocation of social resources. Rather, it is a social critique of power that understands economic dominance as deeply corrosive to a broad set of liberal democratic values. 19  That said, the neo-Brandeisians have grown up in a welfarist world where contestants over the direction of antitrust law, and legal policy more generally, are accustomed to presenting their arguments in welfarist terms. Further, the idea that antitrust law should promote consumer welfare enjoyed broad bi-partisan acceptance for a long time (although, of course, there was intense contestation over the meaning and scope of the consumer welfare standard) and grew rhetorically not only out of the Chicago School right but also the Naderian left. 20  It is therefore understandable that, although their real interest is in advancing a social critique of power, the neo-Brandeisians often couch their arguments in at least partially welfarist terms.</p><p>Consider Lina Khan\u2019s recent article advocating a return to legal rules requiring the separation of platforms and commerce. 21  Khan argues that her proposed separation rules could be justified solely in consumer welfare terms: \u201cEven within a framework where only welfare-based harms justify regulatory interventions, the likely innovation harms stemming from platform appropriation and discrimination invite serious consideration of structural limits.\u201d 22  But Khan considers conventional welfarism too limiting a standard and goes on to identify a \u201chost of functional goals that motivated previous separations regimes, ranging from fair competition and system resiliency to media diversity and administrability.\u201d 23  Khan argues that \u201c[t]hese concerns register in a normatively pluralistic framework: While some are cognizable in terms of welfare economics, others appeal to a broader set of democratic and institutionalist values.\u201d 24  Finally, she candidly admits that, in some circumstances, pursuing these \u201cdemocratic and institutionalist\u201d values comes at the expense of efficiency and consumer welfare: \u201cIn the context of business and market structure, these distinct values sometimes align\u2014such that a separation that promotes a robust marketplace of ideas also promotes dynamic efficiency\u2014while in other instances they are in tension.\u201d 25 </p><p>Khan\u2019s potpourri approaches to the goals of antitrust law is certainly in line with the Brandeisian tradition. The sum of Brandeis\u2019s teaching on bigness is well encapsulated by Justice Douglas in his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Standard Stations</emphasis> dissent: 26 The lessons Brandeis taught on the curse of bigness have largely been forgotten in high places. Size is allowed to become a menace to existing and putative competitors. Price control is allowed to escape the influences of the competitive market and to gravitate into the hands of the few. But beyond all that there is the effect on the community when independents are swallowed up by the trusts and entrepreneurs become employees of absentee owners. Then there is a serious loss in citizenship. Local leadership is diluted. He who was a leader in the village becomes dependent on outsiders for his action and policy. Clerks responsible to a superior in a distant place take the place of resident proprietors beholden to no one. These are the prices which the nation pays for the almost ceaseless growth in bigness on the part of industry. Douglas went on to raise, and dismiss, the potential conflict between efficiency and anti-bigness social values that Khan identified in her separation paper: The only argument that has been seriously advanced in favor of private monopoly is that competition involves waste, while the monopoly prevents waste and leads to efficiency. This argument is essentially unsound. The wastes of competition are negligible. The economies of monopoly are superficial and delusive. The efficiency of monopoly is at the best temporary. 27  Douglas then supported his claim that monopolies do not generate efficiency with a quote from Brandeis in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Curse of Bigness</emphasis>: Undoubtedly competition involves waste. What human activity does not? The wastes of democracy are among the greatest obvious wastes, but we have compensations in democracy which far outweigh that waste and make it more efficient than absolutism. So it is with competition. The waste is relatively insignificant. There are wastes of competition which do not develop, but kill. These the law can and should eliminate, by regulating competition. 28  For the Brandeisian Justices on the Supreme Court, it became gospel that Brandeis had shown that monopolies did not generate efficiencies and hence that there was no social welfare cost implicated in adopting an antitrust policy hostile to bigness. The four dissenting Justices (Douglas, Black, Murphy, and Rutledge) in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">U.S. v. Columbia Steel Co.</emphasis> 29  cited from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Curse of Bigness</emphasis> again in insisting that any efficiencies resulting from the merger were \u201clargely illusory.\u201d 30  Justice Douglas repeated this observation in his dissent in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co. v. U.S.</emphasis>, 31  where he disputed the premise that a railroad merger could be justified on the grounds that it would result in improved service. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">FTC v. Procter &amp; Gamble</emphasis>, Justice Douglas finally got a majority sign off on the doctrine that efficiencies cannot justify a merger that may increase dominance, 32  an issue with which antitrust law has continued to wrestle ever since. 33 </p><p>And yet, Brandeis himself was not quite so emphatic in dismissing the possibility that an anti-bigness antitrust policy would impose costs of social welfare by suppressing certain economies of scale or scope. He acknowledged that a \u201cunit in business may be too small to be efficient,\u201d although \u201cthe unit may be too large to be efficient, and this is no uncommon incidence of monopoly.\u201d 34  Yet more candidly, he argued that although the trusts had sometimes achieved efficiencies, \u201ctheir fruits have been absorbed almost wholly by the trusts themselves\u201d and \u201cthe community has gained substantially nothing.\u201d 35  This observation presages the later debate between the consumer welfare and total welfare standards 36 ; the important point is the admission that large scale has, in fact, produced efficiencies on at least some occasions. It follows, of course, that an anti-bigness antitrust policy will, in at least some cases, entail a loss of efficiency (even if Brandeis thought that any systemic efficiency losses would be slight).</p><p>Other Brandeisian jurists admitted even more clearly that the potential loss of efficiency was a deliberate aspect of antitrust policy. Perhaps the clearest such statement can be found in Learned Hand\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alcoa</emphasis> opinion: \u201cThroughout the history of these statutes it has been constantly assumed that one of their purposes was to perpetuate and preserve, for its own sake and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">in spite of possible cost</emphasis>, an organization of industry in small units which can effectively compete with each other.\u201d 37  The Supreme Court endorsed this language in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Von\u2019s Grocery</emphasis> 38  and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brown Shoe</emphasis>, 39  opinions that even post-Chicagoans generally recognize did not promote consumerist interests. 40 </p><p>In the near term, the neo-Brandeisians may not have to come to grips with the possibility that their anti-bigness crusade will entail losses of economic efficiencies, for which consumers will have to pay. There is plenty of low-hanging fruit to be picked by both post-Chicagoans, who believe that antitrust has gotten badly off track even on consumer welfare terms, and neo-Brandeisians, who want to pursue an antitrust policy much grander than consumer welfare. But, eventually, the conflicts between efficiency and antidominance that Brandeis weakly admitted a century ago and that Khan cautiously anticipates today will arise. That will be the moment of truth for the neo-Brandeisians: Are they prepared to stick to their guns and oppose mergers that clearly will benefit consumers but create excessive bigness? Will they pursue antimonopolization rules that handcuff dominant firms from exploiting efficiency advantages in the name of protecting the \u201clittle guy\u201d and promoting a level playing field? Or, will the neo-Brandeisians maintain their anti-bigness rhetoric, but slip quietly into a post-Chicago regime characterized by vigorous antitrust enforcement, but on some version of the consumer welfare standard?</p><p>If the neo-Brandeisians do stick to their guns and pursue an antitrust policy \u201cin spite of its possible cost\u201d to efficiency, query whether they will gain enough political traction to maintain their seat at the table in Congress, the White House, and especially the courts. The American people may be motivated to embrace an antitrust policy promised simultaneously to protect consumer welfare many of the other values advanced by Brandeis and his contemporary acolytes\u2014anti-bigness, antidominance, democratic integrity\u2014but it is far from clear that, even at this moment of antitrust excitement, there is much of an appetite for an antitrust policy that would raise consumer prices or impair innovation.</p><p>There is also the possibility that the neo-Brandeisians will find themselves consciously or unconsciously pursuing a strategy similar to that of which Robert Bork has long been accused\u2014obfuscating terms in order to pursue one policy wrapped in the guise of a very different policy. Bork allegedly committed a nefarious two-step by first contorting the Sherman Act\u2019s legislative history to produce a \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d standard and then defining consumer welfare as solely concerned with allocative efficiency such that even wealth transfers from consumers to producers in the form of higher prices did not count as losses of consumer welfare. 41  These semantic machinations were ostensibly necessary because consumer welfare was a politically palatable standard whereas allocative efficiency was not. If the Brandeisians find themselves in a similar position\u2014favoring an anti-bigness policy entailing losses of efficiency but realizing that overtly embracing such a standard could be a political nonstarter\u2014will they do a Bork and conceal their true standard in a more palatable form of words? Or will they advance their position with forthrightness and candor and go down with their ship?</p><p>Contra to Learned Hand, the neo-Brandeisians may dispute that the choice between anti-bigness and efficiency will ever be that stark. Perhaps it will not be. Or perhaps that very argument is the first step down the Borkian road.</p><h>III. Empiricism Above A Priori Theory</h><p>Of all of Brandeis\u2019s many distinguished contributions to the law, none is more important than the idea that facts trump theories. It was Brandeis\u2019s brief in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Muller v. Oregon</emphasis> 42  compiling voluminous empirical evidence on the deleterious effects on women\u2019s health, safety, and morals from working excessive hours that created the archetype of the \u201cBrandeis brief\u201d that would contribute to importantly to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brown v. Board of Education</emphasis> 43  and the realist shift in law in the mid-20th century. 44  It was Brandeis\u2019s theories of federalism that created the idea that the states should serve as \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d testing new laws and policies through experimentation, success, and failure. 45  And it was Brandeis\u2019s vision that constituted the FTC as a fact-gathering organization with the power to collect information from across the nation, inform Congress about the true functioning of markets, and collaborate with industry and civil society to improve market conditions for the good of all. 46  Brandeis was the first great American juridical empiricist; his methodological influence on American law has been unparalleled.</p><p>Of course, Brandeis made his contributions before the rise of contemporary empirical methods, which have greatly increased the complexity and sophistication of empirical studies. One consequence of this rarification of empirical claims in or concerning law is that judges and lawyers\u2014never mind the jurors\u2014often find themselves struggling to keep up with the conflicting expert witness testimony. Whereas in Brandeis\u2019s day, the lawyers were the stars of antitrust cases, that role which been largely ceded to the highly credentialed (and highly paid) economists who swoop into the antitrust agencies to present their multivariate regressions showing that the merger in question will lower (or raise) prices or that the defendant\u2019s prices were above or below average variable cost.</p><p>The paradox for the neo-Brandeisians is this: to be a genuine Brandeisian means to be an empiricist, to prefer inductive fact-based reasoning to a priori generalization or deduction. Today, antitrust empiricism is owned by an economics profession that deploys complex tools on which most lawyers are not qualified to opine and judges outcomes based on welfarist criteria. Therefore, to be a contemporary, Brandeisian on empiricism is to cede the field straight back to the very economists who supposedly have been asleep at the wheel for the last forty years and are unlikely to be sympathetic on average to Brandeisian social and political ideology.</p><p>What are the alternatives for the neo-Brandeisians? One is to scuttle Brandeis\u2019s empiricism and proceed instead with a set of a priori rules or principles designed to reduce market dominance and create a level playing field, as the European Union largely did during its \u201cform based\u201d years, before its more recent turn to \u201ceffects based\u201d economics. 47  That carries the distinctive disadvantages of simultaneously disregarding the most Brandeisian aspect of Brandeis and appropriating a formalistic mode of legal reasoning that eventually became too formal for even the formalistic Europeans. The other is to prise antitrust empiricism away from the economists or to appropriate modes of empiricism\u2014such as qualitative empiricism\u2014that do not have as their outputs dollars and cents. In that case, the rising cohort of Brandeisians will need to master a set of empirical skills as robust as any associated with the economics profession today.</p><p>Another implication of a commitment to induction and empiricism rather than a prior formal reasoning is the willingness to shift course when the facts so dictate. Critics of the Chicago School frequently note that the Chicagoans initially embarked on a needed course correction based on empirical observations about the excesses of antitrust law but eventually settled into a set of rigid ideological dogmas at odds with the mounting evidence that their overly laissez faire approach was jeopardizing market competitiveness. 48  Are the neo-Brandeisians committed to eschewing a similar course by genuinely following the facts wherever they lead? If it turns out that vertical integration between dominant platforms and marketplace participants does not, in fact, jeopardize democratic and social values but instead promotes market participation and pluralism by a wide variety of social actors, will the neo-Brandeisians concede that \u201cfair is fair\u201d and back off antitrust enforcement against vertical mergers? If the evidence shows that Google, Facebook, and Amazon are not nearly as dominant as they might seem because entry barriers are actually quite low and nascent firms with a realistic chance to innovate and compete are a dime a dozen, will the neo-Brandeisians take off their boxing gloves and shake hands with Sundar Pichi, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos? In other words, are the neo-Brandeisians genuinely open to fact-based, empirical antitrust, regardless of its outcomes?</p><p>The answer may well be \u201cof course we are, with the caveat that we are likely to interpret the empirical outcomes differently than you do.\u201d Fair enough. For now, it is enough to ask that, in the spirit of Brandeis himself, the neo-Brandeisians show a bona fide willingness to prioritize facts over theories.</p><h>IV. Conclusion</h><p>Congratulations to the neo-Brandeisians! A small cadre of committed scholars and activists have succeeded in fundamentally changing the terms of the antitrust debate in a very short period of time. It remains to be seen, of course, whether they will be able to move from a seat at the table to regime change. I offer no prediction. What I have offered instead is a set of questions, neither friendly nor hostile, about the relationship of this current movement to its original patron. Hopefully, the answers to these questions will help to clarify the direction and appeal of the budding neo-Brandeisian movement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGEABX-1011770003603X19875039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGEABX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MS-RCM1-JBMY-H130-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470049</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sage Publications, Inc.

Assuming the mantle of Brandeis gives the neo-Brandeisians a historically grounded brand but also comes with some baggage. Among other things, the neo-Brandeisians need to be prepared to answer the following questions: (1) Will they follow Brandeis in seeing bigness as a curse not only in business but also in government? (2) Will they break cleanly with welfarism and adhere to a moral, social, and political theory of anti-bigness, even at the cost of efficiency? and (3) Will they commit themselves genuinely to Brandeis\u2019s empiricism\u2014that facts on the ground trump theories, wherever the facts may lead?</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the last two years, the self-styled neo-Brandeis movement has emerged out of virtually nowhere to claim a position at the bargaining table over antitrust reform and the future of the antitrust enterprise. Unlike the Chicago School, which spent more than two decades laying the intellectual framework for its assault on the structuralist status quo before it emerged as an influential force in the courts and, among political elites, the neo-Brandeisians are just beginning to articulate their agenda on a scholarly basis even as they are already at the center of antitrust reform discussions in Washington. The simultaneity of the neo-Brandeisians\u2019 efforts to articulate their agenda on a scholarly basis with their political influence may not be an obstacle in this case, since the neo-Brandeisians seem mostly to be courting the expressly political branches of government\u2014the President (mostly presidential candidates) and especially Congress\u2014rather than the courts, which typically take a longer incubation period to bring on board a movement. Nonetheless, to skeptics of the movement like myself, the lack of a significant body of work articulating the movement\u2019s views creates a framing difficulty\u2014how does one critique a movement without a canon of literature or, to date, any tangible political or judicial achievements?</p><p>The fortunate answer is that the neo-Brandeisians are not purportedly creating their movement from whole cloth but instead are seeking to return to an antitrust school of the past\u2014the one, of course, associated with Justice Louis Brandeis and his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Curse of Bigness</emphasis>. 1  By styling themselves as neo-Brandeisians rather than simple Brandeisians, the neo-Brandeisians have left themselves the wiggle room to take those aspects of Brandeis that they find congenial and to dismiss those superseded by the passage of time or their own finer sensibilities. Nonetheless, it seems only fair to hold the neo-Brandeisians to the core views of their patron saint. In that spirit, this essay shall review three key aspects of the original Brandeis and his immediate followers and inquire whether the neo-Brandeisians are willing to go along. They are: (1) Brandeis\u2019 abhorrence not only of big business but also of big government, and particularly of the centralizing tendencies of President Franklin Delano Roosvelt\u2019s New Deal, which Brandeis voted sharply to curtail as a Justice of the Supreme Court; (2) the candid admission by Brandeis, or at least various of Brandeis\u2019s followers, that implementation of an anti-bigness ideology would entail losses of productive efficiencies and hence impose costs on consumer interests; and (3) Brandeis\u2019s insistence that facts should always trump theories, wherever the facts might lead.</p><h>I. The Curse of Bigness\u2014In Everything</h><p>Perhaps the most comprehensive articulation of the neo-Brandeisian agenda to date can be found in Tim Wu\u2019s eloquent monograph <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age</emphasis>. 2  In chapters that cover the history of the monopolization movement, Brandeis\u2019 anti-bigness vision for a \u201cright to live and not merely exist,\u201d Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s trustbusting \u201cbig cases,\u201d the rise and triumph of the Chicago School, and Big Tech\u2019s invidious rise to dominance, Wu presents a lively picture of the world of concentrated power that Brandeis fought to overcome through law and that was tragically recreated once Brandeis\u2019s influence waned. In conclusion, Wu prescribes a stern dose of Brandeisianism in the form of reinvigorated merger review, a democratic process for merger control, boldness to bring \u201cbig cases\u201d and break up big firms, institutional processes for market investigations, and a \u201cprotection of competition\u201d test to replace the consumer welfare standard. 3 </p><p>Similarly, neo-Brandeisians Zephyr Teachout and Lina Khan\u2019s paper on the politics of market structure argues that \u201cmarket structure is deeply political\u201d and presents a taxonomy of ways in which market power translates into political power. 4  After describing three conventional categories\u2014setting policy, regulating markets, and taxing\u2014in which companies with market power appropriate conventionally governmental functions, Teachout and Khan propose a fourth Brandeisian category\u2014dominance, which represents a catchall of invidious ways in which dominant companies arrogate political power to themselves. 5  Bigness is a curse not only to consumers but also to citizens in democratic societies.</p><p>Brandeis surely would have agreed with much of Wu, Khan, and Teachout\u2019s analysis, but he would not have stopped his harangue against bigness with industry. When Brandeis imagined bigness as a curse, he did not limit his indictment to big business. He also included big government or at least a big federal government. That Brandeis was egalitarian in his abhorrence of bigness in government, and business is a central theme of Jeffrey Rosen\u2019s recent work on Brandeis. As Rosen writes, \u201cDenouncing big banks as well as big government as symptoms of what he called a \u2018curse of bigness,\u2019 Brandeis was determined to diminish concentrated financial and federal power, which he viewed as a menace to liberty and democracy.\u201d 6 </p><p>Brandeis\u2019s crusade against bigness in government was not limited to rhetoric. As a Supreme Court Justice, Brandeis not only voted to strike down key pieces of New Deal legislation, he also served up personal warnings to the President that further aggrandizements of federal power would meet resistance at the Supreme Court. Brandeis detested the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration because they created too much centralized power in the federal government. 7  In January 1935, he joined the majority in striking down the \u201chot oil\u201d section of the NIRA that allowed the president to ban shipment in interstate commerce of oil that exceeded state-set production limits. 8  On \u201cBlack Monday,\u201d May 27, 1935, Brandeis again joined the majority in three opinions striking down key elements of the New Deal concerning debt relief, 9  the President\u2019s removal power over Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioners, 10  and industry codes under the NIRA. 11  President Roosevelt was purportedly so incensed with the latter decision and its limitations on the federal commerce clause power that he compared it to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dred Scott</emphasis> and warned that it would have dire consequences for the nation. 12  Unperturbed by the wrath of the President and his New Deal coalition, Brandeis conveyed the following message to the White House: \u201cThis is the end of this business of centralization, and I want you to go back and tell the President that we\u2019re not going to let this government centralize everything. It\u2019s come to an end.\u201d 13 </p><p>Can one seriously style herself a Brandeisian if she adopts Brandeis\u2019s abhorrence of bigness in industry but not in government? At least some of the neo-Brandeisians seems to think so. Senator Elizabeth Warren has wrapped herself in the mantle of Brandeis, arguing against a concentration of business power that \u201ccrushes competition\u201d and aggrandizes monopolists. 14  But she also supports vast expansions of the federal government, such as the Green New Deal, which calls for immense federal works projects in electricity, transportation, Internet, and housing that would dwarf the New Deal. 15  This is surely quite selective anti-bigness.</p><p>Of course, nothing says that as a general matter one must be anti-bigness as to both industry and government, or not at all. Over the course of American history, a range of attitudes toward bigness have developed. For simplicity, we may organize them in the following two-by-two matrix:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"176\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"208\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">Against Big Business</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">For Big Business</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Against big government</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Thomas Jefferson, Louis Brandeis</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Ronald Reagan, Robert Bork</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For big government</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Franklin Roosevelt, Elizabeth Warren</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Alexander Hamilton, Theodore Roosevelt</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Of the four combinations shown, only the Jefferson/Brandeis qualifies as pervasively anti-bigness. The other three embrace some aspect of bigness, in government, business, or both. One can choose to align oneself with any of these traditions, or chose some other option\u2014it\u2019s a free country! But it is questionable whether the mantle of Brandeis should be worn by those not fitting into the first box, into the Jeffersonian tradition with which Brandeis himself so strongly associated. It was that tradition that exalted the yeoman farmer and small-scale local government, while abhorring the \u201cMonster Bank\u201d and the bloated federal government that spawned it, that Brandeis saw as his lineage.</p><p>Beyond the question of whether those in the big government/small business camp can rightly call themselves Brandeisian, there is a substantive question to engage about the relationship between scale in government and scale in business. Arguably, the anti-bigness strand in the American psyche finds its most fertile ground for political expression when bigness of one kind grows out of proportion to bigness of other kinds. The anti-bigness sentiment may be most of all one of balance: no institution or sector should grow so large as to swamp its countervailing forces. Writing in the mid-1960s, historian Richard Hofstadter observed that \u201cAmericans have always had to balance their love of bigness and efficiency against their fear of power and their regard for individualism and competition.\u201d 16  During the sixties, Hofstadter noted, Americans ranked their concerns about the bigness of big business behind their concerns about the bigness of the federal government and labor unions. 17  Today, the popular resurgence of antitrust sentiment may have something to do with the continual retreat of both the federal government and organized labor influence since the 1980s, leading to a feeling that big business is increasingly unconstrained by offsetting social and political forces. See the growing calls for more antitrust enforcement to counter employer monopsony power in labor markets. 18 </p><p>That the strongest inclination of the anti-bigness sentiment may be a demand for checks and balances rather than an abhorrence of bigness per se should be instructive to the neo-Brandeisians. The rising contemporary antitrust movement does not exist in isolation from other social and political currents. Arresting bigness in business today while promoting a continued growth in the federal government is not a sustainable long-run solution.</p><h>II. Candor on the Costs of Anti-Bigness</h><p>The core of the Brandeisian critique of business power is not welfarist in the contemporary economic sense, which is to say it does not seek to quantify, and then to maximize, the welfare of society through rules of the road that optimize the allocation of social resources. Rather, it is a social critique of power that understands economic dominance as deeply corrosive to a broad set of liberal democratic values. 19  That said, the neo-Brandeisians have grown up in a welfarist world where contestants over the direction of antitrust law, and legal policy more generally, are accustomed to presenting their arguments in welfarist terms. Further, the idea that antitrust law should promote consumer welfare enjoyed broad bi-partisan acceptance for a long time (although, of course, there was intense contestation over the meaning and scope of the consumer welfare standard) and grew rhetorically not only out of the Chicago School right but also the Naderian left. 20  It is therefore understandable that, although their real interest is in advancing a social critique of power, the neo-Brandeisians often couch their arguments in at least partially welfarist terms.</p><p>Consider Lina Khan\u2019s recent article advocating a return to legal rules requiring the separation of platforms and commerce. 21  Khan argues that her proposed separation rules could be justified solely in consumer welfare terms: \u201cEven within a framework where only welfare-based harms justify regulatory interventions, the likely innovation harms stemming from platform appropriation and discrimination invite serious consideration of structural limits.\u201d 22  But Khan considers conventional welfarism too limiting a standard and goes on to identify a \u201chost of functional goals that motivated previous separations regimes, ranging from fair competition and system resiliency to media diversity and administrability.\u201d 23  Khan argues that \u201c[t]hese concerns register in a normatively pluralistic framework: While some are cognizable in terms of welfare economics, others appeal to a broader set of democratic and institutionalist values.\u201d 24  Finally, she candidly admits that, in some circumstances, pursuing these \u201cdemocratic and institutionalist\u201d values comes at the expense of efficiency and consumer welfare: \u201cIn the context of business and market structure, these distinct values sometimes align\u2014such that a separation that promotes a robust marketplace of ideas also promotes dynamic efficiency\u2014while in other instances they are in tension.\u201d 25 </p><p>Khan\u2019s potpourri approaches to the goals of antitrust law is certainly in line with the Brandeisian tradition. The sum of Brandeis\u2019s teaching on bigness is well encapsulated by Justice Douglas in his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Standard Stations</emphasis> dissent: 26 The lessons Brandeis taught on the curse of bigness have largely been forgotten in high places. Size is allowed to become a menace to existing and putative competitors. Price control is allowed to escape the influences of the competitive market and to gravitate into the hands of the few. But beyond all that there is the effect on the community when independents are swallowed up by the trusts and entrepreneurs become employees of absentee owners. Then there is a serious loss in citizenship. Local leadership is diluted. He who was a leader in the village becomes dependent on outsiders for his action and policy. Clerks responsible to a superior in a distant place take the place of resident proprietors beholden to no one. These are the prices which the nation pays for the almost ceaseless growth in bigness on the part of industry. Douglas went on to raise, and dismiss, the potential conflict between efficiency and anti-bigness social values that Khan identified in her separation paper: The only argument that has been seriously advanced in favor of private monopoly is that competition involves waste, while the monopoly prevents waste and leads to efficiency. This argument is essentially unsound. The wastes of competition are negligible. The economies of monopoly are superficial and delusive. The efficiency of monopoly is at the best temporary. 27  Douglas then supported his claim that monopolies do not generate efficiency with a quote from Brandeis in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Curse of Bigness</emphasis>: Undoubtedly competition involves waste. What human activity does not? The wastes of democracy are among the greatest obvious wastes, but we have compensations in democracy which far outweigh that waste and make it more efficient than absolutism. So it is with competition. The waste is relatively insignificant. There are wastes of competition which do not develop, but kill. These the law can and should eliminate, by regulating competition. 28  For the Brandeisian Justices on the Supreme Court, it became gospel that Brandeis had shown that monopolies did not generate efficiencies and hence that there was no social welfare cost implicated in adopting an antitrust policy hostile to bigness. The four dissenting Justices (Douglas, Black, Murphy, and Rutledge) in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">U.S. v. Columbia Steel Co.</emphasis> 29  cited from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Curse of Bigness</emphasis> again in insisting that any efficiencies resulting from the merger were \u201clargely illusory.\u201d 30  Justice Douglas repeated this observation in his dissent in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co. v. U.S.</emphasis>, 31  where he disputed the premise that a railroad merger could be justified on the grounds that it would result in improved service. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">FTC v. Procter &amp; Gamble</emphasis>, Justice Douglas finally got a majority sign off on the doctrine that efficiencies cannot justify a merger that may increase dominance, 32  an issue with which antitrust law has continued to wrestle ever since. 33 </p><p>And yet, Brandeis himself was not quite so emphatic in dismissing the possibility that an anti-bigness antitrust policy would impose costs of social welfare by suppressing certain economies of scale or scope. He acknowledged that a \u201cunit in business may be too small to be efficient,\u201d although \u201cthe unit may be too large to be efficient, and this is no uncommon incidence of monopoly.\u201d 34  Yet more candidly, he argued that although the trusts had sometimes achieved efficiencies, \u201ctheir fruits have been absorbed almost wholly by the trusts themselves\u201d and \u201cthe community has gained substantially nothing.\u201d 35  This observation presages the later debate between the consumer welfare and total welfare standards 36 ; the important point is the admission that large scale has, in fact, produced efficiencies on at least some occasions. It follows, of course, that an anti-bigness antitrust policy will, in at least some cases, entail a loss of efficiency (even if Brandeis thought that any systemic efficiency losses would be slight).</p><p>Other Brandeisian jurists admitted even more clearly that the potential loss of efficiency was a deliberate aspect of antitrust policy. Perhaps the clearest such statement can be found in Learned Hand\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alcoa</emphasis> opinion: \u201cThroughout the history of these statutes it has been constantly assumed that one of their purposes was to perpetuate and preserve, for its own sake and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">in spite of possible cost</emphasis>, an organization of industry in small units which can effectively compete with each other.\u201d 37  The Supreme Court endorsed this language in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Von\u2019s Grocery</emphasis> 38  and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brown Shoe</emphasis>, 39  opinions that even post-Chicagoans generally recognize did not promote consumerist interests. 40 </p><p>In the near term, the neo-Brandeisians may not have to come to grips with the possibility that their anti-bigness crusade will entail losses of economic efficiencies, for which consumers will have to pay. There is plenty of low-hanging fruit to be picked by both post-Chicagoans, who believe that antitrust has gotten badly off track even on consumer welfare terms, and neo-Brandeisians, who want to pursue an antitrust policy much grander than consumer welfare. But, eventually, the conflicts between efficiency and antidominance that Brandeis weakly admitted a century ago and that Khan cautiously anticipates today will arise. That will be the moment of truth for the neo-Brandeisians: Are they prepared to stick to their guns and oppose mergers that clearly will benefit consumers but create excessive bigness? Will they pursue antimonopolization rules that handcuff dominant firms from exploiting efficiency advantages in the name of protecting the \u201clittle guy\u201d and promoting a level playing field? Or, will the neo-Brandeisians maintain their anti-bigness rhetoric, but slip quietly into a post-Chicago regime characterized by vigorous antitrust enforcement, but on some version of the consumer welfare standard?</p><p>If the neo-Brandeisians do stick to their guns and pursue an antitrust policy \u201cin spite of its possible cost\u201d to efficiency, query whether they will gain enough political traction to maintain their seat at the table in Congress, the White House, and especially the courts. The American people may be motivated to embrace an antitrust policy promised simultaneously to protect consumer welfare many of the other values advanced by Brandeis and his contemporary acolytes\u2014anti-bigness, antidominance, democratic integrity\u2014but it is far from clear that, even at this moment of antitrust excitement, there is much of an appetite for an antitrust policy that would raise consumer prices or impair innovation.</p><p>There is also the possibility that the neo-Brandeisians will find themselves consciously or unconsciously pursuing a strategy similar to that of which Robert Bork has long been accused\u2014obfuscating terms in order to pursue one policy wrapped in the guise of a very different policy. Bork allegedly committed a nefarious two-step by first contorting the Sherman Act\u2019s legislative history to produce a \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d standard and then defining consumer welfare as solely concerned with allocative efficiency such that even wealth transfers from consumers to producers in the form of higher prices did not count as losses of consumer welfare. 41  These semantic machinations were ostensibly necessary because consumer welfare was a politically palatable standard whereas allocative efficiency was not. If the Brandeisians find themselves in a similar position\u2014favoring an anti-bigness policy entailing losses of efficiency but realizing that overtly embracing such a standard could be a political nonstarter\u2014will they do a Bork and conceal their true standard in a more palatable form of words? Or will they advance their position with forthrightness and candor and go down with their ship?</p><p>Contra to Learned Hand, the neo-Brandeisians may dispute that the choice between anti-bigness and efficiency will ever be that stark. Perhaps it will not be. Or perhaps that very argument is the first step down the Borkian road.</p><h>III. Empiricism Above A Priori Theory</h><p>Of all of Brandeis\u2019s many distinguished contributions to the law, none is more important than the idea that facts trump theories. It was Brandeis\u2019s brief in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Muller v. Oregon</emphasis> 42  compiling voluminous empirical evidence on the deleterious effects on women\u2019s health, safety, and morals from working excessive hours that created the archetype of the \u201cBrandeis brief\u201d that would contribute to importantly to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brown v. Board of Education</emphasis> 43  and the realist shift in law in the mid-20th century. 44  It was Brandeis\u2019s theories of federalism that created the idea that the states should serve as \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d testing new laws and policies through experimentation, success, and failure. 45  And it was Brandeis\u2019s vision that constituted the FTC as a fact-gathering organization with the power to collect information from across the nation, inform Congress about the true functioning of markets, and collaborate with industry and civil society to improve market conditions for the good of all. 46  Brandeis was the first great American juridical empiricist; his methodological influence on American law has been unparalleled.</p><p>Of course, Brandeis made his contributions before the rise of contemporary empirical methods, which have greatly increased the complexity and sophistication of empirical studies. One consequence of this rarification of empirical claims in or concerning law is that judges and lawyers\u2014never mind the jurors\u2014often find themselves struggling to keep up with the conflicting expert witness testimony. Whereas in Brandeis\u2019s day, the lawyers were the stars of antitrust cases, that role which been largely ceded to the highly credentialed (and highly paid) economists who swoop into the antitrust agencies to present their multivariate regressions showing that the merger in question will lower (or raise) prices or that the defendant\u2019s prices were above or below average variable cost.</p><p>The paradox for the neo-Brandeisians is this: to be a genuine Brandeisian means to be an empiricist, to prefer inductive fact-based reasoning to a priori generalization or deduction. Today, antitrust empiricism is owned by an economics profession that deploys complex tools on which most lawyers are not qualified to opine and judges outcomes based on welfarist criteria. Therefore, to be a contemporary, Brandeisian on empiricism is to cede the field straight back to the very economists who supposedly have been asleep at the wheel for the last forty years and are unlikely to be sympathetic on average to Brandeisian social and political ideology.</p><p>What are the alternatives for the neo-Brandeisians? One is to scuttle Brandeis\u2019s empiricism and proceed instead with a set of a priori rules or principles designed to reduce market dominance and create a level playing field, as the European Union largely did during its \u201cform based\u201d years, before its more recent turn to \u201ceffects based\u201d economics. 47  That carries the distinctive disadvantages of simultaneously disregarding the most Brandeisian aspect of Brandeis and appropriating a formalistic mode of legal reasoning that eventually became too formal for even the formalistic Europeans. The other is to prise antitrust empiricism away from the economists or to appropriate modes of empiricism\u2014such as qualitative empiricism\u2014that do not have as their outputs dollars and cents. In that case, the rising cohort of Brandeisians will need to master a set of empirical skills as robust as any associated with the economics profession today.</p><p>Another implication of a commitment to induction and empiricism rather than a prior formal reasoning is the willingness to shift course when the facts so dictate. Critics of the Chicago School frequently note that the Chicagoans initially embarked on a needed course correction based on empirical observations about the excesses of antitrust law but eventually settled into a set of rigid ideological dogmas at odds with the mounting evidence that their overly laissez faire approach was jeopardizing market competitiveness. 48  Are the neo-Brandeisians committed to eschewing a similar course by genuinely following the facts wherever they lead? If it turns out that vertical integration between dominant platforms and marketplace participants does not, in fact, jeopardize democratic and social values but instead promotes market participation and pluralism by a wide variety of social actors, will the neo-Brandeisians concede that \u201cfair is fair\u201d and back off antitrust enforcement against vertical mergers? If the evidence shows that Google, Facebook, and Amazon are not nearly as dominant as they might seem because entry barriers are actually quite low and nascent firms with a realistic chance to innovate and compete are a dime a dozen, will the neo-Brandeisians take off their boxing gloves and shake hands with Sundar Pichi, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos? In other words, are the neo-Brandeisians genuinely open to fact-based, empirical antitrust, regardless of its outcomes?</p><p>The answer may well be \u201cof course we are, with the caveat that we are likely to interpret the empirical outcomes differently than you do.\u201d Fair enough. For now, it is enough to ask that, in the spirit of Brandeis himself, the neo-Brandeisians show a bona fide willingness to prioritize facts over theories.</p><h>IV. Conclusion</h><p>Congratulations to the neo-Brandeisians! A small cadre of committed scholars and activists have succeeded in fundamentally changing the terms of the antitrust debate in a very short period of time. It remains to be seen, of course, whether they will be able to move from a seat at the table to regime change. I offer no prediction. What I have offered instead is a set of questions, neither friendly nor hostile, about the relationship of this current movement to its original patron. Hopefully, the answers to these questions will help to clarify the direction and appeal of the budding neo-Brandeisian movement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGEABX-1011770003603X19875039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGEABX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D4-0K81-JBMY-H055-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470049</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sage Publications, Inc.

This is Sam's Aunt Betty. This week on the show, the role of Big Tech in 2020. All right, let's start the show. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAM SANDERS: Hey, y'all. From NPR, I'm Sam Sanders. IT'S BEEN A MINUTE. As my Aunt Betty said, this week we're talking tech. I have been thinking something for a while. Every big conversation we're having right now in 2020 - the pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement, election 2020 - what is shaping all those conversations? Facebook and Twitter. For better and for worse, those are the spaces that we're going to to talk all this stuff out, even as we are still being manipulated on these platforms in 2020 as much as we were in 2016. </p><p>I've been obsessed with what these companies have been doing recently to take a stand, or not, on any number of issues. Twitter is now labeling President Trump's tweets for threatening harm or for spreading misinformation. It's led to several prominent conservatives leaving Twitter over the last few weeks. Facebook is kind of doing the opposite. They aren't really censoring Trump, and that's led to a boycott of the company. Big advertisers, like REI and Verizon, have said this month that they will no longer buy ads on Facebook. So we're going to take some time on the show this week to talk about Facebook and Twitter and how different and harder life for those two companies is in 2020 compared to 2016 or really any other year. </p><p>To do that, I'm joined by two all-star panelists, Tony Romm and Lizza Dwoskin. They both cover tech for The Washington Post. I love a good Washington Post takeover. </p><p>Welcome to you both. Hi. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Hey. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Hey, Sam. How you doing? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'm pretty good. I'm so glad that on this show this week democracy will not die in darkness. Thank y'all for being here. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter) Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Anyhoo, before we talk more about tech, I just want to emotionally check in with you both. We are now almost halfway through 2020. How long has this half-year felt for both of y'all on a scale of nanoseconds to eon? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, God. I didn't realize it had been a half-year until you had said that. Oh, now it feels like eons. Jeez. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Sorry. </p><p>TONY ROMM: It all feels like one giant day. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, sadly. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: I just had - I had a baby. I'm like, when did I have that baby? Last August. And, like, everything has felt like one giant day since then. And then sort of the world became the cave that I was already in. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Wow. The world became the cave I was already in. Wow. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I love it. I love it. Realness. Realness. Or what my editor says, I feel her (laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: Should I go get - like, go get a glass of wine or something right now? Like, my goodness. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Yeah, let's start. You know, it's 10 a.m. Who cares? You're in California, at least. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter) Exactly. So I want to talk tech right now. You both cover tech, and tech is very important, obviously. But I feel like I'm hearing less about it systemically these days. And I feel like we are thinking about tech differently than we were a few years ago. So I want to take some time now to talk about where Big Tech stands in 2020, particularly compared to 2016. </p><p>And I'm really not talking about all tech. I'm talking about, this week at least, Twitter and Facebook. These are two platforms that in many ways drive a national conversation. And, I mean, Tony confirmed. Like, after 2016, a lot of folks on both sides of the aisle said Big Tech is kind of bad, kind of a hot mess. Let's fix it. And now, four years after that, a few months away from the next big election, there's been no major regulation of either Twitter or Facebook. And it seems that neither of these platforms have actually lost a lot of users. What's up with that, Tony? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. In so many ways, a lot has changed and nothing has changed. I mean, on one hand, we're now talking about these issues in a way that we weren't four years ago. And even the companies are talking about them in different ways. We saw just this week and then last week that companies like Facebook and Twitter are actually beginning to do something about all of those things the president says that a lot of his critics find repugnant or controversial. </p><p>But at the same time, you're right. Nothing has happened here really in terms of regulation. You know, we've had hearings. We've had demands for documents. We've had investigations that might sooner than later result in something, but that'll also depend on the willingness of regulators to put the money where their mouth is. And so it almost feels, I think, in the eyes of some of the people who wanted to see tech change most that it was a squandered opportunity over the past few years. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. So then for you both, it's hard to forecast to three months from now, let alone three hours, but is there any way of knowing whether all the bad, weird things that happened on these platforms last election will be kept from happening again? I mean, is it going to be 2016 all over again? </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: I mean, I think it's going to be - first of all, I think it's going to be harder to know. Two, though, I think they've gotten better at getting that rush, like, the outs, like, spotting out, like, foreign interference. I think they've gotten better at that because they literally - the bar was so low in 2016 when Russians were paying in rubles, you know. They've gotten a lot more sophisticated, but the stuff that's really, really complicated, as you can see during the pandemic, as you can see during the protests, is really just misinformation and abusive comments and hate speech or what you might call hate speech, you know, comments that tow the line by politicians, by political leaders. And so that's a much, much more fraught kind of issue. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, yeah. Tony, you have any thoughts on that? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. I mean, you're right. It's hard to predict, you know, what we might see come the 2020 election. But I would actually turn the question on his head a little bit and say that it kind of doesn't matter in some respect. I mean, like, yes, it does for the future of democracy. I don't want to diminish that. But, you know, Facebook was... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: You know that thing. </p><p>TONY ROMM: It does die in darkness after all. But, you know, I mean to say that, like, Facebook felt like a cesspool to a lot of people, like, prior to the 2016 election. But just to go back to something you said earlier, Sam, like, people are still using this stuff. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: You know, we're all sort of doom-scrolling through our feeds anyway. We know it's bad for us, but it still is our drug. Like, we're still using social media and still sharing on social media no matter how many bad things may actually happen there. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, yeah. You know, we've pretty much laid out the way that Americans and politicians feel about these platforms. We don't really like them anymore, but we still use them. I want to talk for a second about how these companies view themselves now versus four years ago or when they started. </p><p>Let's start with Facebook because I feel like Facebook is in this mode now where they've really kind of become a libertarian platform, and they want to just say, we are open for whoever wants to say whatever, and it's not our job to monitor, which is different from where they were a few years ago. And it's different from this kind of mission they had for a while, where they wanted to connect the world and bring positivity and unity to the whole globe. Like, do they see themselves differently now than they did maybe a few years ago? </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: It's so funny you say libertarian because, you know, there was a moment where Zuckerberg himself, especially with the rise of Trump, was - this shouldn't be permitted on our platform. And it doesn't mean that he wasn't very pro-free speech. He always was. But he had this instinct to rein it in, that he felt it was offensive, according to sources that we have. And then he's moved into this, like, much more hard-line position on free speech that I think in some ways was always there. But now the company has just boldly articulated as this is where we're going to go. And it's so in the opposite direction of the other tech companies because, like, you see Twitter had this really interesting transformation because Twitter used to be called the free speech wing of the free speech party and... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I remember. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Right? So, like, that company especially was founded by people who largely had come from Google. And their whole ethos, the world they came up in was, we need to protect the Internet because the Internet can be shut down in other countries. So it's like the Internet was their ideology. And so that led them to become, like, you know, kind of to use an intellectual term, but, like, free speech maximalists. Like, we need to protect what can be said. The platform itself has to be protected. But now Twitter has - the pendulum has swung in the other way for Twitter. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: They're, like, labeling Trump tweets, which surprised me when it began to happen a few weeks ago. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. I mean, just to go back to your original question about, like, these companies and their world views and stuff, I - you know, often, you hear this comment from Mark at Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter about, you know, their interest in free speech. But often, critics are quick to point out that sometimes it feels like it's less a commitment to free speech as it is a desire to get out of responsibility. You know, if you say that you believe in giving people the right to express themselves, I think the concern on Capitol Hill and elsewhere is that what you're really saying is you don't want to do the work of moderating. And there have actually been times where Facebook has indicated that its views on these things have changed as it's become a bigger platform. You know, I sat down with Mark Zuckerberg a few months ago, well before the pandemic and so forth, when he had delivered that speech that kind of made it look like he was, like, running for president or something at Georgetown last year. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I remember that. </p><p>TONY ROMM: And, you know, and the whole point of that was free speech, right? He was defending the fact that Facebook had chosen not to do anything about the fact that Trump was lying in his advertisements. And in the course of that, Mark said, you know, we didn't believe it was our responsibility to stand in the way of what an elected official is trying to say. And in the course of doing that, one of the things that Mark pointed out was that, you know, he had created Facebook in large parts because he felt that people needed a place to share their views and vent politically about things, including the first Iraq War, which was funny because I sort of remember Facebook as the thing that came about as a way for college students to find who was hot or not. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Exactly. </p><p>TONY ROMM: And, you know, it had one of those makings of... </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Like, he actually rewrote the origin story of Facebook as a political protest? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. He said it was a driving force behind it. He took a whole lot of criticism. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Wow. I watched \"The Social Network.\" I know it was about hot or not and all that stuff - who was hot. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Tony, on what you're saying, like, one of things I actually learned recently from a source - we haven't published this, but... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Uh-oh. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Oh, no. Oh, no. No, it's not, like, salacious or anything. It just really kind of, like, opened my eyes to - you guys remember the Arab Spring. And we remember that one big kind of force in the Arab Spring was when the Google engineer created a Facebook page to protest the government. So ever - a lot of people associate it with that Google engineer Wael Ghonim. But what he did was he created a Facebook page. </p><p>And the person I spoke with told me that at the time, like, Facebook really didn't even want to take credit for that. Like, people were like, oh, my God. You're helping democracy. Like, you're doing this. And they were kind of just like, oh, no. Like, we're just a platform. Like, you know, here you go. Like, they - later, they did end up taking credit for it and kind of fits into what Mark is saying now. But at the time, they weren't - you know, they were more fearful of kind of getting involved in politics in that way. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Is this reckoning for Big Tech just the nature of industries that have a moment? Like, at some point, the mood changes and how we see these sectors change. Like, you can't always love the Wall Street bros, and you can't always love the tech bros. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. But remember that those perceptions change because bad stuff happens, right? It's not just that, like, these positions fall out of vogue because there's another cooler industry that comes along. It's because for the Wall Street bros, they tanked an economy. And for the oil bros... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: More than once. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, right. I don't know if there are oil bros, but, like, if there are, then perhaps they tank the environment. And now in the context of the tech companies we're talking about them, you know, lighting democracy on fire, at least according to some of the folks that we talked to, in the way that they've allowed foreign interference to affect elections and in the falsehoods they allow to spread on a daily basis. And you even see that among the people who currently work at these companies, as they change positions, as they get frustrated with their leaders or as they begin to speak out more in organizing protests and rallies of their own companies. And they often happen in a way that you don't see in other industries. I think we're beginning to kind of see that within Silicon Valley itself. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: It's just weird if you think about, like, all the reading you do about millennials is that - and, you know, and younger workers, they really want to work for places that have values. And Silicon Valley, you know, still employs a lot of younger workers. So they have that idealism about their workplace. I just wonder - you know, I feel like there still is that craving among workers for values. But as Tony said, like, they're losing that sense of values, which was always kind of the marketing edge that the tech companies had. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: One thing I also wonder about is the public's relationship to these companies. We've talked about what their leaders think, you know, Jack and Mark and what Trump thinks. But I am really perplexed by the ways in which America still embraces these two platforms, Facebook and Twitter, which we all seem to hate. And it's really weird to watch this happen in 2020 because if you think of - I don't know - the organizing around this new surge of Black Lives Matter protests, it's happening on Twitter. It's happening on Facebook. But those are the same platforms that are often full of white supremacist posts and abuse for those very activists of color. It just feels like now there's no way to live in this world without them. Like, it is inconceivable to imagine life as we know it without platforms like these. Like, whether we love it or not, this is our reality now. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. And it's also hard to imagine writing about it in the context of isolation. You know, too often I think when we were discussing tech companies for a long time we did it by thinking of tech as its own discrete industry. And that's true, right? You know, Facebook is not the same as Ford. But it is impossible to talk about democracy and elections and race without also talking about tech. And it's impossible to talk about tech without also discussing elections and race and so forth. Like, because there's no such thing as online and offline. It's one world. It's just bleeding into each other. I think for too long we sort of treated them as isolated in our thinking and in some cases in our writing. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. I think, Tony Romm, you have given us the perfect toss to break. What a wonderful concluding thought. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: We're going to take a break right now, but when we come back, I will play my favorite game with these two all-stars. The game is called Who Said That. We'll be right back. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>TONY ROMM: My favorite story involving Mark and Jack - there was a period of time where Mark was only eating meat that he had killed himself and, like, served Jack Dorsey raw goat. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: What? </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: (Laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: And Jack was, like, asked about this. I actually can't remember who the reporter was who, like, interviewed Jack about it. And Jack was asked about it. He was like, yeah, it was weird. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, my God. They are not just like us. </p><p>We are back. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. As I said earlier, this episode is a Washington Post takeover. I'm joined by Tony Romm and Lizza Dwoskin. They both cover tech for The Washington Post. We're talking tech this episode. And because life is funny, we actually had a tech hiccup while taping this next segment. I will not go into details, but Lizza might sound a bit different than Tony and I. It's fine. It is fine. Keep listening. OK, now we're going to play my favorite game, Who Said That. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF ATLANTA\")        </p><p>KANDI BURRUSS: Who had been saying that? </p><p>PORSHA WILLIAMS: Who said that? </p><p>KENYA MOORE: Who said that? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So Who Said That is the simplest game. I share three quotes from the week of news. You've got to guess who said that. I might give you a clue. I might just give you a point. The winner gets nothing. Everyone can feel good about this game, I promise. </p><p>Right, Tony? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. I mean, although every time I do it, my friends listen, and they're like, do you live in a cave? What is wrong with you, you dumpster fire? </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. Let's go. You ready for the first quote? There's no buzzers, so just yell out your answer whenever you have an answer. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Let's do it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. Here's the first quote - \"this year is going to be different. It will not be like the past, where there's one big, giant show. We do not want a lot of people out watching. The idea is very brief bursts - brief but mighty.\" </p><p>TONY ROMM: Is that me going to the gym? </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter) This guy. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: That was good (laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: I actually don't know. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This is from a local official talking about something that usually just happens on the fourth, but it's been happening... </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Fireworks. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, the fireworks. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. Which local official? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, which local official. Is it the mayor? </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Oakland, Boston. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's a mayor. Which city has had it worse - the worst? </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Not Oakland and Boston? I live in Oakland. I hear them all night. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Like, literally, it's all night outside my apartment. I'm sort of surprised it's not D.C.</p><p>SAM SANDERS: What city would always say that it has everything the worst 'cause that's their thing? </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: New York. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Who is the mayor of New York? </p><p>TONY ROMM: We've already said. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Now say the name of the mayor. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Bill de Blasio. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: There we go. There we go. We got there. Congratulations, Tony. So that was New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announcing this week that in spite of cities like New York and others being overwhelmed by nighttime fireworks the last few weeks, the city will still have a Fourth of July fireworks celebration with help from Macy's. Why are they still doing this? We've seen reports across the country for a few weeks now of an uptick in illegal fireworks being set off in major cities all across the country. Some folks have gone so far as to suggest that, like, the government or the authorities are involved. Everyone seems to hate it. And in spite of that national mood, Bill de Blasio, per usual, doesn't read the room and says, no, we're still going to have more fireworks sponsored by the city on the Fourth of July. </p><p>Anyhoo, with a lot of help, Tony, you got that point. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: I let him win. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This next quote is a movie quote. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, God. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And I'm giving you this movie quote because, surprisingly, last weekend, this old movie was No. 1 at the U.S. box office. Here's a quote. Name the film - \"your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.\" Oh, come on. </p><p>TONY ROMM: I haven't been to a movie theater in, like, years. I don't even know (laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This is one of the better Spielberg films. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: I... </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's a movie with - y'all really need help. OK. It's a movie with dinosaurs. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: \"Jurassic Park\"? </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. Yeah, \"Jurassic Park,\" strangely enough, was the No. 1 film at the box office this past weekend. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Why? </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: I thought it was going to be something pandemic-related. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: No, because the only theaters that can really function right now are drive-in theaters. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And they specialize in showing older, classic titles. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: That's a good one. That's interesting. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Right? So last weekend, \"Jurassic Park\" made a little over half a million dollars at the U.S. box office. </p><p>TONY ROMM: OK. I have to admit I've never seen a \"Jurassic Park\" movie. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Well, Tony, you're talking about things to do during the pandemic. Now is the time. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Now is the time. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, there we go. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Last quote. The quote is from a famous rapper who had his heyday many, many years ago but manages to still pop up in the news every year, so it seems. This is for an ad he did for Papa Cristo's Greek Grill in Los Angeles. The quote is, \"you can't even pronounce the food it's so ***damn good.\" </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Snoop? </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: What rapper who peaked when we were in high school still manages to pop up in weird business schemes all the time? </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: OK. I feel like Ja Rule, but, like... </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes, you got it. </p><p>TONY ROMM: It is? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's Ja Rule. It is Ja Rule. So there is this lovely commercial out this week featuring Ja Rule... </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>JA RULE: Papa Cristo pitas. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Plugging Papa Cristo's Greek Grill in Los Angeles. He mispronounces several Greek dishes... </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>JA RULE: Ock (ph) - oh, hold on. Oktapodakia - whatever. But it's good. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Before saying... </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>JA RULE: You can't even pronounce the food it's so ***damn good. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: The ad is actually for a new TBS reality TV show called \"Celebrity Show-Off.\" </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, no. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: On this show, celebrities compete to see who can make the best content to get YouTube views. And, of course, Ja Rule did this because Ja Rule. I will say, though, like, Ja Rule is my favorite kind of celebrity because he just has no shame. He is there to make money and use his fame to make money, and that's it. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Give us all the candor of Ja Rule. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter) I'll also take the money of Ja Rule, although I don't really know how he's doing financially. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Well, he didn't have to pay anything out for that Fyre Festival debacle, so he always lands up. He has nine lives, it seems. Here's to you, Ja. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: On that note, congratulations to you both for playing the game and for being good sports and for teaching me a lot about tech this week. Lizza Dwoskin, Tony Romm, two tech reporters for The Washington Post, I'm so glad y'all both were here this weekend. Let's do it again soon. </p><p>ELIZABETH DWOSKIN: Yeah, this was fun. Thanks. </p><p>TONY ROMM: See you, Sam. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right, listeners, this might be the last week I ask you this for a while, but I'm going to ask you again. We're pushing the show hard this month, and we need you to help us out and do a little bit of work. If you go over to Apple Podcasts, rate or review the show. I know. No one wants to do that. You know, you got other things to do. But when you do that, it helps other folks find this show, and I think that's nice. Hook us up. We'll be forever grateful. Thank you. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. We'll be right back. </p><p>We are back. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I'm Sam Sanders, and we're talking this episode about Big Tech and social media and how platforms like Twitter and Facebook keep having an outsized influence on all of our lives, and they're kind of the epicenters of all the big conversations we're having right now in 2020. </p><p>My next guest has some experience with those two platforms and the way that her work can be understood and misunderstood, often through social media. Alexandra Petri is a columnist for The Washington Post. See? I told you - Washington Post takeover this episode. She writes satire for the Post, a genre with a long history. But in today's social media ecosystem, a lot of her jokes can sometimes be lost on people, even people in the White House. </p><p>Let's flash back right now to March 2017. Alexandra had just written a column titled \"Trump's Budget Makes Perfect Sense And Will Fix America, And I Will Tell You Why.\" </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: So I wrote it, and I thought, well, it's going to be pretty clear, given that, like, the second sentence is something about you punching people in the face with an eagle, that it should be - like, it's not the most subtle satire I've ever written. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But she woke up to an email telling her that the same column - again, a satire column - was on a list of real news articles that the White House recommended at an official, like, White House event - a list of articles they thought were actually praising the Trump White House budget. </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: Usually, I'm consigned to being fake news. But for that one beautiful, blissful day, I got to be real news, which was very exciting and on a whole different plane. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This strange experience did not stop Alexandra from writing satire. In fact, she is out now with a new book of essays called \"Nothing Is Wrong And Here Is Why.\" It's mostly a compilation of her columns, including that one. </p><p>This kind of, you know, makes the case for, like - I don't know - why your voice is important right now, because we live in a moment where we need to find ways to laugh about the absurdity of everything more than ever before. But we also live in this moment where you really can't tell what the joke is or isn't, which is I guess why it's good folks like you are out there to help us figure that out. I mean, what is it like to write satire in a political climate where you know that some folks will see it as truth? </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: It's tough 'cause I know - there's this thing called Poe's law, where they say, like, any sufficiently sincere expression of your opinion on the Internet is indistinguishable from advanced satire and sort of vice versa. So you have to - like, the worst thing that ever happens to me when I write something is I get an email from somebody like, finally, somebody gets it. And I hate those. I'm like, no... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: ...I didn't do it right 'cause I always try to make it so, like, if you read to the end of it, you'll - there's sort of a turn where I sort of pop out of it like, you know, the cuckoo in the clock and say, hey, like, here's what I'm trying to say here. I hope you notice. And then I pop back in, and, like, we keep going around and the figurines dance and the metaphor continues to overtake the sentence. But a lot of stuff gets swept under the rug as satire that's just people being like, well, if I state something that's untrue, I can get lots of clicks. And that's still continuing. And sometimes it's identified... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: ...As satire, and sometimes it's just, like, a dude with a computer - like, the proverbial guy in a basement doing his thing. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: They have multiplied in the last few years, I tell you (laughter). I want you, if you're cool with it, to pick one of the shorter essays from the book, read it or read a snippet of it and then kind of talk through your process of making it and what you want people to take from it. </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: Ooh. I'm open to suggestions on this 'cause I... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Can I have you read a bit of \"Famous Quotes The Way A Woman Ought To Say Them In A Meeting\" (ph)? </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: Oh, yeah. In this one, I took the liberty of translating some famous sentences into the way a woman would have to say them during a meeting to avoid being perceived as angry, threatening or bitchy. And so you start with your thought, and then you say it as though you're offering a groveling apology for an unspecified error. (Reading) Give me liberty or give me death. Dave, if I could - if I could just - I just really feel like if we had liberty, it would be terrific, and the alternative would just be terrible (ph), you know? That's just how it strikes me. I don't know. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: Or I have a dream today would become, (reading) I'm sorry. I just had this idea. It's probably crazy. But, look; just as long as we're throwing things out here, I had sort of an idea or vision about maybe the future. </p><p>Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. I'm sorry, Mikhail, if I could? I didn't mean to cut you off there. Can we agree that this wall maybe isn't quite doing what it should be doing? Just looking at everything everyone's been saying, it seems like we could consider removing it possibly. I don't know. What does the room feel? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I love it. So hearing you read this, it's hilarious, and it's also kind of sad 'cause it's true. And it's also a thing that you've touched on in your writing for many, many years now. When you hear yourself reading out loud a piece like that that you've written, knowing that it still might be true in a certain way five or 10 years from now, does it make you a little sad (laughter)? </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: Every time one of these stays relevant, it does make me - it makes me sad. And I feel like one of the things that's both inspiring when you're a writer and depressing is you have this sort of sustaining, hopefully not all of the time delusion, but sometimes delusion that by writing about something, you've done something about it. And so you think, no, I wrote about this. Didn't we fix it? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It'll get better, yeah. </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: Yeah. And it's sad you have to keep writing about the same things over and over again. And it's like, no, I'm out of jokes. Now we just have this unpleasant reality and I've reached my limit of humorous remarks to toss in its direction in the hope that one of them will really whack it on the jaw and knock it over. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: When you're in those moments, how do you keep writing? </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: I mean, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you just say, well, I'm going to go take a walk or, in this case, a turn around the room in these times. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: I don't know. 'Cause I was - you think, well, I can't write any jokes about this, but I still have to say something about it. And so you wind up writing something that isn't humorous but is still like, hey, I didn't want to let this go by without remarking on it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. A thing you have said before in interviews and written before really sticks with me. You said, quote, \"every joke is sort of an argument where you're trying to connect a line to what people think is true from something that they may have not made up their mind about.\" Explain that. </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: Humor is sort of - is based on, like, the recognition of things that are true. And it's like you're in this moment of making eye contact with somebody where you're thinking, hey, I see you in there. Like, I get it. And, often, there are things where people - like, they just don't think they can be swayed on. But sometimes you think, well, if I could just find a crack in this argument and sort of push my way in there, maybe then you'll recognize that this thing is sort of absurd. </p><p>Like, one of my favorite things to do is when you have somebody and they've got this worldview where - like, people were like, oh, crisis actors definitely came in after Sandy Hook and they were all crisis actors and, like, don't worry about it. I'm like, so, well, there had to be some sort of, like, audition process, then. Like, let's imagine what that would look like. And sort of try to find the part where you sort of stick your wedge in there and you pop - hopefully pop something open and they'll say, well, I can't actually imagine that audition process now that you mention it. Maybe I'm just trying to... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: ...Hide from myself the fact that something horrible happened. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, trying to complicate the narrative, I guess. </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: Yeah, try to be like, well, here's what follows from that. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. A lot of folks hearing this conversation have heard you and I laugh for the last six minutes. You are a humor writer for people who are like, I don't want to laugh right now. Everything is bad. Make a 20-second elevator pitch, if not for your book, for laughter itself. </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: Laughing doesn't necessarily mean you're not taking things seriously. It could also mean that you're a hyena, for instance. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: And just laughter in general - I feel like, yeah, well, why deny yourself? It's like trying to argue on behalf of, you know, eating a good meal or, like, having the companionship of friends. It's like, well, if I can't explain to you... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: ...Why it's positive to have... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's like, of course these are good things to do. </p><p>ALEXANDRA PETRI: ...The companionship of friends, maybe I'm pitching the wrong person. Maybe you really are a hyena. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter) Thanks again to Alexandra Petri. Her book is called \"Nothing Is Wrong And Here Is Why.\" It's in stores right now. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>AUNT BETTY: Now it's time to end the show as we always do. Every week, listeners share the best thing that happened to them all week. We encourage folks to brag, and they do. Let's hear a few of those submissions. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>MICHELLE #1: Hi, Sam. This is Michelle (ph) in Oakland, Calif., and the best part of my week was my husband teaching me how to back into a parking spot in our brand-new car. It's a little embarrassing that I don't know how to do that at this point in my life, but he talked me through it. At no point did we yell or raise our voices at each other, so I think this whole coronavirus thing has been good. It's taught us how to be a little more patient with each other, which is a good thing 'cause we're about to be first-time parents. </p><p>MICHELLE #2: Hi, Sam. This is Michelle (ph) from Lititz, Pa., and the best part of my week was completing the Loyalsock Trail, which is in north central PA. It was a 5-day, 59.21-mile backpacking trip with my cousin. </p><p>JUSTINA: I became an aunt. My nephew was born a month and a half premature. And today, I got to hold him for the first time. </p><p>BEN: My name is Ben (ph), and I'm a teacher in the Twin Cities. And the best part of my week was that after months of electronic check-ins and pleading, we got to spend time with students and their families at a socially distanced graduation event today. I'm overflowing with gratitude for the 10 boys I've been honored to know throughout their high school careers and honored to be able to call students - Jesus (ph) and Diego (ph) and Chris (ph) and Brian (ph) and Ben (ph) and Alex (ph) and John (ph) and Edwin (ph) and Andy (ph) and Sergio (ph). I love them, and I'm so proud of what they've done. I'm overflowing. </p><p>DANI: Hey, Sam. This is Dani (ph). Two and a half months ago, I lost my boyfriend Jack (ph) to cancer. It's been a really hard year, but this week, I was finally able to acknowledge and seek help for my depression. I know it's early in this journey, but today I was able to eat well, go for a walk and listen to your podcast. That felt actually impossible seven days ago, so I think that's a pretty great first step. Thanks for being there. Bye. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Thanks to all those listeners - Dani, Ben, Justina (ph), Michelle and Michelle - two Michelles.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Is your data worth $5 a month to tech companies? $20? More? How much would make you care?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  An answer to the final question may come from a bill proposed by Senators Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri. Their bill would require companies that collect user data to tell consumers and regulators what they collect, how they make money off it and how much it's worth -- in aggregate and broken down by users.</p><p>  ''The overall lack of transparency and disclosure in this market have made it impossible for users to know what they're giving up,'' Mr. Warner said in a statement.</p><p>  Which is true. Seeming to acknowledge such concerns, Facebook announced changes to its terms of service a few days later, explaining how it makes money. ''Business and organizations pay us to show you ads,'' it said. ''We use your personal data to help determine which ads to show you.'' (Unbelievably, it hadn't said that before. Sorry, you expected more?)</p><p>  Less obvious is how much people care. As my colleague Charlie Warzel wrote this past week: ''We don't always act in our own interests when it comes to our data. We'll even forgo monetary rewards to avoid thinking about privacy.''</p><p>  But I guess that's the point of the bill: to shock us into realizing of how much our data is worth.</p><p>  So, how easy is it to work that out?</p><p>  ''Not easy at all,'' said Robert Shapiro, the chairman of the economic advisory firm Sonecon, who has tried to do it himself.</p><p>  Mr. Shapiro's approach: Determine advertising revenue for some of the biggest American data collectors, work out the proportion attributed to targeted ads (about half, one recent study said, based on 2015 data), and divide by the number of users. Using that approach, he found that in 2018, an average American's data was worth about $240, or $20 a month, to big tech companies, data brokers and other firms.</p><p>  Mr. Warner is more cautious. In an interview with Axios, he pegged the figure at $5 a month.</p><p>  The problem is, both sums sound insultingly small. The idea of increasing public awareness of the issue is great, but I worry that people might be underwhelmed, not outraged.</p><p>  Mr. Shapiro said that his figure was probably an underestimate, because companies had become more sophisticated in their targeting of ads. And as companies grow, he said, the figure could rise to as much as $600 a year by 2022.</p><p>  Would that be enough to make you care? What would? Tell me, at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jamie@nytimes.com\">jamie@nytimes.com</email></p><p>  What's American?</p><p>  Once, you could build a car in America using American designs and American steel and, very confidently, call it American.</p><p>  But as products became more complicated, supply chains and intellectual property went global. So when the United States government moved to block the sale of American products and services to Huawei and other Chinese tech companies (a list that recently got longer), many companies, even some outside the United States, quickly stopped selling, because determining what ran afoul of the rule was difficult.</p><p>  But it has now been a month since the rule was announced, and it's clear that American companies don't want to leave all of the $11 billion Huawei spends with them every year on the table. So they scratched at the rule, and examined their supply chains, and decided that, actually, they could sell some stuff to Huawei. My colleagues Paul Mozur and Cecilia Kang reported on how Intel and Micron have sidestepped the ban; The Wall Street Journal says Qualcomm has, too.</p><p>  How these companies determined that skirting the rule was O.K. is unclear, but the regulation says products can be shipped to Huawei if they are made in foreign countries and if the material in them that originated in the United States accounts for no more than 25 percent of their value. (''Material'' means physical components, but also intellectual property.) Complex webs of foreign subsidiaries no doubt help make it easier to claim that material isn't American, too.</p><p>  All of this underscores the difficulty facing the Trump administration: It can be hard to say a gadget is really American -- or Chinese, or whatever -- these days. So a tech Iron Curtain doesn't looking so impenetrable.</p><p>  Small platform, big stance</p><p>  Imagine you run a small social network where people discuss knitting. And you notice people increasingly discussing a non-knitting topic that you believe detracts from the network. You could just ban the topic, right?</p><p>  Well:</p><p>  ''On Sunday, Ravelry, a popular website for knitters and crocheters, took a political stand when it announced that it was banning content that supports President Trump, in what it said was a resolution against white supremacy.''</p><p>  Some users were ... displeased? ''Kill yourselves,'' one said. ''Boycott Ravelry,'' said another.</p><p>  As a private social media platform, Ravelry isn't limited by free speech rights; it can go right ahead and take such a step. And it will probably weather the haters: It's a free service, so users have little recourse (apart from telling it to kill itself, or boycotting it), and most of its eight million users will probably accept it and keep knitting.</p><p>  Expect more of this. Ravelry got the idea from another small social network, the role-playing game forum RPG.net. ''There are very clear incentives for smaller platforms to take strong stances,'' Rasmus Nielsen, a professor of political communication at Oxford University, said in an email. That might be for product differentiation purposes, or to make an ideological stand for the community.</p><p>  There's an interesting point about size here: Facebook is a private social media platform, just like Ravelry; it could ban topics and clean up problems overnight.</p><p>  It won't, of course, because the backlash (and ad revenue hit) would be huge. As a society, we don't really want huge platforms like Facebook to turn into censors. (Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, reiterated at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado that he had no plans to do that, defending the need for free speech even for factually incorrect statements.)</p><p>  ''The tricky part is what gets to count as small and thus relatively unproblematic,'' Professor Nielsen said. ''Ravelry clearly is. Is Twitter?''</p><p>  Some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Bitcoin enjoyed a sugar rush. It hit $13,880 on Wednesday, a 17-month high. But as Bitcoin tends to do, it quickly dropped, falling below $11,000 the next day. There are competing theories about the resurgence, but Facebook's cryptocurrency project could have provided some legitimacy, even though it won't be using Bitcoin.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Speaking of ... Facebook's crypto project still faces skepticism. Not just from regulators but from Facebook's partners in the venture, too.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Jony Ive is leaving Apple. Its chief design officer is heading off to start a new company called LoveFrom, but will continue to work on Apple products.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Google and the University of Chicago were sued over medical data. Patient data allegedly wasn't stripped of identifiable information before being handed to the tech giant.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Amazon has a fake books problem. They're being pirated and sold on the retail giant's site, meaning real authors are cheated while Amazon still makes sales.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 America has been hacking Iran, staging attacks against an intelligence group that United States officials believe helped plan recent strikes on oil tankers.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Robots could displace 20 million manufacturing jobs by 2030, mainly in the lower-income areas of developed nations. (And if a robot doesn't take your job, it could become your boss.)</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 A.I. experts don't want to power a Big Brother state. In a European Union report, experts said they wanted to ban the use of A.I. for mass surveillance and societal scoring.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 The Pentagon has a laser that can identify people by their heartbeats.

Warner and Josh Hawley seeks to protect privacy by forcing tech companies to disclose the ' true value ' of their data to users. Specifically, companies with more than 100 million users would have to provide each user with an assessment of the financial value of their data, as well as reveal revenue generated by ' obtaining, collecting, processing, selling, using or sharing user data .' In addition, the DASHBOARD Act would give users the right todelete their datafrom companies' databases. As a researcherexploring the ethical and political implications of digital platforms and big data, I'm sympathetic to the bill's ambition of increasing transparency and empowering users. However, estimating the value of user data isn't simple and won't, I believe, solve privacy issues.</p><p><br/>Data collectorsThe data collected by tech companies consists not just of traditional identifying information such as name, age and gender. Rather, as Harvard historian Rebecca Lemov has noted, it includes ' Tweets, Facebook likes, Twitches, Google searches, online comments, one-click purchases, even viewing-but-skipping-over a photograph in your feed .' In other words, big data contains the mundane yet intimate moments of people's lives. And, if Facebook captures your interactions with friends and family, Google your late night searches, and Alexa your living room commands, wouldn't you want to know, as the bill suggests, what your ' data is worth and to whom it is sold '?However, calculating the value of user data isn't that simple. Estimates on what user data is worth vary widely. They include evaluations ofless than a dollar for an average person's datato a slightly more generous US$100 for a Facebook user.One user sold his data for $2,733 on Kickstarter . To achieve this number, he had to share data including keystrokes, mouse movements and frequent screenshots. Sadly, the DASHBOARD Act doesn't specify how it would estimate the value of user data. Instead, it explains that the Securities and Exchange Commission, an independent federal government agency, ' shall develop a method or methods for calculating the value of user data .' The commission, I believe, will quickly realize that estimating the value of user data is a challenging undertaking.<br/><br/><br/>One study estimated that a user's Facebook profile was worth about $100.<br/>nevodka/Shutterstock.com<br/><br/>More than personalThe proposed legislation aims to provide users with more transparency. However, privacy is no longer solely a matter of personal data.Data shared by a fewcan provide insights into the lives of many.Facebook likes, for example, can helppredict a user's sexual orientationwith a high degree of accuracy. Target has used its purchase data to predict which customers are pregnant. The case garnered widespread attention after the retailerfigured out a teen girl was pregnant before her father did . Such predictive ability means that private information isn't just contained in user data. Companies can also infer your private information, based on statistical correlations in the data of a number of users. How can the value of such data be reduced to an individual dollar value? It is more than the sum of its parts. What's more, this ability to use statistical analysis to identify people as belonging to a group category can have far-reaching privacy implications. If service providers canuse predictive analyticsto guess a user's sexual orientation, race, gender and religious belief, what is to stop them from discriminating on that basis? Having been let loose, predictive technologies will continue to work even if users delete their part of the data that helped create them.<br/>Control through dataThe sensitivity of data depends not just on what it contains, but on how governments and companies can use it to exert influence. This is evident in mycurrent researchon China's plannedsocial credit system .

Warner and Josh Hawley seeks to protect privacy by forcing tech companies to disclose the \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/414097487/Dashboard-Act-1-Pager\">true value</url>\" of their data to users. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Specifically, companies with more than 100 million users would have to provide each user with an assessment of the financial value of their data, as well as reveal revenue generated by \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/414097245/Data-Value-Transparency-SIL19753\">obtaining, collecting, processing, selling, using or sharing user data</url>.\" In addition, the DASHBOARD Act would give users the right to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/414097487/Dashboard-Act-1-Pager\">delete their data</url> from companies' databases.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://datascience.virginia.edu/people/samuel-lengen\">As a researcher</url> exploring the ethical and political implications of digital platforms and big data, I'm sympathetic to the bill's ambition of increasing transparency and empowering users. However, estimating the value of user data isn't simple and won't, I believe, solve privacy issues. </p><h>Data collectors</h><p>The data collected by tech companies consists not just of traditional identifying information such as name, age and gender. Rather, as Harvard historian Rebecca Lemov has noted, it includes \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-big-data-is-actually-small-personal-and-very-human\">Tweets, Facebook likes, Twitches, Google searches, online comments, one-click purchases, even viewing-but-skipping-over a photograph in your feed</url>.\" </p><p>In other words, big data contains the mundane yet intimate moments of people's lives. And, if Facebook captures your interactions with friends and family, Google your late night searches, and Alexa your living room commands, wouldn't you want to know, as the bill suggests, what your \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/6/warner-hawley-introduce-bill-to-force-social-media-companies-to-disclose-how-they-are-monetizing-user-data\">data is worth and to whom it is sold</url>\"?  </p><p>However, calculating the value of user data isn't that simple. Estimates on what user data is worth vary widely. They include evaluations of <url normalizedValue=\"https://ig.ft.com/how-much-is-your-personal-data-worth/\">less than a dollar for an average person's data</url> to a slightly more generous US$100 for a Facebook user.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/apr/22/how-much-is-personal-data-worth\">One user sold his data for $2,733 on Kickstarter</url>. To achieve this number, he had to share data including keystrokes, mouse movements and frequent screenshots. </p><p>Sadly, the DASHBOARD Act doesn't specify how it would estimate the value of user data. Instead, it explains that the Securities and Exchange Commission, an independent federal government agency, \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/414097245/Data-Value-Transparency-SIL19753\">shall develop a method or methods for calculating the value of user data</url>.\" The commission, I believe, will quickly realize that estimating the value of user data is a challenging undertaking. </p><h>More than personal</h><p>The proposed legislation aims to provide users with more transparency. However, privacy is no longer solely a matter of personal data. <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107590205.004\">Data shared by a few</url> can provide insights into the lives of many.</p><p>Facebook likes, for example, can help <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802\">predict a user's sexual orientation</url> with a high degree of accuracy. Target has used its purchase data to predict which customers are pregnant. The case garnered widespread attention after the retailer       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/\">figured out a teen girl was pregnant before her father did</url>. </p><p>Such predictive ability means that private information isn't just contained in user data. Companies can also infer your private information, based on statistical correlations in the data of a number of users. How can the value of such data be reduced to an individual dollar value? It is more than the sum of its parts. </p><p>What's more, this ability to use statistical analysis to identify people as belonging to a group category can have far-reaching privacy implications. If service providers can <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13347-014-0157-8\">use predictive analytics</url> to guess a user's sexual orientation, race, gender and religious belief, what is to stop them from discriminating on that basis? </p><p>Having been let loose, predictive technologies will continue to work even if users delete their part of the data that helped create them.</p><h>Control through data</h><p>The sensitivity of data depends not just on what it contains, but on how governments and companies can use it to exert influence. </p><p>This is evident in my <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.samuellengen.net/social-credit\">current research</url> on China's planned       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/31/662436265/china-tests-a-social-credit-score\">social credit system</url>.
