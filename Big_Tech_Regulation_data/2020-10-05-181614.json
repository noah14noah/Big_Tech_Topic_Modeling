Clearly, the agreement this summer on an unprecedented \u20ac750 billion ($879 bill...</p><p>EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen offered an upbeat assessment in her first annual policy report (\u201cstate of the union\u201d address) to the European Parliament this month. Clearly, the agreement this summer on an unprecedented \u20ac750 billion ($879 billion) recovery fund and renewal package has given the European Union a new sense of strength.   But now is not the time for complacency. While Europe can take pride in leading the world toward carbon neutrality and a \u201c green recovery ,\u201d COVID-19 cases on the continent are spiking again, and the region remains at serious risk of falling behind in the global technology race.   In terms of the broader economy, there is now talk of a \u201cK-shaped\u201d recovery in which some sectors decline sharply while others boom, often by seizing on opportunities created by the crisis itself. The EU has every reason to worry that its economy comprises more sectors in the first category than in the second, which invariably centers on information and communication technology (ICT).   The pandemic has accelerated the digital transition. China, for its part, has stepped up its efforts to achieve technological dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) and other key sectors of the future. And companies like Zoom have gone from being non-entities to household names in the space of just months. ExxonMobil, once the most valuable company in the United States, now doesn\u2019t even make it into the top 30, having been surpassed by companies like Netflix . Despite a recent correction, US tech giants\u2019 combined market capitalization now exceeds that of all companies listed in Europe.   But even though hundreds of millions of people\u2019s daily lives during the pandemic have been mediated by US tech companies\u2019 products and services, the US cannot afford complacency, either. Chinese giants like Huawei and TikTok are enlarging their global market share by the day. According to Eric Schmidt , a former executive chairman of Google and Alphabet and chair of the US Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Innovation Advisory Board, \u201cChina is on its way to surpass us in many, many ways ... we need to take them seriously.\u201d Otherwise, he warns , China will \u201cend up with a bigger economy, more R&amp;D investments, better quality research, wider applications of technology, and a stronger computing infrastructure.\u201d   There was a time when Europe could proudly claim to have helped launch the era of mobile communications. But now that the world is on the verge of upgrading from 4G to 5G, Europe\u2019s technological contributions are notably absent. A new report from the European Round Table for Industry finds that the EU trails the US by three years, and China by nearly as much, just when it comes to implementing 4G , which is already yesterday\u2019s technology. Needless to say, it is lagging even further behind in its rollout of 5G base stations, even though it is home to major ICT companies like Ericsson and Nokia.    Europe\u2019s slow adoption of 5G will have far-reaching implications for its future competitiveness. Many of the industries that 5G could revolutionize are those in which Europe has traditionally demonstrated strength: manufacturing, design, and health care. Now, there is a high risk that China, through digitalization, will achieve dominance in these industries.   And 5G is just one technology. Even more important is AI, where the situation for Europe is particularly grim. According to a 2019 study by the Center for Data Innovation, the US leads the global AI race \u201cin four of the six categories of metrics\u201d examined (talent, research, development, and hardware), and China comes out on top in the remaining two (adoption and data). The EU commands primacy in none, though it is close behind the US in terms of talent.   This last observation is crucial. Europe\u2019s problem is not a scarcity of talent but rather a lack of appropriate institutional arrangements and leadership in this critical domain. Fractured, old-fashioned governance frameworks are hampering the rollout of 5G infrastructure. Insufficient funding for basic research is hampering innovation. And the absence of deep capital markets is making it difficult for start-ups to get the financing they need to grow and scale up, leaving them to be snatched up by deep-pocketed US companies.   The results of these failures are clear to see in the rankings of the world\u2019s unicorns (start-ups valued at $1 billion or more). According to one recent index, six of the ten largest are from the US, three are from China, and one is from Singapore. Other indices give China the biggest share of major unicorns; but none show European start-ups anywhere near the top.   Though many start-ups eventually will fail, at least some of today\u2019s highly valued companies will go on to become the giants of tomorrow\u2019s digital economy, dominating our lives as much as today\u2019s Big Tech firms do. It\u2019s no use complaining about Chinese state support or less-regulated US markets. The companies that succeed will be built on innovative business models that deliver what customers want.   Late last year, to lend new momentum to the transition to a carbon-neutral economy, the European Parliament declared a \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d That is a perfectly understandable objective to prioritize. But Europe also needs to declare a domestic \u201cdigital emergency,\u201d lest it continue falling behind in the industries that will be necessary for achieving all other development goals \u2013 including a green economy.

I'm Bret Baier.</p><p> President Trump is leaving the door open for a pardon for his former  campaign chairman.  The President has openly decried the treatment of some  witnesses by the special counsel, and most pointedly perhaps about the Paul  Manafort case.</p><p> It did not take long after the President's pardon possibility comments were  published for alarm bells to sound on Capitol Hill and for the pushback to  begin.</p><p> Let's get the latest tonight from chief intelligence correspondent  Catherine Herridge.  Hi -- Catherine.</p><p> CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, thank  you -- Bret.</p><p> Tonight new reaction to a possible pardon from a senior Democrat on the  Senate Intelligence Committee.  Mark Warner tweeting, quote, \"This would be  a blatant and unacceptable abuse of power\" after the President lashed out  at the special counsel over its tactics and targets.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERRIDGE:  During an Oval Office interview, President Trump told the \"New  York Post\" he has not ruled out a pardon for former campaign chairman Paul  Manafort.  Quote, \"It was never discussed but I wouldn't take it off the  table.  Why would I take it off the table?\"  The President said.</p><p> Mr. Trump also alleged that Manafort, one-time political adviser Roger  Stone, and his associate Jerome Corsi were pressured to lie.  Quote, \"You  know, this flipping stuff is terrible.  You flip and you lie and you get --  the prosecutors will tell you, 99 percent of the time they can get people  to flip.  It's rare that they can't.\"</p><p> On the Senate floor, a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller's  investigation was blocked after Democrats and one Republican made their  case.  </p><p> SENATOR JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  We have already seen the forced  resignation of the Attorney General a day after the election.  It is clear,  therefore that something has to be done to protect Mr. Mueller's  investigation.  </p><p> SENATOR CORY BOOKER (D), NEW JERSEY:  This is about the legislative branch  ensuring a common sense check and balance on presidential overreach.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  The Senate floor action seemed symbolic after the majority  leader made his objections known Tuesday.  </p><p> SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  This is a solution  in search of a problem.  The President is not going to fire Robert Mueller.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  New records obtained by Fox News showed Mueller's investigations  focused on the hacked Clinton campaign e-mails released in 2016 by  WikiLeaks, its founder Julian Assange, and any connection to the Trump  campaign.  The draft plea agreement offered to Corsi earlier this month  accuses him of lying to federal investigators, a charge he denied to Fox.  </p><p> JEROME CORSI, ROGER STONE ASSOCIATE:  No, I have never met Julian Assange.   I've never spoken with him.  I have never e-mailed him.  I've had no  contact with Julian Assange whatsoever.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  The special counsel documents cite an August 2016 Corsi e-mail  referring to Assange and predicting a time table for the release of e-mails  from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.

But certainly what the  new documents tell us is that the more investigation has been firmly  focused on the Trump Tower meeting, as well as any potential contact with  WikiLeaks and the release of the Clinton e-mails.  </p><p> BAIER:  All right.

Good evening -- Trey.</p><p> TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.</p><p> Speaking today at an investment forum, Russian President Vladimir Putin  blamed the firefight over the weekend off the coast of Crimea on Ukrainian  President Petro Poroshenko, saying that the clash had political  motivations.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> YINGST:  \"And now a minor incident in the Black Sea and they impose martial  law in the country,\" Putin said.  \"It is clearly done because of the  upcoming election.\"</p><p> Putin's comments came just hours after the Russian military announced it  would deploy a new S-400 surface-to-air missile system in Crimea next  month.  The system, capable of tracking and shooting down targets 250 miles  away, could be moved into place as the war drums continue to sound in  eastern Europe following the capture of 24 Ukrainian sailors by Russian  forces on Sunday.</p><p> In the past 48 hours, all 24 Ukrainian sailors have been ordered by Russian  courts to jail for the next two months pending trial.</p><p> In Ukraine, President Petro Poroshenko wearing combat fatigues visited  troops Wednesday who are training for future ground operations should they  be needed in the country's eastern parts.  </p><p> \"We have to improve our skills.

Good evening -- Rich.  </p><p> RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.   A strong defense of the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia and backing of the  Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense  Secretary James Mattis briefed senators this morning as Democrats and  Republicans say they want punishment for Saudi Arabia for the death of  Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do believe I have read every piece  of intelligence that has come in in the last few hours.  I think I have  read it all.  There is no direct reporting connecting the Crown Prince to  the order to murder Jamal Khashoggi.  That is all I can say in a non- classified setting.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EDSON:  Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker says it's  apparent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for Khashoggi's  death.  Other senators questioned why CIA director Gina Haspel failed to  attend.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  It was inadequate because the  CIA was not there.  So the question for me is whether or not the CIA  supports the conclusion with a high degree of confidence that the Crown  Prince was complicit in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EDSON:  The CIA says Haspel already briefed the Senate Intelligence  Committee and that she was never told to avoid this morning's session.   Ahead of that briefing, Secretary Pompeo wrote in the Wall Street Journal  quote, \"Is it any coincidence that the people using the Khashoggi murder as  a cudgel against President Trump's Saudi Arabia policy are the same people  who supported Barack Obama's rapprochement with Iran, a regime that has  killed thousands worldwide including hundreds of Americans, and brutalizes  its own people.\"</p><p> After the briefing, the Senate voted to advance the measure to end the U.S.  support of the Saudi-coalition fighting the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.   Secretary Mattis says, quote, \"Pulling back our limited U.S. military  support, our weapons sales to our partners and our protection of the Saudi  and Emirati populations would be misguided on the eve of the promising  initial negotiations.\"</p><p> Negotiators are trying to schedule a meeting with a war infraction  scheduled for next month in Sweden -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  More with the panel.

Governor Andrew Cuomo  needs President Trump's support for a critical rebuilding project.</p><p> Correspondent Kristin Fisher takes a look tonight from the White House.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo  calls it the most critical infrastructure issue in the entire northeast --  replacing the century-old rail tunnels beneath the Hudson River. </p><p> GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK STATE:  If you lose service of one of these  tunnels for one, two, or three days, you are talking about a devastating  impact on transportation in the whole northeast corridor.  </p><p> FISHER:  The existing tunnel was already showing its age but then super  storm sandy hit, flooding it with salt water and that salt is still sitting  on the cement, decomposing one of the most critical arteries into the  nation's largest city, and President Trump's hometown.  </p><p> CUOMO:  We want to make sure that the President understands the severity of  the damage.  </p><p> FISHER:  But this year, the Trump administration denied funding for its  replacement, the proposed gateway tunnel.  So today, New York governor came  to Washington to try to convince President Trump in person to help build it  before it's too late.  </p><p> CUOMO:  I think it is fair to say that the President was receptive to what  we were talking about.  </p><p> FISHER:  If they strike a deal, it would be a rare display of  bipartisanship between two brash native New Yorkers who have traded barbs  repeatedly over the last two years.  It would also give real credence to  the hope that infrastructure may be one issue where Republicans and  Democrats might actually be able to work together when the new Congress  comes in.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It really could be a  beautiful bipartisan type of situation.  Maybe we will make a deal, maybe  we won't.  That's possible.  But we have a lot of things in common on  infrastructure.  </p><p> SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  We Democrats believe  in a real infrastructure bill with real, direct and robust federal  investments that will rebuild crumbling roads and bridges.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> FISHER:  And when it comes to building these new tunnels, there's been a  lot of talk that perhaps funding for them would be tied to the President's  border wall.  But tonight, Governor Cuomo told Democrats on Capitol Hill,  don't do it, it's a bad deal.  He said quote, \"I would not trade anything  for a wall\" -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Kristin Fisher, live on the north lawn.  Kristin -- thanks.</p><p> House Democrats have formally nominated Nancy Pelosi to be speaker next  year.  238 members voted today -- 203 voted yes for Nancy Pelosi, 32 voted  no against Nancy Pelosi.  There were three blanks.  Pelosi needs to whittle  down those 35 dissenters by about half in order to hit the magic number of  218 in January.  Maryland's Steny Hoyer was elected today to be House  Majority Leader again.</p><p> The final days of the current congress could get a lot messier.  There is  increasing concern tonight about the possibility of a partial government  shutdown next week.</p><p> Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel tells us where things stand  right now.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  As the human  drama plays out at the southern border, President Trump has signaled he is  willing to shut down part of the government one week from Friday demanding  more money for his border wall.  Retiring Speaker Paul Ryan says the House  has delivered $5 billion.  </p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Our bill contains the  President's full request for the border but ultimately, the President and  the Senate Democrats are going to have to come to agreement, as well.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Senate Democrats like Connecticut's Richard Blumenthal are  pushing back.</p><p> SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), CONNECTICUT:  The demand for $5 billion is  based on delusion, not reality.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  President Trump told \"Politico\" late yesterday, he doesn't do  anything just for political gain.  Still, this is a winner for him.  Quote,  \"People look at the border, they look at the rush to the police, they look  at the rock-throwers and really hurting three people.  Three very brave  border patrol folks.  I think that it is a tremendous issue, but much more  importantly, is really needed.  So we have to have border security.\"</p><p> Plus, the President is well aware he is about to be dealing with a  Democrat-led House in the new year.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer  is trying to hold his ground.  </p><p> SCHUMER:  The $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and  Republicans is our position.  We believe that is the right way to go.  If  there is any shutdown, it is on President Trump's back.  </p><p> EMANUEL: With time winding down, the majority leader is trying to deliver.  </p><p> MCCONNELL:  We are trying to get the President the money he would like for  the wall.  That is part of the year-end funding discussion which is  ongoing.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> EMANUEL:  At this point, all the sources I have spoken with are not pushing  the panic button.  Their feeling is there is still time to cut a deal but  it's not entirely clear what it might be -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  We'll track it.  Mike Emanuel, live on the Hill.  Mike -- thanks.</p><p> The outlook is a bit cloudy tonight for Google.  It is facing huge fines  over accusations of illegally tracking millions of people around the world.   Many lawmakers here and overseas are losing patience.</p><p> Correspondent Gillian Turner is here to tell us what is happening.  Good  evening -- Gillian.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.</p><p>Google's privacy practices once again under fire.  Since yesterday seven  European countries have filed complaints under a new E.U. data protection  law.  They alleged Google uses manipulative tactics to trick users into  allowing the platform to track them.</p><p> One consumer group filing complaints on behalf of the E.U. says, \"The  places we go to reveal a lot about ourselves and our private life.   Smartphones are being used for spying on our every move.\"  Google faces a  fine now of up to 4 percent of its annual global revenue, or about $4  billion under the new law.</p><p> But Google tells Fox News, its location history function has to be turned  on by users in order to take effect.  And they add, \"Location history is  turned off by default, and you can edit, delete, or pause it at any time.   If you pause it, we make clear that depending on your individual phone and  app settings, we might still collect and use location data to improve your  Google experience.\"</p><p> But even congressional regulators say the tracking function is not user- friendly.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SENATOR JON TESTER (D), MONTANA:  You are going to have to teach me how I  can say no information is transferred for me because I have never seen  that.  And if it has, it has been imprinted in so damn fine of print that I  don't even have time to read it all.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TURNER:  U.S. Lawmakers are hot on Google's trail, though they have yet to  pass any federal legislation, as their European counterparts did in May.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SENATOR JERRY MORAN (R), KANSAS:  It has become clear that the U.S. needs a  consumer federal data privacy law. </p><p> BLUMENTHAL:  Congress is fed up.  It's about big tech no longer being  entitled to say to America, trust us.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TURNER:  Capitol Hill leaders will have the chance to grill Google  executives in person on this matter in just a few days.  The CEO of Google  Sundar Pichai testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on December  5th -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  We'll continue to follow that.  Gillian -- thank you.</p><p> Up next, you might be surprised at the number of immigrants living in this  country illegally.  That's coming up.</p><p> First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are  covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 45 in Baltimore as the city files a federal lawsuit against the Trump  administration alleging unlawful efforts to deter immigrants from getting  public assistance.  The city asserts that African immigrants' participation  in the federal Head Start Program has virtually ceased in Baltimore schools  due to policy change.</p><p>Fox 11 in Los Angeles with a preview of the L.A. Auto Show.  The event  comes just days after General Motors announced layoffs and plant closures  around the U.S. and in Canada.  The show will feature more than 60-vehicle  debuts and underscores the public's demand for SUVs and crossovers, as well  as electric vehicles.</p><p> And this is a live look at Honolulu from our affiliate there Fox 2.  One of  the big stories there tonight, a man who suffered a heart attack shortly  after Hawaii mistakenly issued an alert about a ballistic missile is suing  the state.  The lawsuit says the sending of the false missile alert and  failing to cancel it in a timely manner was a substantial factor in causing  the James Shawn Shields' heart attack on January 13th.  No comment from the  state yet.</p><p> That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.  We  will be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  The FBI says a man sitting in a Texas jail may be one of the most  prolific serial killers in American history.  Texas Rangers say 78-year-old  Samuel Little has confessed to 90 murders so far.  The FBI and the Rangers  are trying to match Little's confessions with unsolved killings around the  country.  They have confirmed 34 so far.  Little is said to be in poor  health and is expected to remain in that Texas jail until his death.</p><p> We have new information tonight about what is one of the most controversial  issues here in Washington and maybe where you live -- illegal immigration.   It turns out, there is less of it right now, and those who try it are not  necessarily who you think they are.</p><p> National correspondent William La Jeunesse looks at the numbers and  explains this evening.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TRUMP:  We are not letting people into our country unless they come in  legally.  </p><p> WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Unrealistic maybe,  but not unworthy of pursuit.  According to a new study, the number of  illegal immigrants living in the U.S. fell to its lowest level in a decade.  </p><p> THERESA CARDINAL BROWN, BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER:  We have for the first  time a majority of those coming to the U.S.-Mexico border, are not Mexican,  they are not single men, they are not just looking for work.  </p><p> LA JEUNESSE:  The Pew Research study found Mexicans today make up about  half the illegal population, down considerably.  Two-thirds of migrants in  the U.S. have been here ten years or more and 43 percent have U.S.-born  children.  Half those cross the border illegally, the rest overstay their  visa.</p><p> Pew's findings differ from a recent Yale study that suggests up to 22  million illegal immigrants live in the U.S., not 11 million.  The Pew study  is also based on the 2016 census, two-year-old data that does not fully  account for the recent surge from Central America.  </p><p> BROWN:  What happened as a drip, a drab has now become a very large group.  </p><p> LA JEUNESSE:  Deterring them will require Mexico's help.</p><p> DUNCAN WOOD, WOODROW WILSON CENTER:  Mexico will continue to play a large  role in stemming the flow but they're not going to be able to stop it.  </p><p> LA JEUNESSE:  That flow from Latin America is also driving legal  immigration.  For the first time in a decade, Hispanics outnumber Asians  arriving to the U.S.  The U.S. immigrant population, legal and illegal,  numbers more than 44 million, a roughly 14 percent of the nation.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LA JEUNESSE:  The President hopes to reshape immigration policy by  replacing family reunification with a merit the system.  But any study is a  snapshot in time.  As the exodus from Central America illustrates,  immigration is fluid -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  William La Jeunesse in L.A..  William -- thanks.</p><p> Up next, a sanctuary city idea some conservatives just might like.</p><p> First, beyond our borders tonight.</p><p> The Pentagon has identified two soldiers and an airman killed in a roadside  bomb attack yesterday in Afghanistan.  They are Army Captain Andrew Patrick  Ross of Lexington, Virginia; Army Sergeant First Class, Eric Michael Emond  (ph) of Brush Prairie, Washington; and Air Force Staff Sergeant Dylan  Elchin of Hookstown, Pennsylvania.</p><p> At least 30 civilians were killed along with 16 Taliban fighters as Afghan  government forces battled insurgents in the southern Helmand Province  overnight.  Taliban terrorists staged a coordinated attack against security  forces in Afghanistan.  And a U.S. military spokesman says an air strike  that killed many of the civilians was conducted by American aircraft.</p><p> A Chinese researcher who claims to have helped make the world's first  genetically-edited babies says a second pregnancy may be underway.   Mainstream scientists have condemned that experiment, and universities and  government groups are now investigating.</p><p> Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.</p><p> We will be right back.   </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  New tonight, a sanctuary city proposal that Republicans and  conservatives might get behind.  It does not have to do with immigration.   It's all about guns.  Correspondent Dan Springer tells us what one small  Washington state town is doing about a gun law most residents there have no  intention of obeying.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good man.  I appreciate what you are doing.  </p><p> DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  In tiny Republic, Washington, Police  Chief Loren Culp was a local celebrity after saying he would not enforce  the law, or one state law, initiative 1639, a sweeping gun control measure.  </p><p> LOREN CULP, REPUBLIC, WASHINGTON, POLICE CHIEF:  I felt that it was such a  blatant disregard for Constitutional rights that I felt like I had no  choice but to stand up for the people that I serve.  </p><p> SPRINGER:  The new gun law bars 18 to 20-year-olds from buying  semiautomatic rifles and makes it a potential felony if your gun ends up in  the wrong hands.  It also creates enhanced background checks and mandatory  firearms training.  Voters across Washington state passed the measure 59 to  41 percent, but in Ferry County, nearly three out of four voters opposed  it.  Mayor Elbert Koontz is considering an ordinance proposed by Chief Culp  to make Republic a sanctuary city for gun rights.  </p><p> JERRY MORAN, (R) SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Everybody in Republic has a  gun.  We don't have a giant crime rate because nobody in their right mind  is going to come to a house where people have guns that know how to use  them.  </p><p> SPRINGER:  When Chief Culp announced his sanctuary city proposal, he got a  standing ovation.  In Seattle, the reaction is very different.  </p><p> RENEE HOPKINS, ALLIANCE FOR GUN RESPONSIBILITY:  Their job is to enforce  the laws that are passed, not necessarily just the ones they approve of  personally.  </p><p> SPRINGER:  The Second Amendment Foundation along with the NRA sued to  strike down the new state law.  Its leaders see poetic justice in gun  rights advocates getting into the sanctuary business, up until now reserved  for illegal immigrants.  </p><p> ALAN GOTTLIEB, SECOND AMENDMENT FOUNDATION:  In politics, there is always a  pushback.  When you try to take people's rights away from them, they stand  up and they rebel, and that's what you're seeing in Republic, Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SPRINGER:  The city council will discuss the gun rights sanctuary city  ordinance at its next meeting on Monday and could vote on it before the  state law takes effect in January.  The state's attorney general, a  Democrat who supports gun control, says he'll review the ordinance if it  passes.  Bret?  </p><p> BAIER:  Dan Springer in Washington state.  Dan, thanks.  </p><p>Mississippi Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith gets to keep her job.  The Republican  incumbent defeated Democrat Mike Espy in yesterday's runoff by a 54 to 46  percent margin.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CINDY HYDE-SMITH, (R) MISSISSIPPI:  The reason we won is because  Mississippians know me and they know my heart, and thank you for standing  up.  </p><p> MIKE ESPY, (D) MISSISSIPPI SENATE CANDIDATE:  This movement is not going to  end for a new Mississippi, a more united Mississippi, a Mississippi where  everyone, regardless of race or party, or religion, feels their worth.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Hyde-Smith was appointed to the job last spring after the  retirement of Thad Cochran.  She becomes the first woman elected to  Congress from Mississippi.  And in the new Senate in January, Republicans  will now hold a 53 to 47 majority, a net gain of two seats from the current  Senate.  </p><p> Former President Obama did not campaign in person for Espy.  He did cut a  robo-call Monday.  Mr. Obama has been pretty visible lately during the lead  up to the midterms and afterwards, and he wants to make sure you don't  forget about him or the things he considers his achievements.  That's the  story tonight from correspondent Doug McKelway.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  The truth was, I was also intent on  following a wise American tradition of ex-presidents gracefully exiting the  political stage.  </p><p> DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Former President Obama may have  found the political stage harder to leave then he thought.  Since those  remarks in September, against tradition, he campaigned vigorously in the  midterms, with mixed results.  His favorite candidates lost close races in  Florida, Georgia, Indiana, and Ohio, but won in Virginia and Illinois where  they were favored.  Wedged between his party's elders and its young farm  team, he remains the Democratic Party's de facto leader.  </p><p> DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN POLICY ADVISER:  They need someone to  act as a spokesman.  He is the natural person to do it.  </p><p> MCKELWAY:  He is also determined to preserve his legacy under constant  assault from the present administration.  </p><p> OBAMA:  Nobody in my administration got indicted.  </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> MCKELWAY:  He is right about that, although there were many scandals from  Benghazi to Fast and Furious, the IRS targeting of conservative groups, and  the botched startup of Obamacare.  Critics scoff at what they say is his  embellishment of other legacies like the growth of the economy and of oil  and gas exploration.  </p><p> OBAMA:  You wouldn't always know it, but it went up every year I was  president.  </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> OBAMA:  And that whole, suddenly Americans are the biggest oil producer and  the biggest gas -- that was me, people.  </p><p> MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  The only thing Obama did is  stand in the way in every conceivable way with both a pen and a phone to  prevent these entrepreneurs from being able to exploit these resources to  the max.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCKELWAY:  There is one Obama legacy that's indisputable -- Organizing for  Action, which evolved from the Obama campaign's Organizing for America, has  helped build the Democrats' effective ground game, contributing to the  party's retaking of the House, where numerous investigations of the Trump  administration await come January.  Bret?</p><p> BAIER:  Dough, thank you.  </p><p> So is President Trump considering a pardon for his former campaign  chairman?  And where is this investigation going?  We will talk about it  all with the panel after the break.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. JEFF FLAKE, (R) ARIZONA:  We have already seen the forced resignation  of the attorney general a day after the election.  It is clear, therefore,  that something has to be done to protect Mr. Mueller's investigation.  </p><p> SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D) NEW JERSEY:  This is about the legislative branch  asserting a commonsense check and balance on presidential overreach.  </p><p> MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  This is a solution in search  of a problem.  The president is not going to fire Robert Mueller.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Three Senate Judiciary Committee members today taking to the floor  to try to force a vote on the bill to protect Special Counsel Robert  Mueller.  This happened before news broke of a \"New York Post\" article,  piece in which the president is quoted, asked about pardoning Paul  Manafort, his former campaign chairman.  It, pardoning Manafort, \"was never  discussed, but I wouldn't take it off the table.  Why would I take it off  the table?\" That prompted a lot of response on Capitol Hill.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. JEFF FLAKE, (R) ARIZONA:  That is par for the course, I guess, to hold  that and dangle it out there.  </p><p> SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, (D) SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  The real danger  there is a pardon, which is in Trump and Manafort's interest, but it would  be solid evidence of obstruction of justice.  </p><p> SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I am not aware of any  conversations for anyone's pardon involving this process at all.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  So it is like a four-alarm fire up on Capitol Hill over this today.   Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington  Times,\" Amy Walter, national editor for the \"Cook Political Report,\" and  Hugo Gurdon, editorial director for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Amy,  thoughts?  </p><p> AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\":  That is not the only  four alarm fire that's going on.</p><p> BAIER:  There's a lot of them.</p><p> WALTER:  There's the Saudi Arabia question, what we are going to do there  in the war on Yemen, and should we continue to give support to Saudi  Arabia.  And then of course you have Mueller, and then you have judges.   All of those trying to get squeezed into the next week, week and a half,  these guys would like to get on.  Oh, and we also have a lame duck session  where we need to pass the numbers of very important bills.  So this seems  to be one of the many things that Congress is juggling.  </p><p> I don't know that there is going to be an answer to whether or not we're  going to get a Mueller vote right now.  It seems like Flake is out there a  little bit on his own in terms of being the one Republican that could make  this happen.  To me, the question is whether or not -- </p><p> BAIER:  I guess Corker is there.  </p><p> WALTER:  Right, that is true, but Flake is saying I'm not going to support  any judicial nominees that come through unless I get this vote, and whether  or not that has enough leverage to get that vote to the floor, on top of  the other votes rebuking the president, one of which happened today on  Saudi Arabia.  How many of those can McConnell really continue to hold up?  </p><p> BAIER:  Hugo?  </p><p> HUGO GURDON, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  The president does have a way, as Jeff  Flake was saying, of dangling things, or another way of looking at it is  expressing things in a way which poke the hornets' nest.  By just  suggesting he is not going to take it off the table, it suggests to the  Democrats who have been saying he wants to pardon Manafort that that is  what he is going to do.  </p><p> But it works in the Democrats' favor to try and pass this resolution to  protect Mueller, because even if the president has no intention of doing  this, and as the majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is saying  this is a solution in search of a problem, it allows them to keep stoking  the idea that the president is going to try and do this.  I think they  would have a tough time proving obstruction of justice if the president  exercises his constitutional powers and actually does the pardon.  </p><p> BAIER:  There are people up there today saying just by saying what he said,  it's already obstruction of justice.  The snowball just goes down the hill  very quickly here, Charlie.  </p><p> CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\":  Welcome to the next two  years of Washington, and in particular in Congress.  The good news for the  president, though, is that because of the elections, the GOP, the  Republican caucus is going to be a little bit more Trumpier.  People like  Bob Corker and Jeff Flake won't be there sniping from the Republican side.   It will mostly be Democrats that are playing these games.  </p><p> But in terms of the issue of pardoning, once again, it's a situation where  you have Trump saying something -- it's that he dangles something.  It's  that he actually enunciates it.  Everybody knows that this is the sort of  thing that pardons have been used for forever, and we can say whatever we  want to about Paul Manafort, and it's great that he has been found guilty  of crimes that he committed, but of course he committed them a long time  ago.  And the only difference between why federal prosecutors didn't go  after it back then, that remains to be answered.  But the only difference  between that and what ended up happening is the fact that he got involved  in politics and specifically -- and that by definition is a political  prosecution.  </p><p> BAIER:  It's important to note that we don't know what we don't know.  I  say that all the time about the Mueller investigation.  </p><p> HURT:  Yes, absolutely.  </p><p> BAIER:  We do know that there have been some stories that have just really  fallen apart that got a lot of traction.  Yesterday there was a \"Guardian\"  report that said that Paul Manafort met with Assange in London and talked  about the WikiLeaks emails.  This is the \"Washington Times.\"  Paul  Manafort's passports don't show that he entered London in all the years  claimed by the Guardian newspaper when it said he met secretly with  WikiLeaks Julian Assange.  \"The Guardian\" said he met with Assange in  London in 2013, 2015, 2016.  A review of Manafort's two passports show he  entered Heathrow airport since 2008 on two occasions, 2012 and on another  time where the customs stamp years was blurred.  It appears to say 2010 or  2016.\"  The point is, that is in court records from his trials, and it kind  of falls apart.  And it took up a lot of airwaves yesterday.  </p><p> WALTER:  Yes, though it was notable that no other news organization was  able -- they said we can't confirm this.  </p><p> BAIER:  We can't confirm this, but here's --  </p><p> HURT:  And they walked it back.  </p><p> GURDON:  And \"The Guardian\" intro said, \"The Guardian has been told.\" They  were not even standing by their own story.  They said, we have been told  this, but --  </p><p> BAIER:  My point is, in the vacuum of information -- </p><p> WALTER:  Of course, that takes up a lot of -- absolutely.  But here's the  thing, why would -- to your point about the prosecution is all political --  why would Mueller be cutting a deal with Paul Manafort if he didn't have  anything to give him?  He would have just prosecuted, this would be over.   So there is clearly more that they wanted to get from him that --it's not  over.  </p><p> BAIER:  It's not over.  They've got something.  </p><p> WALTER:  So they've got something.  So the idea that they could just  prosecute him and let it be done -- </p><p> BAIER:  Or they think they have something.  We just played Jerome Corsi,  who is also facing a charge of lying.  He was on our channel last night.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JEROME CORSI:  I never met Julian Assange, I have never spoken with him.  I  never emailed him.  I've had no contact with Julian Assange whatsoever.  I  have been a loyal American.  I have no contacts with Russian intelligence.   I have no business interest in Russia.  I have nothing to do with Russia.   I have never been to Russia.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Hugo, these denials are pretty straight.  Who is telling the truth,  who is not?  We don't know what Mueller has.  He obviously has a lot of  investigative months behind him, but it seems to be coming to a head here.  </p><p> GURDON:  It certainly does.  These are as categorical denials as one could  possibly get.  The falling to pieces of the deal that Paul Manafort had  with the prosecutor is another sign that this has come to -- I think that  Manafort does look like he is looking for a pardon.  I think it does raise  questions of why the president would want to give him a pardon.  All of  that, the question of a pardon, the question of a prosecutions, it's all  coming to a head, as you say.  </p><p> BAIER:  There is more to talk about on this.  I want to talk about the  Democrats and, as Amy mentioned, Saudi Arabia and foreign policy.  There's  just a lot going on.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE:  There is no direct reporting connecting  the crown prince to the order of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p> JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY:  We have no smoking gun that the crown  prince was involved.  Not the intelligence committee, or anyone else.   There is no smoking gun.  </p><p> SEN. BOB CORKER, (R) SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We also  have a crown prince that is out of control.  The killing of a journalist.   And whether there is a smoking gun -- I don't think there is anybody in the  room that doesn't believe he is responsible for it.  </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN, (D-IL) SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  There are many who believe  this execution of Khashoggi in Istanbul could never have taken place  without the knowledge and direction of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  A lot of focus on Capitol Hill today.  Defense Secretary Mattis,  Secretary of State Pompeo up there briefing senators.  Who was not there,  the CIA director.  A lot of talk about that.  The CIA put out a statement  saying the notion that anyone told Director Haspel not to attend today's  briefing is false, going on to say they have been briefed the  communications and they provided all the intelligence that they have.  </p><p> We are back with the panel.  Charlie, it doesn't seem like anything is  going to stop the administration's policy decision of backing Saudi Arabia,  but the Senate voted, 61 votes, to stop the support for the Yemen war.  </p><p> HURT:  This is one of the situations where, and we see in no matter who is  in the White House, no matter who controls Congress.  It is not really a  partisan issue.  It's a matter of being in the White House versus being in  congress.  It's so easy to be in Congress and to take totally legitimate  potshots at some really terrible people, including the crown prince and  others around the world who do egregious, nasty things that run counter to  everything that we believe in in America.  </p><p> Of course, the problem is on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, you  have the White House desperately trying to not let it get out of control  because of the real world interests at play here.  And you go back to the  previous administration, Vladimir Putin has done horrible, disgusting,  murderous things to his own people and to ex-pats living in his country,  political enemies.  And we don't go to war over it.  And that's probably a  good thing.  I don't want to go to war over that sort of thing.  </p><p> BAIER:  Amy?  </p><p> WALTER:  It seems to me that many senators, including Senator Lindsey  Graham, are not going to be happy unless Gina Haspel comes up to Capitol  Hill.</p><p> BAIER:  And he said as much today.</p><p> WALTER:  And basically was we have to hear from her or else nothing is  moving.  And to me, that could take all this debate over whether this issue  of Yemen actually makes it to a bill, which makes it to the president's  desk, I think a lot of that could be diffused by having Gina Haspel come up  to the Hill.  </p><p> BAIER:  Here is what Secretary Mattis said about the Saudi-Yemen situation.   \"Pulling back our limited U.S. military support, our weapons sales to our  partners, and our protection of the Saudi and Emirati populations would be  misguided on the eve of the promising initial negotiations.  It took us too  long to get here.\"  Talking about negotiations to end the civil war in  Yemen.  </p><p> GURDON:  Mattis is absolutely right.  The extraordinary thing about this is  that people talking on the opposite sides of this are nevertheless all  correct.  There may well be, there presumably is no absolute smoking gun,  but at the same time I don't think anyone has any doubt that the crown  prince is responsible.  </p><p> I think the White House has played this very badly, and President Trump has  played this badly because it is quite possible to say we are not going to  overthrow our entire Mideast strategy, which is about isolating Iran,  ending the war in Yemen, and also to some extent, although sotto voce,  helping Israel and having Saudi Arabia on your side doing that.  You can  still say we are going to impose sanctions, we are going to make sure that  Saudi Arabia recognizes the United States doesn't stand up for this.  </p><p> I think Saudi Arabia miscalculated.  They thought they could literally get  away with murder because of the alliance with the United States.  The  United States has to make it perfectly plain that they cannot do that.  </p><p> BAIER:  We will see where it goes.  I have got to run because the traffic  here in D.C. is unbelievable.  Do you know why?  There is a tree lighting.   'Tis the season.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  Moments ago, President Trump and the first lady just did the annual  flick of the holiday switch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:   Four.  Three.  Two.  One.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  The president speaking at the National Christmas Tree lighting in  which he thanked first responders and military families around the country.   You have to see this if you're in town.  Thanks for watching SPECIAL  REPORT.  Fair, balanced and unafraid.  \"THE STORY\" hosted by Harris  Faulkner tonight starts now.

Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of \"THE FIVE\".</p><p>SPECIAL REPORT up next with our very own hottie -- Bret Baier.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX ANCHOR: Thanks -- Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We love you.</p><p>BAIER: Animals are great.</p><p>This is a Fox News alert.</p><p>Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.</p><p>President Trump is leaving the door open for a pardon for his former campaign chairman. The President has openly decried the treatment of some witnesses by the special counsel, and most pointedly perhaps about the Paul Manafort case.</p><p>It did not take long after the President's pardon possibility comments were published for alarm bells to sound on Capitol Hill and for the pushback to begin.</p><p>Let's get the latest tonight from chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge. Hi -- Catherine.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well, thank you -- Bret.</p><p>Tonight new reaction to a possible pardon from a senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Mark Warner tweeting, quote, \"This would be a blatant and unacceptable abuse of power\" after the President lashed out at the special counsel over its tactics and targets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE: During an Oval Office interview, President Trump told the \"New York Post\" he has not ruled out a pardon for former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Quote, \"It was never discussed but I wouldn't take it off the table. Why would I take it off the table?\" The President said.</p><p>Mr. Trump also alleged that Manafort, one-time political adviser Roger Stone, and his associate Jerome Corsi were pressured to lie. Quote, \"You know, this flipping stuff is terrible. You flip and you lie and you get -- the prosecutors will tell you, 99 percent of the time they can get people to flip. It's rare that they can't.\"</p><p>On the Senate floor, a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation was blocked after Democrats and one Republican made their case.</p><p>SENATOR JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA: We have already seen the forced resignation of the Attorney General a day after the election. It is clear, therefore that something has to be done to protect Mr. Mueller's investigation.</p><p>SENATOR CORY BOOKER (D), NEW JERSEY: This is about the legislative branch ensuring a common sense check and balance on presidential overreach.</p><p>HERRIDGE: The Senate floor action seemed symbolic after the majority leader made his objections known Tuesday.</p><p>SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: This is a solution in search of a problem. The President is not going to fire Robert Mueller.</p><p>HERRIDGE: New records obtained by Fox News showed Mueller's investigations focused on the hacked Clinton campaign e-mails released in 2016 by WikiLeaks, its founder Julian Assange, and any connection to the Trump campaign. The draft plea agreement offered to Corsi earlier this month accuses him of lying to federal investigators, a charge he denied to Fox.</p><p>JEROME CORSI, ROGER STONE ASSOCIATE: No, I have never met Julian Assange. I've never spoken with him. I have never e-mailed him. I've had no contact with Julian Assange whatsoever.</p><p>HERRIDGE: The special counsel documents cite an August 2016 Corsi e-mail referring to Assange and predicting a time table for the release of e-mails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Quote, \"Word is friend in embassy plans two more dumps. One shortly after I'm back, 2nd in October. Impact planned to be very damaging.\"</p><p>Corsi said the e-mail that accurately predicted WikiLeaks would publish e- mails in October 2016 was based on his analysis, not insider information.</p><p>CORSI: I figured it out and told Roger Stone and told many people in August. It just happened that I was right.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE: A source with direct knowledge of the investigation tells Fox News the President's written answers to Mueller are consistent with his public statements on the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting which included Manafort. The President tweeted last summer he had no advanced knowledge. A status hearing for the Manafort case is now scheduled for Friday -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: It seems like things are coming to a head but we don't know a timeline.</p><p>HERRIDGE: We don't know a timeline but sort of the conventional wisdom is that after the President submitted written answers that it would probably wrap up fairly quickly, possibly before Christmas. But certainly what the new documents tell us is that the more investigation has been firmly focused on the Trump Tower meeting, as well as any potential contact with WikiLeaks and the release of the Clinton e-mails.</p><p>BAIER: All right. Catherine -- thank you.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>BAIER: Adult film actress Stormy Daniels says that her attorney Michael Avenatti sued President Trump for defamation on her behalf without her permission. Daniels tells the \"Daily Beast\" Avenatti started a fund- raising Web site to raise money for her legal expenses without telling her about it. She says he refuses to this day to tell her how that money is being spent. Daniels says she has not decided whether to keep Avenatti as her lawyer.</p><p>Meantime overseas, the tensions between Russia and Ukraine over the seizure of Russian ships and sailors is threatening to derail a planned meeting between Russian leader Vladimir Putin and President Trump.</p><p>The two leaders are supposed to talk Saturday on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Argentina. But President Trump has hinted the Russian action against Ukraine might lead him to cancel.</p><p>This takes place as the administration launches a new effort to shore up support in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>We have Fox team coverage on two big foreign policy stories tonight. Rich Edson at the State Department with firm backing from the U.S. for the Saudis in their fight against terrorists in Yemen. But first up, correspondent Trey Yingst in our Middle East bureau tonight on Russia and Ukraine. Good evening -- Trey.</p><p>TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening -- Bret.</p><p>Speaking today at an investment forum, Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the firefight over the weekend off the coast of Crimea on Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, saying that the clash had political motivations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YINGST: \"And now a minor incident in the Black Sea and they impose martial law in the country,\" Putin said. \"It is clearly done because of the upcoming election.\"</p><p>Putin's comments came just hours after the Russian military announced it would deploy a new S-400 surface-to-air missile system in Crimea next month. The system, capable of tracking and shooting down targets 250 miles away, could be moved into place as the war drums continue to sound in eastern Europe following the capture of 24 Ukrainian sailors by Russian forces on Sunday.</p><p>In the past 48 hours, all 24 Ukrainian sailors have been ordered by Russian courts to jail for the next two months pending trial.</p><p>In Ukraine, President Petro Poroshenko wearing combat fatigues visited troops Wednesday who are training for future ground operations should they be needed in the country's eastern parts.</p><p>\"We have to improve our skills. We have to provide effective training to be ready in case it is needed,\" Poroshenko said, \"and for the enemy to lose and to pay its irresponsible decision to invade Ukraine.\"</p><p>According to Poroshenko, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offered Ukraine military assistance this week in preparation for a larger conflict with Russia. Pompeo joins U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis in placing the blame on Russia for starting the recent provocation.</p><p>JAMES MATTIS, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: When you think that there is a treaty between the two countries that permit exactly what happened, it just shows that Russia cannot be counted on right now to keep its word.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YINGST: Now, the Kremlin does tell Fox News that President Trump and President Putin are still scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the G-20 summit this weekend, despite Trump's threats to cancel as the situation on the ground in Ukraine inches closer to a military confrontation -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Trey Yingst in our Middle East newsroom. Trey -- thanks.</p><p>The murder of a Saudi journalist has Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill questioning U.S. policy toward the kingdom's leadership.</p><p>State Department correspondent Rich Edson is live tonight with the administration's answer to that. Good evening -- Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: Good evening -- Bret. A strong defense of the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia and backing of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary James Mattis briefed senators this morning as Democrats and Republicans say they want punishment for Saudi Arabia for the death of Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I do believe I have read every piece of intelligence that has come in in the last few hours. I think I have read it all. There is no direct reporting connecting the Crown Prince to the order to murder Jamal Khashoggi. That is all I can say in a non- classified setting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker says it's apparent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for Khashoggi's death. Other senators questioned why CIA director Gina Haspel failed to attend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: It was inadequate because the CIA was not there. So the question for me is whether or not the CIA supports the conclusion with a high degree of confidence that the Crown Prince was complicit in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: The CIA says Haspel already briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee and that she was never told to avoid this morning's session. Ahead of that briefing, Secretary Pompeo wrote in the Wall Street Journal quote, \"Is it any coincidence that the people using the Khashoggi murder as a cudgel against President Trump's Saudi Arabia policy are the same people who supported Barack Obama's rapprochement with Iran, a regime that has killed thousands worldwide including hundreds of Americans, and brutalizes its own people.\"</p><p>After the briefing, the Senate voted to advance the measure to end the U.S. support of the Saudi-coalition fighting the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen. Secretary Mattis says, quote, \"Pulling back our limited U.S. military support, our weapons sales to our partners and our protection of the Saudi and Emirati populations would be misguided on the eve of the promising initial negotiations.\"</p><p>Negotiators are trying to schedule a meeting with a war infraction scheduled for next month in Sweden -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: More with the panel. Rich -- thanks.</p><p>The U.S. economy expanded at a solid 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter. The GDP figure keeps the economy on pace for its fastest expansion in 13 years.</p><p>Today, Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell painted a positive picture of the U.S. economy during a major speech. He also appeared to suggest the Fed might consider a pause in its interest rate hikes next year to assess the impact of its credit tightening.</p><p>Well, those comments set off a real surge on Wall Street, pushing markets back into positive territory for the year. The Dow soared to a 618-point gain. The S&amp;P 500 was up 62. The Nasdaq finished ahead 209 today.</p><p>The Democratic governor of New York is asking one of the state's most famous and wealthiest men for some help tonight. Governor Andrew Cuomo needs President Trump's support for a critical rebuilding project.</p><p>Correspondent Kristin Fisher takes a look tonight from the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo calls it the most critical infrastructure issue in the entire northeast -- replacing the century-old rail tunnels beneath the Hudson River.</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK STATE: If you lose service of one of these tunnels for one, two, or three days, you are talking about a devastating impact on transportation in the whole northeast corridor.</p><p>FISHER: The existing tunnel was already showing its age but then super storm sandy hit, flooding it with salt water and that salt is still sitting on the cement, decomposing one of the most critical arteries into the nation's largest city, and President Trump's hometown.</p><p>CUOMO: We want to make sure that the President understands the severity of the damage.</p><p>FISHER: But this year, the Trump administration denied funding for its replacement, the proposed gateway tunnel. So today, New York governor came to Washington to try to convince President Trump in person to help build it before it's too late.</p><p>CUOMO: I think it is fair to say that the President was receptive to what we were talking about.</p><p>FISHER: If they strike a deal, it would be a rare display of bipartisanship between two brash native New Yorkers who have traded barbs repeatedly over the last two years. It would also give real credence to the hope that infrastructure may be one issue where Republicans and Democrats might actually be able to work together when the new Congress comes in.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It really could be a beautiful bipartisan type of situation. Maybe we will make a deal, maybe we won't. That's possible. But we have a lot of things in common on infrastructure.</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: We Democrats believe in a real infrastructure bill with real, direct and robust federal investments that will rebuild crumbling roads and bridges.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FISHER: And when it comes to building these new tunnels, there's been a lot of talk that perhaps funding for them would be tied to the President's border wall. But tonight, Governor Cuomo told Democrats on Capitol Hill, don't do it, it's a bad deal. He said quote, \"I would not trade anything for a wall\" -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Kristin Fisher, live on the north lawn. Kristin -- thanks.</p><p>House Democrats have formally nominated Nancy Pelosi to be speaker next year. 238 members voted today -- 203 voted yes for Nancy Pelosi, 32 voted no against Nancy Pelosi. There were three blanks. Pelosi needs to whittle down those 35 dissenters by about half in order to hit the magic number of 218 in January. Maryland's Steny Hoyer was elected today to be House Majority Leader again.</p><p>The final days of the current congress could get a lot messier. There is increasing concern tonight about the possibility of a partial government shutdown next week.</p><p>Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel tells us where things stand right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: As the human drama plays out at the southern border, President Trump has signaled he is willing to shut down part of the government one week from Friday demanding more money for his border wall. Retiring Speaker Paul Ryan says the House has delivered $5 billion.</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Our bill contains the President's full request for the border but ultimately, the President and the Senate Democrats are going to have to come to agreement, as well.</p><p>EMANUEL: Senate Democrats like Connecticut's Richard Blumenthal are pushing back.</p><p>SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), CONNECTICUT: The demand for $5 billion is based on delusion, not reality.</p><p>EMANUEL: President Trump told \"Politico\" late yesterday, he doesn't do anything just for political gain. Still, this is a winner for him. Quote, \"People look at the border, they look at the rush to the police, they look at the rock-throwers and really hurting three people. Three very brave border patrol folks. I think that it is a tremendous issue, but much more importantly, is really needed. So we have to have border security.\"</p><p>Plus, the President is well aware he is about to be dealing with a Democrat-led House in the new year. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer is trying to hold his ground.</p><p>SCHUMER: The $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position. We believe that is the right way to go. If there is any shutdown, it is on President Trump's back.</p><p>EMANUEL: With time winding down, the majority leader is trying to deliver.</p><p>MCCONNELL: We are trying to get the President the money he would like for the wall. That is part of the year-end funding discussion which is ongoing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EMANUEL: At this point, all the sources I have spoken with are not pushing the panic button. Their feeling is there is still time to cut a deal but it's not entirely clear what it might be -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: We'll track it. Mike Emanuel, live on the Hill. Mike -- thanks.</p><p>The outlook is a bit cloudy tonight for Google. It is facing huge fines over accusations of illegally tracking millions of people around the world. Many lawmakers here and overseas are losing patience.</p><p>Correspondent Gillian Turner is here to tell us what is happening. Good evening -- Gillian.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening -- Bret.</p><p>Google's privacy practices once again under fire. Since yesterday seven European countries have filed complaints under a new E.U. data protection law. They alleged Google uses manipulative tactics to trick users into allowing the platform to track them.</p><p>One consumer group filing complaints on behalf of the E.U. says, \"The places we go to reveal a lot about ourselves and our private life. Smartphones are being used for spying on our every move.\" Google faces a fine now of up to 4 percent of its annual global revenue, or about $4 billion under the new law.</p><p>But Google tells Fox News, its location history function has to be turned on by users in order to take effect. And they add, \"Location history is turned off by default, and you can edit, delete, or pause it at any time. If you pause it, we make clear that depending on your individual phone and app settings, we might still collect and use location data to improve your Google experience.\"</p><p>But even congressional regulators say the tracking function is not user- friendly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR JON TESTER (D), MONTANA: You are going to have to teach me how I can say no information is transferred for me because I have never seen that. And if it has, it has been imprinted in so damn fine of print that I don't even have time to read it all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: U.S. Lawmakers are hot on Google's trail, though they have yet to pass any federal legislation, as their European counterparts did in May.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR JERRY MORAN (R), KANSAS: It has become clear that the U.S. needs a consumer federal data privacy law.</p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Congress is fed up. It's about big tech no longer being entitled to say to America, trust us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: Capitol Hill leaders will have the chance to grill Google executives in person on this matter in just a few days. The CEO of Google Sundar Pichai testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on December 5th -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: We'll continue to follow that. Gillian -- thank you.</p><p>Up next, you might be surprised at the number of immigrants living in this country illegally. That's coming up.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 45 in Baltimore as the city files a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration alleging unlawful efforts to deter immigrants from getting public assistance. The city asserts that African immigrants' participation in the federal Head Start Program has virtually ceased in Baltimore schools due to policy change.</p><p>Fox 11 in Los Angeles with a preview of the L.A. Auto Show. The event comes just days after General Motors announced layoffs and plant closures around the U.S. and in Canada. The show will feature more than 60-vehicle debuts and underscores the public's demand for SUVs and crossovers, as well as electric vehicles.</p><p>And this is a live look at Honolulu from our affiliate there Fox 2. One of the big stories there tonight, a man who suffered a heart attack shortly after Hawaii mistakenly issued an alert about a ballistic missile is suing the state. The lawsuit says the sending of the false missile alert and failing to cancel it in a timely manner was a substantial factor in causing the James Shawn Shields' heart attack on January 13th. No comment from the state yet.</p><p>That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We will be right back.</p><p>BAIER: The FBI says a man sitting in a Texas jail may be one of the most prolific serial killers in American history. Texas Rangers say 78-year-old Samuel Little has confessed to 90 murders so far. The FBI and the Rangers are trying to match Little's confessions with unsolved killings around the country. They have confirmed 34 so far. Little is said to be in poor health and is expected to remain in that Texas jail until his death.</p><p>We have new information tonight about what is one of the most controversial issues here in Washington and maybe where you live -- illegal immigration. It turns out, there is less of it right now, and those who try it are not necessarily who you think they are.</p><p>National correspondent William La Jeunesse looks at the numbers and explains this evening.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: We are not letting people into our country unless they come in legally.</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Unrealistic maybe, but not unworthy of pursuit. According to a new study, the number of illegal immigrants living in the U.S. fell to its lowest level in a decade.</p><p>THERESA CARDINAL BROWN, BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER: We have for the first time a majority of those coming to the U.S.-Mexico border, are not Mexican, they are not single men, they are not just looking for work.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: The Pew Research study found Mexicans today make up about half the illegal population, down considerably. Two-thirds of migrants in the U.S. have been here ten years or more and 43 percent have U.S.-born children. Half those cross the border illegally, the rest overstay their visa.</p><p>Pew's findings differ from a recent Yale study that suggests up to 22 million illegal immigrants live in the U.S., not 11 million. The Pew study is also based on the 2016 census, two-year-old data that does not fully account for the recent surge from Central America.</p><p>BROWN: What happened as a drip, a drab has now become a very large group.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Deterring them will require Mexico's help.</p><p>DUNCAN WOOD, WOODROW WILSON CENTER: Mexico will continue to play a large role in stemming the flow but they're not going to be able to stop it.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: That flow from Latin America is also driving legal immigration. For the first time in a decade, Hispanics outnumber Asians arriving to the U.S. The U.S. immigrant population, legal and illegal, numbers more than 44 million, a roughly 14 percent of the nation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: The President hopes to reshape immigration policy by replacing family reunification with a merit the system. But any study is a snapshot in time. As the exodus from Central America illustrates, immigration is fluid -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: William La Jeunesse in L.A.. William -- thanks.</p><p>Up next, a sanctuary city idea some conservatives just might like.</p><p>First, beyond our borders tonight.</p><p>The Pentagon has identified two soldiers and an airman killed in a roadside bomb attack yesterday in Afghanistan. They are Army Captain Andrew Patrick Ross of Lexington, Virginia; Army Sergeant First Class, Eric Michael Emond (ph) of Brush Prairie, Washington; and Air Force Staff Sergeant Dylan Elchin of Hookstown, Pennsylvania.</p><p>At least 30 civilians were killed along with 16 Taliban fighters as Afghan government forces battled insurgents in the southern Helmand Province overnight. Taliban terrorists staged a coordinated attack against security forces in Afghanistan. And a U.S. military spokesman says an air strike that killed many of the civilians was conducted by American aircraft.</p><p>A Chinese researcher who claims to have helped make the world's first genetically-edited babies says a second pregnancy may be underway. Mainstream scientists have condemned that experiment, and universities and government groups are now investigating.</p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>BAIER: New tonight, a sanctuary city proposal that Republicans and conservatives might get behind. It does not have to do with immigration. It's all about guns. Correspondent Dan Springer tells us what one small Washington state town is doing about a gun law most residents there have no intention of obeying.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good man. I appreciate what you are doing.</p><p>DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: In tiny Republic, Washington, Police Chief Loren Culp was a local celebrity after saying he would not enforce the law, or one state law, initiative 1639, a sweeping gun control measure.</p><p>LOREN CULP, REPUBLIC, WASHINGTON, POLICE CHIEF: I felt that it was such a blatant disregard for Constitutional rights that I felt like I had no choice but to stand up for the people that I serve.</p><p>SPRINGER: The new gun law bars 18 to 20-year-olds from buying semiautomatic rifles and makes it a potential felony if your gun ends up in the wrong hands. It also creates enhanced background checks and mandatory firearms training. Voters across Washington state passed the measure 59 to 41 percent, but in Ferry County, nearly three out of four voters opposed it. Mayor Elbert Koontz is considering an ordinance proposed by Chief Culp to make Republic a sanctuary city for gun rights.</p><p>JERRY MORAN, (R) SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE: Everybody in Republic has a gun. We don't have a giant crime rate because nobody in their right mind is going to come to a house where people have guns that know how to use them.</p><p>SPRINGER: When Chief Culp announced his sanctuary city proposal, he got a standing ovation. In Seattle, the reaction is very different.</p><p>RENEE HOPKINS, ALLIANCE FOR GUN RESPONSIBILITY: Their job is to enforce the laws that are passed, not necessarily just the ones they approve of personally.</p><p>SPRINGER: The Second Amendment Foundation along with the NRA sued to strike down the new state law. Its leaders see poetic justice in gun rights advocates getting into the sanctuary business, up until now reserved for illegal immigrants.</p><p>ALAN GOTTLIEB, SECOND AMENDMENT FOUNDATION: In politics, there is always a pushback. When you try to take people's rights away from them, they stand up and they rebel, and that's what you're seeing in Republic, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPRINGER: The city council will discuss the gun rights sanctuary city ordinance at its next meeting on Monday and could vote on it before the state law takes effect in January. The state's attorney general, a Democrat who supports gun control, says he'll review the ordinance if it passes. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Dan Springer in Washington state. Dan, thanks.</p><p>Mississippi Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith gets to keep her job. The Republican incumbent defeated Democrat Mike Espy in yesterday's runoff by a 54 to 46 percent margin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CINDY HYDE-SMITH, (R) MISSISSIPPI: The reason we won is because Mississippians know me and they know my heart, and thank you for standing up.</p><p>MIKE ESPY, (D) MISSISSIPPI SENATE CANDIDATE: This movement is not going to end for a new Mississippi, a more united Mississippi, a Mississippi where everyone, regardless of race or party, or religion, feels their worth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Hyde-Smith was appointed to the job last spring after the retirement of Thad Cochran. She becomes the first woman elected to Congress from Mississippi. And in the new Senate in January, Republicans will now hold a 53 to 47 majority, a net gain of two seats from the current Senate.</p><p>Former President Obama did not campaign in person for Espy. He did cut a robo-call Monday. Mr. Obama has been pretty visible lately during the lead up to the midterms and afterwards, and he wants to make sure you don't forget about him or the things he considers his achievements. That's the story tonight from correspondent Doug McKelway.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The truth was, I was also intent on following a wise American tradition of ex-presidents gracefully exiting the political stage.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Former President Obama may have found the political stage harder to leave then he thought. Since those remarks in September, against tradition, he campaigned vigorously in the midterms, with mixed results. His favorite candidates lost close races in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, and Ohio, but won in Virginia and Illinois where they were favored. Wedged between his party's elders and its young farm team, he remains the Democratic Party's de facto leader.</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN POLICY ADVISER: They need someone to act as a spokesman. He is the natural person to do it.</p><p>MCKELWAY: He is also determined to preserve his legacy under constant assault from the present administration.</p><p>OBAMA: Nobody in my administration got indicted.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCKELWAY: He is right about that, although there were many scandals from Benghazi to Fast and Furious, the IRS targeting of conservative groups, and the botched startup of Obamacare. Critics scoff at what they say is his embellishment of other legacies like the growth of the economy and of oil and gas exploration.</p><p>OBAMA: You wouldn't always know it, but it went up every year I was president.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>OBAMA: And that whole, suddenly Americans are the biggest oil producer and the biggest gas -- that was me, people.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: The only thing Obama did is stand in the way in every conceivable way with both a pen and a phone to prevent these entrepreneurs from being able to exploit these resources to the max.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKELWAY: There is one Obama legacy that's indisputable -- Organizing for Action, which evolved from the Obama campaign's Organizing for America, has helped build the Democrats' effective ground game, contributing to the party's retaking of the House, where numerous investigations of the Trump administration await come January. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Dough, thank you.</p><p>So is President Trump considering a pardon for his former campaign chairman? And where is this investigation going? We will talk about it all with the panel after the break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE, (R) ARIZONA: We have already seen the forced resignation of the attorney general a day after the election. It is clear, therefore, that something has to be done to protect Mr. Mueller's investigation.</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D) NEW JERSEY: This is about the legislative branch asserting a commonsense check and balance on presidential overreach.</p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: This is a solution in search of a problem. The president is not going to fire Robert Mueller.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Three Senate Judiciary Committee members today taking to the floor to try to force a vote on the bill to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This happened before news broke of a \"New York Post\" article, piece in which the president is quoted, asked about pardoning Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman. It, pardoning Manafort, \"was never discussed, but I wouldn't take it off the table. Why would I take it off the table?\" That prompted a lot of response on Capitol Hill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE, (R) ARIZONA: That is par for the course, I guess, to hold that and dangle it out there.</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, (D) SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: The real danger there is a pardon, which is in Trump and Manafort's interest, but it would be solid evidence of obstruction of justice.</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I am not aware of any conversations for anyone's pardon involving this process at all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: So it is like a four-alarm fire up on Capitol Hill over this today. Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Amy Walter, national editor for the \"Cook Political Report,\" and Hugo Gurdon, editorial director for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Amy, thoughts?</p><p>AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": That is not the only four alarm fire that's going on.</p><p>BAIER: There's a lot of them.</p><p>WALTER: There's the Saudi Arabia question, what we are going to do there in the war on Yemen, and should we continue to give support to Saudi Arabia. And then of course you have Mueller, and then you have judges. All of those trying to get squeezed into the next week, week and a half, these guys would like to get on. Oh, and we also have a lame duck session where we need to pass the numbers of very important bills. So this seems to be one of the many things that Congress is juggling.</p><p>I don't know that there is going to be an answer to whether or not we're going to get a Mueller vote right now. It seems like Flake is out there a little bit on his own in terms of being the one Republican that could make this happen. To me, the question is whether or not --</p><p>BAIER: I guess Corker is there.</p><p>WALTER: Right, that is true, but Flake is saying I'm not going to support any judicial nominees that come through unless I get this vote, and whether or not that has enough leverage to get that vote to the floor, on top of the other votes rebuking the president, one of which happened today on Saudi Arabia. How many of those can McConnell really continue to hold up?</p><p>BAIER: Hugo?</p><p>HUGO GURDON, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": The president does have a way, as Jeff Flake was saying, of dangling things, or another way of looking at it is expressing things in a way which poke the hornets' nest. By just suggesting he is not going to take it off the table, it suggests to the Democrats who have been saying he wants to pardon Manafort that that is what he is going to do.</p><p>But it works in the Democrats' favor to try and pass this resolution to protect Mueller, because even if the president has no intention of doing this, and as the majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is saying this is a solution in search of a problem, it allows them to keep stoking the idea that the president is going to try and do this. I think they would have a tough time proving obstruction of justice if the president exercises his constitutional powers and actually does the pardon.</p><p>BAIER: There are people up there today saying just by saying what he said, it's already obstruction of justice. The snowball just goes down the hill very quickly here, Charlie.</p><p>CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Welcome to the next two years of Washington, and in particular in Congress. The good news for the president, though, is that because of the elections, the GOP, the Republican caucus is going to be a little bit more Trumpier. People like Bob Corker and Jeff Flake won't be there sniping from the Republican side. It will mostly be Democrats that are playing these games.</p><p>But in terms of the issue of pardoning, once again, it's a situation where you have Trump saying something -- it's that he dangles something. It's that he actually enunciates it. Everybody knows that this is the sort of thing that pardons have been used for forever, and we can say whatever we want to about Paul Manafort, and it's great that he has been found guilty of crimes that he committed, but of course he committed them a long time ago. And the only difference between why federal prosecutors didn't go after it back then, that remains to be answered. But the only difference between that and what ended up happening is the fact that he got involved in politics and specifically -- and that by definition is a political prosecution.</p><p>BAIER: It's important to note that we don't know what we don't know. I say that all the time about the Mueller investigation.</p><p>HURT: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>BAIER: We do know that there have been some stories that have just really fallen apart that got a lot of traction. Yesterday there was a \"Guardian\" report that said that Paul Manafort met with Assange in London and talked about the WikiLeaks emails. This is the \"Washington Times.\" Paul Manafort's passports don't show that he entered London in all the years claimed by the Guardian newspaper when it said he met secretly with WikiLeaks Julian Assange. \"The Guardian\" said he met with Assange in London in 2013, 2015, 2016. A review of Manafort's two passports show he entered Heathrow airport since 2008 on two occasions, 2012 and on another time where the customs stamp years was blurred. It appears to say 2010 or 2016.\" The point is, that is in court records from his trials, and it kind of falls apart. And it took up a lot of airwaves yesterday.</p><p>WALTER: Yes, though it was notable that no other news organization was able -- they said we can't confirm this.</p><p>BAIER: We can't confirm this, but here's --</p><p>HURT: And they walked it back.</p><p>GURDON: And \"The Guardian\" intro said, \"The Guardian has been told.\" They were not even standing by their own story. They said, we have been told this, but --</p><p>BAIER: My point is, in the vacuum of information --</p><p>WALTER: Of course, that takes up a lot of -- absolutely. But here's the thing, why would -- to your point about the prosecution is all political -- why would Mueller be cutting a deal with Paul Manafort if he didn't have anything to give him? He would have just prosecuted, this would be over. So there is clearly more that they wanted to get from him that --it's not over.</p><p>BAIER: It's not over. They've got something.</p><p>WALTER: So they've got something. So the idea that they could just prosecute him and let it be done --</p><p>BAIER: Or they think they have something. We just played Jerome Corsi, who is also facing a charge of lying. He was on our channel last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME CORSI: I never met Julian Assange, I have never spoken with him. I never emailed him. I've had no contact with Julian Assange whatsoever. I have been a loyal American. I have no contacts with Russian intelligence. I have no business interest in Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. I have never been to Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Hugo, these denials are pretty straight. Who is telling the truth, who is not? We don't know what Mueller has. He obviously has a lot of investigative months behind him, but it seems to be coming to a head here.</p><p>GURDON: It certainly does. These are as categorical denials as one could possibly get. The falling to pieces of the deal that Paul Manafort had with the prosecutor is another sign that this has come to -- I think that Manafort does look like he is looking for a pardon. I think it does raise questions of why the president would want to give him a pardon. All of that, the question of a pardon, the question of a prosecutions, it's all coming to a head, as you say.</p><p>BAIER: There is more to talk about on this. I want to talk about the Democrats and, as Amy mentioned, Saudi Arabia and foreign policy. There's just a lot going on. Stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: There is no direct reporting connecting the crown prince to the order of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY: We have no smoking gun that the crown prince was involved. Not the intelligence committee, or anyone else. There is no smoking gun.</p><p>SEN. BOB CORKER, (R) SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: We also have a crown prince that is out of control. The killing of a journalist. And whether there is a smoking gun -- I don't think there is anybody in the room that doesn't believe he is responsible for it.</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN, (D-IL) SENATE MINORITY WHIP: There are many who believe this execution of Khashoggi in Istanbul could never have taken place without the knowledge and direction of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: A lot of focus on Capitol Hill today. Defense Secretary Mattis, Secretary of State Pompeo up there briefing senators. Who was not there, the CIA director. A lot of talk about that. The CIA put out a statement saying the notion that anyone told Director Haspel not to attend today's briefing is false, going on to say they have been briefed the communications and they provided all the intelligence that they have.</p><p>We are back with the panel. Charlie, it doesn't seem like anything is going to stop the administration's policy decision of backing Saudi Arabia, but the Senate voted, 61 votes, to stop the support for the Yemen war.</p><p>HURT: This is one of the situations where, and we see in no matter who is in the White House, no matter who controls Congress. It is not really a partisan issue. It's a matter of being in the White House versus being in congress. It's so easy to be in Congress and to take totally legitimate potshots at some really terrible people, including the crown prince and others around the world who do egregious, nasty things that run counter to everything that we believe in in America.</p><p>Of course, the problem is on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, you have the White House desperately trying to not let it get out of control because of the real world interests at play here. And you go back to the previous administration, Vladimir Putin has done horrible, disgusting, murderous things to his own people and to ex-pats living in his country, political enemies. And we don't go to war over it. And that's probably a good thing. I don't want to go to war over that sort of thing.</p><p>BAIER: Amy?</p><p>WALTER: It seems to me that many senators, including Senator Lindsey Graham, are not going to be happy unless Gina Haspel comes up to Capitol Hill.</p><p>BAIER: And he said as much today.</p><p>WALTER: And basically was we have to hear from her or else nothing is moving. And to me, that could take all this debate over whether this issue of Yemen actually makes it to a bill, which makes it to the president's desk, I think a lot of that could be diffused by having Gina Haspel come up to the Hill.</p><p>BAIER: Here is what Secretary Mattis said about the Saudi-Yemen situation. \"Pulling back our limited U.S. military support, our weapons sales to our partners, and our protection of the Saudi and Emirati populations would be misguided on the eve of the promising initial negotiations. It took us too long to get here.\" Talking about negotiations to end the civil war in Yemen.</p><p>GURDON: Mattis is absolutely right. The extraordinary thing about this is that people talking on the opposite sides of this are nevertheless all correct. There may well be, there presumably is no absolute smoking gun, but at the same time I don't think anyone has any doubt that the crown prince is responsible.</p><p>I think the White House has played this very badly, and President Trump has played this badly because it is quite possible to say we are not going to overthrow our entire Mideast strategy, which is about isolating Iran, ending the war in Yemen, and also to some extent, although sotto voce, helping Israel and having Saudi Arabia on your side doing that. You can still say we are going to impose sanctions, we are going to make sure that Saudi Arabia recognizes the United States doesn't stand up for this.</p><p>I think Saudi Arabia miscalculated. They thought they could literally get away with murder because of the alliance with the United States. The United States has to make it perfectly plain that they cannot do that.</p><p>BAIER: We will see where it goes. I have got to run because the traffic here in D.C. is unbelievable. Do you know why? There is a tree lighting. 'Tis the season.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAIER: Moments ago, President Trump and the first lady just did the annual flick of the holiday switch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Four. Three. Two. One.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: The president speaking at the National Christmas Tree lighting in which he thanked first responders and military families around the country. You have to see this if you're in town. Thanks for watching SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced and unafraid. \"THE STORY\" hosted by Harris Faulkner tonight starts now.

Set your DVRs.  Never miss an  episode of \"THE FIVE\".  </p><p>SPECIAL REPORT up next with our very own hottie -- Bret Baier.  </p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX ANCHOR:  Thanks -- Greg.  </p><p>GUTFELD:  We love you.</p><p>BAIER:  Animals are great.</p><p>This is a Fox News alert.  </p><p>Welcome to Washington.  I'm Bret Baier.</p><p>President Trump is leaving the door open for a pardon for his former  campaign chairman.  The President has openly decried the treatment of some  witnesses by the special counsel, and most pointedly perhaps about the Paul  Manafort case.</p><p>It did not take long after the President's pardon possibility comments were  published for alarm bells to sound on Capitol Hill and for the pushback to  begin.</p><p>Let's get the latest tonight from chief intelligence correspondent  Catherine Herridge.  Hi -- Catherine.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, thank  you -- Bret.</p><p>Tonight new reaction to a possible pardon from a senior Democrat on the  Senate Intelligence Committee.  Mark Warner tweeting, quote, \"This would be  a blatant and unacceptable abuse of power\" after the President lashed out  at the special counsel over its tactics and targets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  During an Oval Office interview, President Trump told the \"New  York Post\" he has not ruled out a pardon for former campaign chairman Paul  Manafort.  Quote, \"It was never discussed but I wouldn't take it off the  table.  Why would I take it off the table?\"  The President said.</p><p>Mr. Trump also alleged that Manafort, one-time political adviser Roger  Stone, and his associate Jerome Corsi were pressured to lie.  Quote, \"You  know, this flipping stuff is terrible.  You flip and you lie and you get --  the prosecutors will tell you, 99 percent of the time they can get people  to flip.  It's rare that they can't.\"</p><p>On the Senate floor, a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller's  investigation was blocked after Democrats and one Republican made their  case.  </p><p>SENATOR JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  We have already seen the forced  resignation of the Attorney General a day after the election.  It is clear,  therefore that something has to be done to protect Mr. Mueller's  investigation.  </p><p>SENATOR CORY BOOKER (D), NEW JERSEY:  This is about the legislative branch  ensuring a common sense check and balance on presidential overreach.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  The Senate floor action seemed symbolic after the majority  leader made his objections known Tuesday.  </p><p>SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  This is a solution  in search of a problem.  The President is not going to fire Robert Mueller.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  New records obtained by Fox News showed Mueller's investigations  focused on the hacked Clinton campaign e-mails released in 2016 by  WikiLeaks, its founder Julian Assange, and any connection to the Trump  campaign.  The draft plea agreement offered to Corsi earlier this month  accuses him of lying to federal investigators, a charge he denied to Fox.  </p><p>JEROME CORSI, ROGER STONE ASSOCIATE:  No, I have never met Julian Assange.   I've never spoken with him.  I have never e-mailed him.  I've had no  contact with Julian Assange whatsoever.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  The special counsel documents cite an August 2016 Corsi e-mail  referring to Assange and predicting a time table for the release of e-mails  from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.  Quote, \"Word is friend in  embassy plans two more dumps.  One shortly after I'm back, 2nd in October.   Impact planned to be very damaging.\"</p><p>Corsi said the e-mail that accurately predicted WikiLeaks would publish e- mails in October 2016 was based on his analysis, not insider information.  </p><p>CORSI:  I figured it out and told Roger Stone and told many people in  August.  It just happened that I was right.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  A source with direct knowledge of the investigation tells Fox  News the President's written answers to Mueller are consistent with his  public statements on the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting which included  Manafort.  The President tweeted last summer he had no advanced knowledge.   A status hearing for the Manafort case is now scheduled for Friday -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  It seems like things are coming to a head but we don't know a  timeline.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  We don't know a timeline but sort of the conventional wisdom is  that after the President submitted written answers that it would probably  wrap up fairly quickly, possibly before Christmas.  But certainly what the  new documents tell us is that the more investigation has been firmly  focused on the Trump Tower meeting, as well as any potential contact with  WikiLeaks and the release of the Clinton e-mails.  </p><p>BAIER:  All right.  Catherine -- thank you.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p>BAIER: Adult film actress Stormy Daniels says that her attorney Michael  Avenatti sued President Trump for defamation on her behalf without her  permission.  Daniels tells the \"Daily Beast\" Avenatti started a fund- raising Web site to raise money for her legal expenses without telling her  about it.  She says he refuses to this day to tell her how that money is  being spent.  Daniels says she has not decided whether to keep Avenatti as  her lawyer.</p><p>Meantime overseas, the tensions between Russia and Ukraine over the seizure  of Russian ships and sailors is threatening to derail a planned meeting  between Russian leader Vladimir Putin and President Trump.</p><p>The two leaders are supposed to talk Saturday on the sidelines of the G-20  summit in Argentina.  But President Trump has hinted the Russian action  against Ukraine might lead him to cancel.</p><p>This takes place as the administration launches a new effort to shore up  support in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>We have Fox team coverage on two big foreign policy stories tonight.  Rich  Edson at the State Department with firm backing from the U.S. for the  Saudis in their fight against terrorists in Yemen.  But first up,  correspondent Trey Yingst in our Middle East bureau tonight on Russia and  Ukraine.  Good evening -- Trey.</p><p>TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.</p><p>Speaking today at an investment forum, Russian President Vladimir Putin  blamed the firefight over the weekend off the coast of Crimea on Ukrainian  President Petro Poroshenko, saying that the clash had political  motivations.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YINGST:  \"And now a minor incident in the Black Sea and they impose martial  law in the country,\" Putin said.  \"It is clearly done because of the  upcoming election.\"</p><p>Putin's comments came just hours after the Russian military announced it  would deploy a new S-400 surface-to-air missile system in Crimea next  month.  The system, capable of tracking and shooting down targets 250 miles  away, could be moved into place as the war drums continue to sound in  eastern Europe following the capture of 24 Ukrainian sailors by Russian  forces on Sunday.</p><p>In the past 48 hours, all 24 Ukrainian sailors have been ordered by Russian  courts to jail for the next two months pending trial.</p><p>In Ukraine, President Petro Poroshenko wearing combat fatigues visited  troops Wednesday who are training for future ground operations should they  be needed in the country's eastern parts.  </p><p>\"We have to improve our skills.  We have to provide effective training to  be ready in case it is needed,\" Poroshenko said, \"and for the enemy to lose  and to pay its irresponsible decision to invade Ukraine.\"  </p><p>According to Poroshenko, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offered  Ukraine military assistance this week in preparation for a larger conflict  with Russia.  Pompeo joins U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis in  placing the blame on Russia for starting the recent provocation.  </p><p>JAMES MATTIS, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY:  When you think that there is a  treaty between the two countries that permit exactly what happened, it just  shows that Russia cannot be counted on right now to keep its word.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YINGST:  Now, the Kremlin does tell Fox News that President Trump and  President Putin are still scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the G-20  summit this weekend, despite Trump's threats to cancel as the situation on  the ground in Ukraine inches closer to a military confrontation -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Trey Yingst in our Middle East newsroom.  Trey -- thanks.</p><p>The murder of a Saudi journalist has Democrats and Republicans on Capitol  Hill questioning U.S. policy toward the kingdom's leadership.</p><p>State Department correspondent Rich Edson is live tonight with the  administration's answer to that.  Good evening -- Rich.  </p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.   A strong defense of the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia and backing of the  Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense  Secretary James Mattis briefed senators this morning as Democrats and  Republicans say they want punishment for Saudi Arabia for the death of  Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do believe I have read every piece  of intelligence that has come in in the last few hours.  I think I have  read it all.  There is no direct reporting connecting the Crown Prince to  the order to murder Jamal Khashoggi.  That is all I can say in a non- classified setting.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON:  Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker says it's  apparent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for Khashoggi's  death.  Other senators questioned why CIA director Gina Haspel failed to  attend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  It was inadequate because the  CIA was not there.  So the question for me is whether or not the CIA  supports the conclusion with a high degree of confidence that the Crown  Prince was complicit in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON:  The CIA says Haspel already briefed the Senate Intelligence  Committee and that she was never told to avoid this morning's session.   Ahead of that briefing, Secretary Pompeo wrote in the Wall Street Journal  quote, \"Is it any coincidence that the people using the Khashoggi murder as  a cudgel against President Trump's Saudi Arabia policy are the same people  who supported Barack Obama's rapprochement with Iran, a regime that has  killed thousands worldwide including hundreds of Americans, and brutalizes  its own people.\"</p><p>After the briefing, the Senate voted to advance the measure to end the U.S.  support of the Saudi-coalition fighting the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.   Secretary Mattis says, quote, \"Pulling back our limited U.S. military  support, our weapons sales to our partners and our protection of the Saudi  and Emirati populations would be misguided on the eve of the promising  initial negotiations.\"</p><p>Negotiators are trying to schedule a meeting with a war infraction  scheduled for next month in Sweden -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  More with the panel.  Rich -- thanks.</p><p>The U.S. economy expanded at a solid 3.5 percent annual rate in the third  quarter.  The GDP figure keeps the economy on pace for its fastest  expansion in 13 years. </p><p>Today, Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell painted a positive picture of  the U.S. economy during a major speech.  He also appeared to suggest the  Fed might consider a pause in its interest rate hikes next year to assess  the impact of its credit tightening.</p><p>Well, those comments set off a real surge on Wall Street, pushing markets  back into positive territory for the year.  The Dow soared to a 618-point  gain.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 62.  The Nasdaq finished ahead 209 today.</p><p>The Democratic governor of New York is asking one of the state's most  famous and wealthiest men for some help tonight.  Governor Andrew Cuomo  needs President Trump's support for a critical rebuilding project.</p><p>Correspondent Kristin Fisher takes a look tonight from the White House.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo  calls it the most critical infrastructure issue in the entire northeast --  replacing the century-old rail tunnels beneath the Hudson River. </p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK STATE:  If you lose service of one of these  tunnels for one, two, or three days, you are talking about a devastating  impact on transportation in the whole northeast corridor.  </p><p>FISHER:  The existing tunnel was already showing its age but then super  storm sandy hit, flooding it with salt water and that salt is still sitting  on the cement, decomposing one of the most critical arteries into the  nation's largest city, and President Trump's hometown.  </p><p>CUOMO:  We want to make sure that the President understands the severity of  the damage.  </p><p>FISHER:  But this year, the Trump administration denied funding for its  replacement, the proposed gateway tunnel.  So today, New York governor came  to Washington to try to convince President Trump in person to help build it  before it's too late.  </p><p>CUOMO:  I think it is fair to say that the President was receptive to what  we were talking about.  </p><p>FISHER:  If they strike a deal, it would be a rare display of  bipartisanship between two brash native New Yorkers who have traded barbs  repeatedly over the last two years.  It would also give real credence to  the hope that infrastructure may be one issue where Republicans and  Democrats might actually be able to work together when the new Congress  comes in.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It really could be a  beautiful bipartisan type of situation.  Maybe we will make a deal, maybe  we won't.  That's possible.  But we have a lot of things in common on  infrastructure.  </p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  We Democrats believe  in a real infrastructure bill with real, direct and robust federal  investments that will rebuild crumbling roads and bridges.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FISHER:  And when it comes to building these new tunnels, there's been a  lot of talk that perhaps funding for them would be tied to the President's  border wall.  But tonight, Governor Cuomo told Democrats on Capitol Hill,  don't do it, it's a bad deal.  He said quote, \"I would not trade anything  for a wall\" -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Kristin Fisher, live on the north lawn.  Kristin -- thanks.</p><p>House Democrats have formally nominated Nancy Pelosi to be speaker next  year.  238 members voted today -- 203 voted yes for Nancy Pelosi, 32 voted  no against Nancy Pelosi.  There were three blanks.  Pelosi needs to whittle  down those 35 dissenters by about half in order to hit the magic number of  218 in January.  Maryland's Steny Hoyer was elected today to be House  Majority Leader again.</p><p>The final days of the current congress could get a lot messier.  There is  increasing concern tonight about the possibility of a partial government  shutdown next week.</p><p>Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel tells us where things stand  right now.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  As the human  drama plays out at the southern border, President Trump has signaled he is  willing to shut down part of the government one week from Friday demanding  more money for his border wall.  Retiring Speaker Paul Ryan says the House  has delivered $5 billion.  </p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Our bill contains the  President's full request for the border but ultimately, the President and  the Senate Democrats are going to have to come to agreement, as well.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Senate Democrats like Connecticut's Richard Blumenthal are  pushing back.</p><p>SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), CONNECTICUT:  The demand for $5 billion is  based on delusion, not reality.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  President Trump told \"Politico\" late yesterday, he doesn't do  anything just for political gain.  Still, this is a winner for him.  Quote,  \"People look at the border, they look at the rush to the police, they look  at the rock-throwers and really hurting three people.  Three very brave  border patrol folks.  I think that it is a tremendous issue, but much more  importantly, is really needed.  So we have to have border security.\"</p><p>Plus, the President is well aware he is about to be dealing with a  Democrat-led House in the new year.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer  is trying to hold his ground.  </p><p>SCHUMER:  The $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and  Republicans is our position.  We believe that is the right way to go.  If  there is any shutdown, it is on President Trump's back.  </p><p>EMANUEL: With time winding down, the majority leader is trying to deliver.  </p><p>MCCONNELL:  We are trying to get the President the money he would like for  the wall.  That is part of the year-end funding discussion which is  ongoing.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EMANUEL:  At this point, all the sources I have spoken with are not pushing  the panic button.  Their feeling is there is still time to cut a deal but  it's not entirely clear what it might be -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  We'll track it.  Mike Emanuel, live on the Hill.  Mike -- thanks.</p><p>The outlook is a bit cloudy tonight for Google.  It is facing huge fines  over accusations of illegally tracking millions of people around the world.   Many lawmakers here and overseas are losing patience.</p><p>Correspondent Gillian Turner is here to tell us what is happening.  Good  evening -- Gillian.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.</p><p>Google's privacy practices once again under fire.  Since yesterday seven  European countries have filed complaints under a new E.U. data protection  law.  They alleged Google uses manipulative tactics to trick users into  allowing the platform to track them.</p><p>One consumer group filing complaints on behalf of the E.U. says, \"The  places we go to reveal a lot about ourselves and our private life.   Smartphones are being used for spying on our every move.\"  Google faces a  fine now of up to 4 percent of its annual global revenue, or about $4  billion under the new law.</p><p>But Google tells Fox News, its location history function has to be turned  on by users in order to take effect.  And they add, \"Location history is  turned off by default, and you can edit, delete, or pause it at any time.   If you pause it, we make clear that depending on your individual phone and  app settings, we might still collect and use location data to improve your  Google experience.\"</p><p>But even congressional regulators say the tracking function is not user- friendly.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR JON TESTER (D), MONTANA:  You are going to have to teach me how I  can say no information is transferred for me because I have never seen  that.  And if it has, it has been imprinted in so damn fine of print that I  don't even have time to read it all.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER:  U.S. Lawmakers are hot on Google's trail, though they have yet to  pass any federal legislation, as their European counterparts did in May.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR JERRY MORAN (R), KANSAS:  It has become clear that the U.S. needs a  consumer federal data privacy law. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL:  Congress is fed up.  It's about big tech no longer being  entitled to say to America, trust us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER:  Capitol Hill leaders will have the chance to grill Google  executives in person on this matter in just a few days.  The CEO of Google  Sundar Pichai testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on December  5th -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  We'll continue to follow that.  Gillian -- thank you.</p><p>Up next, you might be surprised at the number of immigrants living in this  country illegally.  That's coming up.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are  covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 45 in Baltimore as the city files a federal lawsuit against the Trump  administration alleging unlawful efforts to deter immigrants from getting  public assistance.  The city asserts that African immigrants' participation  in the federal Head Start Program has virtually ceased in Baltimore schools  due to policy change.</p><p>Fox 11 in Los Angeles with a preview of the L.A. Auto Show.  The event  comes just days after General Motors announced layoffs and plant closures  around the U.S. and in Canada.  The show will feature more than 60-vehicle  debuts and underscores the public's demand for SUVs and crossovers, as well  as electric vehicles.</p><p>And this is a live look at Honolulu from our affiliate there Fox 2.  One of  the big stories there tonight, a man who suffered a heart attack shortly  after Hawaii mistakenly issued an alert about a ballistic missile is suing  the state.  The lawsuit says the sending of the false missile alert and  failing to cancel it in a timely manner was a substantial factor in causing  the James Shawn Shields' heart attack on January 13th.  No comment from the  state yet.</p><p>That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.  We  will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  The FBI says a man sitting in a Texas jail may be one of the most  prolific serial killers in American history.  Texas Rangers say 78-year-old  Samuel Little has confessed to 90 murders so far.  The FBI and the Rangers  are trying to match Little's confessions with unsolved killings around the  country.  They have confirmed 34 so far.  Little is said to be in poor  health and is expected to remain in that Texas jail until his death.</p><p>We have new information tonight about what is one of the most controversial  issues here in Washington and maybe where you live -- illegal immigration.   It turns out, there is less of it right now, and those who try it are not  necessarily who you think they are.</p><p>National correspondent William La Jeunesse looks at the numbers and  explains this evening.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP:  We are not letting people into our country unless they come in  legally.  </p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Unrealistic maybe,  but not unworthy of pursuit.  According to a new study, the number of  illegal immigrants living in the U.S. fell to its lowest level in a decade.  </p><p>THERESA CARDINAL BROWN, BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER:  We have for the first  time a majority of those coming to the U.S.-Mexico border, are not Mexican,  they are not single men, they are not just looking for work.  </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  The Pew Research study found Mexicans today make up about  half the illegal population, down considerably.  Two-thirds of migrants in  the U.S. have been here ten years or more and 43 percent have U.S.-born  children.  Half those cross the border illegally, the rest overstay their  visa.</p><p>Pew's findings differ from a recent Yale study that suggests up to 22  million illegal immigrants live in the U.S., not 11 million.  The Pew study  is also based on the 2016 census, two-year-old data that does not fully  account for the recent surge from Central America.  </p><p>BROWN:  What happened as a drip, a drab has now become a very large group.  </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Deterring them will require Mexico's help.</p><p>DUNCAN WOOD, WOODROW WILSON CENTER:  Mexico will continue to play a large  role in stemming the flow but they're not going to be able to stop it.  </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  That flow from Latin America is also driving legal  immigration.  For the first time in a decade, Hispanics outnumber Asians  arriving to the U.S.  The U.S. immigrant population, legal and illegal,  numbers more than 44 million, a roughly 14 percent of the nation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  The President hopes to reshape immigration policy by  replacing family reunification with a merit the system.  But any study is a  snapshot in time.  As the exodus from Central America illustrates,  immigration is fluid -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  William La Jeunesse in L.A..  William -- thanks.</p><p>Up next, a sanctuary city idea some conservatives just might like.</p><p>First, beyond our borders tonight.</p><p>The Pentagon has identified two soldiers and an airman killed in a roadside  bomb attack yesterday in Afghanistan.  They are Army Captain Andrew Patrick  Ross of Lexington, Virginia; Army Sergeant First Class, Eric Michael Emond  (ph) of Brush Prairie, Washington; and Air Force Staff Sergeant Dylan  Elchin of Hookstown, Pennsylvania.</p><p>At least 30 civilians were killed along with 16 Taliban fighters as Afghan  government forces battled insurgents in the southern Helmand Province  overnight.  Taliban terrorists staged a coordinated attack against security  forces in Afghanistan.  And a U.S. military spokesman says an air strike  that killed many of the civilians was conducted by American aircraft.</p><p>A Chinese researcher who claims to have helped make the world's first  genetically-edited babies says a second pregnancy may be underway.   Mainstream scientists have condemned that experiment, and universities and  government groups are now investigating.</p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.</p><p>We will be right back.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  New tonight, a sanctuary city proposal that Republicans and  conservatives might get behind.  It does not have to do with immigration.   It's all about guns.  Correspondent Dan Springer tells us what one small  Washington state town is doing about a gun law most residents there have no  intention of obeying.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good man.  I appreciate what you are doing.  </p><p>DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  In tiny Republic, Washington, Police  Chief Loren Culp was a local celebrity after saying he would not enforce  the law, or one state law, initiative 1639, a sweeping gun control measure.  </p><p>LOREN CULP, REPUBLIC, WASHINGTON, POLICE CHIEF:  I felt that it was such a  blatant disregard for Constitutional rights that I felt like I had no  choice but to stand up for the people that I serve.  </p><p>SPRINGER:  The new gun law bars 18 to 20-year-olds from buying  semiautomatic rifles and makes it a potential felony if your gun ends up in  the wrong hands.  It also creates enhanced background checks and mandatory  firearms training.  Voters across Washington state passed the measure 59 to  41 percent, but in Ferry County, nearly three out of four voters opposed  it.  Mayor Elbert Koontz is considering an ordinance proposed by Chief Culp  to make Republic a sanctuary city for gun rights.  </p><p>JERRY MORAN, (R) SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Everybody in Republic has a  gun.  We don't have a giant crime rate because nobody in their right mind  is going to come to a house where people have guns that know how to use  them.  </p><p>SPRINGER:  When Chief Culp announced his sanctuary city proposal, he got a  standing ovation.  In Seattle, the reaction is very different.  </p><p>RENEE HOPKINS, ALLIANCE FOR GUN RESPONSIBILITY:  Their job is to enforce  the laws that are passed, not necessarily just the ones they approve of  personally.  </p><p>SPRINGER:  The Second Amendment Foundation along with the NRA sued to  strike down the new state law.  Its leaders see poetic justice in gun  rights advocates getting into the sanctuary business, up until now reserved  for illegal immigrants.  </p><p>ALAN GOTTLIEB, SECOND AMENDMENT FOUNDATION:  In politics, there is always a  pushback.  When you try to take people's rights away from them, they stand  up and they rebel, and that's what you're seeing in Republic, Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPRINGER:  The city council will discuss the gun rights sanctuary city  ordinance at its next meeting on Monday and could vote on it before the  state law takes effect in January.  The state's attorney general, a  Democrat who supports gun control, says he'll review the ordinance if it  passes.  Bret?  </p><p>BAIER:  Dan Springer in Washington state.  Dan, thanks.  </p><p>Mississippi Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith gets to keep her job.  The Republican  incumbent defeated Democrat Mike Espy in yesterday's runoff by a 54 to 46  percent margin.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CINDY HYDE-SMITH, (R) MISSISSIPPI:  The reason we won is because  Mississippians know me and they know my heart, and thank you for standing  up.  </p><p>MIKE ESPY, (D) MISSISSIPPI SENATE CANDIDATE:  This movement is not going to  end for a new Mississippi, a more united Mississippi, a Mississippi where  everyone, regardless of race or party, or religion, feels their worth.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Hyde-Smith was appointed to the job last spring after the  retirement of Thad Cochran.  She becomes the first woman elected to  Congress from Mississippi.  And in the new Senate in January, Republicans  will now hold a 53 to 47 majority, a net gain of two seats from the current  Senate.  </p><p>Former President Obama did not campaign in person for Espy.  He did cut a  robo-call Monday.  Mr. Obama has been pretty visible lately during the lead  up to the midterms and afterwards, and he wants to make sure you don't  forget about him or the things he considers his achievements.  That's the  story tonight from correspondent Doug McKelway.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  The truth was, I was also intent on  following a wise American tradition of ex-presidents gracefully exiting the  political stage.  </p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Former President Obama may have  found the political stage harder to leave then he thought.  Since those  remarks in September, against tradition, he campaigned vigorously in the  midterms, with mixed results.  His favorite candidates lost close races in  Florida, Georgia, Indiana, and Ohio, but won in Virginia and Illinois where  they were favored.  Wedged between his party's elders and its young farm  team, he remains the Democratic Party's de facto leader.  </p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN POLICY ADVISER:  They need someone to  act as a spokesman.  He is the natural person to do it.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  He is also determined to preserve his legacy under constant  assault from the present administration.  </p><p>OBAMA:  Nobody in my administration got indicted.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  He is right about that, although there were many scandals from  Benghazi to Fast and Furious, the IRS targeting of conservative groups, and  the botched startup of Obamacare.  Critics scoff at what they say is his  embellishment of other legacies like the growth of the economy and of oil  and gas exploration.  </p><p>OBAMA:  You wouldn't always know it, but it went up every year I was  president.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>OBAMA:  And that whole, suddenly Americans are the biggest oil producer and  the biggest gas -- that was me, people.  </p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  The only thing Obama did is  stand in the way in every conceivable way with both a pen and a phone to  prevent these entrepreneurs from being able to exploit these resources to  the max.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  There is one Obama legacy that's indisputable -- Organizing for  Action, which evolved from the Obama campaign's Organizing for America, has  helped build the Democrats' effective ground game, contributing to the  party's retaking of the House, where numerous investigations of the Trump  administration await come January.  Bret?</p><p>BAIER:  Dough, thank you.  </p><p>So is President Trump considering a pardon for his former campaign  chairman?  And where is this investigation going?  We will talk about it  all with the panel after the break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE, (R) ARIZONA:  We have already seen the forced resignation  of the attorney general a day after the election.  It is clear, therefore,  that something has to be done to protect Mr. Mueller's investigation.  </p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D) NEW JERSEY:  This is about the legislative branch  asserting a commonsense check and balance on presidential overreach.  </p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  This is a solution in search  of a problem.  The president is not going to fire Robert Mueller.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Three Senate Judiciary Committee members today taking to the floor  to try to force a vote on the bill to protect Special Counsel Robert  Mueller.  This happened before news broke of a \"New York Post\" article,  piece in which the president is quoted, asked about pardoning Paul  Manafort, his former campaign chairman.  It, pardoning Manafort, \"was never  discussed, but I wouldn't take it off the table.  Why would I take it off  the table?\" That prompted a lot of response on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE, (R) ARIZONA:  That is par for the course, I guess, to hold  that and dangle it out there.  </p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, (D) SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  The real danger  there is a pardon, which is in Trump and Manafort's interest, but it would  be solid evidence of obstruction of justice.  </p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I am not aware of any  conversations for anyone's pardon involving this process at all.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  So it is like a four-alarm fire up on Capitol Hill over this today.   Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington  Times,\" Amy Walter, national editor for the \"Cook Political Report,\" and  Hugo Gurdon, editorial director for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Amy,  thoughts?  </p><p>AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\":  That is not the only  four alarm fire that's going on.</p><p>BAIER:  There's a lot of them.</p><p>WALTER:  There's the Saudi Arabia question, what we are going to do there  in the war on Yemen, and should we continue to give support to Saudi  Arabia.  And then of course you have Mueller, and then you have judges.   All of those trying to get squeezed into the next week, week and a half,  these guys would like to get on.  Oh, and we also have a lame duck session  where we need to pass the numbers of very important bills.  So this seems  to be one of the many things that Congress is juggling.  </p><p>I don't know that there is going to be an answer to whether or not we're  going to get a Mueller vote right now.  It seems like Flake is out there a  little bit on his own in terms of being the one Republican that could make  this happen.  To me, the question is whether or not -- </p><p>BAIER:  I guess Corker is there.  </p><p>WALTER:  Right, that is true, but Flake is saying I'm not going to support  any judicial nominees that come through unless I get this vote, and whether  or not that has enough leverage to get that vote to the floor, on top of  the other votes rebuking the president, one of which happened today on  Saudi Arabia.  How many of those can McConnell really continue to hold up?  </p><p>BAIER:  Hugo?  </p><p>HUGO GURDON, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  The president does have a way, as Jeff  Flake was saying, of dangling things, or another way of looking at it is  expressing things in a way which poke the hornets' nest.  By just  suggesting he is not going to take it off the table, it suggests to the  Democrats who have been saying he wants to pardon Manafort that that is  what he is going to do.  </p><p>But it works in the Democrats' favor to try and pass this resolution to  protect Mueller, because even if the president has no intention of doing  this, and as the majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is saying  this is a solution in search of a problem, it allows them to keep stoking  the idea that the president is going to try and do this.  I think they  would have a tough time proving obstruction of justice if the president  exercises his constitutional powers and actually does the pardon.  </p><p>BAIER:  There are people up there today saying just by saying what he said,  it's already obstruction of justice.  The snowball just goes down the hill  very quickly here, Charlie.  </p><p>CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\":  Welcome to the next two  years of Washington, and in particular in Congress.  The good news for the  president, though, is that because of the elections, the GOP, the  Republican caucus is going to be a little bit more Trumpier.  People like  Bob Corker and Jeff Flake won't be there sniping from the Republican side.   It will mostly be Democrats that are playing these games.  </p><p>But in terms of the issue of pardoning, once again, it's a situation where  you have Trump saying something -- it's that he dangles something.  It's  that he actually enunciates it.  Everybody knows that this is the sort of  thing that pardons have been used for forever, and we can say whatever we  want to about Paul Manafort, and it's great that he has been found guilty  of crimes that he committed, but of course he committed them a long time  ago.  And the only difference between why federal prosecutors didn't go  after it back then, that remains to be answered.  But the only difference  between that and what ended up happening is the fact that he got involved  in politics and specifically -- and that by definition is a political  prosecution.  </p><p>BAIER:  It's important to note that we don't know what we don't know.  I  say that all the time about the Mueller investigation.  </p><p>HURT:  Yes, absolutely.  </p><p>BAIER:  We do know that there have been some stories that have just really  fallen apart that got a lot of traction.  Yesterday there was a \"Guardian\"  report that said that Paul Manafort met with Assange in London and talked  about the WikiLeaks emails.  This is the \"Washington Times.\"  Paul  Manafort's passports don't show that he entered London in all the years  claimed by the Guardian newspaper when it said he met secretly with  WikiLeaks Julian Assange.  \"The Guardian\" said he met with Assange in  London in 2013, 2015, 2016.  A review of Manafort's two passports show he  entered Heathrow airport since 2008 on two occasions, 2012 and on another  time where the customs stamp years was blurred.  It appears to say 2010 or  2016.\"  The point is, that is in court records from his trials, and it kind  of falls apart.  And it took up a lot of airwaves yesterday.  </p><p>WALTER:  Yes, though it was notable that no other news organization was  able -- they said we can't confirm this.  </p><p>BAIER:  We can't confirm this, but here's --  </p><p>HURT:  And they walked it back.  </p><p>GURDON:  And \"The Guardian\" intro said, \"The Guardian has been told.\" They  were not even standing by their own story.  They said, we have been told  this, but --  </p><p>BAIER:  My point is, in the vacuum of information -- </p><p>WALTER:  Of course, that takes up a lot of -- absolutely.  But here's the  thing, why would -- to your point about the prosecution is all political --  why would Mueller be cutting a deal with Paul Manafort if he didn't have  anything to give him?  He would have just prosecuted, this would be over.   So there is clearly more that they wanted to get from him that --it's not  over.  </p><p>BAIER:  It's not over.  They've got something.  </p><p>WALTER:  So they've got something.  So the idea that they could just  prosecute him and let it be done -- </p><p>BAIER:  Or they think they have something.  We just played Jerome Corsi,  who is also facing a charge of lying.  He was on our channel last night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME CORSI:  I never met Julian Assange, I have never spoken with him.  I  never emailed him.  I've had no contact with Julian Assange whatsoever.  I  have been a loyal American.  I have no contacts with Russian intelligence.   I have no business interest in Russia.  I have nothing to do with Russia.   I have never been to Russia.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Hugo, these denials are pretty straight.  Who is telling the truth,  who is not?  We don't know what Mueller has.  He obviously has a lot of  investigative months behind him, but it seems to be coming to a head here.  </p><p>GURDON:  It certainly does.  These are as categorical denials as one could  possibly get.  The falling to pieces of the deal that Paul Manafort had  with the prosecutor is another sign that this has come to -- I think that  Manafort does look like he is looking for a pardon.  I think it does raise  questions of why the president would want to give him a pardon.  All of  that, the question of a pardon, the question of a prosecutions, it's all  coming to a head, as you say.  </p><p>BAIER:  There is more to talk about on this.  I want to talk about the  Democrats and, as Amy mentioned, Saudi Arabia and foreign policy.  There's  just a lot going on.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE:  There is no direct reporting connecting  the crown prince to the order of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p>JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY:  We have no smoking gun that the crown  prince was involved.  Not the intelligence committee, or anyone else.   There is no smoking gun.  </p><p>SEN. BOB CORKER, (R) SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We also  have a crown prince that is out of control.  The killing of a journalist.   And whether there is a smoking gun -- I don't think there is anybody in the  room that doesn't believe he is responsible for it.  </p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN, (D-IL) SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  There are many who believe  this execution of Khashoggi in Istanbul could never have taken place  without the knowledge and direction of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  A lot of focus on Capitol Hill today.  Defense Secretary Mattis,  Secretary of State Pompeo up there briefing senators.  Who was not there,  the CIA director.  A lot of talk about that.  The CIA put out a statement  saying the notion that anyone told Director Haspel not to attend today's  briefing is false, going on to say they have been briefed the  communications and they provided all the intelligence that they have.  </p><p>We are back with the panel.  Charlie, it doesn't seem like anything is  going to stop the administration's policy decision of backing Saudi Arabia,  but the Senate voted, 61 votes, to stop the support for the Yemen war.  </p><p>HURT:  This is one of the situations where, and we see in no matter who is  in the White House, no matter who controls Congress.  It is not really a  partisan issue.  It's a matter of being in the White House versus being in  congress.  It's so easy to be in Congress and to take totally legitimate  potshots at some really terrible people, including the crown prince and  others around the world who do egregious, nasty things that run counter to  everything that we believe in in America.  </p><p>Of course, the problem is on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, you  have the White House desperately trying to not let it get out of control  because of the real world interests at play here.  And you go back to the  previous administration, Vladimir Putin has done horrible, disgusting,  murderous things to his own people and to ex-pats living in his country,  political enemies.  And we don't go to war over it.  And that's probably a  good thing.  I don't want to go to war over that sort of thing.  </p><p>BAIER:  Amy?  </p><p>WALTER:  It seems to me that many senators, including Senator Lindsey  Graham, are not going to be happy unless Gina Haspel comes up to Capitol  Hill.</p><p>BAIER:  And he said as much today.</p><p>WALTER:  And basically was we have to hear from her or else nothing is  moving.  And to me, that could take all this debate over whether this issue  of Yemen actually makes it to a bill, which makes it to the president's  desk, I think a lot of that could be diffused by having Gina Haspel come up  to the Hill.  </p><p>BAIER:  Here is what Secretary Mattis said about the Saudi-Yemen situation.   \"Pulling back our limited U.S. military support, our weapons sales to our  partners, and our protection of the Saudi and Emirati populations would be  misguided on the eve of the promising initial negotiations.  It took us too  long to get here.\"  Talking about negotiations to end the civil war in  Yemen.  </p><p>GURDON:  Mattis is absolutely right.  The extraordinary thing about this is  that people talking on the opposite sides of this are nevertheless all  correct.  There may well be, there presumably is no absolute smoking gun,  but at the same time I don't think anyone has any doubt that the crown  prince is responsible.  </p><p>I think the White House has played this very badly, and President Trump has  played this badly because it is quite possible to say we are not going to  overthrow our entire Mideast strategy, which is about isolating Iran,  ending the war in Yemen, and also to some extent, although sotto voce,  helping Israel and having Saudi Arabia on your side doing that.  You can  still say we are going to impose sanctions, we are going to make sure that  Saudi Arabia recognizes the United States doesn't stand up for this.  </p><p>I think Saudi Arabia miscalculated.  They thought they could literally get  away with murder because of the alliance with the United States.  The  United States has to make it perfectly plain that they cannot do that.  </p><p>BAIER:  We will see where it goes.  I have got to run because the traffic  here in D.C. is unbelievable.  Do you know why?  There is a tree lighting.   'Tis the season.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  Moments ago, President Trump and the first lady just did the annual  flick of the holiday switch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:   Four.  Three.  Two.  One.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  The president speaking at the National Christmas Tree lighting in  which he thanked first responders and military families around the country.   You have to see this if you're in town.  Thanks for watching SPECIAL  REPORT.  Fair, balanced and unafraid.  \"THE STORY\" hosted by Harris  Faulkner tonight starts now.

The company unveiled a six-week leave-share program, where parents returning early from their paid leave can get paid for the remaining time in order for their partners to take time off to be with their babies.</p><p>What Happens Next</p><p>At the national level, paid family leave is not a front burner issue, although Democratic leaders such as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid chided new <person><nameText>Speaker Paul Ryan </nameText></person>for his conditioning his acceptance of his new job on his commitment to spending time with his own family but rejecting parental leave legislation. In the presidential campaign, Democratic frontrunner <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>and her Democratic Socialist challenger, <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders, </nameText></person>have both called for national family leave policies, but the issue is a dead letter in the Republican primary. However, parental leave legislation has been brought up in numerous state legislatures over the past year.</p><p>What This Means For Small Businesses</p><p>It is not at all clear that firms of all sizes can afford to offer employees such generous benefits as those in the tech industry, which offer premium employee compensation packages. Small businesses have been increasingly addressing employee needs through paid time off (PTO) policies that allow personnel and employers flexibility. As the <person><nameText>Huffington Post </nameText></person>story points out, big tech firms are increasingly offering paid leave on their own, in the absence of a national policy. A national or state paid leave mandate would only add another regulatory burden harmful to the interests of the small business community.</p><p>Additional Reading</p><p>The NFIB addressed the paid leave issue after President Obama called for Federally-funded studies at the state level earlier in 2015. The NFIB summarized the positions Clinton and Sanders took during their first debate, including on paid leave. The Hill reported on Clinton's call for family leave and other expansive policies. Separately, The Hill reports on Sander's support for family leave.</p><p>Note: this article is intended to keep small business owners up on the latest news. It does not necessarily represent the policy stances of NFIB.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1119990105</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HR4-W051-DYTH-G4H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>December 29, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to a British Pregnancy Advisory Service survey, 16 to 18-year-olds now prefer to send flirty messages from their phones and delay a physical relationship until they feel ready. Instead of worrying that they might be blackmailed over the content, they view it as a safer, more relaxed form of dating.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'd always thought sexting was for dodgy American politicians and naive, peer-pressured children but evidently teenagers are using it before they have sex and are learning to trust each other in the process. Flashing a bit of ankle is a way to test the waters.</p><p>Students are using social media to their advantage, too. Hull University has scrapped freshers' week, having realised that most undergraduates no longer want to endure endless drinking games and groping dances to get to know each other.</p><p>They now find their interest groups online before they arrive and even choose their clubs, whether it's rugby, drama or the LGBTQ+ society. They'd rather make friends over a coffee, on the sports pitch, or in yoga classes.</p><p>Social media is increasingly seen by adults as heralding a dystopian future in which everyone is locked in their rooms: obese, lonely and glued to their screens. In some ways, though, social media is making teenagers more responsible and outgoing than their parents' generation.</p><p>Yesterday Ofcom, the communications regulator, claimed that one in five Britons have been harmed by the online world, chiefly through cyberbullying, harassment or fraud. Sharon White, Ofcom's chief executive, is right that powerful platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should be better regulated, but we shouldn't regard social media itself as the enemy.</p><p>The Circle, a reality TV show that began on Channel 4 last night, has already been criticised for trivialising the way that social media undermines society. Contestants aren't allowed to meet each other, even though they live in the same building, and can only communicate and \"like\" each other online.</p><p>Not all online interaction is pernicious. The computer game Fortnite is quite social for most children, allowing them to chat to classmates after school and form virtual gangs of friends (even if it does contribute to divorce among some grown-up addicts). It needs to be monitored by parents, but unless adults are prepared to provide more youth clubs, after-school activities and attention, they should back off.</p><p>Minecraft is another cult game that helps create budding architects and engineers without the need for Lego. Children who live miles from their grandparents can use Facebook to update them. Instagram is too curated, but the younger generation is becoming more honest on it - the best Instagrammers and vloggers show themselves with spots and in tears as real people. Teenagers doing exams can use Twitter to see how hard everyone else found the biology GCSE with its ridiculous question on carrots.</p><p>Social media and the internet are also increasingly working for pensioners who once had to rely on little more than a red panic button hanging round their neck. It is not more money that the NHS and our social care system needs but more innovation. One elderly woman has taught her Alexa device to bark like a dog when the front door is opened, so that she can feel safe in her home.</p><p>Mumsnet has helped new mothers but is now chastised for putting them off childbirth with lurid discussion threads about the risks of a natural birth as opposed to a caesarean. It is easy to forget how lonely young mothers once felt, stuck at home with tiny children and no access to conversation with women in the same boat.</p><p>Banning iPhones and iPads, as the health secretary Matt Hancock does with his children, or going \"scroll free\" for September as some adults are doing, isn't the solution; it's working out how to use devices for gain not pain and how to set boundaries for users and providers.</p><p>The big tech companies need to behave more responsibly and contributors shouldn't be allowed to hide behind anonymity any more - this virtual world is now part of our lives, not a fantasy. The Circle would be a fascinating insight into this brave new world if it didn't allow contestants to falsify who they are, but it has been created with the intention to cause trouble, strife and drama.

According to a British Pregnancy Advisory Service survey, 16 to 18-year-olds now prefer to send flirty messages from their phones and delay having a physical relationship until they feel ready. Instead of worrying that they might be blackmailed over the content, they view it as a safer, more relaxed form of dating.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'd always thought sexting was for dodgy American politicians and naive, peer-pressured children but evidently teenagers are using it to court before they have sex and are learning to trust each other in the process. Flashing a bit of ankle is a way to test the waters.</p><p>Students are using social media to their advantage, too. Hull University has scrapped freshers' week, having realised that most undergraduates no longer want to endure endless drinking games and groping dances to get to know each other.</p><p>They now find their interest groups online before they arrive and even choose their clubs, whether it's rugby, drama or the LGBTQ+ society. They'd rather make friends over a coffee, on the sports pitch, or in yoga classes.</p><p>Social media is increasingly seen by adults as heralding a dystopian future in which everyone is locked in their rooms: obese, lonely and glued to their screens. In some ways, though, social media is making teenagers more responsible and outgoing than their parents' generation.</p><p>Yesterday Ofcom, the communications regulator, claimed that one in five Britons have been harmed by the online world, chiefly through cyberbullying, harassment or fraud. Sharon White, Ofcom's chief executive, is right that powerful platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should be better regulated, but we shouldn't regard social media itself as the enemy.</p><p>The Circle, a reality TV show that began on Channel 4 last night, has already been criticised for trivialising the way that social media undermines society. Contestants aren't allowed to meet each other, even though they live in the same building, and can only communicate and \"like\" each other online.</p><p>Not all online interaction is pernicious. The computer game Fortnite is quite social for most children, allowing them to chat to classmates after school and form virtual gangs of friends (even if it does contribute to divorce among some grown-up addicts). It needs to be monitored by parents, but unless adults are prepared to provide more youth clubs, after-school activities and attention, they should back off.</p><p>Minecraft is another cult game that helps create budding architects and engineers without the need for Lego. Children who live miles from their grandparents can use Facebook to update them. Instagram is too curated, but the younger generation is becoming more honest on it - the best Instagrammers and vloggers show themselves with spots and in tears as real people. Teenagers doing exams can use Twitter to see how hard everyone else found the biology GCSE with its ridiculous question on carrots.</p><p>Social media and the internet are also increasingly working for pensioners who once had to rely on little more than a red panic button hanging round their neck. It is not more money that the NHS and our social care system needs but more innovation. One elderly woman has taught her Alexa device to bark like a dog when the front door is opened, so that she can feel safe in her own home.</p><p>Mumsnet has helped new mothers but is now chastised for putting them off childbirth with lurid discussion threads about the risks of a natural birth as opposed to a caesarean. It is easy to forget how lonely young mothers once felt, stuck at home with tiny children and no access to conversation with women in the same boat.</p><p>Banning iPhones and iPads, as the health secretary Matt Hancock does with his children, or going \"scroll free\" for September as some adults are doing, isn't the solution; it's working out how to use devices for gain not pain and how to set boundaries for users and providers.</p><p>The big tech companies need to behave more responsibly and contributors shouldn't be allowed to hide behind anonymity any more - this virtual world is now part of our lives, not a fantasy.</p><p>The Circle would be a fascinating insight into this brave new world if it didn't allow contestants to falsify who they are, but it has been created with the intention to cause trouble, strife and drama. Twitter is too negative with its trolls and Instagram too positive but with sensible use and better monitoring they can be effective, informative and entertaining.</p><p>New tech is a means to an end, whether that involves delaying sex for teenagers, using fitness trackers to help us exercise more, academics and professionals sharing links, or giving older people the means to feel reconnected to community and family.</p><p>In Steven Spielberg's film Ready Player One the hero Parzival takes control of the Oasis, a virtual gaming world, and shuts it down on Tuesdays and Thursdays to force everyone to spend more time in real life. We don't need to be that draconian. We just need to apply the same standards of behaviour online as we do offline.</p><p>Fortnite allows children to form virtual gangs of friends online</p><p>The Circle ought to be a fascinating insight into a brave new world</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-141730061</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T97-K2H1-DYTY-C1NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"883\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 19, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>PREGNANCY ADVISORY SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

According to a British Pregnancy Advisory Service survey, 16 to 18-year-olds now prefer to send flirty messages from their phones and delay having a physical relationship until they feel ready. Instead of worrying that they might be blackmailed over the content, they view it as a safer, more relaxed form of dating.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'd always thought sexting was for dodgy American politicians and naive, peer-pressured children but evidently teenagers are using it to court before they have sex and are learning to trust each other in the process. Flashing a bit of ankle is a way to test the waters.</p><p>Students are using social media to their advantage, too. Hull University has scrapped freshers' week, having realised that most undergraduates no longer want to endure endless drinking games and groping dances to get to know each other.</p><p>They now find their interest groups online before they arrive and even choose their clubs, whether it's rugby, drama or the LGBTQ+ society. They'd rather make friends over a coffee, on the sports pitch, or in yoga classes.</p><p>Social media is increasingly seen by adults as heralding a dystopian future in which everyone is locked in their rooms: obese, lonely and glued to their screens. In some ways, though, social media is making teenagers more responsible and outgoing than their parents' generation.</p><p>Yesterday Ofcom, the communications regulator, claimed that one in five Britons have been harmed by the online world, chiefly through cyberbullying, harassment or fraud. Sharon White, Ofcom's chief executive, is right that powerful platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should be better regulated, but we shouldn't regard social media itself as the enemy.</p><p>                     The Circle, a reality TV show that began on Channel 4 last night, has already been criticised for trivialising the way that social media undermines society. Contestants aren't allowed to meet each other, even though they live in the same building, and can only communicate and \"like\" each other online.</p><p>Not all online interaction is pernicious. The computer game Fortnite is quite social for most children, allowing them to chat to classmates after school and form virtual gangs of friends (even if it does contribute to divorce among some grown-up addicts). It needs to be monitored by parents, but unless adults are prepared to provide more youth clubs, after-school activities and attention, they should back off.</p><p>Minecraft is another cult game that helps create budding architects and engineers without the need for Lego. Children who live miles from their grandparents can use Facebook to update them. Instagram is too curated, but the younger generation is becoming more honest on it - the best Instagrammers and vloggers show themselves with spots and in tears as real people. Teenagers doing exams can use Twitter to see how hard everyone else found the biology GCSE with its ridiculous question on carrots.</p><p>Social media and the internet are also increasingly working for pensioners who once had to rely on little more than a red panic button hanging round their neck. It is not more money that the NHS and our social care system needs but more innovation. One elderly woman has taught her Alexa device to bark like a dog when the front door is opened, so that she can feel safe in her own home.</p><p>Mumsnet has helped new mothers but is now chastised for putting them off childbirth with lurid discussion threads about the risks of a natural birth as opposed to a caesarean. It is easy to forget how lonely young mothers once felt, stuck at home with tiny children and no access to conversation with women in the same boat.</p><p>Banning iPhones and iPads, as the health secretary Matt Hancock does with his children, or going \"scroll free\" for September as some adults are doing, isn't the solution; it's working out how to use devices for gain not pain and how to set boundaries for users and providers.</p><p>The big tech companies need to behave more responsibly and contributors shouldn't be allowed to hide behind anonymity any more - this virtual world is now part of our lives, not a fantasy.</p><p>                     The Circle would be a fascinating insight into this brave new world if it didn't allow contestants to falsify who they are, but it has been created with the intention to cause trouble, strife and drama. Twitter is too negative with its trolls and Instagram too positive but with sensible use and better monitoring they can be effective, informative and entertaining.</p><p>New tech is a means to an end, whether that involves delaying sex for teenagers, using fitness trackers to help us exercise more, academics and professionals sharing links, or giving older people the means to feel reconnected to community and family.</p><p>In Steven Spielberg's film Ready Player One the hero Parzival takes control of the Oasis, a virtual gaming world, and shuts it down on Tuesdays and Thursdays to force everyone to spend more time in real life. We don't need to be that draconian. We just need to apply the same standards of behaviour online as we do offline.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-47446514</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T96-V111-JCJY-G4X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"874\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 19, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

According to a British Pregnancy Advisory Service survey, 16 to 18-year-olds now prefer to send flirty messages from their phones and delay having a physical relationship until they feel ready. Instead of worrying that they might be blackmailed over the content, they view it as a safer, more relaxed form of dating.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'd always thought sexting was for dodgy American politicians and naive, peer-pressured children but evidently teenagers are using it to court before they have sex and are learning to trust each other in the process. Flashing a bit of ankle is a way to test the waters.</p><p>Students are using social media to their advantage, too. Hull University has scrapped freshers' week, having realised that most undergraduates no longer want to endure endless drinking games and groping dances to get to know each other.</p><p>They now find their interest groups online before they arrive and even choose their clubs, whether it's rugby, drama or the LGBTQ+ society. They'd rather make friends over a coffee, on the sports pitch, or in yoga classes.</p><p>Social media is increasingly seen by adults as heralding a dystopian future in which everyone is locked in their rooms: obese, lonely and glued to their screens. In some ways, though, social media is making teenagers more responsible and outgoing than their parents' generation.</p><p>Yesterday Ofcom, the communications regulator, claimed that one in five Britons have been harmed by the online world, chiefly through cyberbullying, harassment or fraud. Sharon White, Ofcom's chief executive, is right that powerful platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should be better regulated, but we shouldn't regard social media itself as the enemy.</p><p>The Circle, a reality TV show that began on Channel 4 last night, has already been criticised for trivialising the way that social media undermines society. Contestants aren't allowed to meet each other, even though they live in the same building, and can only communicate and \"like\" each other online.</p><p>Not all online interaction is pernicious. The computer game Fortnite is quite social for most children, allowing them to chat to classmates after school and form virtual gangs of friends (even if it does contribute to divorce among some grown-up addicts). It needs to be monitored by parents, but unless adults are prepared to provide more youth clubs, after-school activities and attention, they should back off.</p><p>Minecraft is another cult game that helps create budding architects and engineers without the need for Lego. Children who live miles from their grandparents can use Facebook to update them. Instagram is too curated, but the younger generation is becoming more honest on it - the best Instagrammers and vloggers show themselves with spots and in tears as real people. Teenagers doing exams can use Twitter to see how hard everyone else found the biology GCSE with its ridiculous question on carrots.</p><p>Social media and the internet are also increasingly working for pensioners who once had to rely on little more than a red panic button hanging round their neck. It is not more money that the NHS and our social care system needs but more innovation. One elderly woman has taught her Alexa device to bark like a dog when the front door is opened, so that she can feel safe in her own home.</p><p>Mumsnet has helped new mothers but is now chastised for putting them off childbirth with lurid discussion threads about the risks of a natural birth as opposed to a caesarean. It is easy to forget how lonely young mothers once felt, stuck at home with tiny children and no access to conversation with women in the same boat.</p><p>Banning iPhones and iPads, as the health secretary Matt Hancock does with his children, or going \"scroll free\" for September as some adults are doing, isn't the solution; it's working out how to use devices for gain not pain and how to set boundaries for users and providers.</p><p>The big tech companies need to behave more responsibly and contributors shouldn't be allowed to hide behind anonymity any more - this virtual world is now part of our lives, not a fantasy.</p><p>The Circle would be a fascinating insight into this brave new world if it didn't allow contestants to falsify who they are, but it has been created with the intention to cause trouble, strife and drama. Twitter is too negative with its trolls and Instagram too positive but with sensible use and better monitoring they can be effective, informative and entertaining.</p><p>New tech is a means to an end, whether that involves delaying sex for teenagers, using fitness trackers to help us exercise more, academics and professionals sharing links, or giving older people the means to feel reconnected to community and family.</p><p>In Steven Spielberg's film Ready Player One the hero Parzival takes control of the Oasis, a virtual gaming world, and shuts it down on Tuesdays and Thursdays to force everyone to spend more time in real life. We don't need to be that draconian. We just need to apply the same standards of behaviour online as we do offline.</p><p>Fortnite allows children to form virtual gangs of friends online</p><p>The Circle ought to be a fascinating insight into a brave new world</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-141729668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T97-K2H1-DYTY-C21K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"883\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 19, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>PREGNANCY ADVISORY SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Last year, the city allowed dockless electric scooters[1] to beging operating in the city using a light-touch approach to regulation. The result of this experiment in lax regulations was what the mayor of Paris recently declared to be 'anarchy.' Residents began complaining of being afraid of users zipping along sidewalks at high speeds. With many having little experience in using the devices, and even less awareness of the rules about where they could and could not be ridden, the inevitable accidents and anger began building into a backlash. And it didn't help that inevitably, these scooters ended up in heaps on various street corners, creating a shocking image of clutter and indifference. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scooters.jpg?strip=all\">https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scooters.jpg?strip=all</url> At one point, 12 scooter companies were operating in the city. And though not all of them are based in Silicon Valley or even the U.S., these all tend to be lumped together in the minds of locals as part of American-style Big Tech. The city was already grappling with concerns about over-tourism[2] that many attribute to tech platforms such as Instagram and Airbnb. In that context, the scooter chaos seemed to local residents like one more example of how Silicon Valley's culture is willing to stampede over the concerns of others in the race to win at any cost. In recent weeks, however, the city has decided to crack down. At a press conference in late June, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced a series of new regulations, including: $40 fine for anyone failing to park the scooters properly. $153 fine for anyone who rides a scooter on the sidewalk. Speed limit of 20 km/hr. Fees for companies of $56 to operate each scooter up to the first 499 and rising up to $74 for each scooter over 3,000. Most ominous, Hidalgo vowed to whittle the number of operators from 12 to 3 or 2. But it seems an oversaturated market and poor strategies are doing some of that work for her. According to a report in Paris-based financial newspaper Les Echos today[3], at least six of the 12 scooter companies have ceased operations, a situation the paper called a 'massacre.' Such consolidation was inevitable. But many of these companies were also reporting problems with vandalism and damage, likely caused by residents fed up with their ubiquitous presence. The tragedy in all this is that a city like Paris desperately needs, and has been welcoming, new forms of mobility. As a city that sometimes has the highest pollution levels in the world[4], Paris has been trying to reduce the number of cars on the road with some success[5]. Offering, safe and affordable alternatives are crucial to that effort. But the problem, as happened with ride-hailing services, comes when each operator pops up on its own. To make such transitions successful, a city needs to take a system-wide approach to optimize the introduction of new modes, reducing some traditional ones, and reinventing others. Fortunately, in the U.S, there are emerging programs such as the Open Mobility Foundation[6], which is seeking to take this larger, long-term view of rethinking mobility citywide. Instead of being seen as a partner in that desperately needed transition, scooter companies are now viewed with suspicion. That's bad for the companies, bad for the city, and ultimately bad for the citizens who want to keep such big cities livable. Silicon Valley's culture has long taken a binary view of regulation: All government rules are bad and anti-innovation. There is rarely any recognition of the role the right rules can play in building trust and ensuring a reasonably competitive market for some services. The consequence of this hubris has become increasingly clear across a number of markets, impacting companies like Facebook and YouTube who are now scrambling to ask for rules that make their responsibilities clearer in order to clean up the various messes they created. In the case of Paris's mobility meltdown, proper regulation could have avoided this. Now we'll see whether belated regulation can help undo the damage.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Wednesday. It is Wednesday, February 28th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Economic boom. Investors are waiting the second reading on the fourth quarter GDP, it's due out in 30 minutes. We will have the numbers as soon as they hit the tape.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Economists are expecting the GDP to come in and show growth of 2-1/2 percent going into the number. Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading despite a big sell-off yesterday, Dow Industrials expected to be up 20 points at the start, NASDAQ up 13. Here's the damage yesterday, stocks were hit hard with the Dow closing down about 300 points after investors were spooked with Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Paul's comments. He signal the strong economy could lead to further interest rate hikes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: The December meeting, the median participant called for three-rate increases in 2018. Since then what we've seen is incoming data that suggests a strengthening in the economy. We have seen some data that will in my case add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up the target.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And with that markets sold off, global market following suit. FT-100 is up 1-1/2 points in London but the CAC quarante in Paris is down a third of a percent. The DAX Index in Germany down a quarter of a percent. In Asia overnight, right across the board. Markets there taking a cue from Wall Street, Hong Kong, Japan both down 1-1/2 percent. The battle over gun control back in the U.S. as the students in Parkland, Florida return to school today.</p><p>President Trump is set to host a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers as they work to end gun violence. The debate having a major impact on the business world as well. This morning we learned that Dick's Sporting Goods also shaking things up. It says it will no longer sell assault-style rifles, it will require shoppers to be 21 years old to purchase any firearm, regardless of what the local laws say. Then a deal at their doorstep, Amazon putting a ring on it acquiring the smart doorbell maker for $1 billion. What it means for your deliveries coming up this morning.</p><p>Plus this, Pizza Hut gobbling up a slice of the NFL, the details as the company replaces Papa John's as the NFL's official pizza sponsor. All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, former Utah Congresswoman, former House Oversight Committee Chairman and Fox News Contributor, Jason Chaffetz. And the Wall Street Journal's editorial board member, Fox News Contributor, Mary Kissel. Great to see you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: Great news on Pizza Hut.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MARY KISSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I like it --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Papa John's.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You do?</p><p>KISSEL: Yes. Absolutely, there's no contest there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just to let you know on this set, that's blasphemy.</p><p>KISSEL: What?</p><p>MCDOWELL: So -- because again, pizza is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We don't -- we really like homemade pizza where, you know --</p><p>KISSEL: The fancy pizza.</p><p>BARTIROMO: My father had a restaurant, we sold pizza, so we're pizza snobs.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: -- right here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The only question that needs answering is coal fired or wood fired.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what happens when you're a pizza snob. What were you saying, was it pizza-related?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes, yes. Pizza. I don't care. Just put some pizza up here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Still mad about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I miss pancakes day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right. You like that stack we had on yesterday. That was incredible. All right. We got a big show this day and this hour, big hour coming up. White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley is here. A lot of questions for him. Former Republican National Committee Chairman and former Mississippi Governor, Haley Barbour making an appearance, along with the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighing in as well.</p><p>You don't want to miss a moment of it, stay with us for a big hour. And we kick it off here with this. Students in Parkland, Florida returning to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School today, two weeks to the day after 17 students were murdered and teachers, they were gunned down. This comes as a bipartisan group of lawmakers are in Washington meeting with the President to talk about legislative ways to combat gun violence. Blake Burman is covering the story. He's at the White House right now. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. That meeting with lawmakers here at the White House later this afternoon at 3:00, to further the conversation on school safety. This comes as the White House has signaled its support for two different pieces of legislation in response to the Parkland shooting. The first is called STOP School Violence Act, that would reauthorized the Federal grant program. And the second is the Fix NICS bill which would penalize government should they not report criminal records into the background check system. Yesterday, the White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also signaled that more support for legislation could come by week's end.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SNADERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Anything further will come later this week. The President as I've said expects to meet with a number of lawmakers tomorrow from both sides of the aisle and wants some more information about specifics after that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: As you mentioned for the first time since the shooting, students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas Senior High School in Parkland, Florida returning to their classrooms this morning on this program earlier today. Junior Kyle Kashuv said he is not so certain that anything will change at least in the upcoming weeks as it relates to safety at his school.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KYLE KASHUV, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: Sadly I don't think that anything is going to really change in the next coming weeks. I think everything is going to stay the same. I don't think that we're going to have -- the only thing -- the only difference we're going to have increased security by police officers. I don't think that anything specifically other than that will change in the security of other schools.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Meantime, the business fallout is continuing Dick's Sporting Goods making a major announcement this morning saying that they will stop selling all assault-style rifles in their stores along with high-capacity magazines and make sure that whoever buys a gun in their store is at least 21 years old. This comes as lawmakers in the State of New York, Virginia, Ohio, and Alabama are now courting Delta Airlines.</p><p>Maria, you know, the background to this one, Delta pulled some benefits for NRA members after the shooting. Lawmakers in the State of Georgia said that they might yank a tax benefit for Delta. Here at White House, I asked the Press Secretary Sarah Sanders about this yesterday and the White House is not weighing in. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hmm. Well, I mean, it's odd to say this least. Blake, thank you. We're going to keep covering this. Blake Burman is at the White House. Joining us now to continue the conversation is former Mississippi governor, former RNC Chairman now founding partner at BGR Group, Haley Barbour. Governor, it's good to see you, sir. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>HALEY BARBOUR, FOUNDING PARTNER, BGR GROUP: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where do you stand on all this? Dick's Sporting Goods today, one of the largest sports retailers in the country announcing it will stop selling assault fire rifles. Is that significant to you?</p><p>BARBOUR: Well, I mean, it's a -- it's a big industry when you go into a gun store or a sporting goods store, sells guns, you're going to see that these assault-looking rifles are very prominent and when you ask the store owner will say it's because all the customers see it on television, they see it in the movies, and they are enamored of learning more about these -- about these guns. So if Dick's does this, or if Dick's does this, they are going to be turning their back on fair amount of the market and that's a private decision that they have to make as a business decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But isn't it -- isn't it worth having the discussion? I mean, I'm all about freedoms and my rights. I don't want my second amendment rights touched but assault rifles, why do people need assault rifles?</p><p>BARBOUR: Well -- I mean, first of all, there's a huge difference between people in urban areas and people in rural areas.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>BARBOUR: When you get in a rural area, you could be 30 minutes from the nearest deputy sheriff. And if something happens in at your home or in the area where you are, to one of your neighbors, it could be like I say 30 minutes before law enforcement can get there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. That's a fair point.</p><p>BARBOUR: So people need a way to -- need a way to protect themselves, their families and their property. And let's don't kid ourselves, if you're at outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good point.</p><p>BARBOUR: So --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Governor Barbour, I think that what people just want in terms of this gun safety debate is some -- they want evidence-based decisions because people always point to the \"assault weapons ban\" from 1994 to 2002. And if you look at all of the studies done, that ban had a negligible impact on gun crime. Instead those studies point to improved background checks, now that was 18 weapons that these assault weapons were banned for really cosmetic reasons.</p><p>You look at this new assault weapons ban that was introduced by the Democrats in the House and the way they start defining these weapons, they clearly are going after semiautomatic handguns as well. That is clearly the direction and proponents of the second amendment, that's what they've always been worried about and people need to understand that's why there's pushback on broadly banning classes of guns in this country.</p><p>BARBOUR: Well, there's no question that probably there are more semiautomatic handguns in the United States than there are long rifles, because that's the way -- we don't have as many revolvers as we had when I was growing up and more semiautomatic. But you make a very important point, we need to look at everything, we need to look at mental health, mental health is a gigantic issue here and the failures of law enforcement in this case are really mind-boggling. How many times over and over and over was this young man reported and yet nothing was ever done about it.</p><p>Which says -- as the young man said on tape a while ago, we are going to have to harden schools. How much we do it and how we do it, whether President Trump's idea to let schoolteachers be armed. Of course, I'm sure what he means is only ones who want to, only ones who volunteer, only ones that take the training, but even if you do that you're still going to need stronger law enforcement in the schools to protect the people by their soft targets attract this kind of terrible thing like the church in Texas where again, the shooter should have been known and should have never been able to buy a gun but our system broke down, we just got to make our system work better.</p><p>KISSEL: But Governor, Mary Kissel here, it seems to me like the companies are interested in virtue signaling and the politicians the same, you know, it is a complex issue, you mentioned mental health, there is a balance to be struck between the privacy of the individual and the ability to notify law enforcement, that's a nuance sophisticated conversation to have. Is anybody having that conversation?</p><p>BARBOUR: Well, there need to be because if you're -- if you're next door neighbor is a grumpy old man, that doesn't mean he is a threat to society. But if -- but if your next door neighbor behaves like this young boy, this 19-year-old kid did, then absolutely law enforcement or some form of a judicial system needs to come into this, and his rights of privacy do not exceed the right of the public to be safe.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. These are all really important points that you make, Governor. Let me ask you about immigration because ICE is now saying that its agents arrested 150 illegal immigrants in the greater San Francisco Bay area since the weekend. That despite the fact that Oakland's mayor alerted the public to the operation that ICE agents were coming. This comes as a Federal judge in that rejected a legal challenge to the Trump administration's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, essentially giving the project a green light. President Trump tweeted about this this morning, he says, I have decided that sections of the wall the California wants built now will not be built until the wall is approved. Big victory yesterday, the president says with rulings from the courts that allow us to proceed. Our country must have border security. Governor, your reaction, what about the Oakland mayor alerting the illegals that ICE managers were coming for them?</p><p>BARBOUR: Well, I thought almost everything she said was unbelievable. I mean, let's just suppose for the sake of our government, Memphis, Tennessee said we're not going to enforce the civil rights law. I mean, that's what she said, we're not going to enforce the immigration law, she said specifically. It's a Federal law and we don't have to -- we don't have to abide by it. That is -- I mean if that were to happen to the civil rights law this country would be up in arms and rightly so. But this sanctuary city business puts people at risk and it puts people at risk who visit Oakland, California, not just the people that live there. And certainly, there are states' rights in our country, we do have a 10th amendment but the idea that they could just turn up their nose at Federal law -- it's pretty far out if you ask me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I think it's incredible actually. Extraordinary how they get away with that, just ignoring Federal law. It's -- and continues with sanctuary city. Thank you, Governor.</p><p>BARBOUR: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you, sir. Haley Barbour there. Coming up. Amazon knocking on the door for a deal. The technology giant buys smart doorbell maker, Ring. In a deal reportedly valued a billion dollars. How the home security market could change. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Later today the President will join lawmaker honoring America's pastor, the late Billy Graham. Lauren Simonetti with the details. Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Maria. The evangelist will become the fourth private citizen ever to light honor in the capitol rotunda. He joined a very short list which includes Rosa Parks in 2005 and two capital policemen killed in the line of duty, the late preacher's casket will sit in the capital throughout the day as President Trump, members of Congress, and the public pay their respects. His body will then flown back to North Carolina tomorrow.</p><p>Well, buyers plan to acquire Monsanto reportedly clearing a major hurdle. Sources telling Reuters the buyer is set to win conditional E.U. (INAUDIBLE) approval to acquire the world's biggest seed producer, you discussed, Maria, the $62 billion deal with Bayer CEO earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WERNER BAUMANN, CEO, BAYER: We have seen very, very good progress, with -- I know roughly half of the 30 approvals we need, we are in very good discussions I have to say with the European commission making good progress there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Bayer also reporting adjusted fourth quarter core earnings that came in slightly below expectations. Let's show you shares of Monsanto up almost one percent in premarket trading. Bayer shares are up nearly 10 percent from a year ago. There you have it.</p><p>All right. Well, Wal-Mart is trying to reach middle-class session conscious shoppers unveiling for new private label brands to step up its competition with Amazon and Target. Wal-Mart also refreshing the Web site this spring with the focus on fashion plus home furnishing. Wal-Mart shares not moving much in premarket trading but the stock up about 30 percent in the past year.</p><p>Well, Ford is bringing its self-driving cars to the streets of Miami. The cars are going to make deliveries and they're going to taxi passengers. Ford teaming up with Dominos to try delivering pizza in these futuristic vehicles for the time being safety drivers will stay behind the wheel of all of the Ford. Over the last year, Ford shares are down 16 percent.</p><p>But many riders as we talk about autonomous vehicles are nervous about the concept. So the navigation app Waymo is releasing this 360 degree video that shows you what its cars see including the traffic around them with the hope of making you feel more comfortable, gaining your trust. Waymo is owned by parent company Alphabet, those shares up 30 percent over the past year. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you, Lauren. We'll take a break. When we come back, James Comey versus President Trump. The former FBI director's latest jab at the Commander-in-Chief on Twitter. Back in a minute.</p><p>POWELL: Our current framework says that the committee would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation above or below two percent. And I would say that framework is working. Market understands it, we've been -- we've been trying to get up to two percent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was the new chairman of the Federal Reserve Jay Powell yesterday fueling expectancies of inflation and multiple rate increase this year during his Capitol Hill testimony. Markets took a big hit after his upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy . It was down 300 points on the Dow Industrials as you see. This morning futures are stabilizing pointing to a higher opening which happens in about an hour. Joining us right now to talk more about markets and your money, Mahoney Asset Management president, Ken Mahoney. Ken, good to see you.</p><p>KEN MAHONEY, PRESIDENT, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us this morning. What did you take away from Jay Powell's testimony yesterday and its impact on markets and the economy?</p><p>MAHONEY: You know, he really was not hawkish. I know that's the headlines this morning, hawkish, hawkish, he wasn't. You know, we were over bought to begin with, we needed something to shake things up a little bit. So, to me it was not hawkish and, you know, three rate hikes, four rate hikes versus the physical stimulus that's coming. Again, I'll side with the physical stimulus. All the moneys that's coming into companies that they could buy back stock and so forth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So when you look at the backdrop right now, you're talking about earnings and the S&amp;P 500 expected to be up 20 percent, 2018. Economic growth of what, 2-1/2, three percent? We're expecting the GDP number any minute. What's your take on that?</p><p>MAHONEY: Yes. So our take is that things are really going to be -- pretty strong. I think about the buybacks right now, $600 billion of the buy backs this year. So why the Fed may be raising a little bit. Look, this is definitely the clash of the titans, right? This textbook you kind of go through and say, wait a second, fiscal monetary which is going to win? Now, it's going to create more volatility. What was unusual is leading into February. You have 13 months in a row, the market is going up of only three percent drawdown. That's crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MAHONEY: So going forward we have to be a little bit more nimble, there will be volatility but we can actually make volatility to your friend by kind of trading along with that.</p><p>KISSEL: And when you say fiscal stimulus, this differs from the Obama era where the stimulus was really just the Fed goosing the market and government spending that crushed private sector growth. This to me looks more sustainable, doesn't it? Because you actually have a rollback in the red tape, you got the tax cuts encouraging business investment which is what's been lacking for so many years.</p><p>MAHONEY: Right. I mean, can you imagine sitting onboard now, and the question is, what do you do with all this cash? Do we buy back stock, 600 billion buybacks perhaps this year. Do we increase the dividends, do we buy our competitors. Do we -- these are all good decisions.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is decisions towards growth.</p><p>MAHONEY: These are all good decisions that would be made at the board level. It's nice to have that stimulus that we're talking about.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL: Yes. But I just want to clarify that because when Democrats talk about fiscal stimulus, what they mean is we want more government spending, we want more control over the economy and we're going in the opposite direction as the right direction. MAHONEY: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just to back up what you said Journal story today, more than a fifth companies is in the S&amp;P 500 have boosted their dividends to shareholders so far this year, not one is lashed with dividend, that's the first time that's happened in seven years. Pretty incredible.</p><p>KISSEL: Yes. But I guess the question is, are we going to get the kind of business investment that you need to keep this economy growing above three percent?</p><p>MAHONEY: I think so. I mean, look, there's so many -- things are going back-and-forth right now. And right now, it's all about the Fed, (INAUDIBLE) Powell will not be -- he will be in the headlines next week but we all doing his thing and we back to talking about taxes again. So, you know (INAUDIBLE) the focus was about Powell.</p><p>I think he did a tremendous job yesterday talking about growth. And look, I don't think we're going to get into this pickle where we get to better economic numbers and then that's good news for the economy, bad news for the market. I don't think we're going to do that again. Meaning, you know, bad news meaning rates going to go higher. I think we're in good situation where good news for economy is good news force the U.S.'s stocks, and therefore that's a good place.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: What are your concerns about inflation? What are the pivot points in which you get concerned?</p><p>MAHONEY: Yes. We only see that yet, I mean, yes, there's wage growth and the Fed governors are (INAUDIBLE) last week talking about this that there's wage growth that's happening but that really kind of going in the other side of that. We really have not seen much in the way of inflation. And, you know, look, just a couple of years ago we're looking at going to recession perhaps and here are the headlines, talking about this goldilocks environment being little bit too hot. Guess what, I think it will take a little bit too hot, we'll take the 10-year inching up a little bit, we'll take that. Now, look, the opposite is when did the 10 years started going down? What would people be saying, oh no, my gosh, the economy is -- guess what, we're inching up a little bit. The 10-year is telling us and the stock market is telling us, that the growth that lies ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what do you want to do? How do you want to invest here?</p><p>MAHONEY: So I still like the leaders, going into this February sell-off we had, those leaders were Boeing, those leaders were Facebook, Apple, they got crushed those good-buying opportunity coming out the other side. Those are still the winners. Now, we would stay away though from those interest sensitive sectors, home builders have not really bounced since that February drought. Look at homebuilders, auto, those inter-sensitive areas we're not going to go near , we're going to stick with the leaders.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Ken, great to see you.</p><p>MAHONEY: Good to see you as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Ken Mahoney there. We got the GDP right after this after short break. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. We are waiting on the GDP, it is Wednesday, February 28th. Here are your top stories 8:30 a.m. on the Eastern rather. The economy in focus right now, we're watching markets, going into the GDP number an we're going to get that number in about 10 seconds. Economists are expecting growth for the fourth quarter of 2-1/2 percent, that's what we are waiting on and we are watching markets right now trading up ahead of the number, up 15 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 1-1/4 on the S&amp;P 500, and up 17 points on the NASDAQ.</p><p>And the GDP out, 2.5 percent, right in line with expectations on the GDP. The number is exactly what people were expecting. This is the second reading of the fourth-quarter GDP up 2-1/2 percent. Of course, this after markets were rattled yesterday, following testimony from the Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell. His comments suggesting that the central bank may raise interest rates more than three times this year, and that is what sent the Dow Industrials down 300 points yesterday, S&amp;P 500 down 35 points, and the NASDAQ, down 91. We're getting the numbers, and it is right in line with expectations at 2-1/2 percent. The actual versus the estimate of 2-1/2 percent.</p><p>This morning, markets are trading up on this news as you can see just after the number was reported. The market did improve just a bit. Dow Industrials now up 25 points, S&amp;P 500 up 2-1/4, and the NASDAQ up 18 points. Global markets? Well, they are also active this morning. Take a look initially, markets were really taking a cue from Wall Street, and that's similar to what we're seeing right now, no stabilization here. FT- 100 flat, CAC Quarante down a quarter of a percent, DAX Index down a fraction as well. In Asia overnight, declines across the board. Worst performer was Hong Kong and Japan down about 1-1/2 percent apiece.</p><p>The second reading of the fourth-quarter GDP in line with expectations. Let's talk about reaction here. Dagen, this is what we were looking for. I can't imagine. This number is going to upset markets this morning, 2-1/2 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, as long as it's right in line with expectations, and two, Jay, the Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, of what he said yesterday. He is very positive about the growth outlook in part because of the tax reform coming down to Washington. Two good years for the economy at this point. We do not see even market volatility as weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity. He pointed to that. I think that you will also want to watch the 10-year yield because so much of the action in the stock market has been driven by that. But, again, if it didn't come in a little bit hotter in the fourth-quarter, maybe you would have gotten a little -- seen some shaky markets. But this is, again, right in line with expectations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and the markets actually picking up steam here, up 30 points now on the industrial average. Because yesterday, Mary, the worry was, was that the economy is actually too hot. This is sort of those -- one of those Goldilocks numbers, isn't it?</p><p>KISSEL: Yes, but we've been in such an unusual interest rate environment for so long, Maria. I think a lot of investors are just getting used to a normal environment again, and, you know, I have to agree with your last guest, Ken Mahoney, he said that he didn't think Jay Powell's comments were hawkish at all, and I have to agree with him. I mean, yes, three or four rate hikes but it's coming from such a low level, and what we're seeing here is a fairly robust economy, well above two percent, moving towards three percent, perhaps even 3-1/2 percent growth over the next coming quarters. That's good news, that's very, very good news, and a supportive global growth environment on top of that out of Europe and Japan, just something not a lot of people are talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, we should point out that it's 2-1/2 percent which is in line with expectations, but it's down from the earlier estimate which was 2.6 percent.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I still worry about the government spending. I don't think there was any justification to increase by more than 10 percent, domestic discretionary spending. You're going to have a trillion-dollar deficit added on top of that we already have. I don't think there is any justification for that. And it's one part of the economy in the market, that it just shouldn't be going that direction.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And we agree with you, we talk about it repeatedly, that your upping, you're running, even higher deficits, and upping the amount of supply that the -- in terms of borrowing, in terms of the treasury supply at a time when the Federal Reserve which has been a major buyer of treasury and mortgage debt over the last 10 years, is now pulling back from that. And I will say because this is what Ken was talking about, avoiding interest rate sensitive sectors.</p><p>You've had a pretty big drop in new home sales in January and the month prior in December. And you are seeing softening at the local level because mortgage rates are heading up, and that marginal buyer is now locked out of the market because they can't really afford the mortgages that are being offered, and I think that's, well, something to watch particularly as longer term rates move up.</p><p>KISSEL: I mean, essentially, the administration is betting that the tax cut and the benefits from the tax cuts are going to run for a long time, that and also cutting the red tape, that will somehow outrun or at least stave off this interest rate scare that people are so worried about that you're talking about.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The tax reform did reduce the amount of mortgage and interest deduction, you can say.</p><p>KISSEL: Hey, even Warren Buffet is coming around to the -- to the benefits of the tax reform. I never thought you'd see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, he got a huge benefit for his company, didn't he?</p><p>KISSEL: Yes, he sure did. Don't we underestimate the benefit of tax cuts? We always underestimate the benefits.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I agree, I don't think it's going to be, well, it cost a trillion dollars but I do think that there's certain pockets that are good of the economy like housing that are going to get hurt by this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, we should point out that this GDP number is decelerating from what we saw in the third-quarter. I mean, in the third- quarter, we had growth of 3.2 percent. And in the fourth quarter, the initial reading was 2.6 percent. So, anyway you look at it, things have slowed down a bit in the couple of -- in the last couple of months.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But this was before the tax reform goes --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Yes, it was.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, that's before the tax reform and spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, in this -- in this, you will see -- you will see it pick up steam.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We want to -- we want to get the White House reaction to this number. Hogan Gidley is the Deputy White House Press Secretary. He's joining us right now, and of course, we also want to talk about students returning to class at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida exactly two weeks after 17 people were killed. In Washington, the President is set to meet with a bipartisan congressional group on school safety today, trying to make progress on legislation to combat gun violence.</p><p>Joining us right now from the White House, Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley. Hogan, thanks very much for joining us this morning. Before we get into the return to school, let me get your take on what's happening in the economy right now because the GDP is just out, and it shows a growth number of 2.5 percent but that's down from 3-1/4 percent in the third- quarter what's going on, things have decelerated.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Well, they have, but the overall economy is strong, and as I just heard, Dagen, I think pointed out and she's absolutely right, that's before the tax cuts even took effect. We had some massive hurricanes, unprecedented amounts of damage, but also destruction that occurred in so many places across the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wait a second, all of this -- all of this is before the tax plan. We're talking about the fourth-quarter. So, the tax plan went into effect the beginning of '18.</p><p>GIDLEY: But I'm saying -- right, but I'm saying expectations are that that will actually go up, it's still much higher obviously than President Barack Obama's economy which he said 1.9 percent was the new norm. We're on the way up, most economists say we're going to be hovering close to potentially four percent, as this year continues on, and that's where we expect to be. The economy is strong, businesses are coming back to this country, as you well know, consumer confidence is at all-time high, and we expect that to continue to grow even more into the new year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, in terms of economic policy, what are the President's priorities at this point, Hogan? Because, I know that he wants to work on Dodd-Frank, and he's been rolling back regulations in a big way since the start of his presidency. That should add further spice to this market. What's the priority in terms of economic policy in the coming six or eight months?</p><p>GIDLEY: It will, but look, let's talk about those regulations and their rollback. The big way kind of doesn't begin to describe it. Look, he said that he would cut two regulations for every one that he put into place. He far exceeded that, and he's cutting 22 regulations for every one that gets put into place. Obviously, that spurs on consumer confidence but also security and stabilization in business growth, and that's what this President is all about, as you know. And the rapid turnaround of this economy is no coincidence.</p><p>It's because we have someone in office who understands the economy, who's going to push to make this tax cut permanent for individuals as he did with the corporate tax rate cut, but there's a pattern emerging here with this President, and that is he's taking on topics and issues that haven't been addressed in the better part of 30 to 40 years. He's coming in in a year's time, he's accomplishing record-setting things, and recording setting time, and he's growing this economy, something that the government quite frankly, has been crippling under the last eight years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. So, are you expecting movement on Dodd-Frank in the coming few months?</p><p>GIDLEY: We'll see. I don't want to get ahead of what President is going to say or do, but we obviously know that that's what the President wants to be, he wants to eliminate all hindrances to economic well-being in this country. He wants to prop up middle America, as you saw with the tax cuts, it didn't just effect the corporate tax rate that people have been talking about for 30 or 40 years, but it also cut taxes for the middle-income people in this country, and that's where he's going to continuing to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, we're getting a report this morning that the President is looking to roll back the Volcker Rule, for example, and this is a rule, obviously where proprietary trading firms do -- cannot do proprietary trading and just trade for customers but not their own, so is that something that's going to be changed over the near-term, the Volcker Rule.</p><p>GIDLEY: Again, I can't get ahead of what the President is going to say or do. He's going to talk also about trade today. He's going to make some announcements on that as well. That should impact the economy, too, because, look, for far too long, what we've been talking about in this country, politicians as you know, for decades, go out on a campaign trail and what they say is we want free and fair trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GIDLEY: Well, the free trade is always there. It's the fair part that politicians seem to ignore once they get in office. And this President comes in and says, no more. This has been dogging our country for decades. It's going to stop now and it's going to stop on my watch, and so, we'll see what he announces later today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: On trade, is the U.S. going to re-enter TPP.</p><p>GIDLEY: Again, I can't get ahead of what the President is going to say or do, Maria. I appreciate you pushing me that direction but the President has some ideas to how to fix this economy. He's done a masterful job so far and we expect that to continue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hogan, the President obviously has been spending a lot of time on efforts to try to come up with solutions for gun safety, school safety, really. The President is hoping to jumpstart some real action on background checks or other plans. Tell me where that stands right now, and what does need to be done, in terms of background checks?</p><p>GIDLEY: Donald Trump is not just the President of the United States. He's also a father and he's also a grandfather. And what he wants is what everybody in this country wants, which is safety and security for our children when they go to school, that's just the bottom line. Legislation can't just feel good, it actually has to do good. And that's what the President is trying to get to the bottom of now when he's talking to all the relevant stakeholders. The country was privy to a meeting he had with grieving families, from the Parkland shooting, other relative stakeholders from around the Washington, D.C. area, parents, teachers, students --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GIDLEY: -- just pouring out their heart, they were angry, they were upset. They were upset --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No, that was a -- that was a good idea we did the listening session.</p><p>GIDLEY: Right. But they were also hopeful that something would get done. So, the President then went met with local law enforcement, then he met with governors, people who were on the frontlines of all these issues and how they can be impacted at the local level because, as you know, state and federal partnerships are key if we're going to actually accomplish something here. But when he meets with the Congressional leaders today from individual congressional districts, bipartisan, bicameral, they've got to come up with solutions that actually protect children. We can't just talk about it anymore. The American people deserve better.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, is he -- is he prepared to put forth an executive order bypassing Congress to raise the age limit for getting a gun?</p><p>GIDLEY: Well, it depends on what happens after the talks, it depends on what Congress decides to do and also with the local areas decide to do as well. The President sees that there's obviously a gaping hole in security. There was a systematic failure here at every level of government, whether it was the FBI, whether it was the county sheriff, and then the deputy sitting outside the school that were trained and had a gun and still didn't go inside to protect those kids. Obviously, failures exist, the audit continues, and once we get that information, the President will make recommendations this week on what he feels should be done to protect students in our schools.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you make of all these companies waiting into this issue? Dick's Sporting Goods this morning says that it's no longer going to sell automatic-style weapons. It's going to require consumers to be 21 years old to purchase any firearm, regardless of the law of the land, Dick's Sporting Goods says. What do you -- what do you make of the private sector making these changes? Is that legal?</p><p>GIDLEY: Yes, I don't know if it's legal or not, I'm not an attorney, but it doesn't seem to match up with federal law. But I mean, look, we've got states all over the country, deciding to thumb their nose at the federal government and the laws on the books whether it's California and sanctuary cities, for example. But look, these businesses have made decisions based on pressure from outside groups. I guess they have the right to do that, I guess groups have the right to protest, but the bottom line is we have, you know, 6 million gun owners that are members of the NRA that are law-abiding citizens. This President supports the second amendment, supports the NRA and their efforts to keep our country safe. And we have a constitutional right in this country to keep and bear arms. And so, if a business decides that they're going to kowtow to pressure from outside groups, I guess they can do that, but then they're going to have to suffer the consequences should other side come out and put pressure on them as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hogan, let me ask you about that big announcement from the President yesterday, announcing that his digital strategist, Brad Prascale will run the Trump 2020 campaign. Why did the president make this announcement now, telling everybody he is in fact running for re-election?</p><p>GIDLEY: I love you keep asking me questions I really can't talk about. That's a campaign issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why not?</p><p>GIDLEY: Well, it's a campaign issue, I have to refer you over to the campaign to have that discussion. But look, the President is going to have a myriad of successes to run on in the 2020 election. As you know, the Heritage Foundation just put out a survey basically saying that this President has already accomplished 64 percent of his agenda, Ronald Reagan, the standard bearer of our party for a long time and of government success for the Republicans was only at 47 percent at this time. So, as I mentioned before, it's record-setting accomplishments and record-setting time for Donald Trump. And whoever the campaign manager is for this President, they'll have a lot to push moving into the election cycle.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Hogan, great stuff, thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>GIDLEY: Thanks so much, Maria. Have a great day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hogan Gidley joining us there. Thank you. We'll be right back. Back in a minute. Markets at the highs right now up 50 points on the GDP number. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Lowe's under pressure this morning, reporting earnings as well. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. So, we are seeing Lowe's under extreme pressure this morning. We see the Dow Futures higher but Lowe's will be to the downside and likely to be one of the biggest losers here on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, down 70-1/4 percent right now, the quarterly numbers. What happened to Lowe's when Home Depot six quarters in a row beat? Well, Lowe's missed. They missed on their quarterly profit, the growth margin, all a miss. Same-store sales growth going forward to guidance. Well, that's going to slow, too. They said they've been spending a lot in order to fend off big competition, so it's clear at this time that Home Depot is really king in the home improvement retailing.</p><p>And then we take a look at Amazon. Amazon, a new acquisition, and this is Ring. $1 billion. Ring is home security. Everybody has been seeing the commercials or video doorbells, that is the idea, it adds to Blink which is what they got last year. And it takes on some of the other guys. Well, ADT is to the downside this morning. Alphabet's home unit, a home -- smart home security unit. So, if this is just Amazon expanding beyond and now that it'll also contribute to Amazon Key where they actually have a smart lock, and you go in, you have your package or your fresh food drops up. So, that's big acquisition, they're buying the start-up Ring for $1 billion, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Nic, thank you so much. Technology titans facing a boycott for ties to the National Rifles Association. Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighing in. Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. This seems to be three separate things going on here. You have the news this morning that Dick's Sporting Goods is not going to sell these assault-style rifles to anybody under 21. We got that piece of news. I think that's their business, it's their policy. Do as you will, Dick's Sporting Goods. Then there is the Boycott NRA Movement, like against Delta, United Airlines, that kind of thing. I'm worded about that because it's the politicization of business. When I buy a product or a service, I buy according to price and quality, not according to the politics of the company selling me that product or service.</p><p>But the most pernicious attack on free speech, in my opinion, comes from this attempt to silence the NRA on Amazon, Google, Roku, and Apple. Those organizations run videos of the NRA from the NRA, and there is now a serious movement to ban them from all those outlets. That is deliberately stomping on free speech. The left does not like guns, so shut up the NRA. I think that's absolutely flat-out wrong. There is no question.

Jared Max with sports headlines now. Jared?</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER: Good morning, Maria. First time in LeBron's 15-year career, he has averaged a triple-double for every game in one month. Double digits, three statistical categories. LeBron became the oldest player in NBA history to accomplish this eclectic feet when he helped the Cavalier beat the Nets last night, LeBron also the first NBA player to total more than 30,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, 8,000 assists. LeBron thinks the NBA can assist teenage athletes who have the talent to become pro-basketball players but don't feel suited or interested in playing NCAA ball but don't want to go overseas to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEBRON JAMES, AMERICAN BASKETBALL PLAYER: NCAA is historic. We know it. I'm sorry. It's going to make headlines that (INAUDIBLE) sign at 14 but they get put into this farm system where they'll able to grow and be around other professionals for three or four years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: LeBron says the NCAA is corrupt. Wants to see the NBA create a farm system.</p><p>Move over Papa John's, here comes Pizza Hut. The new official sponsor of the NFL for pizza. Multi-year deal includes collected use of 32 NFL team trademarks to facilitate local exclusive team partnerships. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says, we're thrilled to have Pizza Hut as a partner.</p><p>Let's take a look at Pizza Hut's parent Yum! Brands on the stock board. Now, Pizza Hut assumes Papa John's role as the official pizza of the NFL. Papa John's came under fire last season when the company founder John Schnatter suggested sales were down because of the NFL's mishandling of players kneeling for the anthem. The two mutually decided to part ways yesterday.</p><p>As Major League Baseball rosters fill out with younger, less expensive talent, some high-priced free agents are still looking for work. And so, the players association has filed a grievance against four baseball teams: the Marlins, the Rays, the Pirates, and the A's. All accused of failing to appropriately spend revenue sharing money to improve their clubs.</p><p>Hey, do you see the mascots that were chosen for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo? Students from 16,769 elementary schools in Japan chose the mascots and the winner was drawn by a graduate of Cabrillo College in California, Ryo Taniguchi. One student who voted for the design said it looks futuristic but also represents Japan traditions. Some of the (INAUDIBLE) that didn't quite make the cut are these guys. Plus, it could work as Olympic mascots.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cool. What are you expecting from Tokyo 2020?</p><p>MAX: Hopefully, a little bit more fun and less controversy than these Olympics. Where it's just strictly about the game and maybe two years from now, we get to a different point where people can make comments about each other and we keep the politics outside of sports.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did you watch it?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes. You did, we did.</p><p>KISSEL: I love the Olympics. Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. OK.</p><p>KISSEL: Watch it every year.

And with even establishment conservatives like Sens. Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney eschewing Parler for now, Trump supporters worry that Parler\u2019s influencers will be preaching to a MAGA choir forever.    \u201cThe question is not pure engagement. The question is influence,\u201d said Will Chamberlain, the editor-in-chief of the populist magazine Human Events. \u201cTwitter is interesting because there\u2019s so many people, prominent people, that can be influenced. Parler is not that.\u201d    Regardless, Parler is rapidly growing: In the past week alone, Parler\u2019s user base has grown from 1 million to 1.5 million users, according to a CNBC interview with Matze. And given the number of conservative influencers on the site \u2014 as well as a robust presence of conservative outlets, which don\u2019t have to worry about social media companies shutting off their traffic spigots \u2014 there is potential for the site to grow a decently sized conservative audience.    Adopters have found benefits to the Twitter alternative: It isn\u2019t lousy with white nationalists, like the niche social media site Gab; it has a better user interface than the encrypted messaging service Telegraph; and its commitment to making both sides equally heard is heaven to the ears of people constantly worried that Big Tech, their so-called liberal nemesis, is about to deplatform them.    However, Parler\u2019s user base is still dwarfed by Twitter, which has over 300 million active users , and Facebook, with 2.6 billion active users . Even Parler\u2019s frequent surge in new users may not be indicative of sustained growth and relevance. Google+ \u2014 Google\u2019s attempt to launch a Facebook competitor \u2014 similarly surged in users before flaming out quickly. And Parler had several unexpected technical hiccups during its initial launch, such as when Owens announced that she was joining in 2018 and swamped the companies\u2019 servers with 40,000 new followers.    Moreover, conservative attempts to clone pre-existing internet behemoths \u2014 Conservapedia, Conservative Fact Check, the infinite attempts to make a Facebook clone \u2014 have rarely, if ever, produced an actual winner.    \u201cEvery time conservatives try to build the conservative MoveOn or the conservative YouTube or the conservative \u2026. whatever, it never works,\u201d said Matt Lewis, a Trump-critical conservative columnist at the Daily Beast. \u201cThis feels like an attempt to recreate the conservative version of Twitter. Maybe it will work out this time, but the track record isn\u2019t good.\u201d     But even if the site grows, the element Parler will find difficult to replicate is Twitter\u2019s vast variety of communities, celebrities, and influencers \u2014 particularly if they didn\u2019t feel inclined to join what\u2019s increasingly known as a MAGA platform.    Much of Twitter\u2019s draw, after all, is seeing high-profile people from different ideological backgrounds go after each other. If, for instance, Donald Trump Jr. leaves Twitter for Parler, he won\u2019t be able to get into a real-time social media war with progressive Twitter darling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Nor could Trump himself \u2014 the white whale of Parler, who has yet to join the site \u2014 direct his nearly 83 million followers to spam the account of a Hollywood celebrity or a Democrat politician who criticized him.    \u201cUntil those people start getting on, I think it\u2019s going to be insular,\u201d said Jack Posobiec, a MAGA personality, former Pizzagate proponent and a correspondent for the pro-Trump One America News Network. \u201cAnd that\u2019s okay. People do like to be able to feel safe. People kind of feel like they\u2019re at a party right now. But the energy of Twitter comes from having different communities on it. And that that energy isn\u2019t there right now. Right now, Parler feels like a Trump rally.\u201d    Chamberlain said Parler seems like an easy-out solution to what was ultimately conservatives\u2019 biggest internet problem: their perceived censorship on the platforms with the biggest audiences.    \u201cThere are a lot of libertarian-leaning legislators who find that really appealing because they don\u2019t like the idea of using government to regulate big tech,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can say, \u2018Oh, look at Parler. We don\u2019t need to do anything, everybody should just move over to Parler.\u2019\u201d    For now, Parler is the hot new thing on the right, populated by a growing number of right-wing celebrities, right-wing fans and people who would like to troll both of these constituencies by creating fake accounts in their names. The trolls, Posobiec said, are \u201ca weird sort of sign of a healthy online digital commons, because that\u2019s sort of the sign that people from the other side are getting on.\u201d    But unless real political and ideological opponents follow them off Twitter and go on Parler, the site will be little more than a perpetual Trump party where everyone can yammer all day about how Trump is the best, with no pushback.    \u201cI would love to be able to leave for Parler,\u201d said Chamberlain. \u201cI would love to ignore Twitter, but my job isn\u2019t just getting engagement. My job is influencing public conversation, the way I see it. And I need Twitter for that.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42530052970</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6096-58Y1-F07F-84HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"937\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TheLiveFeeds.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 6, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump\u2019s high-profile Fox News allies are flocking to Parler, the purported unbiased alternative to Twitter \u2014 and the MAGA internet isn\u2019t crazy about it.    Over the past few weeks, spurred by Twitter\u2019s attempts to moderate Trump\u2019s tweets, Reddit\u2019s decision to ban a massive pro-Trump subreddit, and the bans coming down on figures like meme creator Logan \u201cCarpe Donktum\u201d Cook, several high-profile conservatives and Trump allies have created accounts on Parler, assured that they can basically say whatever they would like without being booted off the platform. Even better, they were joining a large community of MAGA influencers who have been on Parler since its launch in December of 2018, from the mainstream \u2014 Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens, for instance \u2014 to the fringe figures who\u2019d been banned from Twitter, such as Jacob Wohl, Laura Loomer and Milo Yiannopoulous.      But to these early adopters \u2014 many of whom still have their social media accounts on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, with massive followings on each \u2014 the sudden presence of GOP figures has caused concern that the social media platform may just become a right-wing version of the \u201csafe space\u201d culture they widely mock, with plenty of MAGA stars but few big names from across the ideological spectrum.     The MAGAfication problem is so bad that CEO and founder John Matze has openly begged progressive pundits to join the platform, offering a \u201cprogressive bounty\u201d of $20,000 to any left-wing influencer with a following of 50,000 or more users on Twitter who makes an account. And with even establishment conservatives like Sens. Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney eschewing Parler for now, Trump supporters worry that Parler\u2019s influencers will be preaching to a MAGA choir forever.    \u201cThe question is not pure engagement. The question is influence,\u201d said Will Chamberlain, the editor-in-chief of the populist magazine Human Events. \u201cTwitter is interesting because there's so many people, prominent people, that can be influenced. Parler is not that.\u201d    Regardless, Parler is rapidly growing: In the past week alone, Parler\u2019s user base has grown from 1 million to 1.5 million users, according to a CNBC interview with Matze. And given the number of conservative influencers on the site \u2014 as well as a robust presence of conservative outlets, which don\u2019t have to worry about social media companies shutting off their traffic spigots \u2014 there is potential for the site to grow a decently sized conservative audience.    Adopters have found benefits to the Twitter alternative: It isn\u2019t lousy with white nationalists, like the niche social media site Gab; it has a better user interface than the encrypted messaging service Telegraph; and its commitment to making both sides equally heard is heaven to the ears of people constantly worried that Big Tech, their so-called liberal nemesis, is about to deplatform them.       However, Parler\u2019s user base is still dwarfed by Twitter, which has over 300 million active users , and Facebook, with 2.6 billion active users . Even Parler\u2019s frequent surge in new users may not be indicative of sustained growth and relevance. Google+ \u2014 Google\u2019s attempt to launch a Facebook competitor \u2014 similarly surged in users before flaming out quickly. And Parler had several unexpected technical hiccups during its initial launch, such as when Owens announced that she was joining in 2018 and swamped the companies\u2019 servers with 40,000 new followers.    Moreover, conservative attempts to clone pre-existing internet behemoths \u2014 Conservapedia, Conservative Fact Check, the infinite attempts to make a Facebook clone \u2014 have rarely, if ever, produced an actual winner.    \u201cEvery time conservatives try to build the conservative MoveOn or the conservative YouTube or the conservative \u2026. whatever, it never works,\u201d said Matt Lewis, a Trump-critical conservative columnist at the Daily Beast. \u201cThis feels like an attempt to recreate the conservative version of Twitter. Maybe it will work out this time, but the track record isn\u2019t good.\u201d    But even if the site grows, the element Parler will find difficult to replicate is Twitter\u2019s vast variety of communities, celebrities, and influencers \u2014 particularly if they didn\u2019t feel inclined to join what\u2019s increasingly known as a MAGA platform.    Much of Twitter\u2019s draw, after all, is seeing high-profile people from different ideological backgrounds go after each other. If, for instance, Donald Trump Jr. leaves Twitter for Parler, he won\u2019t be able to get into a real-time social media war with progressive Twitter darling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Nor could Trump himself \u2014 the white whale of Parler, who has yet to join the site \u2014 direct his nearly 83 million followers to spam the account of a Hollywood celebrity or a Democrat politician who criticized him.       \u201cUntil those people start getting on, I think it\u2019s going to be insular,\u201d said Jack Posobiec, a MAGA personality, former Pizzagate proponent and a correspondent for the pro-Trump One America News Network. \u201cAnd that\u2019s okay. People do like to be able to feel safe. People kind of feel like they\u2019re at a party right now. But the energy of Twitter comes from having different communities on it. And that that energy isn't there right now. Right now, Parler feels like a Trump rally.\u201d    Chamberlain said Parler seems like an easy-out solution to what was ultimately conservatives\u2019 biggest internet problem: their perceived censorship on the platforms with the biggest audiences.    \u201cThere are a lot of libertarian-leaning legislators who find that really appealing because they don\u2019t like the idea of using government to regulate big tech,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can say, \u2018Oh, look at Parler. We don't need to do anything, everybody should just move over to Parler.\u2019\u201d    For now, Parler is the hot new thing on the right, populated by a growing number of right-wing celebrities, right-wing fans and people who would like to troll both of these constituencies by creating fake accounts in their names. The trolls, Posobiec said, are \u201ca weird sort of sign of a healthy online digital commons, because that\u2019s sort of the sign that people from the other side are getting on.\u201d    But unless real political and ideological opponents follow them off Twitter and go on Parler, the site will be little more than a perpetual Trump party where everyone can yammer all day about how Trump is the best, with no pushback.    \u201cI would love to be able to leave for Parler,\u201d said Chamberlain. \u201cI would love to ignore Twitter, but my job isn\u2019t just getting engagement.

And with even establishment conservatives like Sens. Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney eschewing Parler for now, Trump supporters worry that Parler\u2019s influencers will be preaching to a MAGA choir forever.    \u201cThe question is not pure engagement. The question is influence,\u201d said Will Chamberlain, the editor-in-chief of the populist magazine Human Events. \u201cTwitter is interesting because there\u2019s so many people, prominent people, that can be influenced. Parler is not that.\u201d    Regardless, Parler is rapidly growing: In the past week alone, Parler\u2019s user base has grown from 1 million to 1.5 million users, according to a CNBC interview with Matze. And given the number of conservative influencers on the site \u2014 as well as a robust presence of conservative outlets, which don\u2019t have to worry about social media companies shutting off their traffic spigots \u2014 there is potential for the site to grow a decently sized conservative audience.    Adopters have found benefits to the Twitter alternative: It isn\u2019t lousy with white nationalists, like the niche social media site Gab; it has a better user interface than the encrypted messaging service Telegraph; and its commitment to making both sides equally heard is heaven to the ears of people constantly worried that Big Tech, their so-called liberal nemesis, is about to deplatform them.    However, Parler\u2019s user base is still dwarfed by Twitter, which has over 300 million active users , and Facebook, with 2.6 billion active users . Even Parler\u2019s frequent surge in new users may not be indicative of sustained growth and relevance. Google+ \u2014 Google\u2019s attempt to launch a Facebook competitor \u2014 similarly surged in users before flaming out quickly. And Parler had several unexpected technical hiccups during its initial launch, such as when Owens announced that she was joining in 2018 and swamped the companies\u2019 servers with 40,000 new followers.    Moreover, conservative attempts to clone pre-existing internet behemoths \u2014 Conservapedia, Conservative Fact Check, the infinite attempts to make a Facebook clone \u2014 have rarely, if ever, produced an actual winner.    \u201cEvery time conservatives try to build the conservative MoveOn or the conservative YouTube or the conservative \u2026. whatever, it never works,\u201d said Matt Lewis, a Trump-critical conservative columnist at the Daily Beast. \u201cThis feels like an attempt to recreate the conservative version of Twitter. Maybe it will work out this time, but the track record isn\u2019t good.\u201d     But even if the site grows, the element Parler will find difficult to replicate is Twitter\u2019s vast variety of communities, celebrities, and influencers \u2014 particularly if they didn\u2019t feel inclined to join what\u2019s increasingly known as a MAGA platform.    Much of Twitter\u2019s draw, after all, is seeing high-profile people from different ideological backgrounds go after each other. If, for instance, Donald Trump Jr. leaves Twitter for Parler, he won\u2019t be able to get into a real-time social media war with progressive Twitter darling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Nor could Trump himself \u2014 the white whale of Parler, who has yet to join the site \u2014 direct his nearly 83 million followers to spam the account of a Hollywood celebrity or a Democrat politician who criticized him.    \u201cUntil those people start getting on, I think it\u2019s going to be insular,\u201d said Jack Posobiec, a MAGA personality, former Pizzagate proponent and a correspondent for the pro-Trump One America News Network. \u201cAnd that\u2019s okay. People do like to be able to feel safe. People kind of feel like they\u2019re at a party right now. But the energy of Twitter comes from having different communities on it. And that that energy isn\u2019t there right now. Right now, Parler feels like a Trump rally.\u201d    Chamberlain said Parler seems like an easy-out solution to what was ultimately conservatives\u2019 biggest internet problem: their perceived censorship on the platforms with the biggest audiences.    \u201cThere are a lot of libertarian-leaning legislators who find that really appealing because they don\u2019t like the idea of using government to regulate big tech,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can say, \u2018Oh, look at Parler. We don\u2019t need to do anything, everybody should just move over to Parler.\u2019\u201d    For now, Parler is the hot new thing on the right, populated by a growing number of right-wing celebrities, right-wing fans and people who would like to troll both of these constituencies by creating fake accounts in their names. The trolls, Posobiec said, are \u201ca weird sort of sign of a healthy online digital commons, because that\u2019s sort of the sign that people from the other side are getting on.\u201d    But unless real political and ideological opponents follow them off Twitter and go on Parler, the site will be little more than a perpetual Trump party where everyone can yammer all day about how Trump is the best, with no pushback.    \u201cI would love to be able to leave for Parler,\u201d said Chamberlain. \u201cI would love to ignore Twitter, but my job isn\u2019t just getting engagement. My job is influencing public conversation, the way I see it. And I need Twitter for that.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42530060130</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6096-58Y1-F07F-84J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"937\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TheLiveFeeds.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 6, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

About 100,000 people joined Parler on Tuesday alone, according to Parler CEO John Matze, bringing its total daily active users toward 1.5 million on Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The surge in interest is an accomplishment, but it falls short of the hordes gathering on Twitter and Facebook. By comparison, Twitter reported having 166 million daily active users in the first quarter of 2020. Facebook boasted 1.73 billion daily active users during the same timeframe.</p><p> Mr. Matze called Twitter and Facebook \"techno-fascists\" and vowed to dethrone them.</p><p> \"The only thing keeping them alive at this point, in my opinion, is the controversy around the 2016 election going into 2020 with Donald Trump and the amount of free airtime that Twitter gets every day on every news network and every shoutout on every website,\" Mr. Matze said.</p><p> The Parler platform is not strictly for conservatives and castaways from other platforms but for people who believe in the principles of free speech and data privacy, the company says.</p><p> Mr. Matze describes the platform as ideological and not political.</p><p> Many of the newest 100,000 Parler users arrived alongside @CarpeDonktum, a prominent pro-Trump voice who had more than 270,000 followers before Twitter banned him this week. When @CarpeDonktum migrated to Parler, he said he was permanently suspended by Twitter for a meme that violated copyright infringement policies.</p><p>Twitter told The Washington Times that @CarpeDonktum was permanently banned for repeated violations of copyright law.</p><p> The most recent complaint against the account was brought by Jukin Media, which objected to a video posted by @CarpeDonktum that was shared by the president and that mocked CNN for allegedly perceiving racism among toddlers, according to Harvard University's Lumen Database.</p><p> Parler welcomed @CarpeDonktum, just as it has accepted more controversial personalities including far-right provocateurs Alex Jones and Laura Loomer following their deplatforming elsewhere. Other prominent users include Sens. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, and Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Andy Biggs, Arizona Republican and chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus.</p><p> Parler is based in Las Vegas, with a staff of about 20 full-time employees, but Mr. Matze said he is hiring rapidly to meet the new demand. While the app went live in 2018, Mr. Matze said its formal launch was linked to the 2020 Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington.</p><p> As his platform expands, Mr. Matze said he anticipates growing pains that come with rapid growth and more engaged users.</p><p> \"Even the biggest platforms in the world will have scaling troubles if everybody gets on at once, but if we continue at the pace that we're going, everything should be smooth,\" Mr. Matze said. \"If Donald Trump went out tomorrow and said, 'I'm on Parler,' I think that'd be a problem.\"</p><p> The political left appears content to let conservatives socially distance themselves from larger social media platforms, and Parler knows that presents a challenge.</p><p> Mr. Matze said he has had more difficulty courting liberal users, but he thinks Parler's pitch will attract liberals who share the viewpoints that they ought to own their digital profiles as personal property and that they should opt-in to view content rather than have trending topics foisted upon them.</p><p> \"We're having trouble getting people from the left on,\" Mr. Matze said. \"We've announced a $20,000 bounty for any blue-check-marked Twitter figure with at least 50,000 followers who identifies as a progressive to come on to Parler.\"</p><p> While some of Parler's newest members support the populist right's Big Tech regulation proposals, Parler stands opposed to regulation of any sort. When asked about Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley's proposal to withdraw legal protections to social media companies that the government deems to have misbehaved, Mr. Matze said he has not seen any legislative proposals involving Big Tech regulation and free speech that make any sense.</p><p> Opponents of regulating the tech companies have applauded Parler's emergence as a competitor that can threaten other social media companies' grip on the marketplace.</p><p> The Electronic Frontier Foundation's Aaron Mackey said he is not familiar with Parler's business model but he views a new competitor as healthy for the social media sector. Mr. Mackey said new regulatory proposals aimed at reining in tech could hurt companies such as Parler.</p><p> \"The Googles, the Facebooks and the Twitters of the world are going to be able to comply with whatever new standard you throw at them, they'll be able to litigate all of the cases away, they'll just throw money at the problem,\" Mr. Mackey said. \"New entrants, those who would cater to a different view or to a broader spectrum of the population and perhaps serve as real competition to these platforms, won't get off the ground because they'll be subject to the crippling liability and other regulatory regimes envisioned by these proposals that no new entrant can reasonably meet.\"</p><p> Rather than look to government to solve the problems Big Tech has created, the political right should look to the private sector for solutions, said Jesse Blumenthal, Stand Together vice president and Charles Koch Institute director of technology and innovation. Mr. Blumenthal warned against overestimating major social media companies' dominance as permanent, though he noted other digital platforms such as Gab have attempted to compete with tech giants and attracted conservatives in the past with limited accomplishments.</p><p> \"There are a handful of these platforms that exist and I think that it's good that there are competitors in the marketplace,\" Mr. Blumenthal said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-17BD682623A8A980</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6071-HSR1-JBCN-418F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1008\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>26 June 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The gains -- good gains -- of the day evaporated near the afternoon. But it is holding on and if no damage is done, it will be positive on the close. Put it together, together we understand the markets on Tuesday, the 26th of March. Parliament is seizing control of Brexit. Tonight, you will hear from lawmakers, businesses and voters on all sides of this debate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One does not simply crack down on memes. A sweeping new copyright law angers European internet users and companies as well. There is a crisis of confidence in the cockpit, a new report shows just how little time the pilots of the doomed Boeing 737 MAX had to react.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight we are live outside the Houses of Parliament in London. I am Richard Quest, and, of course, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening, uncharted territory, unprecedented more than a century, long- standing conventions have been shattered and the twists and the turns since the Brexit referendum. The process is into now a whole new phase.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The ayes to the right 327, the no's to the left 300.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: So the no's have it. The no's have it. Now, after that dramatic vote, the British Parliament has seized control of Brexit from the Prime Minister that has forced some hard line Brexiteers to consider backing Theresa May's deal they twice rejected to ensure Brexit does happen.</p><p>What is going to happen over the next 24 hours? This is as best one can understand and follow. Lawmakers are planning the so-called indicative votes that will take place tomorrow. What will it look like? What will the order paper look like? What will the voting slip look like? The Prime Minister is set to meet with her back bench committee that was the 1992 -- it's the rank and file members of her Party. They are the ones who will actually push her around the jaw, they can't at the moment because they've already had one vote of no confidence.</p><p>Eventually, MPs are likely to vote on several options for Brexit, including a much softer challenge to change the relationship with the E.U. All sorts of things, second referendum, no Brexit at all. Bianca is with me. You have been watching them -- you have been in Westminster all day?</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: I have been. I have been in and out of Parliament, a very peculiar atmosphere there. Half of them like keep calm and carry on and you almost want to ask, are you sure you've realized the urgency of the situation? And the other half are running around trying to design these series of votes, really eager to avert Brexit, trying to get the indicative votes --</p><p>QUEST: So they start -- the debate tomorrow starts around what? Two o'clock?</p><p>NOBILO: Two o'clock.</p><p>QUEST: And they'll debate, and then is there going to be -- there is going to be a voting slip at the end of it?</p><p>NOBILO: Yes, so between earlier today and when the debate starts tomorrow, MPs are able to put forward all of the options they want to see on ballot paper. You outlined a couple of those just then. Then we're not entirely sure how the voting is going to happen because this is all unprecedented. We understand now that it's going to be the case, the MPs will vote on slips in the lobbies, pink slips.</p><p>I know you are very keen to know what these ballot papers will look like? Apparently they are going to be pink, and then they will have the opportunity to vote for a series of options. And it will be a clear vote, so that means that you will say yes or no to each option, but you won't rank it.</p><p>QUEST: Right, you don't rank it, but it's not like you can only vote one, you can actually vote for them all?</p><p>NOBILO: You will be able to express your support for all of the different options, so we understand and then that might lead to a runoff, so this will whittle. So tomorrow is the whittling process and then there will be another day of Parliamentary business set aside for whatever is left at the end of that.</p><p>QUEST: Good Lord. Where this goes is anyone's guess at this point? We will be tracking the sentiment in Brexit with our brexitometer. Now, you've got a variety of things if we look at the barometer. You can see exactly the sort of things. You've got a general election, a no Brexit, a second referendum, a deal or a no deal.</p><p>[15:05:10]</p><p>QUEST: So, why don't you be the first to give us a try with this thing out? Tonight, tonight, where do you think we are?</p><p>NOBILO: I'm going to give you a fangled answer which you will hate, but there are two parallel currents at the moment in Parliament because the fact that these votes are happening has made some hard core Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg think again and say that they'll support the Prime Minister's deal because they think Brexit is in jeopardy. Will that be enough to get her deal across the line? Probably not. But that does mean her deal is more likely.</p><p>On other hand, you have this other current MPs seizing back control from the government wanting to put their options forward and we understand that Parliament would coalesce around a softer Brexit. So two things are happening at once, so you need to maybe amend your dial for that. But I thought, I'd give you a confusing answer for your first trial of it.</p><p>QUEST: I'm so glad we did that. Hopefully, we'll have a guest that will guess that will get the hang of this at one go. Thank you.</p><p>Earlier, a major business group told me all this uncertainty is causing an investment log jam in British industry. The manufacturing association called Make U.K. says supply chains are integrated with Europe, and a no deal scenario with customs checks across Europe will be the worst possible outcome.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>STEPHEN PHIPSON, CEO MAKE U.K.: What the manufacturing community wants in this country is to make sure that no deal is really taken off the table here. We cannot operate in an integrated sense with the Europeans with the sense that we have, a possibility of having customs barriers and tariffs and everything else in the way.</p><p>QUEST: It looks as though no deal is not going to happen. It's still on the table, I'll grant you, but the indicative vote process, out of this, what is the best solution for you?</p><p>PHIPSON: The best solution is the closest alignment we can have. You have to remember, we spent 45 years in most of our manufacturing, in many parts of our manufacturing sectors in integrating into supply chains with Europe.</p><p>QUEST: I understand that, but if you take the closest possible Customs Union, single market, you are looking at something like a Norway solution, and that means rule taker, not rule maker</p><p>PHIPSON: You know, we supported the Prime Minister's deal because it actually was a comprehensive deal that took down many of those barriers and gave us a sensible transition period. It's probably wrong to give it a label that exists already. What we need is something that is quite unique here, and no one has ever done it before in the sense that there is a reverse free trade agreement.</p><p>QUEST: But do you think if the Prime Minister does manage to get into the transitional period, it probably won't be her doing the next set of negotiation. I think we can probably agree on that.</p><p>PHIPSON: It looks that way at the moment, yes.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but what would come out at the other end of that? That's two years hence? Because again, it's the same option. In the indicative votes, they are going to be asking Customs Union, Norway plus, Canada minus, Canada plus, plus.</p><p>PHIPSON: They are indeed, and our message -- our constant message and the big businesses in this country's constant message is that alignment, whatever the label you want to call it has to be as close as possible to where we are now. Because we have spent years integrating these things together.</p><p>Look at our car makers, a very good example, but capital goods are the same in this country. Many of those supply chains are linked together. We are trading in both directions with no delays at the border. We are great at logistics in this country. We have developed fabulous logistics systems that deliver just in time.</p><p>But putting barriers in the way means that we will limit investment in this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST: The Brexit uncertainty is pushing many businesses and consumers to stockpile whatever they can. You might think this will be good for companies offering storage space. Actually, it is not working out that way. CNN's Isa Soares reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>ISA SOARES, CORRESPONDENT, CNN (voice over): Recent winter months we typically see a decline in business for this cold storage hub outside of London.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As you can see, we have reached maximum capacity.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES (voice over): But this year has proved very different.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A lot of our existence clients panicking, due to the uncertainty around Brexit and therefore stockpiling and getting goods shipped in to us in larger box and quantities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES (voice over): The site stores produce for a range of clientele -- from manufacturers and restaurants to caterers and small businesses.</p><p>And there is space here, for over 2,000 pallets of frozen goods, items such as bread, chicken breasts as well as ice cream. But fully stocked shelves to present an unwelcome problem in this industry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We've had quite a few new inquiries over the last couple of months. It's bad for business because in an ideal world, you don't want to have to be turning away any business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES (voice over): Threats of leaving the E.U. without a deal or with a bad one have created a safety first approach for many retailers across the U.K. who fear trade disruptions. Those with enough resources are stocking up while they have the chance.</p><p>[15:10:10]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRASER MCKEVITT, RETAILA ND CONSUMER INSIGHT: UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We know that retailers are taking a number of steps. They have been looking to hire extra staff working in their customs unit to help to get things through the borders if there should be any delays. They have also been looking at what they stock. Is there a chance, perhaps, to source things locally from the U.K.?</p><p>Everybody wants to do that, of course it's a great marketing tool to talk about locally grown produce and British produce to British consumers, but the simple fact is, Britain only produces half of the food that it actually eat.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES (voice over): The government has so far reassured the public that food supply, irrespective of Brexit, will remain unchanged.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said this to CNN. \"The U.K. has a high degree of food security built on access to a diverse range of sources including strong domestic production and imports from third countries. This will continue to be the case as we leave the E.U.\" They added, \"While we are making sensible preparations for all eventualities as we leave the E.U., the government is not and will not be storing food.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKEVITT: We do know that 10% of consumers have said that they are already stockpiling goods, but another 25% of consumers have said they would consider stockpiling.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOAREZ (voice over): And as Brexit uncertainty continues to fester, businesses and consumers must now choose how best to fill their freezers.</p><p>Isa Soares, CNN -- CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST: The European stock market swept to higher ground on Tuesday. There are implications and indications the British's Prime Minister's Brexit deal could gain some support and that lifted the FTSE. The other European markets' indices, they closed higher as well.</p><p>When we come back, Boeing is now bringing pilots and airlines to look at the new revamped 737 MAX 8. But they'll get their first indication of the changes being made and their requirements of safety. And Uber buys a formal rival, a $3 billion deal, it's one of the biggest deals in Middle East and tech history.</p><p>[15:15:00]</p><p>QUEST: Some news, just in, we've received written testimony from the heads of the FAA, NTSB and Department of Transportation in the United States who will testify about Boeing on Wednesday in the Senate. The acting FAA administrator is expected to say its oversight approach needs to evolve.</p><p>When you think about it, what time did they have on the doomed Lion Air airplane? Forty seconds, probably the max. That's how long pilots in simulators are finding they have to save their aircraft if it's a 737 MAX when re-creating the problems investigators believe brought down Lion Air flight 610 last October.</p><p>According to \"The New York Times,\" the pilots had just moments, less than moments to stop Boeing's software from causing a catastrophic nose dive. Previous reports say the pilots were scanning a manual, trying to understand what had happened and what they needed to do. Nothing that the plane was doing, according to anything they've ever seen before or had been trained for.</p><p>The plane, of course, plunged into the sea. David Soucie is a former FAA safety inspector. He is in Denver. I've read, David, that what supposedly happened and on how the pilots in the simulators reacted. But, David, Boeing has always maintained that switching off the motor to the stabilizer is the recognized way of dealing with it. So why was it different in this case?</p><p>DAVID SOUCIE, FORMER FAA SAFETY INSPECTOR: Well, there are two things, Richard, one is that the pilots weren't aware that it was even in play because when you turn off that MCAS system or when you turn off your auto pilot, you think that you are in total control. So the response -- the natural response isn't to think of an electronic thing that you need to turn off. You think that there is something physically wrong with the aircraft pushing the nose down. So that's where your mindset is and that indicates to me there may not have been enough training for pilots to recognize the difference between the two things.</p><p>QUEST: When this happened and in listening to it, I mean, it sounds like there was a very short window to identify and work out firstly, we're going down in the stabilizer. Secondly, I need to do the remote -- the auto stabilizer trim procedure. How did Boeing get this one so wrong?</p><p>SOUCIE: Well, Richard, there is a couple of things, a couple of speculations, but one of them is to me is just kind of an over confidence in the fact that they felt that this system was not a primary control system. It was simply designed by the group that says we need to modify the way it flies to make it fly more like the previous version.</p><p>So they didn't think of it as being a primary flight control issue when they first approved it as engineers, they only approved it for about 2% of deflection, but the way that the software interpreted that and the way it came out was that every time you use the trim, it resets itself, allowing it to go past the two-and-a-half, past the two-and-a-half, every time you do that so it could end up at 9.8 degrees of deflection.</p><p>So I think what happened here, Richard, is not enough communication, not enough understanding among the entire system, not just that one system, but how it affects everything.</p><p>QUEST: And, David, the FAA acting administrator is due to say, we believe before Congress, that the reason they didn't ground the fleet is because at that time, there was no systemic reason to do so. They could not find the systemic reason. Well, bearing in mind everyone else had an abundance of caution, do you think his reasoning holds water?</p><p>SOUCIE: He's wired to the wrong side, Richard. In that point, he should have been thinking, what reason was there to not ground the aircraft? Not reason there was to ground it, but what reason is there to keep it flying? And that is a change in philosophy and it needs to be examined, not only by him personally but by the organization.</p><p>QUEST: David Soucie in Denver, Colorado. David, thank you. For Boeing, it is an unprecedented crisis for the company. Two of its jets have had fatal crashes. The U.S. Justice Department has issued criminal subpoenas and the 737 MAX fleet remains grounded across the globe.</p><p>And yet, despite all of this, Boeing still rules the skies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): If it ain't a Boeing, I ain't going. It's a mantra amongst pilots that dates back to the company's earliest days. And in 2018, it drove Boeing to a record-setting 806-aircraft deliveries. Six more planes than its rival Airbus.</p><p>[15:20:10]</p><p>QUEST (voice over): An enviable reputation for safety is now scarred by the twin disasters of Lion Air 610, Ethiopian 302. The ensuing crisis is sure to leave a mark on the company's profitability.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN STRICKLAND, AVIATION EXPERT: Boeing certainly is going to take some financial hits as a result of these two accidents. The question is, how much?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): The Indian Airline's SpiceJet has been forced to ground its thirteen 737 MAX 8 jets as a part of the worldwide grounding of the aircraft.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AJAY SINGH, CEO, SPICEJET: We are also flying our existing aircraft a little harder. And we have cancelled a few flights. So we are trying to make do the best that we can.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Now, the Chief Executive wants compensation for Boeing for the lost revenue. But getting rid of Boeing planes all the together, Singh says, not any time soon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SINGH: You know, Boeing is a world-class company. They are one of the finest companies in the world and we are confident that Boeing will find a solution.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): In the age of this aviation duopoly, it's Airbus or Boeing and both are running backlogs on orders, airlines wanting to switch from one to the other would find that very difficult.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STRICKLAND: Airlines tend to have fleet philosophies based on commonality of training for pilots, spares, holdings, engineering support and that means having made the decision to go for one manufacturer or another, an airline will tend to stick with it.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Even in Indonesia's Garuda which this week said it would cancel an order of nearly 50 MAX 8s has no plans to replace them with Airbus. If it ain't a Boeing, I ain't going. That mantra may be a risk. Boeing's firm hold on the market is not.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Uber is expanding its empire ahead of a long-awaiting IPO. They're snapping up Middle East rival, Careem for $3.1 billion. The deal gives dominance Uber market dominance in the region. Careem is the largest Middle East ride hailing app with 30 million users across 90 cities.</p><p>Careem will keep its name in the region. I spoke to the co-founder last year, two years ago. Magnus Olsson explained how his company has managed to thrive in a crowded market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAGNUS OLSSON, CO-FOUNDER, CAREEM: We started here in the region first and I think what we are seeing globally as well, is that in many regions of the world, the regional players are being very successful, and I think the answer is, the reason for that is the same across the regions, that it's really about catering to the local needs. There are quite significant differences between markets and even between cities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: There are differences, a user of Careem, John Defterios joins me from London. So the fact that Uber is buying in this sense, is this a failure of Careem or a great success that it's managed to carve out, but ultimately couldn't hold up against Uber?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR, CNN: I think it could hold up, actually, Richard, and I think it's a compliment for what Careem has built over the last seven years. We have a talk here in London about the knowledge of the black cab driver, that is what Uber is buying into Careem because of the fascinating, but very complex market of the Middle East and North Africa. Let's knock off a few things here that are important.</p><p>It's the first tech unicorn in the Middle East to go down, well valued over a billion dollars as a unicorn at $3.1 billion. It's also the second major tech company to be bought out from Dubai, the other was Amazon when it bought souq.com, the online retailer and I think we have to say, Richard, in this case, because of this complex market, kudos goes to Dubai here because it's gone beyond trade, beyond tourism and beyond financial services and showing it could be a tech hub.</p><p>The man you interviewed, Magnus Olssen is a Swede, his partner is Pakistani. He will remain the CEO of the group and the brand will live -- Careem -- Richard, so to the point it not being a failure, and Sheik Mohammed Bin Rashid, the ruler of Dubai sent out a tweet today saying, \"Everybody laughed at us in 1999 when we launched Dubai Internet City. Having this deal go out today, having the companies flourish, both souq.com and Careem is a testimony to what we have been able to build.\"</p><p>Particularly, I would suggest, Richard, in the last five years, Dubai when it comes to technology finally clicking in, getting some start-ups there.</p><p>QUEST: So why? How is it doing it, John? I mean, I'm not surprised that His Highness has put out that tweet? But is it justifiable?</p><p>[15:25:06]</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Justifiable in the sense because they have been waiting to get some traction in this sector. And I think we have to remember, Richard, Uber does not have a great track record in the emerging markets and I think they needed to land something before they go public later in 2019 to try to justify the $120 billion valuation.</p><p>They came out of China because of the competition. Russia was very complex. They've pulled out of eight Southeast Asian countries. They are finding it very difficult to compete in India and Latin America. So to have a player that's active from Morocco in the West all the way to Pakistan in the East says something here.</p><p>And I think Careem, it was able to maneuver through a lot of local regulations. Don't forget, in the Middle East, some of the government taxi companies are competing against Uber and Careem. And Careem even offered to take riders with cash as opposed as you know to the credit card situation that is set up with Uber. So they were flexible, maneuvered through some of the difficult times and what a payoff, Richard, $3.1 billion after seven years of business. Not bad for two McKenzie consultants, neither one from the Middle East who thought they saw a crack in the market and took advantage of it.</p><p>QUEST: And they even call their drivers the captains.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: You are correct.</p><p>QUEST: We think the two owners of this company are more than captains, they're more like Admirals and Commodores doors of the fleet. All right, thank you, John. John Defterios.</p><p>As we continue tonight, some Brexiteers are changing their tune. They are worried the U.K. might not leave the European Union at all, I beg your pardon, I will talk to Lord Lamont who manage Britain's money when John Major was in Number 10 and is well clued in on what the hard line Brexiteers are thinking, in a moment.</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There is more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment. Some Brexiteers fear the U.K. may never leave the E.U. Lord Lamont will tell me how to ensure Brexit happens. And internet users and companies are furious after the EU passes its so called Meme Band. Before that, this is CNN and here, the facts will always come first.</p><p>The Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has lost the confidence of his powerful army chief. He is calling for Mr. Bouteflika to be declared unfit for office. Protesters have been demanding the president step down after two decades in power. He's rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013.</p><p>The European plane maker Airbus has landed a major deal to sell 300 passenger planes to Chinese airlines. The agreement was signed as China's President met European leaders. Xi Jinping met the talks in Paris with President Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel.</p><p>There's a tense calm on the Israel-Gaza border after a serious flare-up in violence. Israel has extra tanks and troops on patrol today and remains on high alert. Overnight, Israel bombed dozens of Hamas targets in retaliation for Monday's rocket strike on a home near Tel Aviv.</p><p>Prosecutors have dropped all the charges against the American actor Jussie Smollett. Smollett was accused of staging a hate crime and filing a false police report. He had claimed he was the victim of an attack back in January. Smollett insists he's been telling the truth. But Chicago police and the mayor say this is a whitewash of justice.</p><p>The British parliament will hold up to seven votes on Wednesday. Well, we're not quite sure how they're going to do it. But law makers are scrambling to find a way forward for Brexit. For some Brexiteers are changing their tune, signaling they'll back Theresa May's deal.</p><p>It's not because they like it any more than before, it's because they feel Brexit is slipping away. The U.S. skeptic Jacob Rees-Mogg who heads up the ERG, European Research Group tweeted, \"the choice seems to be Mrs. May's deal or no Brexit.</p><p>Now, lord Lamont is with me, Norman Lamont; the former Finance Minister. You look at -- you worry about how the mechanisms for these indicative votes. It is not clear how they're going to do it. But is it your fear now that Brexit is slipping away?</p><p>NORMAN LAMONT, FORMER FINANCE MINISTER, UNITED KINGDOM: I do believe Brexit will happen in one form or another, but I think the best way to ensure that it happens is to wait for the deal. I mean, I've said that some time ago, it's not just something I'm saying today. It's been obvious to me for some time that by making objections to so many different aspects of it, the Brexiteers are in danger of making perhaps not a perfect deal into an enemy of Brexit.</p><p>QUEST: How did they get it so wrong? How did they not realize that MV2 was the moment to sign on? Because thereafter, the cascading events were so unknown?</p><p>LAMONT: Well, I think there was an assumption from the very beginning that one could get to no deal, and that no deal would be allowed to happen. I personally have always been very skeptical about that. I felt that parliament, by one means or another would obstruct the course towards no deal.</p><p>QUEST: Certainly, we had indicative votes on that in the earlier part. But it begs the question, what does happen next? I mean, in your view? We've got these votes tomorrow, which were -- we're not entirely certain the mechanism. But they're supposed to give an indication of what parliament would find acceptable.</p><p>LAMONT: Well, they're supposed to, of course. Nobody knows quite what form of voting, quite how this is going to be done. An extraordinary -- an extraordinary amount of power seems to be in-ceded to the speaker to decide this. Are people going to list things, one, two, three, four?</p><p>Is it going to be preferential voting? Are the results going to be made public? I would hope so, that will be an outrage if members of parliament voted secretly. But how are they going to publish all their preferences or fill up half a newspaper if they do that. So I think it's very unclear where this will lead.</p><p>And, of course, it is not mandatory on the government, but the government have taken a step down this road, which, of course, makes it from the government's point of view rather dangerous. Because if you go down this road a bit, people are saying, well, what's the point of this? Why aren't you bound by it?</p><p>[15:35:00] QUEST: And when would you expect MV3, meaningful vote 3 on the Prime Minister though? Now, I know what she said in the house, yes, so she's not going to bring it back because there was no support for it. But that support will only come from the ERG and the DUP.</p><p>LAMONT: Well, that's right. I mean, it looks to me today that it won't happen this week. But I wouldn't be surprised if I woke up and was totally astonished? I don't know everything that's going on. I very well thought it could well be next week. But perhaps it will never be moved if they don't think they can get it through.</p><p>QUEST: What's the mood like over there?</p><p>LAMONT: I think the mood is chaotic and --</p><p>QUEST: Really?</p><p>LAMONT: And the mood rather depressed if --</p><p>QUEST: When you're walking round in the tea rooms and all of that, it's -- there's a feeling of people shushing in the corners and whispering.</p><p>LAMONT: Well, I didn't know about whispering in corners. But I -- there's a lot of acrimony, I think it's not good in Westminster, I've never been to meetings before where people have been so ill-tempered with each other.</p><p>QUEST: What will it take because -- what would it take to get the ERG, the European Reform Group -- research group and the DUP on board, bearing in mind the backstop is not going to go, that's there. So the -- what? She's had the commitments, but what do you think it will now take to get those MPs to sign on?</p><p>LAMONT: Well, I think it's not for me to speak for the ERG, it's not my -- I don't have any authority to do that. I'm not strictly speaking a member of it.</p><p>QUEST: But you know what they're thinking is?</p><p>LAMONT: I know quite a lot, I've got a lot of friends --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>LAMONT: And I do know what they're thinking.</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>LAMONT: You know, I personally think they will be well advised to understand that, well, this from their point of view is not a perfect deal. It is the only deal that is going to happen and have a chance of delivering Brexit. I think you will go back to a longer extension, two years or something like that, Brexit would never happen.</p><p>We have a very long extension with every month that passes, the momentum diminishes, legitimacy of demand for a second referendum will increase. So, I mean, I have -- I think quite a lot of conservative MPs --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>LAMONT: Are coming around to this, but the DUP though, I see no sign that they are changing their objection, but perhaps there's something happening in private, I don't know.</p><p>QUEST: So let's have a -- we've got a -- it's so uncertain. We decided to employ a Brexitometer. Which under Brexitometer, it has a variety here. We're going to track the change. So these are your options, a general election, a no -- in fact, as you see it on the screen in front of you, a general election, no Brexit, second referendum, leaving with a deal, leaving without a deal. As you look at it tonight, as we are sitting talking now, which way is the wind blowing?</p><p>LAMONT: Well, I think the wind is blowing a bit towards a softer Brexit or a longer extension. I don't think the wind is blowing towards a second referendum. In fact, I think you'll find on the options that people vote on the second referendum won't be because people don't think it would be --</p><p>QUEST: So that's a deal, so that's a deal in a variety of a deal. Good to see you, sir, thank you, thank you very much indeed. Now, the British government has responded to the online petition to revoke Article 50. The government's response is simple, it's no. The petition got nearly 6 million signatures, the government points out three times as many people voted for Brexit.</p><p>So all sides are jockeying to control the process. And our conversation with you continues at cnn.com-slash-join. Who can secure the best Brexit outcome? Parliament, Theresa May or the British citizens through a second referendum? That's at cnn.com-slash-join.</p><p>Who is best equipped? Meanwhile, tensions are running high up and down the country. Let us not forget, London is only one part of -- and the others. Nina dos Santos is in the strongly remained city of Brighton, first, Anna Stewart is in the leave support city of Peterborough.</p><p>OK, let's start with you, Anna. Anna, what are they making of what's happening and how Brexit is very close to being -- well, it's more -- it's in more danger than it's ever been?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Well, I think your last guest lord Lamont said there's a feeling of ill-temper in Westminster and that spreads well beyond Westminster and London. I'm feeling it everywhere I travel this week in the U.K., I'm focusing on remain areas.</p><p>The feeling here is that they cannot understand, they voted and they did vote in their droves nearly three years ago to leave the EU and we're still having this conversation. Now, 61 percent of people here voted to leave the EU, and I met one chap called Tony, I want to bring you what he had to say.</p><p>He wants to leave the EU, but frankly, at this stage, he's just fed up talking about it. I asked him what he wants to happen next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:40:00] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Better imagine what they're going to do? Better imagine what they're going to do. The senior asked a comments here, distracted their bones, they're picking their noses.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART: Now, there are issues for someone like Tony of a sovereignty, there are also issues about immigration, Richard, plenty of thorny problems. The people I've spoken that voted to leave have not changed their minds.</p><p>QUEST: So to Nina, Nina dos Santos, as I -- what are people there wanting? I mean, how are their views changing? Not so much actually how they're changing their minds, but what are they making of the process going on down here in London?</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Confusion, consternation, they're wary of what's going on in Westminster. And essentially, they're just exhausted with Brexit, Richard. You know, we managed to gain the pulse of a few people on the streets here in Brighton which is a city of 275,000 people that voted really strongly in favor of remaining.</p><p>It was nearly 70 percent in favor of remaining in that referendum with a huge turnout of nearly three-quarters of the eligible population. But now people are saying, well, we're just sick of the word Brexit, it's a toxic subject, and there is nothing polite we could tell you about the politicians that you could actually broadcast.</p><p>Nevertheless, here's a snippet of three points of view on the street that speaks to exactly what's going on today politically.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The way the parliament has taken control, I don't think it will help at all. I think it's just going to make it even more confusing and more delay.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think they even need to figure out now only the end lap. Our generation figure out in a few years time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't want to leave with no deal on Friday.</p><p>DOS SANTOS: And if you can't get that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll go with Theresa May's deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOS SANTOS: Well, Richard, as you can just see, when I was speaking before even the lights on the famous Brighton Pier appear to have given up on this idea. People as I was saying before are just citing the word on the streets today as being Brexhaustion, even the remain hard-line like this just wants to see the whole situation over and done with.</p><p>And that's despite the fact that there could be according to a local university, some 43,000 jobs could be lost here in this County of Sussex and nearby Hampshire if we were to see a no deal Brexit in a couple of weeks time, Richard?</p><p>QUEST: Right, so continue your travels around the country, please, both of you, as we try to understand the difference between metropolitan London and the country at large. Thank you. We continue tonight, some think it's off to a slow start, predicting shrinking profits in Q1.</p><p>[15:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Samsung has issued a surprise profits warning on Tuesday, telling investors its first quarter earnings are going to come up short. The company is getting hit on both ends by a slowdown in hardware sales. Its own phone, of course, and in Israel as a supplier. It's been such a profitable party, supplies and the manufacturers.</p><p>Contrast all this with Apple which is focusing more on services, including video streaming and credit cards. Our next guest is here to put it altogether. Michael Nunez is the deputy technology editor at Mashable, he joins me now from New York. Good to see you, sir, thank you.</p><p>I apologize I am not -- I am not able to be with you. I am Brexiteering in London. The Apple announcement, let's do Apple first before we do Samsung.</p><p>MICHAEL NUNEZ, DEPUTY TECHNOLOGY EDITOR, MASHABLE: Sure --</p><p>QUEST: The Apple announcements yesterday, reading this morning, the credit card seems to be a bit of a ho-hum, the magazines seems to be nice to have. But this idea of television plus or TV plus, there's too many unanswered.</p><p>NUNEZ: Yes, I would completely agree. I think everyone was really excited to hear about a potential competitor to Netflix or Amazon Prime. And what we learned was that Apple is working with a lot of really premium talent. You know, Oprah was in attendance, Stephen Spielberg was in attendance.</p><p>So those two names alone I think were enough to make headlines and get people excited about what's to come on this service. The problem is that we don't know how much this costs, we don't really know what this subscription service entails. And one of the weirder parts of this is that Apple has not included Netflix in its new Apple TV plus subscription service.</p><p>So they're not going to make it easy for you to switch between both Apple creative content and Netflix creative content. And that's kind of the dream. I think people would like to, you know, swim seamlessly between all of these different subscription services.</p><p>QUEST: I'm sorry, but when I look at this idea of a pure rated value, it starts to look a bit like cable. I mean, you pay the subscription and you got certain content for it, and in Apple's case, it's going to be other people's, but the majority will be other people's content.</p><p>NUNEZ: Yes, that's right. I mean, I think this is just a part of a much larger trend that's happening in tech right now. So you know, as you know, Disney World created its own subscription service very soon, and essentially a lot of big players, all of the big tech players and several big media players are going be launching or have already launched subscription-based services.</p><p>And so what it comes down to is for --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>NUNEZ: Millennials that are cord-cutting, they will begin to choose an ala carte-style -- you know, from an ala carte-style menu of different subscription services. So right now, Netflix happens to be one of the favorites. But I think in the next couple of years or even by the end of this year, you could see others like this Disney streaming service or Apple's or Apple TV Plus streaming service, you know, begin to find its way on to millennial's monthly bills, I guess.</p><p>QUEST: Right, and finally, the Apple plan, what -- and the Samsung, when you take Samsung. Samsung has its own phones and it makes bits for others.</p><p>NUNEZ: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Apple has its own phone and its building services. Which of the two models, do you think has most long-term sustainability?</p><p>NUNEZ: Wow, great question. I think, you know -- I think Apple's pushing the services is really interesting. It's definitely a departure from what the company has done for the past several decades. So this is something that's very new for Apple.</p><p>However, they've sold over a billion devices, and they're able to push their content and their subscription services in front of people very easily. So something like iCloud is a great example. A lot of people have run out of space on their phones from taking pictures, from snapping videos and so they typically get a little prod from Apple.</p><p>A little notification that shows up on their phone that says you've run out of space --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>NUNEZ: You should subscribe to our iCloud service. Well, in the near future, you'll also be prodded by Apple to subscribe to other things like Apple TV Plus, like Apple Music and you know, any of their -- any one of their services that they're --</p><p>QUEST: All right --</p><p>[15:50:00] NUNEZ: That they're betting on. And then for Samsung, you know, for building hardware, I think it's going to be difficult as time goes on, because, obviously, chips are getting cheaper, I think the demand for new smartphone chips, for example is decreasing.</p><p>You know, people are upgrading their smartphones less and less over time. And then also, companies like Amazon and Google are ordering less chips from companies like Samsung, because their data, you know, their large data infrastructure warehouses are essentially built and they're you know -- although, they're optimizing those, they're just not scaling quite as much as they were in the past few years.</p><p>So for a company that makes computer chips, I think it's going to be really hard to stay competitive in the short-term.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir, thank you, I appreciate it, thank you.</p><p>NUNEZ: Thanks for having me.</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight, and after the break, the EU -- the EU deals blow to tech companies and meme makers, why copyright laws have made unlikely internet bed fellows in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERRCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: The EU has approved new copyright rules that managed to anger both Silicon Valley and internet activists at the same time. The new laws will make sites like YouTube and Google responsible for any copyright infringements committed by their users.</p><p>The media companies and artists have had their eyes on this for years. They say it will help them get fair pay for their content. Meanwhile, tech companies say they'll have to put in costly filters that threaten the digital economy in Europe. Free speech activists here fear it could amount to censorship and kill off beloved names like the one you're seeing on the screen.</p><p>Hadas Gold is with us. How did they manage to annoy everybody in one day? And why won't these memes disappear?</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Well, the whole idea is that these platforms be responsible for any user-generated content that is uploaded to their sites that might somehow violate some sort of copyright. They have to make sure that they have the copyrights.</p><p>What that means is things like those memes like you just showed one from \"Game of Thrones\", that if they don't have the proper copyright for it, they might be banned. Now, the EU claims that memes are exempt because there's an exception for parody and satire.</p><p>But the tech companies are saying, how will you -- how will their AI, how will their algorithm be able tell the difference between a meme that's meant for parody and one that's meant to infringe on some sort of copyright. Now, Richard, this all has to do with money. Because what they're saying is that these platforms are generating profit off of these memes or video clips or anything like that.</p><p>[15:55:00] Because they're getting advertising revenue, and that, that money should also be going to the people who created the content. Think about it, if there's a video of you, Richard, lip-syncing to a popular Taylor Swift song, that Taylor Swift song is copyrighted, and if that video which I'm sure would go viral, it can make you a lot of money in advertisements.</p><p>And what the EU law is saying is --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>GOLD: Some of that should be shared with the artist. You know, people like Paul McCartney is supporting it. On the other side, you have the big tech companies, Google, Twitter, Reddit all saying that they are not necessarily supportive of this new law.</p><p>QUEST: So the new laws come in, I guess it's a case of so what? I mean, get used to it?</p><p>GOLD: Well, I mean, so it's not like it's going to be implemented tomorrow. This still has to be approved by European ministers, and then it will be transposed into law by all the European countries. So there might still be time, so something that might be changing.</p><p>And the tech companies say that the devil is in the details because right now they say the law is rather vague on what exactly is exempted and what's not, and how it should be enforced. For example, will they have to have some sort of content filter because again, they warn that they don't want to have to impose a content filter that could filter out legitimately --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>GOLD: Allowed content. So there still is some room here for development, but this is something that is causing a lot of people to be rather angry today, especially those meme makers.</p><p>QUEST: Hadas, I would offer to do a bit of lip-syncing, but I think that might put an end to a lovely relationship. Good to see you, thank you. It's the last few minutes of trade on Wall Street. The Dow has given up all of its gains that we saw earlier. A slide in U.S. bonds, take a look at the Dow, you'll see it and we will have a profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, there have been so many superlatives about what's happening with Brexit. The biggest, the most different -- you name it, the precedence that are being broken, the history-making, all of these and more. And tomorrow will be another day, which is why we will be here, and please, make -- if you can make time to come along as well.</p><p>As we see what it's like when MPs run the institution, that the executive, the government is supposed to run. That will be on tomorrow night's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, and that is tonight, I'm Richard Quest in London.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.

But we're not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebookhas to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for seven years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do.</p><p>``We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.</p><p>``While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.''</p><p>In the last year Facebookhas come under intense pressure over some of its business practices, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a series of data breaches and concerns over fake news and other content on the site.</p><p>The committee's final report into disinformation and fake news also said electoral law was ``not fit for purpose'' and should be updated to reflect the move to ``microtargeted'' online political campaigning.</p><p>They called for a comprehensive review of the current rules and regulations surrounding political work during elections and referenda, and separately urged the Government to put pressure on social media companies to publicise instances of disinformation.</p><p>Ministers were also asked to reveal how many investigations are being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics.</p><p>The report is the latest attempt to crack down on social media networks, and follows accusations from digital minister Margot James that some firms show little regard for the security and safety of some of their more vulnerable users.</p><p>The issue has come under increased focus following the case of schoolgirl Molly Russell, who took her life aged 14, after her family found material relating to depression and suicide when they looked at her Instagram account following her death.</p><p>The Government is expected to publish a white paper later this year on proposals to reform laws to make the internet and social media safer.</p><p>Tory MP and committee chairman Damian Collins said: ``Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.</p><p>``The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.</p><p>``We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people. The age of inadequate self-regulation must come to an end.</p><p>``The rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by Parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator.''</p><p>Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said: ``Labour agrees with the committee's ultimate conclusion: The era of self-regulation for tech companies must end immediately. We need new independent regulation with a tough powers and sanctions regime to curb the worst excesses of surveillance capitalism and the forces trying to use technology to subvert our democracy.</p><p>``Few individuals have shown contempt for our parliamentary democracy in the way <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has. If one thing is uniting politicians of all colours during this difficult time for our country, it is our determination to bring him and his company into line.''</p><p>A Government spokesman said: ``This week the Culture Secretary will travel to the United States to meet with tech giants including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple to discuss many of these issues.</p><p>``We welcome this report's contribution towards our work to tackle the increasing threat of disinformation and to make the UK the safest place to be online. We will respond in due course.''</p><p>Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner, said: ``We're pleased with the committee's support of our recommendation for a statutory code that will clarify how personal data should be used during political campaigning. The ICO's investigations into these areas continue and we'll be reviewing the full report with interest.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PANEWS-HSA7654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PANEWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFV-DW41-JCBD-Y44T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8170</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1088\"/><timeReceived>9:39 AM BST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Press Association Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Press Association Mediapoint</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31563\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Luigi Zingales is an Italian born MIT doctorate, now a Professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of two widely reviewed books: 'Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists' and 'Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity'. This academic has published extensively in economics and financial journals. </p><p>His writings have expressed a number of concerns about 'Big Tech' to which I will try to do justice in a short three part series.  Once upon a time  Beginning with the invention of the automobile, people were freed from the yoke of distance. A century after invention of the automobile another life changing technological revolution arrived. Enter the smartphone. Before the smartphone, people's communication links were tethered to landlines. The introduction of the smartphone coupled with mobile communication and the Internet brought unprecedented access to information and the ability to share it.  At our fingertips today we have more advanced hardware and computing power than was used to take man to the moon and bring him home. We have access to more information in the palm of our hands than is in the world's best library. Our power to communicate is greater than any propaganda machine ever dreamed of possessing. With those things said, an average individual cannot take advantage of these advances without the applications. That's what companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon; what 'Big Tech' does. They translate the power of the technology so the average user can take advantage of it. All revolutionary changes in technology improve lives. But as Alfred Nobel learned, technological advances can have a dark side too. They also present challenges that offer an opportunity for abuse and reason for consideration of regulatory response. The Big Tech revolution poses challenges. The applications pose a direct challenge to free markets. Privacy is under direct and continuous attack. It is corrosive to both security and liberty. Wealth is being concentrated. Perceptions can be subtly adjusted and factual presentation skewed. In some ways its challenges are similar to those once addressed with anti-trust legislation; others are different and or new.  Position statement We need to understand the dangers associated with new technology. It may be that be we will need to confront the implications of the technological change brings us. No one wants to go back to a world without smartphones any more than we want to return to a world with animal based transportation. The point is if or how we should manage new technology. We do not want it to become just an end in itself. We want it to help us, but we do not want it bind us; even with golden handcuffs. As compared to autos Comparing the auto revolution with the tech revolution has some value. The early auto industry was fragmented. There were about 3,000 companies in the United States. They each had the intent to produce cars or parts for them. There were still 44 independent car companies in the U.S. when the Great Depression hit. It wasn't until the early 1980s that Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors emerged as the industry oligarchs.  By that time foreign cars were on the rise. Today, the market share of the top-selling car manufacturer in the U.S. is 18%, the largest two have 32%, and of the largest four 54%. What produced this fragmentation was geographical segmentation and product differentiation. There were high transportation costs and that favored local producers. Consumers preferred not only different colors but different models mitigating economies of scale as an advantage. Here's Big Tech The history of Big Tech is very different in this respect. Ten years after the introduction of the iPhone, Apple's market share as the largest smartphone seller in the U.S. is 38%. The market share of the largest two smartphone sellers 64%. The market share of the largest four is 90%. Market concentration has come far more quickly. Formation of oligarchs with wealth and power is concerning.  Looking at the application markets, the picture is more stark. The market share of Google, the largest search engine in the U.S., is 86%, the largest two 93% and of the largest four 99%. The market share of the largest social media platform in the U.S. is 60%, of the largest two 86%, and of the largest four 98%. Yes, it is difficult to measure the market share of products that are free. But even looking at a more substantive market representation, such as online advertising, Google and Facebook form a duopoly that commands market share of more than 80%. We need to recognize that.

Luigi Zingales is an Italian born MIT doctorate, now Professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of two widely reviewed books: 'Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists' and 'Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity'. Economic and financial journals have published his work extensively. </p><p>He has expressed a number of concerns about 'Big Tech' to which I will try to do justice in a short three part series. How much impact is Big Tech having? There is plenty of evidence of distortion of competition in the tech sector. Distortion not only on the market side. Consider the recent EU case against Google. The EU charged Google with preferring its own shopping comparison tool to others; but on the social side as well. Google also unilaterally decided to de-rank payday lenders in their search results. De-ranking is a subtle form of censorship. A company de-ranked by Google is effectively condemned to irrelevancy. Regardless of what we think of payday loans, who is Google to decide that for us? Why would Google have done it? Was the timing related to the Obama administration initiating a campaign against payday lenders at the same time? Is it hard to imagine that Google cultivates the gratitude of politicians having the power to regulate and legislate in ways that impact Google's interest? Will the market heal the potential ills from Big Tech? Many hold the view that technology will solve the Big Tech problem because that is what has occurred in the past. This view suffers from the fallacy Bertrand Russell called 'the inductivist turkey.' A turkey observes that his owner comes each morning to feed him. The turkey inductively infers that he will continue to be fed each morning by the owner. That inference breaks down each year at Thanksgiving. Just because something happened in the past, does not mean it will happen in the future. It is simply not true that technology alone has been sufficient in the past. IBM's dominance lasted 30 years and Microsoft's less than 20 years. Neither company was dethroned without government intervention. IBM lost its primacy because the Department of Justice went after it on antitrust grounds for decades. Because of this pressure, it decided to outsource part of its computer manufacturing. That is what led to the PC revolution.  Google and Facebook are not part of Microsoft today because Microsoft too was under antitrust scrutiny. As one of the lawyers in that case said, 'The trial is the remedy.' So historical precedent actually supports the idea of subjecting Big Tech to antitrust scrutiny. It is absolutely true that growth comes from technological innovation. It is wrong to think that letting Big Tech companies continue unhindered will necessarily lead to that innovation. So is antitrust the answer or should it ever have been used? If we believe the market cannot heal the damage then what? Perhaps there is another way. Let's assume there should be no massive overhauls. Such overhauls create uncertainty and pose a danger of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. There are significant economies of scale in search algorithms. Wouldn't it be better to split Instagram from Facebook? There are no strong synergies between them. It was a mistake for antitrust enforcers to allow Facebook to gain so much market power. Should we try to promote competition? The reason we don't see a conservative Facebook being developed is because people want to be where other people are. It's very costly in terms of time and effort for people to 'multi-home' meaning to be on multiple social networks. Compare this, for example, with using both Lyft and Uber, which is convenient and efficient. The same might be true with social media if users could post their content to an intermediary. The intermediary would then disseminate it to all their preferred social media sites. The intermediary could also collect and organize content from their friends and present it in one place. The reason this is not already happening is that federal law prevents it.  If the approach is good why hasn't it been tried? A company called Power Ventures made an application to do all this. It was shut down by court order when Facebook sued. As a result of that lawsuit, it is a crime for a company, even with an individual's permission, to obtain that individual's data from Facebook. This is a clear example of Facebook using government to create barriers to entry. Elimination of such barriers would be pro-competition and pro-free market; not interventionist. This is called 'portability of the social graph.' It's no different than the portability of our cell phone numbers. There was a time when we did not own our phone numbers. The telephone company did. If we moved or switched companies we lost our number. Why do we now think it is normal to own our phone number? Because the FCC forced phone companies to allow portability. This is another instance or regulation creating more competition, not less, and reduced consumer cost. Conclusion: To create more competition perhaps we should begin with this kind of lean regulation in the tech sector. Maybe that in turn would lead to more innovation and a better result for all. Regardless of approach taken it is imperative we recognize that we face a situation our technological advancement has created. We need to decide who we are. What values and principles do we hold? What is important? Then we need to decide how to apply those values and principles to the conundrum Big Tech presents.

Earlier this month, the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional auditor, warned the United States lacked significant safeguards over how companies use personal data.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission, the national consumer protection watchdog, is reportedly readying to level a U.S. record-setting fine against Facebook nearly a year after revelations last March that the social media giant failed to prevent political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica from accessing data on millions of users without their permission.</p><p>Privacy experts say the change in tone in Washington over the past year has been striking. Lawmakers had long resisted calls for comprehensive national privacy regulations, fearing that restrictions would stifle tech firms' abilities to innovate.</p><p>\"Certainly a few years ago, the response among many Republicans and even some Democrats was anti-regulatory,\" said Cameron Kerry, who as general counsel at the Commerce Department during the Obama administration, led efforts to pass a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights that stalled in Congress. \"That's changed. You have a lot of Republicans talking about 'we need to regulate in this area.' \" A number of issues that have emerged over the past year have helped turn dataprivacy into a burning political issue. Scandals such as Cambridge Analytica and Russian political meddling on social media have sparked fears of Silicon Valley's power over the political process.</p><p>At the same time, new European dataprivacy laws that came into effect last spring forced many tech firms to change their privacy practices worldwide to comply.</p><p>That prompted U.S. lawmakers to develop their own proposals to stave off regulation from abroad.</p><p>Most significantly, tech companies themselves have been lobbying Congress to pass national legislation that would override an emerging patchwork of state privacy laws - particularly new rules set to take effect in California next year that would give the state's attorney-general broad powers to police Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"There really is a unique confluence of events at the moment that has generated momentum around privacy in a way that I've never seen while I've been doing this,\" said Joseph Jerome of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washingtonbased non-profit.</p><p>But while tech firms and lawmakers in both parties generally agree there should be new restrictions on how companies collect and use personal data, partisan fault lines are appearing that could thwart those efforts.</p><p>A handful of bills proposed by Republicans, such as Florida Senator Marco Rubio, seek to exempt tech startups and other small businesses from regulation, propose no new powers for federal watchdogs and would block states such as California from enforcing their own data-privacy laws.</p><p>Some Democratic proposals have instead called for hefty fines and even jail time for company executives who violate consumer privacy. California Democrats have also vowed to fight any Republican attempt to override their state's privacy laws.</p><p>\"I would hope that all 53 members [of California's House delegation] would oppose it,\" Representative Jackie Speier of San Francisco told Politico last week.</p><p>Industry groups such as the Internet Association, whose members include Google, Amazon and Facebook, have also pushed for a national law that negates state rules, arguing it creates a level playing field across the country. But some privacy experts fear that Silicon Valley's newfound support for regulation is an attempt to replace aggressive state laws with weaker national ones.</p><p>\"They want Congress to enact a get-meout-from-under the European privacy law and the California privacy law,\" said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a Washington-based advocacy group. \"The fact that the companies want something is both an opportunity, but also a looming threat, because what they want and what the public needs are two different things.\"</p><p>Others see danger in the push to safeguard state rights. Mr. Kerry, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution, argues laws passed by states allowing consumers to block companies from selling their information still place too much onus on users, rather than businesses, to manage the reams of data that companies collect. Well-crafted national legislation could do more to protect consumers by requiring companies to commit to standards for how they safeguard personal information.</p><p>\"A federal law that steps in and goes beyond consumer choice could be much stronger than state laws,\" he said.</p><p>\"Then you really have the basis for a grand bargain in which businesses get one consistent set of laws across the country, and individuals and privacy advocates get strong protections.\"</p><p>Some analysts are skeptical that a divided Congress will be able to overcome partisan differences and pass a bill before next year's presidential election, but say they are encouraged that the tenor of the debate in Washington has changed.</p><p>A decade ago, most of the discussion about regulating tech giants was focused on narrow fixes such as whether companies could make their privacy policies easier to read, Mr. Jerome said.</p><p>\"Nobody seriously thinks that is what the U.S. should do with privacy anymore.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20190225rbnwwocongressprivacy</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VH5-RC61-F06S-354G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"999\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Democrats from New York and Massachusetts and a North Dakota Republican office said they won't be attending DOJ's Sept. 25 meeting, with the latter citing a scheduling conflict. Of all 50 state AG offices queried, 17 of the 21 that responded said they haven't received an invitation. Justice didn't comment.</p><p>The office of Texas AG Ken Paxton said he looks forward to participating in the upcoming discussion on \"growing concerns\" that social media platforms are suppressing conservative content. \"This matter involves both the central tenets of our country's free market economy and the guaranteed freedom of speech,\" a spokesperson said. \"We must work together to ensure that online economic competition operates fairly and transparently, so that Americans across the political spectrum can make informed choices and the public discourse can flourish.\"</p><p>Louisiana's Jeff Landry plans to participate, a spokesperson said. Arkansas' Leslie Rutledge and staff have discussed a variety of issues with Sessions, including the \"vitality and reliability of the tech industry,\" a spokesperson said. Rutledge \"will continue to work with fellow attorneys general and the DOJ to protect the constitutional rights of Americans,\" the spokesperson said, without committing the AG to attending.</p><p>Barbara Underwood of New York hasn't received an invitation and won't attend, a spokesperson said, pointing to a tweet about the meeting. Massachusetts' Maura Healey hasn't gotten an invitation and doesn't plan to participate, a spokesperson said. She did not explain Healey's reasoning. Healey recently clashed with the Trump administration over family separation at the Southwestern border. North Dakota's Wayne Stenehjem is attending another event on Sept. 25, a spokesperson said.</p><p>Other offices replying they haven't received a DOJ invitation are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah and Wisconsin. Spokespeople for the National Association of Attorneys General and the Democratic Attorneys General Association said their organizations aren't involved in discussions about the meeting. The Republican Attorneys General Association didn't comment.</p><p>American Enterprise Institute policy analyst James Pethokoukis called the development a \"notable escalation in Washington's confrontation with America's large technology companies.\" He suggested the administration could be intent on \"making this an issue beyond\" President Donald Trump's tweeting.</p><p>Free State Foundation President Randolph May said it's fair for Sessions to call a meeting to look at big tech antitrust, which has been a growing concern. Government shouldn't be rushing in to regulate the industry, he said, arguing the conservative bias claims shouldn't be conflated with the antitrust discussion. Tech platforms have a First Amendment right to be protected from government intervention concerning the content on their websites. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation echoed that recently. Given the concentration of ownership with platforms like Google and Facebook, antitrust concerns might be legitimate, May said, but tech's \"dynamism\" shows it would be advisable for government to

Many are wary of the expanding influence of companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, and don't want a national law that weakens state measures already in place.</p><p>\"The fact that, even after many hearings last year on the misuse of personal data, not one consensus bill has been introduced is telling,\" said Gigi Sohn of the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology and Policy. \"Republicans and Democrats seem to still be far apart on the best way to address this.\" On one level, the divide is surprising. Republicans have frequently attacked social media and content companies for a perceived liberal bias that mirrors their base in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>The Republicans have also tended to support states over federal authority when they butt heads, said Neema Singh Guliani, senior legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. \"There's a little bit of inconsistency in not recognising the importance of states in this area,\" Ms Guliani said.</p><p>Republicans say they are looking out for tech start-ups, small businesses and consumers, who could be hamstrung by a patchwork of conflicting state laws.</p><p>\"The internet does not stop at state lines and neither should innovative privacy and security -solutions,\" said Greg Walden of Oregon, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p><p>But the new Democratic House, led by Speaker Nancy -Pelosi of California, is signalling that any bill pre-empting state laws will face powerful opposition.</p><p>\"States have been at the vanguard of protecting Americans,\" said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Mrs Pelosi. \"All Americans have benefited from state privacy and data breach laws, so their role as policy innovator and law -enforcer must be respected.\" Many observers expected bipartisan draft bills by now. The gridlock is taking hold despite scandals over unauthorised data disclosures and privacy breaches in the past couple of years that have begun to stir federal regulators to stronger action.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission is weighing penalties against Facebook over political data firm Cambridge Analytica accessing of users' data.</p><p>FTC staff have discussed fines of as much as $US5 billion ($7bn) in the agency's investigation of the company, according to a source. But penalties remained under discussion and a resolution could be weeks or months away.</p><p>Congress also staged high-profile hearings into privacy issues last year, stoking expectations of national legislation and leading tech companies to step up their presence in Washington. Internet companies' lobbying expenditures climbed to $US77.2 million last year, up from $US18.6m in 2010, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>The congressional debate begins later this month. Committee hearings scheduled for February 26 and 27 are aimed at framing the broad parameters for possible privacy legislation.</p><p>Legislative aides say measures under discussion include giving users the right to move their data from one company to another and to allow them to deny use of their data during routine online interactions.</p><p>Participants say there is still momentum for change and room for talks. For instance, there could be limited forms of pre-emption of state laws in the bill. Other consumer protections, such as private rights to sue over breaches, also could help soften Democratic opposition to pre-emption.</p><p>California's new governor Gavin Newsom also signalled recently that he was interested in reopening that state's 2018 debate, to give consumers more ability to get paid for use of their data.</p><p>That could give tech companies another shot at dialling back some of the parts of the California law that worry them most.Another looming fight is over to what extent bricks-and-mortar companies should be included in the data privacy bill.

Nevertheless, they see more of a chance today to gain continental scale by pooling specific businesses: as UniCredit has already done in what chief executive Jean Pierre Mustier calls \"synthetic mergers\" \"\" platforms owned by other banks in businesses such as asset management (Amundi) and cash equities (Kepler Cheuvreux).\u00a0\"You need to reach critical size by bringing things together,\" says Mustier, who was recently appointed president of the European Banking Federation. \"The probability of finding a merger today is low. You can get critical size through synthetic mergers.\"Philippe Brassac is chief executive of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA (CASA), the principal partner of UniCredit in both Amundi and Kepler. He is similarly sceptical about cross-border mergers, and says banks with European ambitions cannot ape banks in China and the US, as their home market is less homogenous.\u00a0In any case, he says, the French mutual group's balance sheet is already considerably bigger than France's national budget, which limits the scope for all-out mergers with other big banks.   Philippe Brassac, chief executive of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA According to Brassac, divergent banking rules between EU member states and the consequent lack of international synergies, means CASA has not been able to fully integrate Cariparma, the biggest part of its Italian retail operations, with its French retail bank, LCL, for example.\u00a0Nevertheless, Brassac has an alternative vision \"\" reflecting Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's synergies between its 49 regional mutual banks \"\" for a kind of banking federalism that might be better suited to Europe's diverse markets.\"Business lines don't know borders,\" Brassac tells Euromoney. \"Each country will keep their retail banks as there are no synergies between them, but for the factories \"\" asset management, insurance, consumer finance \"\" there is room to offset this phenomenon. I do think that you will have consolidation by business line.\" Life is fragile; a capital organization can be fragile too. The challenge is that you have to be the best; you need to satisfy the partner and sign the term sheet\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Philippe Brassac, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA In some cases, this becomes almost as good as or even better than taking control of the distributor. As part of a plan for product distribution collaborations with Italy's 10th biggest bank, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole took a 5% stake in Credito Valtellinese last year, with the option of going to 9.9%, providing capital support without merging.\u00a0Cr\u00e9dit Agricole also purchased Creval's insurance business, Global Assicurazioni, for \u00e2,\u00ac80 million, gaining a 15-year exclusive insurance distribution partnership and access to Creval's network for savings products distribution.\u00a0After rumours that it was interested in taking over Italian banks including Creval, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole found it might have many of the benefits of those acquisitions without the integration headaches.\u00a0Shared platformsMore European bank chiefs accept the view that such partnerships are not just desirable but necessary.\u00a0That's the case at the eurozone's biggest bank, BNP Paribas, which told investors in early 2019 that it is turning to shared platforms to do more to lift profits.\u00a0After a similarly bad run in terms of its financial results, fellow French bank Societe Generale, another top-five eurozone lender by assets, has indicated it is heading in that direction too.During 2019, weakness in the global and European economies has heightened concerns over banks' longer-term returns and made it even more obvious that they need to shrink some of their activities, including sales and trading.\u00a0Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a, Societe Generale's chief executive, says there must be no taboos in deciding what to outsource. SocGen, in fact, was Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's original partner when Amundi was formed in 2010 as a merger of the two banks' fund management arms.\u00a0Although SocGen sold out in 2015, Amundi still has long-term distribution agreements with both banks \"\" and with UniCredit.\u00a0It's increasingly likely that similar schemes will follow.\u00a0\"You need to select your areas of expertise for investment and maintain the quality of the culture,\" Oud\u00e9a tells Euromoney. \"We are much more open than before to partnerships and technological agreements with other banks and financial institutions to create common platforms.\"This year, SocGen has seemed especially interested in outsourcing cash equities \"\" in line with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and UniCredit, as well as Belfius, Rabobank and Swedbank.\u00a0One-by-one, starting with UniCredit in 2011 and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole in 2013, these five banks have transferred their cash equities businesses to Kepler Cheuvreux.\u00a0All five now co-own the bank alongside the firm's management and, as of last year, Atlas Merchant Capital, founded by former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond.\u00a0Ceding control of cash equities businesses is an appealing model at a time when the EU's second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive has forced asset managers to be pickier, hurting smaller brokers.\u00a0Kepler Cheuvreux has grown to become one of Europe's largest cash equities platforms, with research on about 1,100 European stocks and a sales force covering around 1,400 clients.\u00a0In 2017, and for similar reasons, Natixis entered a similar joint venture with Oddo BHF.\u00a0 In a world that's being transformed so much, it does make sense to focus on your strengths, your key skills and the things you do well\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Carlos Torres Vila, BBVA On the other hand, for some banks, partnerships offer a consolidation opportunity, allowing some of their businesses to grow elsewhere in Europe. For example, SocGen has sealed agreements to insource cash management and structured products in central and eastern Europe from Hungary's OTP, after its purchases over the last year of several of SocGen's southeast European commercial banks.\u00a0Across Europe, the quest for partnerships has accelerated in the last three years, especially in 2019, according to James Davis, a capital markets consultant at Oliver Wyman in London.\u00a0\"Banks that are looking to insource are mobilizing more seriously, and there's a wider universe of banks looking to outsource,\" he says. \"Partnerships are not new as an idea. The difference is that there's a coincidence of needs now. There is more of a business and technology case.\"Rumours this year of a link between Deutsche Bank and UBS that would have exploited their relative strengths in fixed income and equities have so far not come to fruition.\u00a0Beyond the six to eight top-tier European investment banks, such as Deutsche and UBS, Davis points to a much longer list of perhaps 20 European regional or national champions that have sizeable sales and trading operations, which cannot aspire to compete globally.\u00a0For the top-tier banks insourcing a certain trading activity is not going to alter the generally losing dynamic in their battle to compete with the big US banks.\u00a0However, outsourcing partnerships can make a big difference to the economics of smaller capital markets operations, says Davis. The difficulty will then be things like labour law. Negotiating which jobs are lost and which transferred to the new platform is complicated and time consuming.\u00a0Nevertheless, as trading becomes more technology-driven and the regulatory burden becomes greater, banks will increasingly partner with other banks and with non-bank liquidity providers \"\" especially as a means to find greater economies of scale in low-margin business such as FX and government bonds, says Davis.\u00a0BNP Paribas' trading partnership with New York electronic market maker GTS, set up in 2017 and expanded last year to cover equities, is one example.Deutsche's exit from global equities this year is being achieved partly through the transfer of its prime finance and electronic business to BNP Paribas, although Deutsche still wants to do some primary business of its own.Global approachAlthough it's often out of necessity, European banks are in some respects blazing a trail in establishing new shared platforms. Especially in areas such as mortgage lending and servicing, they have previously tended more than US banks towards vertical integration of the financial services market, in part because the scope for home-market expansion of individual products and services has been more limited.\u00a0But in a uniquely difficult environment in terms of interest rates, regulation and competition, even European banks may at last be finding they cannot be everything to everyone.\u00a0The long-term effects of globalization and European integration, as well as digitalization, have made it easier and more necessary for some product lines to take a more continental or global approach, as competition increases and switching providers becomes easier.\"Do certain businesses make sense with the scale that we have, versus joining forces with others to have even bigger scale?\" asks Carlos Torres Vila, executive chairman of BBVA. \"In a world that's being transformed so much, it does make sense to focus on your strengths, your key skills and the things you do well. That direction means that we will end up leaving certain businesses we're in now, in terms of manufacturing them, in the hands of larger product specialists.\"In particular, Torres Vila points to insurance and asset management, sectors in which bank-owned players have traditionally relied on highly profitable captive clients in Europe but which also face the challenge of matching the digital investment by the bigger players.\u00a0Some bank-owned insurers, like their asset managers, are relatively small. This is especially true in Spain \"\" even at big banks such as BBVA \"\" where the market there is less developed than elsewhere in Europe.\u00a0In an era of negative rates and vanishing net interest income, banks are still keen to distribute these products, but not necessarily manufacture them. BBVA is already rumoured to have held talks to sell much of its insurance business into a joint venture.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Ralph Hamers,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">ING</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Torres Vila and ING chief executive Ralph Hamers both compare this open architecture-style distribution to the platform-style businesses big tech companies have built.\u00a0In line with the spirit of new open-banking regulations, they say it benefits their clients not just their bottom line.\u00a0\"I do think that if you really want to create the go-to platform for financial services, you can only do that credibly if you are also open to carrying third-party products,\" Hamers tells Euromoney.\u00a0As part of a move in this direction, ING has even bought a Dutch online estate agent. The Dutch bank used to own one of the world's biggest insurance companies until the EU forced it to sell as a condition of its 2008 bailout. Now it wants to distribute more insurance through its online-only banks in countries such as Germany and Spain.\u00a0ING is not seeking to buy back into the production of insurance.\u00a0Last year it entered into a white-label distribution agreement with France's Axa, covering non-life insurance in its online-only challenger markets. Hamers says similar future agreements could cover other products, such as investment funds, and the partnerships could be with other financial services firms, including banks.\u00a0Compared with an individual buying a spare phone charger from, say, Amazon's website, it is often necessary to have more structured partnerships in finance, so the product is better adapted to the distributor.\u00a0\"We're not going to take off-the-shelf Axa products for our customers, because it will not work,\" says Hamers.\u00a0Successful bancassurers such as Spain's CaixaBank and Belgium's KBC will also tell you their in-house products work well because they are adapted to their channels and their clients.However, insurance and asset management, like areas such as payments, are undergoing regulatory changes that will add to the technology struggles of smaller captive producers. You have to join things together: not in front of the customer but for example in the back office\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Helmut Schleweis, DSGV According to Mustier, Pioneer, its fund administrator with more than \u00e2,\u00ac200 billion of assets under management, had unit costs that were perhaps three times higher than the aggregated business now majority-owned by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\u00a0\"We have the same conditions as before for the network in terms of placement and management fees, but with a wider range of quality products,\" he says of Pioneer's 2017 sale to Amundi.\u00a0With \u00e2,\u00ac1.4 trillion in assets under management, Amundi has since become Europe's largest asset manager.As the Amundi deal shows, partnerships between bank-owned financial businesses will be crucial because banks have dominated finance in Europe until now and they want to maintain that dominance \"\" and not just in areas such as deposit taking, mortgage lending and trading.\u00a0Bancassurance, after all, is a European invention. Banks are much more dominant distributors of investment funds to retail and private clients in Europe than in the US.\u00a0The big French banks, with the exception of SocGen, own some of Europe's biggest insurers and asset managers. Incumbent banks also dominate retail payments across much of the continent.Banks are similarly important as consumer credit providers and they are growing that business, often through partnerships with other banks in European countries where they do have large deposit-taking operations.\u00a0Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Santander have large consumer credit businesses in Germany, and last year Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Consumer Finance signed a new distribution agreement with Spanish lender Bankia.\u00a0One of the most important partnerships of this kind is between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Italy's third biggest bank, Banco BPM. A deal sealed late last year saw their Italian consumer-finance joint venture, Agos, buy another Banco BPM consumer-finance subsidiary, Profamily, for \u00e2,\u00ac310 million and win an exclusive 15-year product distribution agreement with the Italian lender.\u00a0At the same time, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole committed to increasing its majority stake in Agos, helping Banco BPM plug a capital gap.Pooling back-office operations, such as IT, mortgage servicing and financial reporting, is another area where banks will seek to work together more in future, perhaps alongside private equity-backed companies.\u00a0<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jean-Laurent Bonnaf\u00e9,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">BNP Paribas</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Indeed, the scope that new technology offers to outsource non-core activities is the first reason BNP Paribas chief executive Jean-Laurent Bonnaf\u00e9 gives to explain why French and European banks like his have yet to reach their limit in terms of cost savings.\u00a0Bonnaf\u00e9 notes how new specialist platforms are growing up, sometimes with investment from banks.\u00a0\"We are doing a lot of non-banking processes in-house,\" he says. \"Any time we are not advising a counterparty, any time we are not running flows or lending, we are doing things outside the core banking universe. Now we may be developing offers ourselves, as there is no third-party offering, but ultimately there may be platforms that are strong enough.\"Know-your-customer processes (KYC) are an example Bonnaf\u00e9 gives. Already, the six biggest Nordic banks gained approval from the EU this summer to create a single jointly owned KYC utility, which they hope will make KYC checks more consistent, easier and more useful.\u00a0Banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Commerzbank, Natixis, SocGen and UniCredit, alongside Paris-based Tikehau Capital, are exploring a similar project, called Clipeum.\u00a0Banks have previously cooperated on banking infrastructure by creating Visa, Mastercard and Swift, as well as credit reference agencies.\u00a0More recently, Nordic banks have proved particularly adept at this, according to UBS research. Instant payment app Swish has rapidly gained traction in Sweden thanks to a partnership between the small number of institutions that dominate that market. Scandinavian banks are also cooperating on a pan-Nordic payments platform, P27.European banks have recently also been eager to partner on industry-wide adoption of blockchain technology \"\" largely because of their large global market shares in trade finance, especially commodities. Examples include we.trade, a platform of 15 banks; R3 Corda; and most recently komgo, a commodities trade-finance blockchain platform consisting of seven European banks and set up by a former SocGen banker.Chief executives are more cautious, however, on the scope to pool back offices, given the complexity of their legacy systems. UBS has been talking about shared services for half a decade, but only has a few elements running and now seems less than confident about accelerating the strategy. It might have missed the opportunity, partly because of leadership flux at its potential partner banks and because rivals feared it would gain an advantage over them.\u00a0Large multinational banks often struggle to unify their own IT systems, let alone pool them with other banks. Data protection and security are barriers. And, as the traditional back-office functions are rarely something banks set out to do, none of them are especially enthusiastic about taking a lead in developing joint solutions for it.\u00a0Torres Vila gives KYC as an example of an area where banks could share infrastructure for things that are not businesses rather than \"activities required to do our businesses\".\u00a0He says: \"It is not so easy to do, because the liability still remains with the bank. Typically, when we attempt to do this with other institutions, it just so happens that their criteria are not always exactly the same and the small print of the agreements is not always so easy to achieve because of that.\"But when it concerns products, outsourcing makes bankers genuinely excited about how partnerships can bring in clients and revenues. A bank with a large factory can gain market share through an agreement with a rival with less scale. At the same time, distributing better-value products from third parties may help shore up client loyalty.SantanderSantander, like other banks, is trying to build on perceived strengths in manufacturing, while following a platform-style relationship strategy.\u00a0In April this year in London, executive chairman Ana Bot\u00c3\u00adn told investors the bank was seizing the opportunity to move away from nationally focused vertical integration.\u00a0\"If we do well in these businesses for ourselves, we should be able to offer them for others,\" she said, pointing to areas such as payments.A new global payments division, set up this year, is now a core element of how Santander plans to leverage its existing economies of scale and to capture certain businesses from other banks.\u00a0The Spanish group has big retail market shares in about 10 countries in Europe and the Americas. In the future it thinks it can win more business in the bank-owned payments sector, as the big tech firms help push out medium-sized lenders.Bot\u00c3\u00adn tells Euromoney it is vital that banks such as Santander maintain and grow their payments business, because the increasing incursion into the global payments industry by firms like Apple and Google is a big threat to their relationships and, therefore, profits.\u00a0\"Retail banking is about payments,\" she says. \"It matters hugely to banks if they lose the payments businesses, and it matters to the customers as there's less competition. Medium-sized banks will be taken out.\" You need the gravitas in the market before people see you as a potential partner\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Tamaz Georgadze, Raisin Santander is one of the top-10 merchant acquirers worldwide, one of the five of those that are banks. Merchant acquiring has been a cornerstone of the turnaround of its Brazilian business. Its 2014 purchase of a majority stake in Brazilian payment-processing firm Getnet \"\" followed by the purchase of the remaining 15% last year \"\" has helped it cement relationships with local corporate clients.\u00a0Having grown market share in Brazil, the next stage will be to launch Getnet in Mexico and then Europe.\u00a0\"We think we can do payments better than others, and we will offer that service to other banks that don't have our scale,\" says Bot\u00c3\u00adn. \"Because scale matters, we have to choose where we compete. We can't do everything for everyone.\"Santander is not the only large bank looking to its in-house payments businesses as a potential consolidator. This year's \u00e2,\u00ac6 billion IPO of Milan-based payments firm Nexi offers another example. It achieved a valuation of 17 times earnings, after growing out of Italian cooperative central institution ICCREA and gradually winning business from other banks.\u00a0Last year Natixis considered a multi-billion euro bid for Ingenico, a Paris-based payment-processing company with a global client base of banks.\u00a0The logic was that Ingenico, under Natixis, could have gained the added scale benefits of the BPCE network (France's second biggest retail bank) while retaining its listing and therefore some of its independence to gain business from other banks.By contrast, moving in the other direction, Santander announced in April it will transfer its custody business in Spain, and a near majority of its custody business in Latin America, to Caceis.\u00a0Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Caisse d'Epargne, now part of Natixis' parent BPCE, merged their investor servicing arms in 2005 to form Caceis, which has grown in part through acquisitions of other banks' custody arms. (BPCE still uses the firm, even after Natixis sold its stake in 2017.)Now Santander will own only 30.5% of Caceis while the French group continues to own the majority.\u00a0\"We are the biggest custodian in Latin America, but we didn't have the right scale in Europe. Combining the two groups will give us global scale,\" says Bot\u00c3\u00adn.Bot\u00c3\u00adn says similar cooperation with other banks could follow the custody agreement, including in areas such as asset management.\u00a0Private equityAccording to Brassac, the trick in these kinds of partnerships, as with Amundi, is that long-term retail distribution agreements are complex to disentangle.\u00a0\"Life is fragile; a capital organization can be fragile too,\" he says. \"The challenge is that you have to be the best; you need to satisfy the partner and sign the term sheet.\"Ultimately, however, the partnership is more likely to renew in years to come if the manufacturer maintains the long-term efficiency and competitiveness of the product. That in turn may be reliant on a proliferation of distribution partnerships, often through more acquisitions, which is something few European banks can afford.\u00a0Some mutual groups are at an advantage here because they are less focused on dividend payouts (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's regional mutual banks participated in the capital raising that accompanied Amundi's acquisition of Pioneer.)\u00a0Yet this need for capital is also where private equity steps in. As they purchase banks' non-performing loan portfolios, private equity firms are also buying up and consolidating banks' NPL servicing arms, building them out on a European scale.\u00a0US private equity firm Fortress bought UniCredit's NPL management arm in 2015, creating doBank. It has since signed a service agreement for NPLs with Greece's biggest banks last year. This year it agreed to acquire Spain's Altamira, previously an equivalent at Santander.One former top banker who advises funds investing in shared banking platforms in Europe says the added advantage of private equity is as an independent party to bang heads when potential partners hesitate to work together for fear of benefitting a rival \"\" as in a 2011 investment by French private equity firm Blackfin in Kepler, preceding the latter's partnerships with UniCredit, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and others.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jean Pierre Mustier,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">UniCredit</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Mustier was head of UniCredit's investment bank in 2011 before leaving the bank for two years in 2014, so the Kepler deal was largely his call. He knows more than most about how reticent bankers will be to cede territory to a rival.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's very hard to find the right tie-ups,\" he says. \"You usually need a neutral party. Kepler Cheuvreux is neutral; Amundi is almost neutral, as it's listed. Otherwise potential partners fear the other will take advantage of them, specifically if it's in the same country.\"</p><p>Firms such as Kepler Cheuvreux have shown how to do it.\u00a0</p><p>Chairman Laurent Quirin set up Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's research and brokerage unit in the late 1980s, before founding Kepler in 1997. He says that the secret to the firm's profit-sharing agreements for equity capital markets is that each partner exclusively originates deals in the states where it is strongest \"\" Belfius in Belgium, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole in France, Rabobank in the Netherlands and UniCredit in Italy and Germany.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's a partnership that works,\" Quirin told Euromoney late last year. \"The local banks are very strong in their local markets\"\u00a6 This local approach is totally unique in Europe. We continue to think that the service to clients is better for it.\"\u00a0</p><p>Natixis' partnership with Oddo for research and distribution is similar to the Kepler setup as Natixis owns a minority (5%) of a larger cash equities platform, one which also includes Germany.\u00a0</p><p>Natixis takes care of primary market business on an exclusive basis in France. That leaves open the possibility for other banks to join later, perhaps in Germany but not France.\u00a0</p><p>\"You need a certain level of alignment,\" says Marc Vincent, head of Natixis' corporate and investment bank. \"It's important to have a long-term agreement. It has to be a win-win strategy. You can't afford to change the partnership after three years.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the presence of cooperative groups in so many of these tie-ups is no coincidence. While individual mutual banks remain focused on distinct regions within a country, some have gained economies of scale, without fully merging, under commonly owned central bodies such as CASA and Natixis.</p><p>At origin those central offices provided liquidity and risk management, and wholesale banking. Over the years, however, they have also been forced to develop commonly owned IT systems and product factories, which are partially independent \"\" even listed \"\" but still enjoy preferential distribution with the network banks.\u00a0</p><p>Would-be cross-border operations by Europe's private-sector banks face some of the same challenges and opportunities.</p><p>Consolidation of product specialists and back offices is accelerating, even in Germany, making it something of a Europe in miniature in this regard.\u00a0</p><p>DZ Bank became the central institution for all Germany's 900-odd cooperative banks in 2016, after acquiring its last regional equivalent, WGZ, based in North Rhine-Westphalia. Last year, DZ also integrated the cooperative network's IT and mortgage platforms.\u00a0</p><p>Through DZ, the cooperatives already own Germany's biggest bancassurer, R+V, and the biggest bank-owned asset manager, Union Investment.\u00a0</p><p>So far, the Landesbanken have consolidated to a much lesser extent than DZ.  </p><p> Helmut Schleweis, president of the DSGV</p><p/><p>Helmut Schleweis, president of the DSGV, the savings banks' association, is convinced that there will eventually be one mega-Landesbank.\u00a0</p><p>Even before that happens, Schleweis says the savings banks can do more to work together and gain better efficiency in their products and processes.\u00a0</p><p>\"You have to join things together: not in front of the customer but for example in the back office,\" he tells Euromoney. \"We have to do our homework, no doubt. We have to look at how we can create added value and decrease costs.\" Do banks need their own products?</p><p>Partnerships between banks \"\" and between banks and non-banks \"\" will happen when one side comes to believe a certain product or a certain activity is no longer essential to its business.\u00a0</p><p>That is why asset gathering, back-office services and some payments and trading have all proved promising for structured collaboration between established financial institutions in recent years.</p><p>But what about their most basic maturity transformation function? In the open-banking era, could some banks or so-called banks eventually outsource all their deposit-taking and lending activities, while others rely on them entirely to distribute their products?</p><p>It would certainly be wrong to assume that banks are only interested in the development and manufacture of products.\u00a0</p><p>\"In the digital world, what you call distributors are the companies that have the big value,\" says Carlos Torres Vila, BBVA's technology-obsessed executive chairman.</p><p>Albeit in a rather piecemeal fashion, banks are already moving in the direction of offering some third-party loans, particularly consumer finance, and some mortgages (like ING's ownership of German broker Interhyb) and small and medium-sized enterprise credit (through fintech firms such as Kabbage, another ING partner).\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, some banks are also offering deposits from third parties, especially in Germany, where savers' predilection for deposits is an increasing burden for banks, thanks to negative interest rates.\u00a0</p><p>Commerzbank has started to do this through Raisin, a Berlin-based marketplace for deposits with generally small banks across Europe. Deutsche Bank is doing something similar through Hamburg-based Deposit Solutions.  </p><p> Tamaz Georgadze, CEO of Raisin</p><p/><p>Raisin's co-founder and chief executive Tamaz Georgadze says the firm's website is still its biggest distribution channel, but the partnership channel is growing faster, thanks to the impact of negative rates on German banks, and as Raisin itself establishes a track record.\u00a0</p><p>\"They reinforce each other,\" he tells Euromoney. \"You need the gravitas in the market before people see you as a potential partner.\"</p><p>So far, no established banks are going so far as to consider getting rid of their balance sheets. But perhaps even this will come.\u00a0</p><p>\"We are right now quite integrated, having the manufacturing and the relationship,\" says Torres Vila. \"We're not abandoning the product and manufacturing side. We're talking about [partnerships in] places where infrastructure sharing makes sense \"\" or products that are less in our core, like insurance or asset management.\u00a0</p><p>\"It might mean that for some of the core products, also, if they get really disrupted, we might do the same.\"</p><p>Newer online-only challenger banks, such as the UK's Monzo, have even fewer qualms about acting like price-comparison websites. However, as with Yolt, the price-aggregation app launched in the UK and elsewhere by ING, and which launched a partnership with Raisin in October, they haven't yet made much money from it.</p><p>Ralph Hamers, ING's chief executive, says it will still be vital to have control of the train of intermediation \"\" branches and apps \"\" as well as the tracks of balance-sheet management, despite the regulatory and operational issues the latter involves.\u00a0</p><p>\"The train in banking is very difficult to make profitable; banks make their money in their balance sheet,\" he says.</p><p>Banks, Hamers imagines, could chose to rely entirely on partnerships with the likes of Facebook and Amazon to distribute their products.\u00a0</p><p>\"That could be the future,\" he says. \"I wouldn't need branches. I wouldn't need an app. I would just provide products out of my balance sheet, and infrastructure for payments.\"\u00a0</p><p>The problem, he says, is that they would lose all their bargaining power over pricing in these arrangements. \"You need to have the client interaction.\"</p><p>The bank must therefore offer other firms' products to maintain its credibility as a trusted portal. Even so, the bank will continue to try to sell more of its own products; it will be successful in doing so as long as it has better knowledge of its clients and better manufacturing economies of scale.\u00a0</p><p>  The banks that build their rivals</p><p>For some companies, even some established banks, sharing the basic digital and regulatory underpinnings to banking products and processes is not just a means to better efficiency but also a business with growth prospects.\u00a0</p><p>Germany's Solarisbank, a self-styled \"tech company with a banking license\" founded in 2016, is the best known of these in Europe. Spain's BBVA and Dutch bank ABN Amro, alongside Japan's SoftBank and Visa, are backers.\u00a0</p><p>Solarisbank offers fintech, e-commerce companies and big tech products such as white-labelled bank accounts, client identification, algorithmic credit scoring, transactions and payment cards. It also offers online consumer-loan systems and know-your-customer processes to banks, including some of Germany's public-sector and cooperative banks.  </p><p> Andreas Bittner, COO of Solarisbank</p><p/><p>\"As we have a European banking licence, we can passport easily, for example offering electronic-money products in other countries such as Italy,\" says Solarisbank's co-founder and chief operating officer Andreas Bittner, previously at Swiss core banking software firm Avaloq.</p><p>Competitors are already emerging.\u00a0</p><p>US private equity company Warburg Pincus \"\" also a backer of Avaloq \"\" is funding Vodeno, a basic banking IT infrastructure provider that will rival Solarisbank. Vodeno is based in Poland.\u00a0</p><p>Wojciech Sobieraj, previously the founder and chief executive of Alior Bank, a successful Polish consumer lender, is rumoured to be involved.'Bank in a box'</p><p>Using public cloud services from Google, Vodeno plans to target retail and small and medium-sized enterprise financiers across Europe, and not just startups that want a \"~bank in a box'.\u00a0</p><p>An insider says Vodeno could help bigger European banks that have fallen behind in technology to launch a new mortgage-lending or customer on-boarding process, for example.</p><p>Last year, France's Societe Generale bought another rival to Solarisbank, Treezor. Treezor's chief executive Eric Lassus says SocGen will remain an arms-length investor, in part to help it win business from other banks.</p><p>Most radically, BBVA has previously talked about this kind of \"platform as a service\" as a future orientation for the bank itself.\u00a0</p><p>Although it is still only three years since its launch, BBVA API Market has found some commercial success, especially with US startups, according to executive chairman Carlos Torres Vila.\u00a0</p><p>Torres Vila says the entry into banking of bigger technology companies constitutes \"a very promising field\" for the initiative \"\" ride-sharing apps seeking to provide financial services to their drivers and customers, for example, or social media messaging apps that do payments.\u00a0</p><p>\"Our view is that these global digital players, whether they are big tech already or startups, are going to require those banking services everywhere,\" he says. \"Whoever provides the banking as a service will need to have that offering everywhere.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1hwhj025s4gj3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKC-GBK1-JD1P-T4V0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5902\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Google, IBM and Microsoft all report their profit numbers on Thursday.</p><p>It's also a big week for the drug sector, with biotech giant Genentech reporting later yesterday, followed by Johnson and Johnson today and Abbott Labs tomorrow.</p><p>The beleaguered airlines sector is also well represented, with American Airlines' parent AMR reporting tomorrow, along with Delta Airlines, and Continental chiming in on Thursday.</p><p>In case that's not enough for investors to digest, Coca-Cola, United Technologies and Ford report on Thursday, as well.</p><p>'And you can't ignore the economic data this week, either,' said Mr Battipaglia. Today, retail sales for June are reported. On the same day, the Empire State survey is reported and producer prices for June are released. The CPI, which measures the all-important consumer inflation data, is scheduled for release tomorrow morning, as is industrial production.</p><p>The Fed is scheduled to release the minutes of the last FOMC meeting tomorrow. That dovetails nicely with the two days of congressional testimony on the economy by Mr Bernanke beginning today.</p><p>Thursday's calendar brings weekly jobless claims, housing starts and the Philadelphia Fed survey for July.</p><p>Economist Joel Naroff at Naroff Economic Advisors noted: 'If we get more solid numbers this week, it could mean the difference between a one-day rally or a week-long rally.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-080715028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4T0C-46N0-TX7D-J09J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"587\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>July 15, 2008 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001QYX</classCode><className>FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORP (FREDDIE MAC)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002RVS</classCode><className>FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (FANNIE MAE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0001WOB</classCode><className>ABBOTT LABORATORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC0001VUD</classCode><className>AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC00027GQ</classCode><className>JOHNSON &amp;

That\u2019s a pity. The higher and longer the boom, the more who get sucked up in it.   It had seemed September was bringing a smidgeon of sense to the momentum mania that propelled \u201ctech\u201d stocks here and elsewhere to record highs in August, prices so high that they dragged the overall  S&amp;P500 index with them.   And it still might be \u2013 dead cat bounces are to be expected as a bubble bursts \u2013 or the fever could continue.   It\u2019s not possible to predict irrational behaviour, other than to know at some stage it will unravel.   While the headlines have been full of the American tech sector\u2019s dizzying surge, it was a surprise for me to see that Australia\u2019s fledgling tech index was the world\u2019s best performed by a very long way since the March COVID bottom.     As the Ophir Asset Management co-founders Andrew Mitchell and Stephen Ng explained in their latest newsletter covering last month: \u201cMuch of this can be attributed to Afterpay rising a staggering +927% over this period; though Nearmap (+250%), Codan (+176%), EML Payments (155%), Megaport (+151%), Data#3 (+137%) and Wisetech (+135%), Appen (+99%) and NextDC (+75%) have shown the Australian IT market is not a one-trick pony during the market recovery.\u201d   Well, maybe not one trick, but heavily reliant on the Afterpay game.   At Thursday\u2019s close of $75.63 a share, it has dropped 21 per cent from its $95.97 August high \u2013 but still has a market capitalisation of $21.5 billion.   That\u2019s, um, pretty amazing for a company that lost $23 million in the past financial year and had EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation) of just $44 million.  The share price is based on momentum \u2013 it\u2019s going up because it\u2019s going up \u2013 and the blue sky potential of the company rolling out its consumer finance product unimpeded.   The share price is based on momentum \u2013 it\u2019s going up because it\u2019s going up \u2013 and the blue sky potential of the company rolling out its consumer finance product unimpeded.   (Since I last mentioned Afterpay in these pages , NAB has launched a no-interest, no-fee credit card aimed squarely at Afterpay\u2019s target market, an indication of competition to come.   And ahead, when the Reserve Bank resumes normal work, is the likelihood of merchants being allowed to pass on the high fees Afterpay charges them. At present, in something rather like retail price maintenance, merchants are forbidden to do so.)     But Australia\u2019s little tech sector doesn\u2019t add up to a hill of beans in this crazy world, also known as the US market where Apple\u2019s market cap last month was greater than the entire value of the FTSE 100 \u2013 the largest 100 UK companies.   British market veteran and commentator Anthony Peters has been watching the tech show with all the scepticism of those who have seen these sorts of movies before, albeit always with acknowledgement of the John Maynard Keynes quote: \u201cMarkets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\u201d   Ahead of Wednesday night\u2019s bounce, Mr Peters observed: \u201cOn August 19th Apple broke through the $US2 trillion market cap. Since then it has handed back $US325 billion or, looked at a different way, the equivalent of the sum total of its projected 2021 revenues or one and a half times the market cap of the newly anointed Dow component Salesforce.  \u201cThis is a great time for playing with silly numbers. The Big Six were collectively worth around $US5 trillion at the beginning of the year. At their peak a week ago today that number had risen to $US8.2 trillion. As at close of business last night that figure had shrunk to $US7.1 trillion.   \u201cSo even after the great September swoon they are still worth over $US2 trillion more than they had been at New Year.   \u201cOptimists see an overdue correction and a probable buying opportunity. Pessimists smell blood and the beginning of the end for the great countercyclical stock bubble. One of them might be right.\u201d   And then there\u2019s Tesla, for which Mr Peters has what you might call a special regard: \u201cMeanwhile Tesla, the bedroom-bound, top-knot sporting geek\u2019s favourite toy, took a 21.06% \u2013 not joking \u2013 hit yesterday to close down $US88.11 at $U330.21. On Tuesday the stock had closed at $US502.49.   \u201cThat said, a year ago you could have bought it at just over $US43 so who\u2019s the fool?   \u201cAt the time of writing it had dropped further to $US324.15.\u2019\u2019  Entrepreneur Elon Musk used his SpaceX rocket to launch his Tesla on a course to Mars. Photo: AAP/SpaceX  Among the stunts pulled by Tesla founder Elon Musk has been sending one of his cars (minus the expensive heavy bits) into orbit around Mars.   Tesla\u2019s share price has departed further from the company\u2019s expected earnings than that car has from Earth.   It is simply not possible to imagine Tesla earning enough profit in a reasonable lifetime to repay the top prices for its shares.   That\u2019s the way capitalism was supposed to work \u2013 companies earned profits to reward shareholders for taking equity \u2013 but that goes out the window when the game is on. The game is called \u201cthe greater fool\u201d.   Tesla is not like the Big Six tech giants, the FAANGM made up of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google and Microsoft.   Unlike many of the Dot.Bomb stars, they are big companies with real businesses and big profits , albeit in the case of Netflix helped by some generous accounting.   (Tesla surprised the market by actually reporting profit in the latest quarter \u2013 $US104 million \u2013 when a loss was expected. But that profit was on sales of $US6 billion and thanks to regulatory credits. Its market cap is \u201conly\u201d $US341 billion. The price/earnings ratio is too ridiculous to bother calculating.)  Aside from momentum, the greater fool game and money being as good as free while central banks are running the printing presses hard, the justification for buying Big Tech is that it is supposed to be less subject to the economic damage caused by the pandemic.   As Gavekal Research summarised it: \u201cWith millions working from home, forced to seek their entertainment from the sofa and obliged to do their shopping over the internet, Big Tech has been the big winner from COVID-19.   \u201cIn a world where the biggest fear of investors is that policymakers will decide once again to lock down entire populations, the stocks of Big Tech (and health care) are the obvious anti-fragile assets of choice.\u201d   On the other hand, Big Tech is priced to perfection. Like our little Afterpay, it is possible to imagine regulatory hurdles down the track.   No, not like the Australian government\u2019s attempted heist, as Crikey\u2019s Bernard Keane has described the plan to steal money primarily for the benefit of News Corp and Nine Entertainment , but first by a co-ordinated international effort to tax them fairly and, secondly, by reinserting fangs into US anti-trust law and enforcement.   Both are a way off \u2013 they would require a responsible US government to start with \u2013 but they are closer than Mars.   In the meantime, there\u2019s the game.   A worry is that there are many rookies playing along at home \u2013 people with little or no market experience who think trading is easy, based on their experience since the March low. That hasn\u2019t been the real world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I'm Julia Chatterley. This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Quarantine completed: Passengers leave the ship docked in Japan despite the coronavirus spread.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bloomberg Buyer. The billionaire says in the campaign, he will sell up if elected President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And I beg your pardon. President Trump pardoning junk bonds King, Mike Milken, among others.</p><p>Is it only Wednesday? Yes, it is. Let's make a move.</p><p>Welcome once again to a particularly stimulating FIRST MOVE this morning or at least, I'll try to. Why? Well, the stimulus hopes in the air from China, from other places around the world, too. I'll talk you through it.</p><p>But first, take a look at what we're seeing right now for U.S. futures. We do look to make some pretty good gains this morning. That of course follows Apple spoiling sentiment with their revenue warning Tuesday, though we finished off the lows and I do think that's important.</p><p>The NASDAQ in fact managing to eke out a fresh record high even if the rally that we're seeing here as we've described on the show, narrower and more defensive.</p><p>Apple though actually could lend some support today, were higher by around five tenths of one percent premarket. That follows yesterday's two percent drop.</p><p>What about Europe? Well, markets are higher thereto. Italians stocks, in fact, hitting their best levels in over a decade. Asia stocks meanwhile, a bit mixed. China is back a little bit. The Nikkei though in Japan ending higher.</p><p>Export data for January coming in less awful -- let's call it that -- than feared. Still down some two percent, but I think the key today is that we seem to be seeing some thinking outside of the ordinary stimulus box or toolkit.</p><p>There are reports that China is considering cash bailouts for the airline industry. Also, China announcing new support for businesses thereto. Chinese firms able to raise cheap cash to government supported so-called coronavirus bonds. And they aren't alone.</p><p>Turkey cutting interest rates today. The South Korean President calling for emergency steps to support their economy. Singapore has also unveiled a $4 billion plus stimulus package, too.</p><p>Meanwhile, we've got a whole slew of Federal Reserve officials speaking today. So watch for their views specifically on the outbreak and perhaps the need for further economic support here.</p><p>Let's get to the drivers because we do begin once again, with the latest on the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>More than 2,000 people now known to have died as a result of the outbreak. President Xi says progress is being made to stem the epidemic, but Beijing has expelled \"Wall Street Journal\" reporters over an opinion piece that they wrote calling China the sick man of Asia. None of the journalist being expelled were the actual authors, in fact of that opinion piece.</p><p>The other big development this morning, passengers have begun disembarking from the Diamond Princess. The cruise ship had the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside of China. Mat Rivers is in Yokohama for us on this story.</p><p>Great to have you with us. There were criticisms all the way along that the quarantine efforts being made aboard this cruise ship simply weren't working given the spread of the virus, but some alarming suggestion about how the passengers were disembarking and using public transport and taxis and things. Talk us through what we saw.</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, I mean, basically what's happening here, Julia is, this is the Japanese government holding to the line that they believe that the quarantine measures that they've undertaken onboard this ship since February 3rd are working.</p><p>They looked to these new cases and we saw another 79 positive diagnoses for the coronavirus on board this ship amongst passengers, but they say that these new cases are not being spread post quarantine. They say that anybody that has a new infection, well, they picked it up before the quarantine started and it just took a while to manifest.</p><p>Now, there's a lot of outside experts and there's a lot of passengers that are quite skeptical of that, and yet you continue to see Japan say no, we are holding to this line to the point they're so confident in it that they're letting people off this ship.</p><p>Eight hundred people tested negative for the coronavirus earlier. You know, over the last couple of days, none of them presented any symptoms as they got off the ship today and so they took taxis, they took buses, they took private cars, and they went home and that's what we're going to see over the next couple of days.</p><p>Now Julia, we did have a chance to speak exclusively with the CEO and President of Princess Cruise Lines, that would be the ship's operator here, Jan Swartz and she basically says -- we had a chance to ask her about the worries of passengers and experts about what Japan is doing here. Here is what she had to say.</p><p>[09:05:15]</p><p>JAN SWARTZ, PRESIDENT, PRINCESS CRUISES: What I can say is today as our guests disembarked, they had tested negative for coronavirus. They had a health check right before they got off. They had a thermal screening.</p><p>And the Japanese Ministry of Health issued them a certificate saying that they had tested negative for coronavirus.</p><p>So I would just defer those types of questions to the Japanese Ministry of Health who have been in charge.</p><p>RIVERS: On a human level though, you can understand the concerns if you put yourself in the shoes of those passengers. You can understand why some people may feel that way or they might feel uncomfortable.</p><p>SWARTZ: I think on a human level, right, this is an unprecedented situation. I mean, nobody going on vacation thinks that they're going to be notified in the last days that they've got an extension of 14 days and they're not going to be allowed to leave their cabin.</p><p>So our heart breaks for everybody who experienced this situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIVERS: Look, what she's saying here essentially is, you know, the Diamond Princess staff is doing what they can to make the people on board comfortable in a tough situation. But ultimately, you know, they're a private company that have to operate by Japanese regulations here -- Japanese law, so even if they wanted to do something different, they can't. They have to do what Japan's Health Ministry tells them because they're currently in a Japanese harbor. They don't really have a choice here, and so they're going to keep doing that.</p><p>They're hoping for the best. They're working with Japan's Health Ministry. But from all indications, Julia, so far that we've seen, Japan's government is going to continue to hold this line and do what they've been doing and we're going to see all of these passengers get off the ship, you know, in the next couple days.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. We're just suffering from a broader lack of information here amid these concerns. Matt, but the standout word for me there was guest. These people don't feel like guests anymore. They feel like prisoners. So palpable relief, I'm sure for many of them.</p><p>Matt Rivers. Great to have you with us. Thank you so much for that update there.</p><p>Let's move on to our next driver. The E.U. is unveiling the shape of its digital future drawing up policies regarding the use of things like artificial intelligence, keeping trust, apparently at the heart of it.</p><p>Anna Stewart joins us now. Anna, trust in technology critical, but these plans do sound ambitious. What more do we know?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: So these are two big publications today, both with terribly boring names. We have the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence and we have the European Data Strategy Proposals.</p><p>Now, these are both starting points for how the E.U. wants to see the future digital market and regulation on it.</p><p>Both are thankfully, Julia, far more interesting than their names suggests. Now, on the AI side of things, they're looking at ways that AI can benefit all sorts of different sectors and businesses, but also, of course addressing the risks and challenges associated with it.</p><p>And so to fill out one of the more interesting bits, facial recognition, they're going to start a debate on when and how it should be used, for instance, in a public space, should it be used for public interest? And what level should that public interest be?</p><p>The most explosive announcement of the whole lot though was actually on the digital strategy side of things and data sharing because this felt -- and it felt like there's a swipe at American tech firms.</p><p>Essentially, they're saying that non-personal data that can be useful for various industries and businesses should be shared. It should not be held by any large tech firm. It should be available to all. They've said it should be available to all whether public, private, startup or giant. Now, it's just the proposals. They haven't said how they plan to force big tech giants who hold this data and protect it.</p><p>They don't say how they plan to do this in the future or of course, when this will be implemented. But I was actually in the press conference. Thierry Breton, who is the commissioner for digital did discuss the fact that they've already lost -- that he has already lost the first battle for personal data to these big American tech firms.</p><p>He says this is the second battle, the battle for industry data, and he says Europe is the battlefield -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. It's going to be fascinating to see what they do with that, and I would agree actually, Europe is the battlefield because the Europeans, particularly compared to the likes of the Chinese and the United States have always been on the front foot, whether it's antitrust, whether it's data privacy and breaches, specifically and actually, in other countries, we've benefited from the demands that the E.U. has made. This looks like the E.U. leading the way again here.</p><p>STEWART: Yes, once again, I think we saw that very much with GDPR in 2018. Protecting, you know, European citizens use of that personal data to a great groan, of course, from corporates that operate in Europe all over the world.</p><p>There are of course, as you mentioned, those big antitrust fines as well and the E.U. certainly slapped plenty of those on major tech firms, and that was something that was referenced today because slapping fines on a major company like Google or Amazon certainly gives them a penalty.</p><p>But the market could already be altered. Market share could already be taken and it's very hard to sort of address that situation.</p><p>[09:10:10]</p><p>STEWART: So Margrethe Vestager, the antitrust commissioner also speaking in the press conference said that part of this will be about preventing that from happening in the first place.</p><p>If data can be shared, perhaps these big giant tech companies can't actually get that market share in the first place. Highly controversial. I will be interested to see what the tech firms say themselves, and of course, perhaps we'll get response from the White House as well -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, precision regulation. I'm sure they'll turn around and say, Europe, this is why you don't have big tech giants because you regulate them to kingdom come quite frankly. Anna Stewart, thank you so much for that great job.</p><p>All right, let's move on to our next driver and to the 2020 White House race. Billionaire Mike Bloomberg seeking the Democratic presidential nomination would sell his company if he is elected in November. His campaign adviser telling CNN \"There will be no confusion about any of his financial holdings blurring the line between public service and personal profiteering.\"</p><p>Bloomberg of course is set to appear in his first Democratic debate tonight and Christine Romans has more. It couldn't have been more pointed perhaps to the not quite so arm's length, perhaps relationship between President Trump and the Trump business dealings. Who is going to buy Bloomberg? That's my other question here. What do you do you make of all of this?</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: And how much would it be worth? I mean, you had some estimates this morning saying it could be worth something like $60 billion, would they be able to find a buyer?</p><p>But look, that's all in the future here, and the point of this statement from the campaign is that they want to be 180 degrees away from Donald Trump and his family. They never want to be in a situation where it looks as if Michael Bloomberg is profiting from the presidency.</p><p>So going back to those old days where Jimmy Carter sold his family's peanut farm, Donald Trump did not divest of his company. In fact, his kids are running it and every time a foreign leader comes to Washington or New York or someplace where he has a resort, they stay there.</p><p>And the allegation is that the Trump family profits from the notoriety and the position of the President of the United States.</p><p>Look, we're going to probably hear about this tonight, maybe on the debate stage when we will hear Michael Bloomberg for the first time on this very public national debate stage for the President of the United States. It's a place he hasn't been before.</p><p>You know, he hasn't done a lot of interviews. He's been able to manage with his multiple millions of dollars, manage the conversation through very well done television ads.</p><p>Now, he will be asked questions and have to act like the other candidates on the debate stage tonight.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, the interesting thing as well and just in terms of policy is, is he just going to be another player for this center left, center ground with the likes of Klobuchar, Buttigieg, Biden are fighting over here, or does he present something else and can he unite them?</p><p>He announced he is fixing finance plans yesterday among some of his other policies here. What do we make of those, Christine? Where in the spectrum is he?</p><p>ROMANS: It looks like attack to the left. I think you're absolutely right. It's a little bit of an attack, but he's still solidly here in the middle of the pack. I mean, he is trying to hold that middle ground there with Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg and a few others and Joe Biden.</p><p>But this is attack to the left. He is talking about transaction tax. I mean, there are a couple of Wall Street analysts this morning, they were like, hey, what about that Wall Street is not going to have any problem with Michael Bloomberg theory. That's maybe gone after yesterday.</p><p>But this is still, you know, the primary season. This is still trying to find a Democratic nominee. So which Michael Bloomberg will we get here? He's a very -- you know, long seen as a pro-business guy. He knows how business works, but he's also very concerned about climate change. He's concerned about gun violence.</p><p>He spent a lot of money and built a lot of deep ties in Democratic communities and in cities and municipalities on these issues.</p><p>So he has ground game on those center left issues on the financial stuff. We'll see how that shakes out.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's going to be fascinating to watch. Christine Romans. Thank you so much for joining us on that story.</p><p>And sticking actually with the White House because President Trump issued an array of pardons on Tuesday. Mike Milken, the former investment banker known as the junk bond king was pardoned along with several others.</p><p>Paul La Monica joins us on this story. This is a fascinating one, Paul, for me because many people have been pushing for this -- decades in the making, we can call it.</p><p>He revolutionized access to credit for young companies, entrepreneurs back in the 80s with this particular market, and then it sort of all went wrong. What do we make of this decision by President Trump today?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, as you pointed out, obviously, Milken is the so-called junk bond King, really symbolizing that 80s greed is good sort of era that we then saw in the movie \"Wall Street\" with Michael Douglas.</p><p>I think, though that the issue was obviously he went to jail and served a little less than two years of a 10-year term for securities violations. But he's second act, Milken has been a major philanthropist with a lot of donations to cancer charities. He himself is a prostate cancer survivor.</p><p>And I think a lot of people feel that Milken has done much good in the past couple of years and has really reformed his image, of course, and that was one of the reasons why President Trump was willing to pardon him.</p><p>[09:15:26]</p><p>LA MONICA: I think there were a lot of people, including Rudy Giuliani in the inner circle of the White House, who led the prosecution against Milken when he was an attorney in the late 80s, that he felt that Milken deserves this. And I think a lot of people do agree that this was a good move on the part of President Trump.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a fascinating one. I mean, pushing money into charities, looking at research into things like melanoma and prostate cancer in particular. I mean, these are some of the things that spark up here. \"The Wall Street Journal\" today as well coming out and saying, look, we know this is controversial, but we think this is the right decision, too.</p><p>When we look at what happened here, do we think this is about money or simply just doing the right thing with someone who has done great good with their life and served their time?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think in this particular case, it probably is about being someone who has admitted his guilt and served his time and has reformed himself and gone above and beyond that, so I think that's really what's at play here.</p><p>Obviously, a lot of the other pardons are far more controversial politically, but I don't think you're going to see as much ill will towards Milken getting pardoned as what happened with say Blagojevich and DeBartolo and Bernie Kerik.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Take each case individually. Paul La Monica, thank you so much for joining us on that story.</p><p>All right, let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we are following around the world.</p><p>U.S. Attorney General William Barr is ready to call it quits, that is according to sources. Barr is considering resigning after President Trump ignored his pleas to stop interfering with Justice Department matters.</p><p>Barr said the President's tweets attacking law enforcement are making it impossible for him to do his job. The U.S. Secretary of State say \"America is prepared to talk with Iran only if they change their behavior fundamentally.\" Mike Pompeo was speaking on board his flight to the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh for talks with the Saudi Foreign Minister. He will also be visiting Amman.</p><p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex may not be able to hang on to the term Royal for much longer. The use of the word in their branding is under review. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle planned on generating income through their Sussex Royal brand as they work to become financially independent. I am not really sure how much of that matters.</p><p>All right. We're going to take a break. Coming up on FIRST MOVE, some out of this world returns for Virgin Galactic shareholders. What's got them stratospherically excited? Find out next.</p><p>Meanwhile, stuck on the ground. As Boeing does its best to get the 737 MAX flying, now, there's another problem with the plane. Stay with us. More to come.</p><p>[09:21:14]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE where stocks looks set to open in the green in this morning's session.</p><p>For all the volatility, in fact, stocks are still on track for their best month since June of last year. A bit of a different story though in the bond market.</p><p>Look at 10-year yields in the United States. We are -- what -- around 1.57 percent, but the 10-year and the three-month yields have inverted.</p><p>So that means the three-month going above the 10-year once again. In the past, not always, but it has been a recessionary signal.</p><p>We're also keeping an eye on Argentina today. Debt restructuring talks with the IMF is set to end in a worst case scenario. Are we looking at another Argentinian default? The first since 2014. We'll keep an eye on that. Lots to discuss.</p><p>Kristina Hooper joins us now. She's the Chief Global Market Strategist for Invesco. Great to have you with us.</p><p>KRISTINA HOOPER, CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, INVESCO: Great to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I actually wants to talk about coronavirus. You said the floodgates have opened. Apple in the last 24 hours. We had Adidas and Puma in the European session all saying this is going to have an impact on the numbers.</p><p>HOOPER: Oh, absolutely. Last week, we had Alibaba's head talk about how it is a black swan event. Tesla is warning about it as well.</p><p>So we're starting to see an impact on -- or expectations of an impact on earnings.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When do we start to perhaps price that to a greater degree because we've seen it hit specific sectors -- transport, the airline sector, in particular? Investors are focused on those specifically versus perhaps those with bigger supply chains.</p><p>I mean, Apple, two percent drops -- it's not much.</p><p>HOOPER: Well, it's not much, but I think it's also important to recognize that this is likely to be a short term phenomenon. And so that's what markets are really pricing in, it is this expectation that yes, we have a difficult quarter and then we move beyond it. So actually, I think the reaction has been relatively appropriate.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So it's back to the V-shaped recovery at some point in future quarters perhaps.</p><p>HOOPER: It could be a bit more like a U for a little while, but I do expect there to be a nice snap back as soon as we see some level of stabilization of the coronavirus, because keep in mind, we did have a lot of positive sentiment, just as coronavirus was emerging because of the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's a really important point to make. Also, and we've talked about it many times on the show, 60 percent of the world's Central Banks are also stimulating and I do think -- and we made the point at the top of the show today that there is a belief here that China will continue to stimulate the Federal Reserve stands ready to do something.</p><p>What's the likelihood of an insurance rate cut from the Federal Reserve here?</p><p>HOOPER: I think there's a very good chance of an insurance rate cut if the situation deteriorates. Keep in mind that the Fed thinks of itself as the world's central banker. So it doesn't necessarily have to significantly impact the U.S. economy. It impacts the Chinese economy and is impacting the global economy -- that may be enough.</p><p>This is just -- you know, we have to think of 2019 as a very significant about face for the Fed where it really started to change its mindset and create something of an expectation of a safety net, and I think that continues to this day.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you think the U.S. consumer though and we had this discussion on the show yesterday actually benefits in some way from lower energy prices, lower mortgage rates, the prospect perhaps of stimulus from the Federal Reserve, if indeed required.</p><p>HOOPER: Oh, absolutely. This is an environment where could that could be very good for the U.S. consumer given that oil prices should continue to come down, given that we should see rates come down in this environment. It would be an added kicker, of course if the Fed cut rates as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Also an added kicker and supportive perhaps of President Trump's political ambitions as well. We've talked many times about the importance of the U.S. economy heading into that election.</p><p>[09:25:10]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How many questions are you getting from clients about Bernie Sanders? Because my belief is we're sort of writing him off. Wall Street is writing him off. They think Trump wins.</p><p>There's also the Bloomberg dynamic perhaps. What are you saying to clients right now?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, I think you're absolutely right. I think the markets are overlooking it. And we're not hearing a lot from clients about this right now.</p><p>But I have been warning that if we get a few high profile primary wins by Bernie Sanders -- that might change the dynamic and cause investors to get nervous. I do think it could result in some very short term sell offs, particularly in specific sectors that we expect to be more highly regulated. But in general, it could create a selloff in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And Mike Bloomberg?</p><p>HOOPER: I think that markets right now or assuming that Michael Bloomberg is the backstop for Bernie Sanders. And so they're proceeding with this assumption that Trump wins.</p><p>But in the off chance that he doesn't, that the Democratic nominee would be Michael Bloomberg.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And very quickly, you said a potential market selloff in the case of Bernie Sanders, difficult to predict. We did that with President Trump as well. What kind of selloff are we talking about? And would it be a buying opportunity?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, I think that anytime we see a selloff just given the policy backdrop, which is so supportive of risk assets, any kind of selloff can be a buying opportunity for investors, because they're hard to come by, and we see rebound so quickly.</p><p>And I would expect some market jitters if Bernie Sanders continues to accumulate delegates and has any kind of high profile primary wins.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And are no bears in this market.</p><p>HOOPER: Exactly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Kristina, we've got to wrap it up. We'll get you back. Kristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at Invesco. The market opens next. We're back after this.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from the New York Stock Exchange and the opening bell this morning, marking the halfway point of the week. We've got a higher open.</p><p>Tech stocks in fact, making fresh record highs. We've got green across the board in Europe. Broader stimulus hopes and not only of course in China, but beyond including in the region. We will also hear what Fed officials -- Federal Reserve officials have to say about the economy and the prospects perhaps for more support going forward. We've got five members of the Board set to speak today.</p><p>The Global Movers. Let me walk you through those. Apple shares are higher, bouncing back from the two percent losses suffered on Tuesday following that revenue warning, coronavirus related, of course.</p><p>Tesla shares also higher. Analysts at Piper Sandler raising their 12-month price target on Tesla to $928.00 a share, the most aggressive target on Wall Street so far if you take out ARK Invest, of course, which is stratospherically higher.</p><p>Groupon shares under pressure this morning. The discount deal company reporting weaker than expected profits and revenues. It says it will stop selling merchandise on its site because of the fiercely competitive marketplace.</p><p>It will now focus on selling experiences like dancing lessons, and wine tasting.</p><p>Boeing today also in focus. The company admitting it found debris in fuel tanks of undelivered 737 MAX jets. The head of the program for the 737 calling it \"absolutely unacceptable.\"</p><p>Clare Sebastian has all the details. What do we know about this, Clare? When I saw this story, I was, quite frankly disbelieving. Does this mean debris left in the production process for some of these planes?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: That is exactly how it sounds, Julia. These are planes that are currently in storage. Don't forget, throughout this grounding, which has now been almost a year, Boeing has continued to produce these planes but it's had to store them, you know in parking lots in various other locations.</p><p>It says it found the debris during maintenance. It says it is conducting a robust internal investigation. It's taking corrective action in its production system.</p><p>Here's the quote from Mark Jenks who is the VP and General Manager of the 737 Program. He says, \"We're taking action after a range of foreign object debris ...\" FOD it's called, \" ... was recently found in the fuel tanks of several 737 Max airplanes in storage.\"</p><p>Now, they don't say how many. \"FOD is absolutely unacceptable.\" He says, \"One escape is too many. With your help and focus, we will eliminate FOD from our production system.\" That's a note to employees at the Renton Washington plant.</p><p>Now, bearing in mind there are around 400 of those planes that are in storage, so inspecting the more will be a big job.</p><p>Now they haven't said if this will push out the timeline for returning the 737 MAX to service. The latest we heard from the company is they expect to get approval around midyear, whenever that means.</p><p>The U.S. airlines have pushed out flights to August or September. They don't expect to have the plane back in service during the summer flying season. But this, Julia, definitely not the kind of looks that Boeing needs and will lead to further questions about, you know, their production system in general and what else is out there.</p><p>This isn't the first time the company has faced issues with the sort of foreign object debris on planes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and you raise so many great points there for me. Recertification is one thing, trust from consumers is entirely another as these problems stack up.</p><p>One thing I did notice and it was my second thought when I read this story, different in terms of communication, program managers straight out and saying, look, this is unacceptable. We're tackling it. We're going to address it.</p><p>Different communication strategy already, I feel from Boeing under a new CEO.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes, and we're hearing about this directly from Boeing. This is clearly part of the strategy, Julia. David Calhoun on the job, fighting just over a month now. He came in on the promise that this would be a new era of transparency.</p><p>And clearly, if they can't deliver on ending these issues that they have with the plane that keep coming to light as the grounding continues, they can at least deliver on that promise of transparency of getting out ahead of leaks, ahead of whistleblowers, you know, hearing it directly from Boeing, rather than the regulators. That I think is critical.</p><p>But this just adds to the challenges the company faces and don't forget, this is the second issue that's come to light this month. Just a couple of weeks ago, there was another software fix that were discovered during flight testing of the 737 MAX.</p><p>So there's a lot that the company is grappling with, and still we're approaching the anniversary now of Ethiopia Airlines Flight 302 that crashed in March last year and still no approval for the plane to fly again.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I remember the conversation I had with Emirates, and I said they can't get this wrong. And he said, the Chairman said, they are going to get this right. They have to get this right. Trust. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much.</p><p>All right shares of Virgin Galactic soaring. The stock up around 160 percent so far this year. Investors seemingly getting excited over plans to launch a commercial space service.</p><p>Matt Egan joins us now. Matt, what do we know about this commercial space service and investors clearly delighted, but it's really the only way to take risk in this sector.</p><p>[09:35:26]</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER: Well, Julia, we know that this stock appears to be defying the laws of physics. It's up eight days in a row, up double digit percentage again today. It's basically tripled since the end of last year, which is really just a stunning move.</p><p>And as you mentioned, it's really benefiting from the fact that if you are bullish on space tourism, this is really the only pure play for that trend and investors are getting understandably excited about Virgin's progress trying to launch passengers into space.</p><p>This is definitely an exciting place, but you know, it is probably time to tap the brakes a little bit on this stock. They haven't even reported results since they went public through that merger with a special acquisition company last year.</p><p>We know that they're not making money. They don't expect to make any money. Virgin is supposed to be reporting results next week, so we'll have to listen to what they say.</p><p>But what's really interesting, Julia, is that even some Virgin bulls are sounding a little bit nervous about this meteoric rise.</p><p>Just look at what Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a report just yesterday, Morgan Stanley said that they are very constructive on Virgin Galactic story and they said that the company has a pole position in space tourism. They could they could use that to potentially fund even bigger projects.</p><p>But Morgan Stanley said they think that the share price could use a breather. Again, this is from a Virgin bull, and that's because this stock has already blown by Morgan Stanley's $22.00 price target. It's now trading at $30.00 and above that.</p><p>So there is some nervousness even from some of the optimists. Julia, we should definitely keep an eye on this stock because eventually, gravity should catch up to it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it reminds me of Beyond Meat and the stratospheric rise that we saw after the IPO of that one, and analysts coming out and saying, yes, it's not that we don't like the story. We're just a bit concerned about how quickly this stock has risen.</p><p>I wonder though, given what we were saying earlier about this being really the only way to take risk if you want to as an investor in this space, does this entice the likes of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk to spin off their space divisions and monetize those?</p><p>EGAN: Well, Julia, you mentioned Beyond Meat. I mean, it does kind of feel like there's been more of these one stock manias lately. There was the boom and bust of Beyond Meat, the rise and fall of the cannabis company Tilray. Tesla is still enjoying this incredible rally. You sort of wonder if this is at all a byproduct of all that easy money sloshing around from global central banks.</p><p>But it is interesting to see, and you mentioned these other space companies. I mean, if you are Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, you've got to be drooling when you see these moves from Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, maybe they will try to take those companies public.</p><p>But I've got to think that the clock is ticking on this a little bit. If they're going to make a move like that, they want to do it when the economy is sturdy like it is now and they want to do it when it's basically free to borrow money right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, great points. Matt Egan, great to have you with us.</p><p>Now, we're going to take a quick break. We're going from destination space to destination zero. Carmaker JaguarLand Rover says its mission is to get to zero emissions, zero accidents and zero congestion. That conversation after this break.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. JaguarLand Rover unveiling a new electric concept vehicle Vector at the opening of the U.K.'s National Automotive Innovation Center.</p><p>The car is designed to provide autonomous rides in urban areas with zero emissions. I spoke to the company's CEO about the futuristic vehicle as well as the impact of the coronavirus on the company's business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RALF SPETH, CEO, JAGUAR LAND ROVER: The Vector is something that is special, creating a new kind of mobility, creating something which is very space efficient. On the other hand, zero emission and can be really -- then also charged by renewable energy and with fast charges and delivers individual public mobility and its autonomous ready.</p><p>It goes in the direction to integrate infrastructure and the car. They speak to each other and make sure that at the end of the day, we get a high safety and security in order to deliver a new modern smart mobility.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What kind of costs are we talking about for this? And how soon do you think we could see these kinds of vehicles on the roads?</p><p>SPETH: We will have these kind of vehicles with the first prototypes on the road within the next two years. We advanced. We have put the technology. We are also working together with partners in order to make sure that we have the latest technology and really fit for the purpose.</p><p>That is also the reason why we didn't come out immediately, kept it in the drawer and opened the drawer just today.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, I was looking on your website with regards Destination Zero, and we're talking zero emissions, zero accidents and zero congestion. And the numbers for me on accidents were mind boggling, 1.3 million people dying globally as a result of cars each year.</p><p>You make the comparison to it being like eight jumbo jets crashing every single day. We don't focus enough on safety on the roads and the benefits perhaps that autonomous technology could bring. Does the need to be more government focused, government investment in this, not just from the automakers?</p><p>SPETH: Yes, you're totally right. At the end of the day, no car company can do these kinds of Destination Zero on its own. We need to have collaboration. We have to have government, regional leaders, academia and industry across sectors together in order to make it happen.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I want to ask you about the impact, in least in the short term of the coronavirus outbreak. What does this mean for the supply chains that you have right now? And the potential impact on demand, what are you seeing?</p><p>[09:45:05]</p><p>SPETH: Yes, at the moment we are seeing absolutely a different picture. First of all, you mentioned demand. There are no sales at the very moment in China. Dealers are not back and there's no demand.</p><p>So that will be a huge impact, but we don't know how long it will take so we cannot give you any, let's say, prognosis or the forecast.</p><p>We have so much good in swing. Our team delivered until the day 28 last month, over and above the target, and all of a sudden there's nothing anymore so that's strange from a supply point of view. We have to feed both the factory in China, but as well the factories in Europe.</p><p>At the moment we are safe with two weeks in Europe. We are going to start the production in China next week, on Monday and we are safe for one week.</p><p>The rest, nobody knows at the very moment because nobody knows how long a government will ultimately close the regions, how long it will take, but also the tier two, tier three and tier four suppliers will come back on stream.</p><p>So we don't know what kinds of parts will be in short supply.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The CEO of JaguarLand Rover there.</p><p>And a look at today's Boardroom Brief. Adidas says the coronavirus has had a huge impact on its business in China. Activity there is down 85 percent according to the German sportswear company. It also said it has seen declines in Japan and in South Korea.</p><p>And Adidas's rival, Puma also says the virus is hurting the bottom line there. They said the travel restrictions in effect in China are impacting their business with fewer Chinese tourists going abroad. Sales are suffering in other markets, too.</p><p>Qatar Airways is increasing its stake in IAG, the company that owns British Airways. It paid around $600 million to raise its shareholding from 21 to 25 percent. Last month, AIG loosened its restrictions on the proportion of its shares that non-E.U. entities can own.</p><p>Okay let's take a quick break here, but the life of a freelancer is fraught with dangers. Often, it boils down to feast or famine.</p><p>After the break how Fiverr is putting work in their hands. Stay with us. We're back in two.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Come back to FIRST MOVE. Fiverr is one of those gig economy brands we keep hearing about. It's built at the-everything-store for digital services.</p><p>In other words, it's a marketplace for freelancers offering their labor. Its marketing plays heavily on low cost, high convenience. Check it out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maybe simplicity just isn't for you. So you'll find yourself in that overpriced boutique studio that charges triple for the same gig and think to yourself, well at least they gave me a tiny branded water bottle because they know how important it is to keep hydrated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No, not everything is a Fiverr. Sellers out their terms and their fees up front. Services offered include writing, graphic design, digital marketing, video and animation.</p><p>[09:50:12]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Micha Kaufman is the co-founder and CEO of Fiverr and joins us now. Great to have you with us.</p><p>MICHA KAUFMAN, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, FIVERR: Good morning, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I thought that lady was very excitable. It's borderline scary. Your numbers were out this morning and they look pretty good. Just talk us through your quarter because I know it's early days. You're investing money, but investors are liking what they're seeing.</p><p>KAUFMAN: Absolutely. So we had an amazing quarter, which is a great ending for the year. We've seen an amazing momentum starting with the first half of the year accelerating through the second half of the year.</p><p>And we're actually seeing that momentum carried into 2020 which makes us very excited about the year and has influenced our goals for this year, which are exceeding market expectations.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You're loss making? Target unprofitability? Does it matter?</p><p>KAUFMAN: It obviously does. The way we think about it is we're a young company with a huge market. So we're prioritizing growth. But we're doing it in a way that increases the efficiency of everything we do and you see that in the massive improvement of our EBITDA margins and the loss of the company, which are very small and shrinking.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Next year? This year? And then we'll move on.</p><p>KAUFMAN: I'm not giving a rate.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I have to try. One of the things that is interesting to me, firstly, that the sellers of their skills, set the price up front. So there's no fear factor on that this is a project that's going to escalate and I don't know what the endgame here in terms of price is going to be.</p><p>But the average spend, actually, is relatively low. It's around $170.00 per person. When I look at a competitor like Upwork, it's like $1,000.00. Why the difference?</p><p>KAUFMAN: So basically, the two companies are very different and are targeting very different types of audiences. Fiverr targeted mostly what we call the zero enterprise, we don't have a Salesforce, which is a great plus.</p><p>For us, that majority of our traffic actually comes organically, which is great. So these are different types of businesses.</p><p>That said, I think that the low spend per buyer is the opportunity. The fact that we can actually grow that and you see constant growth throughout quarters. So this is definitely being a tailwind and accelerating.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: $163.00, last time now, the average spend is $170.00. Where do you see that going?</p><p>KAUFMAN: Oh, so basically, as you think about the more established businesses, the medium-sized businesses, they spend $15,000.00 a year on freelancers, so you know, the room to grow is just amazing.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you think you can capture -- how much of that do you think you can capture? Because that's for all sorts of services, not just the sort of digital and video.</p><p>KAUFMAN: That is great, but when we look at just the categories in which we operate, the addressable market for that, in the U.S. is 100 billion. E.U. is one and a half times bigger than the U.S., so there's so much room to grow.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You're also introducing AI into the process, too. We went on the website to look at FIRST MOVE with Julia Chatterley. We have some examples of what I came up with. It takes your own inputs. I think I had pink and sparkly. Yes, it ignored me on most of those. I am sure what we think of those.</p><p>But talk to me about AI as well because you're trying to make the process simpler and facilitate the use of it. I wonder whether you're kind of doing your sellers out of a job here, perhaps too if computers can do it better?</p><p>KAUFMAN: Absolutely not. So what we're doing and I think this is probably one of the first times that a company is doing that is we're not trying to replace the human factor. We're trying to compliment on that.</p><p>So the way we do it is we allow our creative community to design those logos, but we use AI to make sure that those logos are being customized for customers. And that takes a lot of the work of customization from our freelancers.</p><p>So essentially what we're doing is we're using AI to their benefit instead of trying to replace them.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I know you're expanding globally as well, you're setup in Germany as well. What do you think the big challenge is going to be as part of that? Is it about hiring people? Is it about fast expanding?</p><p>Many companies struggle with just simply hiring the right people at this expansion stage.</p><p>KAUFMAN: So the good news for us is that we don't need to hire many people to run the global operations. What we've done is we've actually started testing in Germany of what does it take to increase the rate of growth of Germany?</p><p>And we've done it very successfully through soft localization and investing a little bit in marketing in Germany. And we've seen Germany right now growing much faster than the overall market base, which is great.</p><p>And what we've done recently is we launched two new languages, German and Spanish, and we're going to roll out two more languages as we go and we think that together with some brain marketing and performance marketing done in these countries, we will be able to increase the penetration rate in these areas.</p><p>[09:55:07]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We'll be helping you with that, too. It's a PR and the marketing. Micha, great to have you on the show. Thank you so much. Good to see you. Fiverr there. Come back and talk to you soon.</p><p>All right, that just about wraps up the show. Let me give you a look at what we're seeing as far as that market action is concerned. We are higher right now. The NASDAQ hitting fresh record highs of course, too.</p><p>As you could see there as well, the Dow higher by some three tenths of one percent. Can we hang on to these gains? Stimulus hopes, as I was discussing earlier on in the show.</p><p>Okay, we'll be back in a couple of hours' time with \"The Express.\" But for now, you've been watching FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours. We are going to work on my website design. We will see you tomorrow.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020021901cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7Y-WRN1-JB20-G2K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7653\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Stock Market, Economy, Coronavirus, Health and Medicine, Cruise Industry, Diamond Princess, Election, Michael Bloomberg, Prison, Donald Trump, Mike Milken</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Hearings &amp;

Her father, Town Moderator Mark DiSalvo, has served in town government on and off since he was the youngest elected School Committee member in the 1980s and even served as a presidential elector for Massachusetts in 1996. Her mother, Tricia Melvin, has volunteered for campaigns and recently served as the chairman of the North Andover Democratic Town Committee as that local party has ascended to majority power in North Andover's town government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"I was brought around to all this stuff my whole life,\" Celia DiSalvo mused.</p><p> She recently went through old newspaper clippings and found one, for example, referring to her as the youngest Democrat at annual Democratic Town Committee Scholarship Breakfast a few years ago.</p><p>     Culture shock</p><p> Celia DiSalvo graduated from North Andover High School in 2015 and went on to Gettysburg College, a private liberal arts school in Pennsylvania about a mile north of where President Abraham Lincoln delivered one of American history's most important speeches near one of the Civil War's bloodiest battlefields.</p><p> But it was the nation's 34 th president, not the 16 th, who steered DiSalvo's path there. In addition to the college's strong sense of community and proximity to Washington, D.C., she said, she chose Gettysburg College because it was home to the Eisenhower Institute, a center launched by Dwight Eisenhower's granddaughter in which students learn global politics and international policy from an array of experts in both Pennsylvania and Washington.</p><p> Life in southern rural Pennsylvania - which in 2016 was pretty solid Trump territory - was an awakening for her, though, as DiSalvo volunteered for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign that fall.</p><p> \"It was really different. I decided to get out of New England - I knew I'd come back here later at some point because all my family's here, etc. - and that was the first time I really felt a major culture shock was being down there in the middle of deep-red Pennsylvania,\" DiSalvo said.</p><p> Being on campus with like-minded college students was met with sharp contrast beyond the college's walls.</p><p> \"The second you left campus, there were Trump signs everywhere. Everyone just has a totally different dynamic,\" she continued. \"So that was difficult to deal with a little bit.\"</p><p> Like many difficulties life throws in the road, overcoming culture shock and venturing out of her comfort zone led to personal growth - something DiSalvo feels should be a main point of college in the first place - for her and her Democratic and Republican peers alike.</p><p> \"With some of my friends, we can talk about these issues because we're all informed,\" she said. \"I respect someone else's opinion if it's different than mine, as long as it's an informed opinion.\"</p><p> DiSalvo would also deal with her first big political disappointment, when Donald Trump not only won the presidency, but won historically-Democratic Pennsylvania as well.</p><p> \"I definitely had a period of time where I was discouraged. But I came home that next summer and said, you know, I can't diss this for the next two years or whoever knows how long,\" she said. \"This is what I'm interested in, and I have to get back up and keep on moving.\"</p><p> DiSalvo would later further her cultural expansion by studying in Spain during the spring of her junior year.</p><p> \"It was amazing. I lived with my Spanish host mother, and she knew like three words in English. And so I really improved on my Spanish while I was there,\" she said.</p><p>     Policy focus en route to Vienna</p><p> In the summer of 2017, DiSalvo interned in the Massachusetts State House, working on a research project on how the federal government might underfund the 2020 census (an issue gaining headlines today) and the potential impacts on states like Massachusetts with large immigrant populations.</p><p> \"People who maybe don't speak English - those people are harder to count - and then you could have awful public policy implications by losing a congressional seat, just because the census doesn't have enough money,\" DiSalvo explained.</p><p> And for DiSalvo, getting into the \"nitty-gritty of public policy,\" as she called it, redirected her interest from the allure of the political stage to the labyrinth of public policy research. The former, she believes, is irrelevant without the latter.</p><p> She researched differences in female politicians in Massachusetts and Maryland as well as income share agreements to fund college tuition, to name just a couple of her projects. In the former, she looked at how different state electoral structures impacted female lawmakers. With the latter, she examined the idea of students being issued grants from schools that are paid back by pledging a fixed percentage of income for a fixed number of years after graduation, contingent on securing a job with a minimum salary.</p><p> In her senior year, DiSalvo's new path would eventually bring her to Munich and Vienna as one of eight fellows at the Eisenhower Institute's Fielding Center for Presidential Leadership, which examines the American presidency through executive/legislative relations and constitutional questions.</p><p> Throughout last summer and the following school year, the eight fellows conducted a massive research project looking into data privacy differences between the United States and the European Union.</p><p> \"We studied all of the privacy laws that were in Europe and how they compared to those in the U.S., and they're more robust in Europe,\" DiSalvo explained.</p><p> New regulations implemented in the E.U. last June have complicated matters even more, and the issue has caught the attention of media observers in recent months as it's had implications for multi-national organizations and businesses. Google, for example, was fined $57 million by France for lack of transparency in how it collects and uses data.</p><p> \"The big thing we looked at was how U.S. companies that have customers in Europe dealt with that lag and difference in privacy laws,\" she continued.</p><p> The fellows researched what's known as the Privacy Shield, designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce through the U.S. State Department's Diplomacy Lab, and why American companies should opt into it to comply with the E.U.'s new General Data Protection Regulations.</p><p> The fellows were invited to show their research and its findings at the U.S. Consulate in Munich, Germany, and the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, Austria, this spring.</p><p> \"Going over there and presenting all this research we worked so hard on for a year, to high-level officials in foreign service, was pretty cool. And then seeing the American vs. European perspectives on what big tech companies do with your data is so drastically different,\" DiSalvo said. \"You think here in America it's all 'Oh, we have so much privacy,' but in comparison there's really none.\"</p><p> These study programs are beneficial, she added, because this research is all stuff the State Department needs anyway. And it gave her a chance to travel broaden her historical perspective even more with a little cultural immersion.</p><p> \"We went to the Dachau concentration camp while we were there,\" DiSalvo reflected. \"I had never been to a concentration camp before. That was pretty eerie. The thing with Dachau is it was the first concentration camp that was started because Hitler was based out of Munich. And they emphasized that it wasn't ever a death camp. It was solely just a concentration camp. But it was so interesting to find out that, in the beginning, it was for anyone who was vocal against Nazi Germany.</p><p> \"Just being there, seeing the expanse, how big it was and the tiny quarters that people would be in,\" she continued. \"There were only two barracks up, but there were still the foundations for 32 others. You couldn't imagine how many people could be in this one small space.\"</p><p>     What's next?</p><p> DiSalvo graduated in May and has returned to North Andover to plan her next moves. What those moves will be is still unclear. For the summer, she's working on scholarship and fellowship applications for graduate school.</p><p> On a bigger scale, she's also considering forming a national advocacy group relating to the work she did regarding the census.</p><p> \"The research I did for the census got turned into legislation in the State House,\" DiSalvo said. \"I came up with research recommendations of how states can fund and help counteract the underfunding and the potential undercount. Massachusetts is planning to use [recommendations], so I would like to be able to bring that to other states.\"</p><p> Mark DiSalvo needn't worry about a campaign challenge coming from inside the house. Celia DiSalvo says she's not planning any elected office runs at this time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-4475082</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898305CC4B378 NWBKMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WH2-XWX1-DXVP-V4M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1499\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 North Shore Sunday<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Let not your heart be troubled. We just saw you on Tucker's show. What do you think? It's this like - now, you're becoming like, kill me. You're on your way now. He does three hours of radio, three hours of TV. They fill me in on The Five. Fill it on outnumbered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: OK, Hannity. OK. My question to you is, why are you picking on poor Robert Francis. He looks like he should be in one of those little saddles like the little boy haircut where you get out of the saddle and you get the little cap gun and you're sitting there. I remember that my brothers would do that. He just looks like a boy. You're being mean now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HANNITY: Listen, my son is 20. It was not a good experience for a year or two, they're taking him to get that haircut. It didn't matter what seat you put him in.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, I think he's trying to be like - he's `trying to be like AOC. I don't get that sense, she's doing that cool Instagram, I'm cooking.</p><p>HANNITY: Drinking wine and putting together IKEA furniture.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Anyone have a good recipe for you know this Saturday. I think it's just ridiculous. But Hannity, your awesome reporting on what is about to blow in this Russia.</p><p>HANNITY: Oh! It's going to blow.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Investigation of the investigators. We have only scratched a little bit of the surface when it comes to Jim Comey and Brennan and company. I can't wait.</p><p>HANNITY: It's all coming. And you know what good that we fix it for the country. Sad that it all happened.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Absolutely. Sean, thanks so much.</p><p>HANNITY: Have a great show.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. Rudy Giuliani, Sol Wisenberg will be here in just moments to explain just how and why White House lawyers repelled that Jerry Nadler and the rest of the probe addicted Democrats. Plus, what might be the most consequential fight playing out across America today. Alabama's strict new pro-life bill just signed into law. Candace Owens will react to this and claim that this legislation and others like it adversely affects the minority community.</p><p>And Michelle Malkin is here with her first response to being censored by Facebook for arguing against censorship. You can't make that up. It's outrageous. And Kamala Harris points to Bill Nye as her climate guru vetoes reboot hits another pothole and a tribute to Tim Conway, Raymond Arroyo is here with seen and unseen. But first, the White House Council says it will not entertain any of the Democrats requests for more documents or interviews regarding the Russia investigation.</p><p>Today, Pat Cipollone sent a letter to the House Judiciary Committee Chair, Jerry Nadler saying quote congressional investigations are intended to obtain information to aid in evaluating potential legislation, not to harass political opponents or to pursue an unauthorized do over of exhaustive law enforcement investigations conducted by the Department of Justice. While Nadler naturally bristled at the response.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERRY NADLER, HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN: The White House and the Department of Justice is enabling the White House to try to evade all accountability to the American people. They're saying that the President is above the law saying in effect the President is a tyrant and a dictator with no limit on his power.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Joining me now is President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Sol Wisenberg, former Deputy Independent Counsel and Fox News Contributor. All right, Rudy, Cipollone also is saying that the Mueller Report makes their requests moot. Your reaction to that does Congress have any right to this information at all?</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, LAWYER FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP: Let me say something about Nadler's response that the President is a tyrant and above the law. This is a legal memorandum. I mean a jury might have a hard time understanding because he's not much of a lawyer but it's a legal memorandum, it's very well thought out, very well written. Obviously, it makes the point of executive privilege, but it goes way beyond executive privilege. It makes a very, very important point. I would have added Pelosi's statement last week that the legislature is the superior branch because that's the way they're acting.</p><p>They have issued not just - they have not just one hearing. They have six hearings. So, it has to be seen in the context of six hearings. They are - they have already issued hundreds of subpoenas looking for possibly a million documents or more. And we have Nadler, we have Schiff, we have Cummings. They're all kind of like want you know daytime television time. And the reality is, this is a tremendous burden on the executive and the law has a way to deal with it.</p><p>There are cases that say that legislative power is there, but it can't be used for an in-permissive purpose. It has to be a proper legislative purpose. In their subpoenas, their information requests, they don't cite a single piece of legislation, they're pursuing. Not only that, they are taking over an executive branch function. And they're afraid to call this an impeachment hearing. So, this is oversight. You don't issue hundreds of subpoenas.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So, Rudy, hold on. So, are you saying that if this were actually an impeachment proceeding, you wouldn't have any problem with turning over these documents.</p><p>GIULIANI: No, I wouldn't have a problem with it, because they really have to generate their own information. They can't be just redoing that. And if they were in good faith, they would read through the Mueller Report and they would say we now have all this information. We have 10 more questions or 15 more questions.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, well they're reading on the House--</p><p>GIULIANI: In fact--</p><p>INGRAHAM: They're doing a dramatic reading I think of the whole--</p><p>GIULIANI: Several recent federal cases make it clear that if you're going to impose on the executive it has to be tailored, it has to be narrow. It can't be overly intrusive. This is all those things. It's overly intrusive. It's completely burdensome. It is not only duplicative, it's multiplied by six.</p><p>INGRAHAM: This isn't even talking about the case that's in the DC, District Court now involving the President's financial records which they're also arguing in front of another Obama appointee.</p><p>GIULIANI: But I think they have to - I think the court, you have to argue these as one because as they affect the executive branch, they're not six separate hearings. You've got to - you have to respond to this avalanche of subpoenas which means you've got to close down shop.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, it's meant to paralyze all that--</p><p>GIULIANI: That is exactly.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. So, I've got to get to Sol. So, a former Justice Department official says that the White House's assertion that Congress does not have a right to the information is mind blowing. This is Joshua Geltzer saying, these aren't peripheral interests of the U.S. Congress, they're core oversight responsibilities at the heart of our legislative branch checking our executive branch and even just understanding it. How do you react to that?</p><p>SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Well, I think both sides have a problem. I think that these subpoenas have been grossly overbroad coming from the House of Representatives. I also think the letter from the White House counsel is very overbroad. There really is no such thing as saying constitutionally is saying you don't get to do a do over and congressional authority to investigate is very, very broad. But Laura, these battles have gone back to the beginning of the Republic.</p><p>Go back to 1796, Congress wanted all of President Washington's papers related to the J treaty and Washington said, you're not going to get them. And James Madison said, we as a Congress - he was a congressman. We have the right to anything we asked for. But the President has a right to say, I don't want to give it to you. And this is part of the checks and balances and it will be very interesting to see how it works out.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We're going to be on perhaps the unitary executive here to something the left is saying. Dana Milbank has this piece out saying, this is basically - they're trying to say they have a divine right to the information - Milbank's a big liberal, but they're always jockeying for power, Rudy, I mean you remember this. The days when you were at the J. It's always a fight between the legislative branch and the executive branch but I have never seen it like I see it now with this president.</p><p>At every turn they have hounded him at every turn and they've accused him of sedition, being a traitor.</p><p>GIULIANI: Tyrant tonight. Tyrant.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Setting up meetings at Trump Tower. I mean a tyrant. I mean but this is - he's like a combo, they say a Pol Pot, Stalin and Chairman Mao or something. I mean this is the level of it. But I want to play something that Jerry Nadler said tonight actually because he was reacting to the administration's response over at MSNBC. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADLER: We are looking at all options to deal with a lawless administration and everything is being looked at.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everything is being looked at, including possible jail.</p><p>NADLER: We're looking at the law, but we will look at all options to force the administration - to be able to hold the administration accountable wherever they may take.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK. That was over at CNN obviously. But Rudy, what is he talking about here? What are the remedies here? There have to be a judicial remedy. Well, they're going to arrest somebody, going to get U.S. Marshals to come arrest what. White House officials.</p><p>GIULIANI: Let me try to respond to his rather inarticulate comment. I think he's saying he would look at jail which is of course absurd. There is nothing lawless about the administration's response. Sol could be quite right that it's a very broad response. But you know as a lawyer you raised all your arguments. I think there is some that are overbroad and I think there are some very, very strong.</p><p>The strongest one being that in the Cheney case, the court held that the power of the Congress is very broad, not unlimited. And I think given the number of subpoenas, given the number of hearings, given the already predetermined positions of the three chairmen, who have already said he should be impeached and Nadler was overheard planning it on Amtrak. I think that they've got a very good argument to the court. How did things ever get this far. And let's check this a little.</p><p>As long as they're willing to compromise. As long as they're willing to compromise if there is going to be a narrower, more focused subpoena.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, well Cipollone, he left the door open.</p><p>GIULIANI: Of course he did.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He does that in most of his letters. So, he's not shutting the door completely.</p><p>GIULIANI: But it's a legal response. It's not lawless.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Right.</p><p>GIULIANI: We're going to go before court and they make an argument and we do.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They don't want to go that far. They don't want impeachment. They don't want this.</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, that's why Nadler is full of you know what.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Well, I want to play something, Sol this goes into what we were talking about last week. Also Rudy, there is a brewing fight going on. It looks like between Brennan and Comey, when it comes to the use of this phony dossier. Catherine Herridge reported on this earlier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A dispute over whether former CIA Director John Brennan or former FBI Director James Comey pushed the unverified dossier during the presidential transition has broken out into the open. The records are not public, but sources familiar with the contents say December 2016 e-mails indicate Comey told bureau subordinates that Brennan insisted the dossier should be included in the formal intelligence assessment on Russian election interference.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, I'm hearing Sol that one of those communications are talking about also says that Jim Comey in December of 2016 said the dossier is unreliable. He didn't want the Intel to review it. We hear tonight - I heard today from a high place White House source that the President, it may be looking to release and declassify all the relevant documents leading up to the start of the Russia probe next week.</p><p>WISENBERG: But he's going to - but I heard he's going to give him to Attorney General Barr to review. Well, I've been hearing that for a long time.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Apparently, it's next week. That's what my source tells me.</p><p>WISENBERG: That'll be interesting.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, that will give us a lot of answers, right. We're going to sit here and debating this. This will have a lot more answers. We'll have actual facts on the table. Correct.</p><p>WISENBERG: Right. Yes, and Comey admits in his own book that he didn't reveal the whole dossier to the President. Only the salacious parts. He didn't tell him that there was this investigation that had been going on. I mean that's in his own book. So, I don't want to speculate on among those two, which one is right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And Rudy apparently there was some talk about how this would look, this could look like among intel sources that it could look like the FBI was doing some kind of weird preemptive blackmail with the President and that Comey going to that meeting that just - it didn't look good. They were worried about this that Comey presenting this dossier or part of it to the President would look like he was kind of having some J Edgar Hoover tactics against the President. That is really disturbing.</p><p>GIULIANI: It doesn't look like it was. I mean the reality is that Comey is the noose is tightening around his neck really bad. Comey in January told the President, it was salacious unverified. How did it become salacious unverified over five months. When they used it in affidavits in which Comey says on the top of the affidavit that it's verified. In footnote five, page 15. He says, it's reliable, not unverified. In other words--</p><p>INGRAHAM: He knew it wasn't.</p><p>GIULIANI: He either lied to the President or he lied to the court. I'm betting on he lied to the court. We call that perjury, Jim, and Brennan may be a witness against you. That'd be interesting.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I know, well this is - gentleman.</p><p>GIULIANI: James Cardinal Comey may be wrong.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, Sol's like I believe it when I see it.</p><p>GIULIANI: I agree, it's hard to indict Cardinal.</p><p>INGRAHAM: This is going to get very interesting next week.</p><p>GIULIANI: This guy can tell you what's going to happen to your immortal soul which he said to Rod Rosenstein about Rod Rosenstein the other day. So, maybe he's above indictment. I don't know.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's back in the Redwoods tonight. All right, guys. Thanks so much. And the question now is how will this new rift between the White House and Congress impact the president's legislative priorities. Is he going to be able to get anything done.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're not even really talking about the substance at this point. They are questioning each other's motives at this point. Something that you know you get to a new level in politics and you're just so distrustful of the other guy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Particularly, the Democrats would argue, don't take this personally. It's our job. If we did not do this. How will future Congresses behave potentially when there is a Democrat in the White House and there is potential wrongdoing there. I mean we've got to do our job.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you agree with the word Nadler use King. He called the President, King.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've said that many times before. If the President can use various mechanism to appropriate money for what he thinks is important without congressional approval, then why have a Congress who in fact have what amounts to a king.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Here now is Matt Schlapp, Chairman of the American Conservative Union and Richard Goodstein, a former Hillary Clinton Adviser and Democratic Strategist. Great to see both of you. All right Richard how does a do nothing Congress help America?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER CLINTON ADVISER: Well, I don't know, it will be a do nothing Congress. The fact is this house has already passed gun control legislation. It's going to shore up the Affordable Care Act. It's going to do any number of things that the public where there is like 70, 80, 90 percent approval whether the Senate passes or not. I mean that's obviously out of the control of the house. The question I would raise is does the President actually want his priorities a wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for repeal and replace to see actually want those things done. Or does he want the issue to run on.</p><p>I think he'd actually - look, he already said his health care thing is going to come after the election. I actually don't think he really wants to get anything done. He wants to be able to run as he did in 2016. Here's what I'm going to do. Just trust me. This time I want to do it. I just don't know whether that's going to ring true.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I think politics is the art of the possible. Right. So, you can pass a lot of things but you have to work with the other side.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: That's right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You have to try to craft something that get votes for it. It's a complicated deal, it's not easy, not easy and Republicans are - but still the first 100 days. They had kind of a lot to show for it in the Trump administration.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Absolutely.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They're on their way to the tax cut. USMCA, they got right into it. Now in negotiations.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: All the regulations.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I mean they made some mistakes out the gate, but they did a lot in the first 100. But the Democrats, they're running against Trump, Matt.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION CHAIR: The president had to face which really no one's really quite have to face like this which is the whole idea of hashtag resistance. No honeymoon, no period of time where you try to collaborate. The President has been able to get things done recently like criminal justice reform and other things which are you know maybe atypical issues for Republicans.</p><p>INGRAHAM: VA.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes. I think what you actually see is the President is navigating a Democratic Party that is more radicalized than we've ever seen and more hardened against by the way if it wasn't Trump, Laura, they'd be doing this against - they'd be doing this against any Republican who would have gotten into. That's just their state of mind.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Trump and Pelosi and Schumer on the same page on infrastructure, who's not Mick Mulvaney, who's not the Freedom Caucus.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Well, that's wrong. They have a billion dollars in their budget infrastructure you don't know what you're talking about.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, I know what I'm talking about because they said to the President. How are you going to pay for this. And he still hasn't given them an answer.</p><p>SCHLAPP: It's not true, it's his budget. You should read it.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No. Come on.</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's not my case here. But I think it's an interesting question. We'll see how it plays out, it's always hard when you're running against an incumbent President whatever party, if the economy is strong or recovering, people have a greater sense of optimism. I think in most polls put aside Russia and all the stuff we're talking about tonight. Most polls people feel pretty good about the future. I mean there is challenges to health care costs that has to be dealt with. I think people are pretty optimistic. We guess in Washington, why I've got more money in my pocket. It's hard to run against that as a Republican or a Democrat running against.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Two things quickly, the right track numbers, right are better under Trump than Obama saw for his eight years. The American people feel better because they're practical people and they see that their economic prospects are improving and that's why it's not selfish for the American people to vote accordingly. The question is how they're - why is the real clear politics average at 40 for Donald Trump. It is, the real clear. The viewers look at it--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well what is it when he won.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No, I'm just saying the real clear politics average of your job approval.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It was really low.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: He wasn't in office that and the economy wasn't doing what it is now. Give him credit.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Let me just jump on the polls real quickly.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's 44 percent tonight.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Exactly. Not the real clear politics average.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Right now tonight. I've just got that - at least I'm getting wrong and it's hard.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Tom Bevan just did a whole piece on this and actually other pollsters are saying it as well.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's about where Obama was up or above--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: The President is higher where he was or higher--</p><p>INGRAHAM: I think this is a hard thing for the Democrats when you start off in the first 100 days saying, I get 80 subpoenas against 80 different former and current Trump officials. That doesn't exactly engender a sense of you know if we don't agree with you on anything but we're going to work with you on some things. And yet the President, I think in good faith met with him on infrastructure and wants to do something on immigration. That's pretty amazing considering they want to get his son. They want to get the White House counsel in.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Democrats pass an immigration bill in 2013, 68 votes in the Senate including Lindsey Graham--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Talk about today.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, OK that bill - if that bill was put on the floor it would pass the House and it should pass the Senate. The fact is, there is enough votes to carry it. Well, it should if people that voted for it last time would still vote for it again, it would have enough votes.</p><p>SCHLAPP: But what do you think about - what you're hearing about the president's immigration proposal, he's approaching it from what we have to do right now which is secure the border, give the resources to take care of the stupid loopholes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: We hear a lot of Republicans having problems with that. That's what I'm hearing.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We haven't unpacked that, but it's always great to see you both.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thanks.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We'll see what happens. All right. Alabama just passed a law that effectively bans abortions and they're not the only state. Candace Owens is here to respond, declaim that these pro-life laws can hurt minorities. A full debate next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Alabama Governor Kay Ivey signed the nation's strictest abortion ban into law tonight making it a felony for doctors to perform an abortion. This comes on the heels of a Georgia and Ohio laws that are also both pro- life, very pro-life. But the party of infanticide. Well, they're crying foul.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You just aborted the state of Alabama. You just raped Alabama with this bill.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, Democrats are just in total meltdown that Roe vs. Wade is on the chopping block of course.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Trying to overturn Roe vs. Wade. That's wrong. And we will find.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Women's health care is under attack and we will not stand for it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's nothing short of an attack on women's basic human rights and civil rights.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Part of the right wing conservative agenda in the United States of America is to take away reproductive health and freedom.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Candace Owens, Conservative Commentator and Jennifer Holdsworth, Democratic Strategist and former Campaign Manager for Pete Buttigeig's DNC Chair Campaign. All right, Jennifer a new poll out this week reveals that the majority of Americans don't think heartbeat bills are too restrictive. You're saying they're wrong.</p><p>JENNIFER HOLDSWORTH, SENIOR DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I'm saying they're wrong. Heartbeat bills are too restrictive because at the point of six weeks of a pregnancy, a lot of women in this country don't know that they're actually pregnant. So, it's entirely too restrictive. If we're talking about the Alabama law, they're going even further than that.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Candace, this is wild. Today, this issue has blown up, I mean it's almost blown the Mueller subpoena fight and off the front pages because Democrats think that if they can get the Republicans back into the culture wars, well they're golden in 2020. Is that accurate?</p><p>CANDACE OWENS, HOST, THE CANDACE OWENS SHOW, FOX NEWS: No, I think the fact that this bill passed is telling us that conservatives are winning across the country and more and more people are starting to wake up to what exactly is the Democrats are doing, which is that they pretend that they are for progress when in fact everything that they do leads to aggressive results particularly in the minority community.</p><p>And we know that abortions impacts the black community more than anybody else. Black women represent only 7 percent of the population yet account for almost 40 percent of all of the abortions in America.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I want to get to that because a constitutional law expert Alyssa Milano spoke out last night on CNN about that very issue. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALYSSA MILANO, ACTRESS: This will affect the communities of color more than anything. OK. For the women of color, for the women that are marginalized, for the women that are low income communities, the women that are most at risk. These bills are going to be catastrophic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: No, I don't understand the argument, because the argument seems to be and it's been made by people all over social media today and tonight that the bill itself is racist, because there is disproportionate number of black women in the state of Alabama who would be having abortions. The pro- life bill would mean there were more black babies in Alabama.</p><p>So, how is it exactly racist when the result is more black children, more opportunities for people to adopt. I would imagine more opportunities for people to have their own reproductive rights someday. I mean what about the girls and boys who lose their reproductive rights by not being born.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: Laws aren't just racist when there is an intention to make them racist. If they have a prejudicial or racist effect, they are also race.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So, just no intent required.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: No, intent can be present but if it has a racist effect it is also considered racist. But I think what Alyssa Milano was saying and I'm not saying that she's a credentialed constitutional law professor but what she's pointing out is that there is a dearth of health care options for women of color in the south, especially in Alabama. We've seen the Republicans try to continue to take those options away. So now--</p><p>INGRAHAM: But it's their health. How is this - I mean I can see the debate about abortion but how is it health care.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: Reproductive health is health care. Having a choice and having autonomy over your own body is health care. This Alabama law.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So, the baby doesn't ever have any rights.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: The doctor can now get more time--</p><p>INGRAHAM: You can't take a life.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: Performing an abortion than the racist would get - the rapist would get for raping the woman.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I'm for the rapist going to get away for life.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: Right. But now the doctor is going to get more time than the rapist.</p><p>INGRAHAM: This is all going to shake out. This is all going to shake out one way or another. Alabama reports are going to challenge.</p><p>OWENS: I just want to be really clear here, because you're saying that black babies being born is racist. It is not racist for black babies to be born. Black babies have a right to be alive. That's what you just said. You said that the abortion ban--</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: You can categorize my words however you want, but that's not what I said.</p><p>OWENS: Racist results is not black babies being born. We know the black population would be double what it is today if it wasn't for abortion--</p><p>INGRAHAM: More electoral power.</p><p>OWENS: The founder of Planned Parenthood was Margaret Sanger who was an avowed racist and eugenicists who was quoted in a letter saying that she wanted to exterminate the black population. We know that she has been by and large successful. It's time to pull that black back and it's time to educate black Americans about the fact that liberals advocate for things that harm our community. First and foremost, the black population growth has stagnated completely. OK. So that tells you that is your answer.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: So, your answer is to tell other black women how to end their life.</p><p>OWENS: I'm not talking how to live their lives. (Inaudible).</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: (Inaudible).</p><p>OWENS: (Inaudible). Fingertips, it's own DNA that is two lives.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: And what does the mother have.</p><p>OWENS: That is why by the way when a pregnant woman is killed they called a double homicide.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right.</p><p>OWENS: Because there are two lives.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: Yes, the Republicans have been very clever about that.</p><p>OWENS: Black babies being born is not racist, I want to be very clear on that.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Here is I think the science argument is that the left is all about climate change, science. Facts, Republicans don't care about facts. They care about emotions. But this is kind of a factual thing at some point. It's really inconvenient for a lot of people, but it's also factual at some point. Isn't that human beings are human beings.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: Conservatives have said--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Down to the very tiniest.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: Conservatives have spent the last two to three decades pretty much butchering history, science and economics, it's only natural that medicine is the next frontier.</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, so you're saying a baby born--</p><p>OWENS: Acknowledging that you're the party of the KKK. You're the party of Jim Crow laws. You are the party of racism and racial terrorism and now, you are also the party that is advocating for black babies to be aborted.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: I believe that you're a climate science than I are, so I would just assume--</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK.</p><p>HOLDSWORTH: (Inaudible).</p><p>OWENS: (Inaudible).</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. Here's the climate of the commercials that are about to roll. We loved having you both on. This is a big issue. It's going to be really hot in the election on this issue along.</p><p>And coming up, \"Seen and Unseen\" with Raymond Arroyo, next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's time for our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment where we expose the big cultural stories of the day.</p><p>Remembering a comedy legend, Bill Nye the f-bomb guy, and Beto 2.0. Joining us with all the details, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor. All right, Raymond, the death of Tim Conway wasn't just a loss for comedy in the world but for you personally.</p><p>RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Laura, I interviewed Tim a number of times. We kept in touch over the years. I had him on my EWTN show. And he was a gentle, kind, hilariously funny man. Tim Conway appeared in everything from \"McHale's Navy\" to SpongeBob SquarePants where he voiced Barnacle Boy, but it was his work for more than a decade on \"The Carol Burnett Show\" that made him part of our lives.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: What was that about that group of people and that time that made \"The Carol Burnett Show\" work?</p><p>TIM CONWAY, COMEDIAN: Well, we were all alcoholics.</p><p>ARROYO: That's a good start.</p><p>CONWAY: That gave a certain relaxation to the show. Harvey and I were the best of friends, and Carol is the most generous person you can imagine. She was always willing to share the show. And I think that is what made it so good.</p><p>I was at this freak show one time, and I saw Siamese elephants.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CONWAY: They were joined at the end of their trunks like that. I kind of felt sorry for them. They couldn't go like the other elephants when they go --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: We didn't play the best part. Then he goes, but these elephants would go. We killed the laugh. When I asked Tim off camera why this comedy was so infectious, he told me this group of people loved each other, and they labored to surprise each other. Watch he and his friends, Harvey Korman here. Classic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Novocain, Novocain. Take a firm hold of the hypodermic needle.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There will be a little bit pain and then numbness will set in.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will just give you a little shot here.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll be right with you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Tim actually witnessed a guy in the Army who injected himself with Novacain, Laura. He said the comradery of this group, that is what made the laughs. They really loved --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Raymond, you and I say this a lot. You cannot fake chemistry. Everybody knows Raymond and I have been friends for a long time because of the way we ridicule each other.</p><p>ARROYO: That's right, we're free to ridicule.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, exactly.</p><p>ARROYO: While we're talking about ridicule and off the wall videos, Laura, Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris tweeted this out as I guess a character witness for her climate change position. It's Bill Nye, The Science Guy. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL NYE: What I'm saying is the planet as on a -- fire. There are things we can do to put it out. Are any of them free? No, of course not. Nothing is free you idiots. Grow the -- up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: This man, this is a comedy routine. To tweet him up for a Democratic contender for president and to tweet this guy out, he is not a scientist. He is a mechanical engineer. It's like tweeting out George Clooney as a doctor or Harrison Ford as an archaeologist.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Wait a second Harrison Ford is not an archaeologist? You're crushing me.</p><p>ARROYO: No. I'm sorry to break the news.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right, Beto.</p><p>ARROYO: Oh, yes. Beto O'Rourke relaunching his presidential campaign. He livestreamed a trip to barber. Problem not the way to reboot his campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am cutting some of this ear hair that you get when you get older. It grows out of your ears. If you don't get it cut, it can be nasty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: This is the AOC-ing of America, Laura. But it could've been worse. He could have taken us to his colonoscopy. So let's thank God for blessing.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It wasn't a prostate deal.</p><p>ARROYO: Exactly. The only think that would make it better is if Tim Conway had been the barber. That would have made it --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Oh, my God. Tim Conway, genius. Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, the only ones left really from the original cast.</p><p>ARROYO: Carol Burnett and Vicki, yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: My gosh. Raymond, thank you so much.</p><p>And \"The Ingraham Angle\" has been in the front lines of the border fight, as you know, and we've gotten our hands on some exclusive detail of the president's immigration plant that is going to be announced tomorrow. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise is here next and whether that bill can get any traction, don't go away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Not one more American life should be lost because our lawmakers fail to secure our borders. That is why we are calling on Congress to fix our terrible immigration laws, stop catch and release, to end deadly sanctuary cities, to stop the visa lottery program.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: And a lot more. President Trump today previewing what we can expect to hear when he announces a major immigration overhaul tomorrow. And as we witnessed last week in south Texas, this is beyond crisis point now. We have updates we're going to bring you tomorrow on New Mexico. A story in New Mexico that has been completely lost on most in the media. And we are told two main points in the president's new immigration plan will be securing the border and instituting now this merit-based immigration system. The goal is to reduce the number of illegals due to family ties. Right now, 66 percent of 1.1 million green cards are doled out just because of family relationships, and they want to invert that with merit-based immigration.</p><p>Joining us now is House Minority Whip Steve Scalise. Congressman, is there a coalition that would support flipping theme narrative from entire family trees coming in here to people we supposedly need because there are not Americans to do these jobs? I'm not for increasing the number of legal immigrants. I think 1.1 million is enough. The president I think is going to keep it at the same number. But if you're going to keep it at the same number and not reduce it, this seems to make sense.</p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE, (R-LA) HOUSE MINORITY WHIP: Laura, there is no talk of increasing the number. What there is talk of is getting back to rule of law, securing the border, going to a merit-based system. And think about this. Right now we have got some of the dumbest laws on the books. If we educate somebody in America to be a computer scientist and engineer, jobs we need in America, they want to stay in America, we force them to leave the country to compete against us, while we've got the visa lottery where we literally pluck names out of a hat, in many cases from countries that don't like us, to bring them here. Why don't we flip that narrative.</p><p>We have caps on different countries. So if you are coming from India you might wait 20 years, whereas if you're coming from Honduras you might wait six years to come here. And like you talked about, the family tree issue. Let's get to a merit-based system where we have rule of law and were we ultimately get back to those basic foundational principles where you come to America and seek the American dream.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You are seeing video, it's not about what you're talking about. We're seeing video of what I saw last week at the border, which is basically people -- I love the guy filming this. He's just one of the best. He's like a local reporter. But people just waiting for the Border Patrol, and they are just pulling them up, processing them in about 24 hours, and releasing them. But that goes to the asylum laws, which Lindsey Graham wants to address. But are the Democrats going to agree to any of this stuff, or are they going to own the issues? Is that the goal here, make them own the issue if they don't move?</p><p>SCALISE: Democrats in middle America are actually for this. The socialist Democrats here in Washington are not. And it shows the divide not within the country. It shows the divide within their party. You have got to end catch and release. You've got to end these magnets that are forcing people to come here, the breakdowns in the asylum law, that is going to be some of the things that I think people are going to be excited about.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's got to happen. We've got 100,000 people just coming in last month. By the way, Angela Rye, one of the CNN's favorite liberal analysts, said this tonight about the president's plan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANGELA RYE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You cannot develop policy absent people and compassion. It does not work. It results not just in hurt individuals but also hurt families.</p><p>At the end of the day what they are saying is you have to be amazingly brilliant, you probably have to be whiter.</p><p>This is reminiscent to me of what happened before the Civil Rights movement really began.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Chris Cuomo, \"All right.\" That's his response.</p><p>SCALISE: Do they have any idea what you are talking about? What do you tell to a person who has been waiting in line legally 10 years to come to America when you're going to allow somebody that just walks up in front of them because you have laws that allow them to do it? You literally read a script and you can come here illegally in place of that person that has been waiting in line in 10 years.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Point system, I don't know how this actually plays out with the bureaucracy. You age, English proficiency. Again, you can game all this stuff. This doesn't mean -- offer of employment above a certain wage threshold, education and vocational certifications. Look, I think in the end this issue if properly messaged will be another huge winner for the president. Although his numbers are not good on immigration now. Have you seen this? I don't know if it's because people are seeing these videos and just frustrated, like why doesn't he fix this, and they're impatient. But his numbers for his dedication to this issue are not I know where he wants them to be.</p><p>SCALISE: When I go, and I've been to a lot of states, a lot of swing states, of course I was in Louisiana with the president yesterday, there are the lines to see this president are unbelievable.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Tell me about it. How much money you raised last night, how much money in New Orleans?</p><p>SCALISE: It was $4 million, and it was sold out. There were people that were literally being turned away. This president has stood up for the things that he promised, he's getting us back to rule of law. He has a good immigration plan that actually gets us back to a merit based system.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So $4 million, one night in New Orleans.</p><p>SCALISE: And 5,000 people illegally crossing a day in many cases, and the Democrats want to own that? Most of America is not, but most Democrats are --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Congressman, it's great to see you, as always.</p><p>SCALISE: Great seeing you, Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And coming conservative star Michelle Malkin censored by Facebook, she will tell the story next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The Constitution prohibits the government from censoring much of the speech we've come to know and love, but Facebook is imposing its own Silicon Valley brand of political correctness on its own social media platform. And Facebook banned provocateurs like Alex Jones, Milo, and even Louis Farrakhan. And now the social media giant is going to step further by censoring conservative commentator Michelle Malkin for, get this, opposing Facebook censorship.</p><p>Michelle joins me know, her first television comments about all this. Michelle, in the post that was taken down, you said I don't know how long it will be until I'm next. I love that. You kind of taunted them and you demonstrated what was going on. But are you now on the verge, do you think, of being just banned on Facebook?</p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: Yes, I think a lot of us are, and I think there is a commonality among many of the people who are being targeted on Facebook and on Twitter, on social media. I even have to worry about my own website at MichelleMalkin.com which is hosted by WordPress which is now going after people based on their ideological viewpoints.</p><p>I do believe, Laura, that this is an existential battle, and I'm not saying that just because it's self-serving because I've made a living over the last 20, 25 years, a lot of it online and never had to worry about this kind of de-platforming. I'm saying this because we need a vibrant marketplace of ideas. We need an informed citizenry for a constitutional republic to function.</p><p>And when Facebook and Silicon Valley overloads have their thumbs on the scale of free speech, that is a concern for all of us. There is a lot to people who have been de-platformed that folks out there might be uncomfortable with, but all I did that caused Facebook to censor me, Laura, was simply stand up for a couple of my friends, Laura Loomer and Gavin McInnes. And now even I, using my Facebook platform that has 2.1 million followers, cannot even mention their names without being accused of violating the, quote-unquote, community standards of Facebook.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's ridiculous.</p><p>MALKIN: There's a lot more going on here, Laura, and I believe that it has to do with the 2020 election and making sure that somehow those of us who support the agenda of President Trump are being throttled and managed and marginalized. And I am sending up an alarm. I did it at CPAC, an I will continue to use my platforms to do it until they kick me off.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Michelle, I love the defiance. Nick Clegg of Facebook was on TV this weekend and he basically issued this warning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK CLEGG, FACEBOOK VICE PRESIDENT FOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS AND COMMUNICATIONS: The way that the rules of the Internet are drawn today in my view, or rather not drawn, will be quite different to the way they are drawn in 10 years' time. And I think big tech companies have a choice. Either they play ball and they try to play a responsible role in that debate, or they try and duck it altogether.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Lucky Europe has gotten all over Facebook, been a lot tougher, frankly, than the United States in dealing with privacy issues. But he said we basically have no choice, Michelle.</p><p>MALKIN: Yes. So what do people do? A lot of people asked me after my CPAC and over the past year now that we have seen people disappear and be unpersoned, and the one thing people can do is fight back with their pocketbooks and fight back with the voices that they do have, and support the people who have disappeared. There's a website called FighttheCensors.com. It's helping people like Laura Loomer and Gavin McInnes, whose names I can't say on Facebook. I would like to see if I can test the Facebook livestream function now, which is also being throttled. Apparently if you violate their community standards they'll take that away as well.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Michelle, I'm not trying to cut you off.</p><p>MALKIN: But I'm going after the underlying groups like the SPLC and CAIR that are going after them is how we have to fight back.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Michelle Malkin, we're going to continue to talk about this with you at a later date. Thank you so much. Stay there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You ever wonder what it's like to have moves like Jagger?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, 75 years old. All right. He's getting ready for his relaunch of his tour that he had to put off because of that valve replacement. He's 75. But remember, he has eight kids. Had his last kid at 73 with his 30-year-old partner. But he's still moving like Jagger.</p><p>Don't forget, check out my new podcast. Just dropped a new one today.</p><p>Shannon Bream and the \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" team, take it all from here.

And just as the seasons tend to bear some resemblance from year to year, so does the fight over patents. For starters, consider one of the key bills, Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte's \"Innovation Act,\" which is a carbon copy of the same bill that failed to pass in the 2013 Congress. The fissures in Congress over the bill are virtually identical: it will likely pass the House and stall in the Senate, where certain Senate Democrats have taken objection with what they feel are too-aggressive provisions in the proposed legislation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's Goodlatte in a statement on the bill's re-introduction: \"In recent years, we have seen an exponential increase in the use of weak or poorly granted patents by patent trolls to file numerous patent infringement lawsuits against American businesses with the hope of securing a quick payday ... With our current patent laws being abused in ways that are threatening the survival of American innovation, the Congress must act to curb abusive patent litigation.\"</p><p>Must it act? A close look at the data suggests it may not need to. According to Lex Machina, a provider of data and analytics systems to companies and law firms, total patent case filings went down 18 percent last year, from 6,083 new cases in 2013 to 5,010 cases in 2014. Though 5,000 cases is not insignificant, the fact that total cases decreased could be a critical argument against aggressive patent reform.</p><p>What might have caused the decline? For one thing, both the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit Court provided clearer direction on patent law in 2014, including some cases that spoke directly to the issues Goodlatte's bill seeks to address. In one key case, Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, the court held that applying abstract ideas to a computer was not enough to convert those ideas into a patentable invention. According to Stanford University Law Professor Mark Lemley, an advocate of reform, the Alice decision and other court actions may have obviated the need for much of what Congress was poised to do. Professor Lemley notes that \"a lot of the business model that was driving the growth in litigation which involved suing everybody in the industry with this very broad, general patent is just less attractive than it used to be.\"</p><p>His view may have some support among the innovators themselves. In a Silicon Valley Insiders poll conducted last year by the Atlantic, patent reform was cited as one of the \"biggest barriers to innovation in the United States\" -- but only by 8 percent of the 50 panelists. Immigration policies and education were both well ahead, at 16 percent and 14 percent respectively. Of course, that hasn't stopped the big tech firms, including Apple, Microsoft, Adobe and Oracle, among others, from advocating for the strongest possible protections for intellectual property. But that's to be expected: even if cases are down and the law is moving in the right direction, 5,000 lawsuits per year still represent real costs to the largest firms, and their bottom line is still put at risk with every new attack from a patent troll.</p><p>But pay attention to another group of technologists, the Alliance of U.S. Startups and Inventors for Jobs (USIJ), whose members include medical start-ups, incubators, and some small tech firms. This past week, the USIJ came out strongly against Goodlatte's bill, which they warned \"would cause many venture capitalists to avoid investing in innovative startups that are increasingly dependent on their patent portfolios\" because of provisions in the bill that would require companies tied to the losing side of a patent infringement suit to help defray legal costs. For them, according to a letter they delivered to Goodlatte and House leadership and which was obtained by Politico, the possibility of patent reform is a victory for \"large, entrenched companies\" at the expense of venture- backed start-ups.</p><p>For a legislator seeking to be on the right side of \"innovation,\" this presents a quandary: It's rare that there's daylight between a firm like Apple and a group of venture capitalists looking to fund the next Apple. But that itself may be an argument in favor of waiting on patent reform, at least until there is more data available to indicate whether or not judicial actions have had a meaningful impact on the system at large.</p><p>It's an argument that the Silicon Valley types may have made -- without fully knowing it. Consider again the Atlantic's poll of Silicon Valley insiders. What did these titans of the new economy believe to be the number one barrier to innovation in the United States? Government regulation and bureaucracy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-WHEX20150309030915Soniweb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FHH-J791-F09T-F488-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"780\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2015 Clarity Media Group, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>The Examiner (Washington, DC)</publicationName><edition>Examiner Edition</edition><aggregationName>ProQuest SuperText</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>March 9, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC0002B82</classCode><className>ADOBE SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>ADBE (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>ADB (FRA)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Apple Computer Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Goodlatte, Bob</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem/><classificationItem><className>OTHER NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Apple Computer Inc</className><className>AAPL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX001301</classCode><className>PATENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009X6F</classCode><className>PATENT INFRINGEMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjdBMTVENTcwQTBDNDc0MkJFN0FFRjc4RkRDRUJGQTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkQzRkZBQjVFNkJCNDdGOEE3MjZGQUY1NkVCRUQ1QjU</classCode><className>Infringement Actions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001040</classCode><className>LITIGATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp;

Bernstein Chief Intellectual Property and Licensing Officer InterDigital Communications Corporation</p><p>Committee on Senate Judiciary</p><p>June 6, 2007</p><p>Chairman Leahy, members of the committee, my name is Bruce Bernstein. I am Chief Intellectual Property and Licensing Officer for InterDigital Communications Corporation and a long-time proponent of preserving and promoting American innovation. Thank you for the opportunity and honor to appear before you this morning to discuss the importance of strong patent rights to innovative and vital American companies like InterDigital. America's patent system has been critical to InterDigital's success and, more broadly, has helped shape the evolution of technologies and products used by billions of people around the world.</p><p>InterDigital is headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, with major development facilities in Melville, New York. For over thirty years, InterDigital has been at the forefront of inventing and developing advanced wireless technologies and products that drive voice and data communications. Although we remain a relatively small company, our inventions are used in virtually every digital cellular phone, and we continue to invest heavily in ongoing research and development. As the inventor, owner and licensor of hundreds of US patents, InterDigital shares this committee's commitment to improve the quality of issued patents and reduce the cost of patent litigation. However, we and others in the technology licensing community are deeply concerned that certain provisions of the Senate patent bill (S. 1145) would significantly undermine the enforceability, predictability and value of all patent rights and, in the process, encourage litigation and abuse. Of particular concern are proposals to mandate apportionment of damages and create a new and duplicative post-grant opposition system. We urge the committee to remove these and other problematic provisions from the bill and to limit legislative reforms to fair, balanced and judicious measures that will preserve the strong foundation of patent rights and remedies so essential to the future of American innovation.</p><p>In my role with InterDigital, I head a small team that manages the company's intellectual property assets and our patent licensing business. I have over 15 years of experience in the intellectual property business and have developed and managed patent portfolios for a number of organizations, including universities, investment institutions, and both private and public technology companies. Prior to joining InterDigital in 2005, I served as Vice President and Head of Patents at BTG International Inc., (BTG) where I developed and managed the company's physical sciences IP portfolio. Prior to joining BTG, I served as an associate at a number of law firms here in Washington, D.C. including Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius, LLP, Dickstein, Shapiro &amp; Morin LLP and Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett &amp; Dunner LLP. Like many others involved in the patent and licensing businesses, I also have a background in technology; I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania before earning my JD from American University.</p><p>Compared to other companies you may hear from today, InterDigital is a small company with less than 400 employees. But our size in human capital is not proportionate to our inventive capacity and global influence. The bulk of our staff is dedicated to research, development and engineering initiatives, and the majority of engineers have advanced degrees and decades of experience. Over the past three decades, our engineers have created many of the breakthrough inventions that have allowed InterDigital to make significant and ongoing investments in leading edge research and development for an increasingly competitive global market. Today, InterDigital holds over 3,000 U.S. and foreign issued patents combined. In addition, we have nearly 9,000 patent applications in process. Not surprisingly, we are passionate about a thoughtful approach to patent reform, and ever mindful that our ability to innovate and grow is directly dependent on the strength and health of America's patent system.</p><p>The wireless market offers tremendous challenges and opportunities. Today, it would be hard to imagine a world without mobile phones. Wireless technologies have changed the way we work, live, and play. By typical measures, the wireless market would be considered mature, but the reality is that the wireless industry is changing faster than ever before, with new technologies, products, applications, and services being introduced daily. As technologies, content, and devices blossom, the only limit on the opportunity for InterDigital is our engineers' imaginations.</p><p>At InterDigital, innovation is the DNA that runs through each of our employees. In the late 1960s, the company's founder recognized the enormous potential of cellular communications quite prescient at a time when neither the Internet nor cellular phones were available. He assembled a group of engineers and incorporated in 1972. As his vision has evolved, InterDigital has remained a pioneer in advancing the wireless industry. When the rest of the world was working on existing analog technologies, we were already developing next generation digital technologies. When the rest of the world was working on existing voice technologies, we were working on advanced data technologies. While others were working on existing narrowband technologies, we were working on advanced broadband technologies. And, today, as most are grappling with the ever-growing library of current technologies -- 3G, WiMAX, or WiFi -- we are already working on solutions for seamless mobility between all standards, domestically and internationally. Our constant aim is to focus on the future of worldwide personal and business communications and to innovate for the public good.</p><p>Based on this innovation, we have built a worldwide patent licensing program with great success. Since 1992, manufacturers of some of the world's most popular brands, such as Nokia, Samsung, Sony, Ericsson, LG, NEC, Panasonic, Sharp and Research In Motion, have become our customers, and we have earned over $1 billion in patent royalty and technology licensing revenues. In recognition of our successful licensing program, InterDigital received the prestigious Licensing Achievement Award from the Licensing Executives Society in 2006. Previous recipients of this award include Genentech (2004), the U.S. Department of Energy (2003), IBM Corporation (2002), Pfizer (2000), and Stanford University (1999).</p><p>Further, in addition to licensing our in-house patent portfolio, we commercialize our inventions by offering advanced products and technologies to manufacturers of mobile devices. This cycle of innovation from technology inventions, to patent licensing and delivering productsis repeated with multiple technologies time and again. Indeed, our engineers are working today on solutions for the next generations of wireless technologies. Our experience and inventions reach across virtually all mobile and wireless standards. Our success in increasing the pace and breadth of our innovation reflects our fundamental commitment to remain a worldwide leader in the creation of pioneering technologies. To protect our ongoing new inventions, we have employed a comprehensive program of developing and protecting our intellectual property through the worldwide filing and issuance of our patents.</p><p>In addition to our internal research and development, InterDigital has a track record of successful co-development programs with leading companies around the world. Just in the last few years alone, we have worked side-by-side with our peers at Infineon (Germany), NXP (Holland), General Dynamics (US) and SK Telekom (Korea) to solve unique problems. We also work closely with several universities on advanced research and innovation projects.</p><p>The US Patent System</p><p>Our country's founders understood the importance of innovation to America's economic prosperity and growth. Significantly, they also recognized that true innovation requires the same incentives, and merits the same rights and remedies, as other forms of property. These principles - and the foundation of our patent system - are reflected in Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution, which gives Congress the power \"To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\" The US patent laws, first codified in 1790, were developed in order to encourage inventors to disclose their inventions to the public in return for a period of exclusive rights to their patented inventions. The resulting public disclosure of inventions encourages inventors to share their inventions rather than hoard them in private. This sharing of ideas in turn fosters further innovation by allowing other inventors to develop improvements and next generation technologies. Our country's continued technological leadership is evidence of our patent system's success.</p><p>The exclusive rights granted to an inventor have been recognized since the inception of the US patent system as being necessary to reward innovation and encourage disclosure of inventions to the public. But such rights are not awarded without condition. Instead, an inventor is only entitled to an exclusive patent right for a limited time for those inventions which meet the statutory requirements of patentability - namely, those inventions that are useful, novel and non-obvious.</p><p>These are the fundamental principles of this nation's patent laws. As such, efforts to improve our patent laws through legislative reform should be consistent with these important precepts. InterDigital believes that despite dramatic developments in technology in recent years, the underlying and originating purpose of the US patent laws continues to this day. As such, it remains essential that our patent laws continue to reward innovation with a strong and predictable framework of rights and remedies. Furthermore, provided that an invention satisfies the stringent requirements of patentability, an inventor should be entitled to a scope of protection coextensive with the metes and bounds of his or her invention.</p><p>In practice, it is the examination process conducted by the USPTO which initially determines whether, and to what degree, patent protection should be afforded to an inventor. This process is shared between applicant and examiner and often involves a significant exchange of argument and explanation before the examiner renders his final decision on patentability. Through this dialogue, an inventor may provide arguments of patentability over \"prior art\" references that have been asserted by the examiner as evidence against patentability. Frequently, an applicant will recognize some similarity between the prior art reference and the inventor's claimed invention and respond with a request to amend the claims in order to appropriately define the limits of the applicant's invention.</p><p>Through this examination process, an applicant is either denied a patent or granted an exclusive right to the invention defined in the claims of the application. Usually, these patent rights are appropriately granted. Sometimes, however, they are not. Some suggest that this \"error rate\" has spiraled out of control. I do not agree. In fact, in 2006, the USPTO achieved its lowest error rate in 20 years - 3.5 percent, as well as a record low patent allowance rate of 54 percent. Even in cases of error, moreover, the patent is typically overbroad and not invalid in its entirety. In such situations, the solution is to reexamine or reissue the patent and adjust it to its proper scope.</p><p>Nevertheless, critics of our patent system are now advocating legislative measures that would create additional and more expansive opportunities to invalidate an issued patent (without giving the patent holder a fair means of appropriately adjusting the patent's scope), and fundamentally change our system of remedies to significantly reduce the cost of patent infringement. The premise of these so-called reforms is that the patent system is broken; the market is flooded with poor quality patents that were erroneously granted; and that patent plaintiffs are predominantly speculators who abuse the system to extract inflated settlements and judgments from large, established manufacturers.</p><p>In InterDigital's view, claims of this type are grossly exaggerated and dangerous in their potential impact on our patent system. To recklessly impugn the overall quality of America's patent portfolio is to denigrate the contribution of our most innovative companies, a growing percentage of which are licensing- based, patent-rich firms like InterDigital. And to diminish the value and enforceability of all patent rights is to destabilize the very foundation of our knowledge-based economy. With so much at stake, InterDigital urges the committee to proceed with great care and deliberation before approving measures that could fundamentally devalue American patents and weaken our global competitiveness.</p><p>With that said, much of the Senate bill is commendable, particularly those measures that are carefully tailored to improve patent quality and mitigate the subjective and costly aspects of patent litigation. InterDigital supports these goals and appreciates this committee's attention and commitment in addressing these important issues. As noted above, however, we are gravely concerned that other aspects of the bill would undermine the strength, value and enforceability of patent rights and hence increase litigation rates significantly, along with costs to patent holders and patent users alike. Namely, InterDigital opposes proposals to (i) mandate apportionment of damages, (ii) introduce an open-ended and duplicative post-grant opposition proceeding that would permit a challenger to invalidate an issued patent based on a reduced burden of proof and without affording the patent holder an adequate opportunity to adjust its scope, (iii) grant the USPTO expansive and unprecedented substantive rulemaking authority, and (iv) allow, as a matter of right, interlocutory appeal of claim construction decisions.</p><p>Beyond the detrimental impact of these measures on patent rights and litigation costs, we are concerned that such proposals would further burden already strained USPTO and judicial resources.</p><p>It is important to note that InterDigital's concerns are shared by a large and growing number of innovative firms, universities and researchers within a broad range of industry sectors, including the technology field that we inhabit. Indeed, in a recent letter to House and Senate leaders, InterDigital joined with more than 100 other patent stakeholders, including universities, venture capital firms, small and large technology businesses and research parks across the country, to voice a shared concern about the potentially damaging patent reform measures. The letter was signed by representatives of the electronics, telecommunications, life sciences, computer hardware, financial services, chemical and biotechnology industries.</p><p>Despite media claims to the contrary, the IT industry is absolutely not united in its support for mandatory apportionment, post-grant opposition or other measures that would fundamentally weaken patent rights. To the contrary, tech industry support for such measures appears primarily limited to large, incumbent manufacturers that are opportunistically using the phrase patent \"reform\" to justify legislation that would reduce their litigation costs and liability when they infringe third party patent rights. These big tech manufacturers are well aware that the threat of meaningful damages is often the only leverage that a small patentee possesses to secure a licensing agreement with a corporate giant; and they are equally aware that a mandatory apportionment standard would all but eliminate that leverage. Similarly, these large manufacturers view the proposed post-grant opposition system as a means of tying up, and more easily \"busting\" inconvenient patents, through endless administrative challenges, with little or no downside risk. In essence, these large tech manufacturing firms are seeking to unwind the very exchange implicit between the inventor and society when he or she discloses his or her invention in the first place.</p><p>In the wake of eBay and other recent Supreme Court decisions, the negotiating strength of patent owners has radically diminished, particularly to the detriment of smaller, less resourced firms that license their patented innovations. Mandatory apportionment, post-grant opposition and similar legislative measures would, for many such innovators, drive the final nail in the coffin.</p><p>Apportionment of Damages</p><p>InterDigital urges the committee to preserve the existing flexible, market-based principles that govern the calculation of reasonable royalties, and to remove from the bill the proposed mandatory apportionment test, which would devalue patents and increase the prevalence, uncertainty and cost of litigation.</p><p>Under the Senate bill, a court must ensure that a reasonable royalty \"is applied only to that economic value properly attributable to the patent's specific contribution over the prior art,\" except where a patent has been shown to be \"the predominant basis for market demand for an infringing product or process.\" Thus, in virtually every patent case involving complex systems, this mandatory apportionment of damages would be applied above all other factors that might otherwise influence the determination of a reasonable royalty, including a patentee's history of negotiated royalty rates and other licensing terms. Although intended to guard against allegedly inflated damage awards, this mandatory apportionment test would represent a dramatic departure from the market-based principles that currently govern damages calculations. Even worse, it would result in unpredictable and artificially low damages awards for the majority of patents, no matter how inherently valuable they might be.</p><p>For innovative companies like InterDigital, mandatory apportionment would encourage free-riders and even existing licensees to risk litigation rather than pay, or continue paying, a market-negotiated licensing fee. As a result, it would undermine the market-based licensing negotiations between the inventor and patent user that have driven our nation's innovation dynamic for more than 200 years. No longer will the market be the arbiter of our technology's value; instead, a paid expert and court will be. There will be very little downside to \"rolling the dice\" and litigating before taking a license.</p><p>When coupled with the heightened eBay1 standard for injunctive relief, a mandatory apportionment test would further weaken and destabilize our system of patent rights and jeopardize the very existence of smaller firms with an innovation and licensing based business model. Since eBay, courts are increasingly reluctant to award permanent injunctions to patent holders (historically, the first line of defense against infringement), unless the infringement undermines competition for the patentee's product. In cases where a patent holder licenses the right to practice its patented technology to others, but does not practice the technology itself (as is often the case with smaller inventors and universities that lack the resources and infrastructure to manufacture their innovations), courts have, since eBay, shown an even greater reluctance to award permanent injunctive relief. As a result, many innovative firms will be forced to permit ongoing use of their patented technologies pursuant to a court-imposed compulsory license (without the benefit of important standard non- royalty license terms such as confidentiality) and a court- dictated royalty. In the post-eBay world, it is thus all the more important that Congress preserve the ability of patent holders to obtain adequate damages for patent infringement, as this will be the only viable remedy in many cases.</p><p>Significantly, Congress expressly and resoundingly rejected mandatory \"apportionment\" in 1946 when it adopted the existing statutory standard for calculating damages, codified in Section 284 of the Patent Act. During hearings on the issue, Congress and other experts noted that apportionment was an overly complex and wholly unworkable test, resulting in excessive litigation costs, extreme delays and unfair damages awards for all parties. One patent expert described mandatory apportionment accountings as \"the great evil that has grown up around the patent system.\" And another expert observed that many cases requiring apportionment had \"run from 10 to 20 years, [...] and others I have known have gone on for 20 years. Some now are running that have been running 20 years and all the people that started in the [apportionment] accounting are dead.\"2 To revert back to an apportionment standard that was universally condemned more than 60 years ago would represent a major step backwards for our patent system -- the very antithesis of patent \"reform.\"</p><p>In lieu of a mandatory apportionment test, Congress in 1946 sought to create a damages standard that would afford courts the necessary flexibility and discretion to determine a fair and appropriate level of damages in cases where a patent has been deemed valid and infringed. Congress's aim, as reflected in the 1946 hearings, was also to ensure that damages awards were sufficient to compensate the patentee for past injury and to deter others from committing similar acts of infringement. With these time-honored and market-based principles in mind, Section 284 of the Patent Act provides that \"Upon finding for the claimant the court shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for the infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer, together with interest and costs as fixed by the court.\" Under this provision, a \"reasonable royalty\" -- i.e., the amount that the patentee would have obtained from licensing its patent -- is the minimum amount of damages payable to the patentee. Any lesser amount of damages would reward and encourage widespread continued infringement, increase costly litigation and ultimately diminish the value of the patent.</p><p>In some cases, a patent owner may have licensed the infringed patent to others, thereby effectively setting an \"established royalty\" as the minimum baseline for damages awarded to the patent holder. However, in cases where there is no established royalty, courts have historically applied a wide variety of factors to determine the royalty the parties would have agreed to in a hypothetical negotiation. In the seminal Georgia- Pacific case3, the court identified 15 factors that courts had historically deemed relevant in determining a reasonable royalty, the first and most important being a history of \"licensing proving or tending to prove an established royalty.\"</p><p>Under Georgia-Pacific, once a patent has been deemed valid and infringed, the courts are provided the flexibility to consider the relevant market factors that would be at issue during a negotiation to arrive at a reasonable royalty for use of the invention. Under this established market-based approach to calculating an equitable award of damages, the court is provided the discretion to determine which factors should be considered for a particular patent and what relative weight should be given each factor. Indeed, in enumerating the list of potentially relevant factors, the Georgia-Pacific court explicitly rejected any kind of mandatory formula or test in deciding the relevance or relative weight of any one factor, other than an established royalty:</p><p>The drawing of proper conclusions from conflicting evidence concerning the amount of a reasonable royalty has been said to call \"for the exercise of judicial discretion by the District Court.\" General Motors Corp. v. Dailey, 93 F.2d 938, 942 (6th Cir. 1937). Both sides agree that this Court has a broad range of judgment in evaluating the relevant factors. In the present case there is a multiplicity of inter-penetrating factors bearing upon the amount of a reasonable royalty. But there is no formula by which these factors can be rated precisely in the order of their relative importance or by which their economic significance can be automatically transduced into their pecuniary equivalent. In discharging its responsibility as fact finder, the Court has attempted to exercise a discriminating judgment reflecting its ultimate appraisal of all pertinent factors in the context of the credible evidence. (emphasis added)</p><p>This flexible, market-based process for calculating a reasonable royalty has been applied in thousands of patent cases. Congress should not depart from this well-established methodology, particularly when the proposed apportionment amendments appear to ignore hard-won lessons about the dangers of rigid damages rules and formulas. Indeed, by resurrecting a mandatory apportionment test, Congress risks repeating mistakes of the past and subjecting patentees and infringers to the same uncertainty, excessive litigation costs and unfair damage awards that ultimately led to the flexible, market-based damages standard codified in Section 284.</p><p>The Department of Commerce in a recent letter to Chairman Berman reiterated the importance of preserving the flexible methodology of Georgia-Pacific, despite questions about recent, seemingly high damage awards. Damages awards in patent cases can and should reflect a variety of factors; and neither courts nor juries should be precluded from considering potentially relevant factors, or required to elevate any one factor over another:</p><p>While the appropriateness of damage awards in a number of patent cases may be subject to debate, DOC does not believe that a sufficient case has been made for a legislative provision to codify or emphasize any one or more factors that a court may apply when determining reasonable royalty rates. . . . It appears that the courts have adequate guidance through Georgia-Pacific and, as a general matter, do in fact consider numerous factors in determining royalty rates. . . The amount of a reasonable royalty should turn on the facts of each particular case, as best as those facts can be determined.</p><p>Of course, apportionment of damages may be appropriate in certain situations. Indeed, among the 15 factors enumerated by the Georgia-Pacific court is \"The portion of realizable profit that should be credited to the invention as distinguished from non- patented elements, the manufacturing process, business risks, or significant features or improvements added by the infringer\" (factor 13). Consistent with Georgia-Pacific, the Federal Circuit's model jury instructions permit consideration of the \"portion of the profit that is due to the patented invention, as compared to the portion of the profit due to other factors.\" Apportionment, however, is not appropriate in all cases. In particular, courts have long held that the parsing of a patent's value is sensible only if the patent represents a relatively insignificant and separable part of the overall product. In contrast, where a patent is responsible for all or substantially all of the product's market value, apportionment is unnecessary and inappropriate. Similarly, apportionment is never appropriate in cases where the patentee demonstrates an established, market- tested royalty.</p><p>The Senate apportionment proposal departs from these principles in numerous, significant respects that would greatly diminish the patent rights and remedies of InterDigital and other innovative firms that rely upon their patents to generate licensing revenue and fund ongoing research and development. Beyond the rigid mandate that courts apportion damages in virtually all cases, the proposed amendment would create an entirely new standard of apportionment that limits a patent's value to its \"specific contribution over the prior art.\" In addition, the court must exclude from the royalty amount the \"economic value properly attributable to the prior art, and other features or improvements, whether or not themselves patented, that contribute economic value to the infringing product or process.\" This unprecedented and subjective analysis could lead to absurd and wholly inequitable results in which a patented technology is deemed to have little or no demonstrable value, even in cases where a well-established history of licensing exists.</p><p>In contrast, the existing apportionment test, as articulated in Georgia-Pacific, looks to the value of the entire patented \"invention,\" as defined by the examination process. Once granted, the patent as a whole has been deemed useful, novel and non-obvious and thus entitled in full to exclusive rights and remedies. The Senate's mandatory apportionment proposal would, in effect, call into question the significance of this examination process, and signal that only certain parts of the patent, as arbitrarily defined by the court, are valuable and thus eligible for damages.</p><p>The only proposed exception to mandatory apportionment is a new and much-heightened formulation of the \"entire market value rule\", which requires the patentee to show that the patent's \"specific contribution over the prior art is the predominant basis for market demand for the infringing product or process.\" Here again, the terminology \"specific contribution over the prior art\" has no defined or well-understood meaning under existing patent law and, as a result, will inject considerable uncertainty into damages proceedings. Similarly, the requirement that a patent's \"specific contribution\" be the \"predominant\" basis for market demand will for most complex technologies erect an insurmountable burden of proof that will gut the \"entire market value rule\" of any relevance.</p><p>Perhaps most troubling is the fact that the bill relegates evidence of negotiated licensing terms to a secondary consideration that can and must be ignored by the court to the extent that such terms conflict with the dictates of apportionment. Under the Senate bill, a court must apply the new apportionment analysis even in cases where the patentee demonstrates a history of negotiated royalties and licensing terms; moreover, the court has discretion to ignore these terms altogether. There is simply no economic or legal justification for mandating that a court and jury second-guess the market, and doing so will only encourage infringement.</p><p>Under the new mandatory apportionment provision, many infringers will feel emboldened to continue their infringing activity because their exposure to damages under the amended Section 284 is dramatically decreased or at least made less certain. Infringers, to the extent they are willing to engage at all in licensing discussions with a patent holder, will adopt negotiating positions with intractably low financial elements, thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of arriving at a negotiated license agreement. At the same time, patent holders that rely upon licensing as the mechanism for securing a return on their investment in innovation will be forced to litigate in order to achieve at least a modest financial reward for their inventive contribution to society.</p><p>Negotiated licenses, absent litigation, will decrease because infringers will demand royalty terms significantly below what their exposure may be at trial. With diminished risk to an infringer for continued unlicensed activity, negotiated resolutions of patent disputes will significantly decrease and litigation will increase commensurately. Along with an increase in litigation, costs for legal proceedings will also grow as the new process for calculating damages will in virtually every case require the court to determine \"the patent's specific contribution over the prior art.\"</p><p>The extreme difficulty and cost of administering such a novel and complex standard was emphasized in a recent letter to Chairman Leahy and Senator Hatch from Chief Judge Paul Michel of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the judicial circuit that hears all appeals from federal district courts arising under US patent laws. In his letter, Chief Judge Michel noted that courts and juries are ill-equipped to interpret or apply this new apportionment test, and the requirement that they do so will inevitably lead to costly battles between expert witnesses and increased litigation costs and delays:</p><p>This is a massive undertaking for which courts are ill-equipped. For one thing, generalist judges lack experience and expertise in making such extensive, complex economic valuations, as do lay jurors. For another, courts would be inundated with massive amounts of data, requiring extra weeks of trial in nearly every case. Resolving the meaning of this novel language could take years, as could the mandating of proper methods. The provision also invites an unseemly battle of \"hired-gun\" experts opining on the basis of indigestible quantities of economic data. Such an exercise might be successfully executed by an economic institution with massive resources and unlimited time, but hardly seems within the capability of already overburdened district courts.</p><p>Chief Judge Michel concludes by stating that he is \"unaware of any convincing demonstration of the need\" for this new mandatory apportionment standard. What makes the practical application of this new requirement even more dubious is that patent examiners themselves do not engage in determining a patent application's \"specific contribution over the prior art.\" Instead, during examination, a patent is awarded if the applicant can demonstrate that claimed invention is useful, novel and non-obvious. A patent applicant is not required, nor should he or she be, to articulate the specific contribution of the patent application over the prior art. Rather, the applicant need only demonstrate that the claimed invention is novel and non-obvious over the prior art. Put differently, it is the entire claimed invention, not merely a parsing of claim elements, that reflects the patent's contribution over the prior art. Thus, the process of determining a patent's specific contribution over the prior art is one which has never been undertaken by the courts, juries or even by the USPTO. Clearly, then, the apportionment measure will decrease incentives to innovate and increase the frequency and cost of litigation.</p><p>Post-Grant Opposition</p><p>Although InterDigital recognizes that existing reexamination procedures are capable of improvement, we oppose the introduction of a new, duplicative and potentially burdensome post-grant opposition process as both premature and harmful to the thousands of innovative firms that rely upon enforceable patent rights to fund ongoing research and development.</p><p>Reexaminations procedures are an important part of our patent system and a critical check on the small percentage of patents that are erroneously granted each year. At the same time, however, such procedures must also strive to preserve the value and enforceability of the vast majority of meritorious patents.</p><p>Under Chapters 30 and 31 of the Patent Act, a patent can be challenged at the USPTO through both ex parte and inter partes reexamination procedures, respectively. Unlike ex parte reexamination, inter partes reexamination allows the third party to participate during the process of reexamination by submitting written comments addressing issues raised by the patent examiner or the patent owner's response to the PTO. The opportunity for reexamination under these two sections of the Patent Act extends for the life of the patent. However, a party is estopped from raising at a later time any ground for invalidity that the third party raised or could have raised during the reexamination proceedings, unless the assertion of invalidity is based on newly discovered prior art unavailable to the challenger and PTO at the time of the original reexamination proceedings.</p><p>During the process of reexamination, the patent owner may make amendments to the claims of the patent in order to arrive at the proper scope of protection for the claimed invention. In some cases, every claim of a patent is canceled, but usually the claims are confirmed or substituted with new or amended claims. This process recognizes that although certain issued patent claims may be invalid in view of newly identified prior art, the patent holder should be able to modify the scope of patent protection in view of this prior art and retain rights in the adjusted claims. In that respect, the goal of reexamination is not to \"bust\" patents, but to ensure that their scope is appropriate in view of the prior art. This Senate bill proposes yet another mechanism for reviewing issued patents in addition to ex parte and inter partes reexamination, and also expands the existing inter partes process by narrowing its estoppel effect and permitting challenges of all issued patents. The proposed post-grant opposition process would allow parties to petition the PTO to cancel claims of a granted patent, but in the context of a quasi-judicial proceeding with administrative judges, discovery, cross-examination and other costly aspects of litigation. This post-grant review would be available to petitioners during a \"first window\" lasting 12 months after the grant of the patent and during a \"second window\" which may be opened if the petitioner receives notice of infringement of the patent or if the petitioner establishes a substantial reason to believe the patent claim is likely to cause the petitioner significant economic harm. A patent may also be reviewed at any time upon written consent of the patent owner.</p><p>InterDigital believes that adding an expansive and duplicative new post-grant opposition process, while maintaining and expanding the existing inter partes reexamination process, would subject patents to an unfair and unreasonable number of duplicative attacks on validity. Under the proposed opposition system, only those grounds that are actually raised by a petitioner are estopped from being asserted again in a subsequent administrative proceeding or civil action. This narrow estoppel effect will encourage duplicative administrative and judicial challenges -- a threat further exacerbated by the bill's narrowing of the inter partes estoppel effect.</p><p>In addition to the threat of harassment, patentees will find it far more expensive to defend administrative challenges under the proposed opposition system. A post-grant opposition system would combine aspects of a judicial and administrative reexamination process, but eliminate or substantially dilute existing safeguards that have effectively discouraged misuse of the system. In the process, it would create a quasi-judicial system of administrative litigation that heavily tips the balance in favor of the challenger's interests. Unlike a civil proceeding, a post-grant opposition system would facilitate invalidation by eliminating the patent's presumption of validity and reducing significantly the challenger's evidentiary burden to mere preponderance of the evidence (compared with the rigorous clear and convincing standard that governs judicial invalidity challenges). Moreover, because the proposed opposition system would unnecessarily restrict the patentee's ability to amend its claims (in contrast with the flexible inter partes reexamination process), it would encourage outright invalidation of a patent that may simply require an adjustment in scope. This threat will be used aggressively by accused infringers against patent owners.</p><p>Patent owners will bear the brunt of these increased litigation costs, particularly if opposition is permitted for any issue of patentability throughout the life of the patent. In contrast, a competitor or free rider - relieved of robust evidentiary requirements and the risk of estoppel - would have every incentive to seek opposition, regardless of the patent's strength. Such a system would inevitably invite abuse, allowing corporate giants to misuse opposition litigation as a means of blocking patents that frustrate their business interests. Indeed, by stripping a patent holder of the protections that guard against baseless challenges, an open-ended opposition threat would cast a permanent cloud over a patent's legitimacy and enforceability.</p><p>This potential for costly, duplicative and harassing attacks on granted patents would be extremely detrimental to patent holders that rely upon negotiated license agreements to secure revenue and financing. The proposed regulations and sanctions for abuse would do little to prevent gamesmanship of the system, since demonstrating misuse would be an extremely difficult exercise. The proposed post-grant opposition system would thus allow infringers to utilize different channels of post-grant review to avoid legitimate licensing efforts. Such a result would be particularly devastating for start-ups and other smaller firms whose very survival is often dependent on early stage venture capital and licensing revenue.</p><p>Significantly, the current proposal for post-grant review would do little to improve patent quality. If afforded an indefinite \"second window\" that can be triggered by virtually any challenger at any time, third parties in possession of relevant prior art would have little incentive to bring such references to the PTO's attention, particularly if the estoppel effect of a second window is no broader than that of the first window. Instead, a potential infringer would almost always be inclined to hold onto the prior art until the last possible moment (e.g., after repeated attempts by the patent holder to negotiate a patent license resulting in a dispute that appears headed for litigation) before filing a \"second window\" petition for cancellation of the patent.</p><p>Finally, a surge in complex post-grant proceedings will further strain an already over-burdened and under-funded USPTO staff, thus jeopardizing the agency's ability to improve pre-grant patent quality. The Department of Commerce echoed this concern in its letter to Chairman Berman, noting that the proposed \"second window coupled with the substantial number of patents subject to the proposed review procedures create very legitimate concerns about the USPTO's ability to effectively handle the potential workload.\" With a portfolio of some 400,000 patent applications per year, the USPTO is struggling to perform its core examination functions, as evidenced by application pendency periods of 30-40 months. The proposed post-grant opposition system will inevitably divert funding from the examination corps, potentially resulting in even greater delays and, most importantly, diminished patent quality.</p><p>To guard against these negative effects, we urge Congress to consider improvements to the existing post-grant system of inter partes reexamination in lieu of a new, duplicative and potentially burdensome administrative review process. If post- grant opposition is ultimately deemed to be a necessary and preferable alternative to inter partes reexamination, implementation of a new opposition proceeding should not occur until the USPTO has demonstrated its ability to perform core examination functions in a timely manner and is given the resources to manage the significant demands of a new system of administrative litigation. Even at that time, opposition proceedings should be limited to a single window of review (i.e., within 12 months of issuance) and combined with adequate safeguards against abusive challenges, including a meaningful estoppel effect and a mechanism to allow the patent holder to freely amend his/her claims as in the current reexamination process, to ensure that patent owners enjoy clear title over their inventions throughout the lives of their patents.</p><p>Substantive USPTO Rulemaking Authority</p><p>InterDigital believes that substantive and potentially significant changes to patent rules are ill-suited to administrative rulemaking processes and should remain the exclusive domain of Congress.</p><p>The Senate bill would empowers the Director of the USPTO with unprecedented and expansive substantive rulemaking authority, which would encompass any \"rules, regulations, and orders that the Director determines appropriate to carry out the provisions of [the Patent Act] or any other law applicable to the [USPTO] or that the Director determines necessary to govern the operation and organization of the Office.\" This rulemaking authority would pave the way for well-intentioned but inadvisable regulatory changes, including severe restrictions on continuation and claim practice that are opposed by the overwhelming majority of patent holders. Significantly, even the Department of Commerce voiced concerns about \"unbounded discretion\" in its letter to Chairman Berman and recommended against an overly broad grant of rulemaking authority.</p><p>Because of various limits on its jurisdiction, the USPTO lacks meaningful exposure to the commercial and economic complexities of patents post-issuance, and thus lacks the breadth of perspective and experience to legislate effectively in substantive and critical areas of patent prosecution. As evidence of this, the USPTO has recently proposed significant regulatory changes that would negatively impact innovators and economic growth, including unprecedented limitations on continuation and claims practice. The fact that the USPTO has hastily finalized these new rules -- without disclosing its underlying studies and despite overwhelming opposition among patent holders -- confirms that its rulemaking procedures are ill-equipped to conduct administrative patent reform with the necessary deliberation and transparency.</p><p>Interlocutory Appeals</p><p>Although InterDigital shares the committee's desire to reduce litigation costs and delays, we fear that immediate appeals of claim construction rulings would have the opposite effect and benefit only those litigants with deep pockets.</p><p>The Senate bill would expressly authorize an immediate appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) after a pre- trial Markman hearing on claim construction. Although aimed at reducing the length and cost of patent litigation, InterDigital believes that an immediate appeal right could have the reverse effect of increasing the costs and delays of litigation, as noted in Chief Judge Michel's letter to Chairman Leahy and Senate Hatch. We thus encourage the committee to remove this amendment from the bill. Claim construction in a patent infringement litigation is conducted pre-trial during a proceeding known as a Markman hearing. Upon considering briefs and oral arguments, the court issues an order construing contested claim terms in a patent. The claim construction is the framework used by the jury (or the court in a bench trial) to determine whether an accused method or device infringes the patent at issue.</p><p>Under current law, issues concerning claim construction may be appealed to the CAFC upon a judgment from the lower court. The Senate bill would allow a party, as a matter of right, to appeal from an interlocutory order on claim construction. Since claim construction is a crucial component to virtually all patent infringement cases, a party dissatisfied with the lower court's order will most likely pursue an appeal to the CAFC. As a result, this right of appeal will significantly delay final judgments from the lower court and result in increased delays in reaching potential settlements, as well as increased litigation costs.</p><p>Similarly, a dramatic increase in the number of appeals brought to the CAFC will further stretch its limited resources, causing further delays and costs at the appellate level. In his letter to Chairman Leahy and Senator Hatch, the CAFC's Chief Judge Michel noted that based on empirical studies, immediate appeal of claim construction rulings could double the number of filings to the CAFC and also double the amount of time necessary to resolve an appeal from one to two years. In the meantime, proceedings at the trial court level would be frozen, thus doubling delays in district courts, which according to Judge Michel, are typically two to three years. InterDigital also shares Judge Michel's concern that claim construction appeals could lead to significant inefficiencies, as claim construction rulings are subject to change during summary judgment proceedings or trials.</p><p>InterDigital Supports Balanced Reforms that Promote Patent Quality, Fairness and Incentives to Innovate InterDigital supports legislative reforms that would enhance pre-grant patent quality and reduce the uncertainty and inefficiency of patent litigation, including, for example, [a permanent end to fee diversion, enhanced third party prior art submissions, universal publication of patent applications and enhanced judicial training.]</p><p>The concept of patent \"reform\" signifies improvements to the efficiency, fairness and overall strength of our patent system. As a licensing-based business that lives or dies on the strength of its patents, InterDigital is a staunch advocate of true patent reform, particularly measures that enhance patent quality, preserve incentives to innovate, and promote a fair and balanced playing field among all stakeholders, large and small. In our view, mandatory apportionment, post-grant opposition, expansive USPTO rulemaking authority, and interlocutory appeals fall outside the realm of patent \"reform\" and, in fact, would degrade patent rights and increase the prevalence, costs and uncertainty of litigation, particularly for smaller innovators. The aim of patent reform is not to gut the patent rights critical to today's knowledge-based economy, but instead to bolster the system with measures that will improve pre-grant patent quality.</p><p>Patent quality is best achieved by pre-grant measures that provide examiners with the resources, training and information needed to properly assess whether an invention is, in fact, novel, non-obvious and useful. A recent study by the National Research Council also demonstrates that increases in patent examination resources yield important reductions in post-grant litigation, further underscoring the critical importance of such measures.6 To its credit, the USPTO has taken several steps in recent years to improve pre-grant quality, including by hiring of thousands of new examiners and strengthening its training programs.7 The results are promising. In December 2006, the USPTO reported a significant decrease in the patent allowance rate to a record low of 54 percent -- a dramatic drop from the 2000 rate of 70 percent. In addition, the USPTO in 2006 achieved its lowest error rate in 20 years -- 3.5 percent. Of course, to maintain this trend, it is imperative that the USPTO continue to receive the resources necessary to evaluate an escalating number of patent applications. And to that end, what is most needed is legislation to permanently end patent fee diversion. Patent reform legislation stands little chance of achieving positive and concrete improvements without addressing vital resource issues. InterDigital is well aware that the committee shares our concerns about fee diversion, and we are very appreciative of your long- standing efforts to ensure that the USPTO retains its fees.</p><p>In that same vein, increased USPTO resources will yield quality gains only if examiners have the information and incentives to recognize and reject claims for obvious or non-novel inventions. InterDigital thus supports measures that would foster an environment of cooperation between patent examiners and applicants and increase the prior art available to examiners. These include, for example, the Senate bill's proposal to increase third-party submissions and mandate universal publication of all patent applications.</p><p>InterDigital also supports reforms designed to reduce litigation costs, uncertainty and abuse. It is a mistake, however, to characterize efforts to weaken the enforceability of legitimate patents as litigation reforms. Not only would such measures undercut the rights of all patent owners to protect a few corporate giants from potential infringement litigation, they would ultimately increase the number of lawsuits by encouraging infringers to seek court-ordered rather than market-based solutions.</p><p>We believe that litigation reforms should reduce the subjective, unpredictable and inefficient aspects of patent litigation that negatively impact patent owners and users alike. For example, we would encourage the committee to reintroduce an amendment to eliminate the best mode requirement. A narrow but meaningful reform of this type strikes the right balance by reducing subjective aspects of the patent system that escalate litigation costs, without diminishing the rights and remedies of legitimate patent owners. Similarly, InterDigital supports measures that would enhance judicial training in patent law and, in turn, steer patent cases towards district court judges with the desire and expertise to take on these complex and highly technical matters. Reforms of this type would heighten the fairness, predictability and efficiency of patent litigation for all stakeholders. We also believe that statutory clarification of the inequitable conduct defense could benefit all participants in the patent system, provided that such a measure appropriately balances the interests of patent owners and users.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Given the critical importance of our patent system to American innovation and economic leadership, it is imperative that patent reforms be carefully tailored to achieve necessary improvements and, in all cases, to promote and protect investments in innovation. The over-arching goal of patent quality is ill-served by measures that would destabilize our current system of patent rights and remedies and, in turn, jeopardize the global leadership of this country's most innovative industries.</p><p>If our shared objective is to improve patent quality while preserving incentives to innovate, we should instead pursue reforms that enhance patent examination resources and capabilities within the USPTO and make it harder for questionable patent applications to survive pre-grant scrutiny. The USPTO has already taken important steps to achieve these goals, hiring thousands of new examiners, instituting new training programs and committing annually to performance benchmarks. But it needs Congress's support in the form of a predictable flow of resources and hence a permanent end to fee diversion. In addition, InterDigital encourages this committee to pursue constructive but narrowly tailored reforms that would increase access to prior art and lessen the subjective aspects of litigation. Carefully structured measures of this type would ultimately fortify the health of our patent system without endangering the rights of American's most innovative firms.</p><p>The Senate patent bill has been described as the most significant piece of patent legislation in over 50 years. As such, it is no exaggeration that this bill and its proposed changes to our patent system will have a dramatic impact on the future course of American innovation. Although InterDigital believes that many of the bill's provisions will have a positive impact, encouraging companies like ours to invest in the cutting edge innovations that will secure our country's economic leadership, we fear that mandatory apportionment, open-ended post-grant opposition, broad administrative rulemaking authority and interlocutory appeals could have a very detrimental effect, particularly if they signal to other countries a weakening of America's commitment to strong patent rights.</p><p>America's system of patent rights and remedies can and should be improved, but it is universally recognized throughout the world as the gold standard. As such, it has given us the moral authority and credibility to fight for stronger protection of U.S. innovations in other markets. Maintaining that authority is critical in today's increasingly competitive global economy. America's leadership in this knowledge-based economy is highly dependent upon the ideas and innovations that constitute our most valuable natural resources and our most desirable exports. If the United States weakens patent rights and remedies at home, our ability to press foreign countries to respect American intellectual property will be greatly diminished. Indeed, we will embolden other countries to adopt even more damaging policies that could jeopardize the continued preeminence of America's most productive industries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGTST2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4NX2-X5H0-0003-1229-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9512\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Congressional Testimony</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2007 Congressional Quarterly, Inc.

Unfortunately, the rush to adopt STEM reforms in North American schools and develop students for competitive 21<sup>st</sup> century knowledge economies has encouraged an uncritical embrace of underlying STEM narratives and purposes, thus foreclosing critical discussion, alternative models, and new perspectives on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">doing</emphasis> science education differently. Here, we unpack narratives and practices informing STEM education that induct learning actors into 'anticipatory regimes' that advance neoliberal ends and technocapitalist ideologies. We argue first that STEM narratives of progress, competition, and innovation increasingly obscure the urgent ecological, ethical and social justice conditions students confront daily. Ironically, this prepares them for a future rendered unsustainable by scientific and technological orthodoxy. We then draw upon critical sustainability studies (CSS) to articulate new axiological orientations that reposition science and technology learning. Lastly, we describe and illustrate an approach aligned with these critical principles - production pedagogy - whose theories and practices re-vision science and technology education. These strategies will situate students in agentive roles <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">now</emphasis>, in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">this</emphasis> present, using real-world tools in authentic sociotechnical contexts. They can then confront their own capacities and limitations to engage in personally relevant ways, as producers, with techno-scientific knowledge.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FULL TEXT</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Introduction</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><anchor id=\"ref0260\"/>Policy and initiatives advancing STEM education are pervasive within the global landscape of educational reform. While STEM policy documents provide rationale for ratifying new curricula that can deepen students' engagement in the sciences, mathematics, engineering, and technology fields, STEM education discourses largely fail to translate innovations in policy into innovations in pedagogy, and neglect, as well, theoretical and epistemological advances in conceptualizing the impacts of science and technology in physical, social, and symbolic worlds (<link><marker>Murphy, Firetto, &amp; Greene, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0260\"/></link>; <link><marker>Rudolph, 2008</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0310\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zeidler, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0435\"/></link>). At the same time, the urgency to adopt and implement STEM reforms in North American schools has resulted in an uncritical embrace of underlying STEM aims and purposes, in turn foreclosing dissent, critical discussion, alternative models, and new perspectives on how we might 'do' science, and (STEM) education, differently.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0080\"/>In schools, standardized assessments and a dependence upon routinized curricular forms mediate and mitigate efforts to critically engage and rethink STEM education, particularly under conditions where governmental policy and corporate/media pressures encourage policymakers, educators and students onto STEM 'bandwagons' (<link><marker>Carter, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0080\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zeidler, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0435\"/></link>). At the same time, STEM reform initiatives continue to abstract science and technology practices from wider sociotechnical contexts, and narrowly delimit STEM learning to the developmental acquisition of decontextualized technical 'skills', compartmentalized disciplinary knowledge, and 'fragmented' expectations that have been separated into non-communicating STEM content areas (<link><marker>Krug &amp; Shaw, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0215\"/></link>). In the rush to implement STEM reform policies in schools, STEM education aims are adapted for, and translated into, quite traditional pedagogies, conventional curricular forms, and standardized assessments. Consequently, reform efforts may contain STEM learning in discrete disciplinary worlds as well as perpetuate a 'scientific rationalist approach' to curriculum and science studies (<link><marker>Gough, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0155\"/></link>) that further separates science and technology education from wider social worlds and communities - from the dramas, living controversies, and critical social justice and ecological questions of our time.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0270\"/>Historically, science education reform initiatives have been mobilized as responses to national security 'crises', workplace 'supply shortages', and 'economic downturns' (<link><marker>Krug &amp; Shaw, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0215\"/></link>). Rationales for STEM education are similarly framed around concerns to address (re)emerging economic crises and perceived deficits in worker skills, accompanied by an instrumentalized and entrepreneurial language set in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">preparing</emphasis> students for the professional dispositions required to succeed - and to innovate - in increasingly competitive and globalized 21<sup>st</sup> century 'knowledge economies' (<link><marker>Olssen &amp; Peters, 2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0270\"/></link>). Absent from dominant STEM discourses, however, are critical analyses or a problematization of the broader social, economic, or ecological implications of these rationales, goals and related science practices, or questions about whose interests, or what kinds of interests, they serve (<link><marker>Habermas, 1968</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0170\"/></link>; <link><marker>Harding, 1991</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0185\"/></link>; <link><marker>Tan &amp; Calabrese-Barton, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0370\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0230\"/>Indeed, overshadowed by the rhetoric of educational 'preparation' are the increasingly urgent ecological, ethical and social justice exigencies that require us to critically rethink education in general, and STEM education in particular, not as instructional programs that developmentally prepare students for some preordained future, but rather as dynamic vehicles that situate learners in critical, agentive roles <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">now</emphasis> - in the present - enabled to negotiate real-world challenges and controversies using real-world tools in authentic sociotechnical contexts (<link><marker>Luke, Sefton-Green, Graham, Kellner, &amp; Ladwig, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0230\"/></link>; <link><marker>Thumlert, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0380\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0220\"/>By contrast, what frequently passes as self-evident in STEM education discourses is the exigency to reform and refine the very mechanisms of 'preparation', the pathways and curricular processes that would developmentally equip students for STEM fields, professions, and futures. In this article, we first interrogate the discourses, curricular practices, and narrative pathways that STEM reforms <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">anticipate</emphasis> for learning actors. In short, how are students, through induction into STEM education's preparatory systems, uncritically incorporated into a curricularly-prepackaged and 'ready-made science' order (<link><marker>Latour, 1987</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0220\"/></link>; <link><marker>Visvanathan, 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0405\"/></link>) and, with that, into unsustainable science and technology values, roles, and epistemologies.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0100\"/>We then sketch out a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">pedagogical</emphasis> model that might recompose science education and learning in an explicitly critical key, where students are positioned instead to engage science and technology questions and controversies and, further, take up agentive positions in reconfiguring their own individual and collective futures, here and now. We begin with a review of critiques of STEM from within contemporary science education theory. We then draw upon critical sustainability studies (CSS) to articulate new practical and axiological orientations for repositioning science and sustainability practices today. In conjunction with CSS, we then articulate the opportunities of 'production pedagogy' theories and models (<link><marker>de Castell, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0100\"/></link>; <link><marker>Smythe, Toohey, &amp; Dagenais, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0335\"/></link>; <link><marker>Thumlert, de Castell, &amp; Jenson, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0385\"/></link>) that provide a pedagogical framework for doing (science) education differently, as well as for modelling practices of democratic governance: means of engaging the problems of the public, and the politics of science, through critical making and critical media interventions. We conclude with reference to one working model that, by conjoining critical sustainability with authentic artefactual and media production today, can help us rethink and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">redo</emphasis> science and technology education.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. From crisis to salvation: critical challenges from within science education</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0320\"/>Critical work in science education has contested the 'hegemony' of STEM discourses (<link><marker>Sharma, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0320\"/></link>) as well as interrogated State, corporate, and educational policy directives that pressure actors in schools to rapidly adopt STEM initiatives (<link><marker>Zeidler, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0435\"/></link>). This body of work includes critiques of the neoliberal ideologies and economic narratives embedded in STEM educational policies, discourses that widely underwrite reform efforts in schools (<link><marker>Carter, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0080\"/></link>; <link><marker>Weinstein, Blades, &amp; Gleason, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0410\"/></link>). For example, in a comprehensive review of key governmental, educational, and business documents advancing STEM education initiatives, <link><marker>Krug and Shaw (2016)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0215\"/></link> identify three dominant narratives that inform and drive STEM policy - 'progress, innovation, and global competitiveness' - narratives that link STEM education reform to economic purposes and corporate (technocapitalist) aims.</p><p>At the same time, related crisis narratives - narratives of 'declining empire' (<link><marker>Sharma, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0320\"/></link>), school failure, 'skills gaps', and scarcity in 'human capital' and 'STEM-ready workers' (<link><marker>Carter, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0080\"/></link>) - insistently reify STEM education as singular panacea to the very problems these discourses define. <link><marker>Zeidler (2016)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0435\"/></link> describes this as the 'STEM deficit model', where the deficits, gaps, and declines articulated in dominant STEM discourses can be ameliorated by more STEM investment, more reform, and more enhancement of existing STEM curriculum and policies.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0160\"/>The deficit model described by <link><marker>Zeidler (2016)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0435\"/></link> seamlessly dovetails with a complementary technocapitalist narrative: 'STEM as societal salvation' (<link><marker>Weinstein et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0410\"/></link>). This latter narrative envisions STEM education as a vehicle for innovation and technical solutions (e.g., solar panels, robotics, space colonization, etc.) to global problems, while fitting science practices, innovation and even 'sustainability' within technical-rational and neoliberal frameworks. To this, <link><marker>Green (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0160\"/></link> adds that high-tech 'Silicon State' narratives are becoming drivers of educational reform while, at the same time, popular media's uncritical embrace of Silicon Valley's neoliberal vision further erodes public governance over the world-changing 'disruptive innovations' rapidly emerging from these corporatizing sectors. Other researchers (<link><marker>Strong &amp; Das, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0360\"/></link>; <link><marker>Strong et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0365\"/></link>) point out that, as schools adopt neoliberal narratives, they also rationalize norms and values into the STEM curriculum: competitive (entrepreneurial) individualism, the atomization of social actors, and attempts to apply homogenizing principles to the world in ways that foster a logic of globalization, rather than an ethos of locality, community and conviviality (<link><marker>Massey, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0245\"/></link>; <link><marker>McCarthy &amp; Prudham, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0255\"/></link>; <link><marker>Robertson, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0300\"/></link>). This poses dilemmas for movements seeking to reassert community identity, place-based work and grassroots empowerment. Following this logic, the protocols, conventions and theories taught in science classrooms are often presented as objective, legitimate knowledge - comprehensible and relevant to all - while dismissing or disregarding other modes of understanding the world, including indigenous ways of knowing and holistic 'ecoliteracies' (<link><marker>Hampson, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0175\"/></link>; <link><marker>Strong &amp; Das, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0360\"/></link>). And here, dominant STEM discourses and practices in education, when they engage contemporary ecological and social matters, typically do so in terms of an instrumental solutionism where science is embedded in narratives that celebrate <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">homo faber</emphasis> innovation - and where technical innovations feed forward into cycles of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">homo economicus</emphasis> consumption and exchange (<link><marker>Gough, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0155\"/></link>; <link><marker>Lyotard, 1984</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0235\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zouda, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0440\"/></link>).</p><p>Left unaddressed in STEM (etiological) 'deficit models' and (eschatological) 'salvation' narratives are problematic contradictions: above all, the very same neoliberal ideologies that rationalize and promote STEM education as solution/salvation also implicitly naturalize free markets, the free movement of commodities, and the free investments of global (human) capital in largely unregulated, low-wage labour sites (i.e., in 'developing nations'). In turn, this economic liberalization puts increasing competitive pressure on North American job markets - as well as global physical systems - through the liberalised 'flows' of (human) capital and the networked 'offshoring/outsourcing' of STEM jobs.</p><p>These operations devalue wages globally and further deteriorate labour conditions, increasing the precarity of already precarious 21<sup>st</sup> century jobs in North America and elsewhere. In these contexts, STEM (education) narratives, fueled by neoliberal ideologies of competition, demands for 'national leadership' in innovation, and the closing of the so-called STEM 'skills gap', ultimately amplify - and tautologically ensure the reproduction of - the very crises and deficits that STEM education would presume to 'solve'. Further, STEM 'solutions' are articulated in terms of expert technical-rational innovations designed to, on one hand, optimize the system that develops markets and generates economic growth and, on the other, remedy or 'fix' the growing ecological/environmental consequences that exfoliate from these same global processes and relations (see <link><marker>Weinstein et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0410\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0050\"/>Critical educational researchers have thus called for transformations in, or 'disruptions' of, dominant STEM (education) practices, with recent calls not just to contest economic narratives, but to rethink the very narratives, roles, and practices of 'normal' science (<link><marker>Bencze &amp; Carter, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0050\"/></link>). Researchers signal that STEM education, regulated by traditional assessments, curricular forms, and positivist epistemologies, selectively ignore socio-scientific issues and disengage science education from worlds outside of schools, as well as insulate STEM education from a reflexive interdisciplinary critique of the complex impacts of science and technology (<link><marker>Gough, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0155\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zeidler, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0430\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zeidler, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0435\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0035\"/>At the same time, critical researchers in science education share common ground in their resistance to a tacit educational embrace of 'value-neutral' technology tools and methods, claims to objectivity and impartiality, along with idealized 'views of the nature of science', static principles, and abstract 'scientific knowledge' that continue to inform STEM curriculum, instruction and assessment (<link><marker>Rudolph, 2008</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0310\"/></link>). For example, as <link><marker>Barrett (2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0035\"/></link>, <link><marker>2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0040\"/></link>) states, environmentally-focused science education, within traditional settings where curricular objectives are imposed <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">upon</emphasis> students, frequently negates opportunities for students to work, engage, and perceive themselves as meaningful collaborators in situated environmental, societal, and technological processes, or as agents capable of enacting change. In these contexts, STEM education often celebrates - and developmentally prepares students for - the very same technical-rational epistemological orientations to 'Nature' that have, arguably, contributed to the precarity of our contemporary Anthropocene. If STEM reforms uncritically equip learners for ready-made science dispositions, skills, and roles, they also generate 'anticipatory regimes' (<link><marker>Adams, Murphy, &amp; Clarke, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0010\"/></link>; <link><marker>Amsler &amp; Facer, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0025\"/></link>) that tacitly delimit (<link><marker>Bateman, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0045\"/></link>) possible futures: what is thinkable and doable as 'normal science'.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0135\"/>While calls to connect STEM education to environmental issues, sustainability, and 'real-world problems' are clearly audible (<link><marker>Fien, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0135\"/></link>; <link><marker>Krug &amp; Shaw, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0215\"/></link>), more and more researchers invite us to, further, fundamentally challenge the very <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">construction</emphasis> of science in STEM education, and to 'tinker' with, and even 'critically disrupt or displace' dominant STEM methodologies 'toward eco-social justice' orientations (<link><marker>Sharma, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0320\"/></link>; <link><marker>Yazzie &amp; Peacock, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0420\"/></link>) or STS interventions that critique the inherited languages and procedures of 'expert' science (<link><marker>Strong &amp; Das, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0360\"/></link>; <link><marker>York, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0425\"/></link>). STS researchers have long signalled more radical opportunities to 'remake science' (<link><marker>Latour, 1987</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0220\"/></link>, <link><marker>2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0225\"/></link>), articulating 'post-normal' and critical science and technology models that at once resist the alignment of STEM with economic and technocratic goals, while also challenging inherited epistemologies and curricular norms/forms that reproduce 'business as usual science' learning practices in schools (<link><marker>Amsler &amp; Facer, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0025\"/></link>; <link><marker>Stengers, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0350\"/></link>). Saliently, these authors demand that the emerging practices of science research and knowledge-making be made procedurally inextricable from questions of ethical responsibility, transparency and public participatory governance.</p><p>As a response to these calls, we argue that critical sustainability studies (CSS) challenges the hegemony of STEM discourses, pedagogies, and policies, providing a model for science and technology education that can help us articulate more critical and interdisciplinary pedagogies.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Critical sustainability studies: an alternative model beyond STEM education</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0130\"/>Critical sustainability studies (CSS) emerged in the 1990s as an interdisciplinary field of inquiry concerned with defining the emergence, limits, and the inherently political nature of the organizing principles of 'sustainable development' that many academics and scientists at the time embraced as a model for reconciling environmental challenges and science practices with imperatives of social and economic development (<link><marker>Ferreira, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0130\"/></link>; <link><marker>Rose &amp; Cachelin, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0305\"/></link>; <link><marker>Springett, 2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0340\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0415\"/>Challenging the rationality of the capitalist paradigm that underlies the notion of sustainable development, CSS scholars called for an examination of the economic, political, social, technological, and environmental forces that fostered or impeded rigorous, critical orientations toward sustainability, and narrowly defined the boundaries and meanings of sustainability itself. Briefly, early conceptions of sustainable development or eco-development-that is, those prior to the Brundtland Report (<link><marker>World Commission on Environment &amp; Development &amp; Bruntland, 1987</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0415\"/></link>)-were originally brought forward by Indigenous communities and local social groups (<link><marker>Gudynas, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0165\"/></link>; <link><marker>Springett, 2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0340\"/></link>; <link><marker>World Commission on Environment &amp; Development &amp; Bruntland, 1987</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0415\"/></link>). This original perspective embraced goals of equity and social justice in new ways, and was based on Indigenous rights and local community organizations' 'bottom-up' models, which were developed to counter emerging neoliberal policies that prominently affected local communities by applying market mechanisms to bio-physical environments.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0125\"/>Over time, the notion of sustainable development was increasingly coopted by corporate discourses and modified to represent 'greener' neoliberal-inspired eco-business and large-scale environmental transformations labelled as 'eco-efficient' or 'win-win' for all stakeholders. These conceptions helped define the emerging neoliberal paradigm of 'sustainability', and legitimated new forms of colonization and imperialism, shaped by the pursuit of resources, expanding markets, and \"green grabbing goals\" (<link><marker>Fairhead, Leach, &amp; Scoones, 2012, p. 238</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0125\"/></link>). At the same time, sustainability projects were, and continue to be, mobilized through rhetoric of 'crisis' intervention and, with that, a top-down transnational solutionism governed by (non-local) experts in order to anticipate and coordinate the participation of local stakeholdersand on the ground (<link><marker>Alonso-Yanez &amp; Davidesen, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0015\"/></link>; <link><marker>Alonso-Yanez, Thumlert, &amp; de Castell, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0020\"/></link>).</p><p>The field of CSS emerged as a response to the disappointments and tragedies of development assistance initiatives that had ignored local conditions, cultures, and the capacities of local/marginalized actors - initiatives that translated bio-physical 'crises' into development opportunities legitimated by STEM salvation narratives (<link><marker>Alonso-Yanez et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0020\"/></link>). In this regard, sustainability, as a set of ecological discourses, has been largely aligned with neoliberal discourses and technocapitalist interests designed to further entrench dominant global economic orders and relations.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0140\"/>Increasingly, however, CSS initiatives have captured scientific and popular attention, providing interdisciplinary researchers with a productive, critical entry point for an in-depth study of society-nature relations and the sociotechnical impacts of technology innovations in context-specific landscapes. CSS has led to a better understanding of how environmental, economic, and societal change processes are dynamically interconnected, and illuminate where contradictions in dominant sustainability paradigms emerge (<link><marker>Folke, 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0140\"/></link>; <link><marker>Ostrom, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0275\"/></link>; <link><marker>Reyers, Folke, Moore, Biggs, &amp; Galaz, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0295\"/></link>). Further, CSS scholars have analyzed the ways in which 'sustainability' projects have led to persistent social inequalities through technocratic governance instruments that reinforce or amplify existing social/environmental justice disparities (<link><marker>Bolin &amp; Kurtz, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0055\"/></link>; <link><marker>Balvanera et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0030\"/></link>; <link><marker>D\u00edaz et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0120\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0315\"/>Central to CSS literature is a focus on examining the close connection between globalization and technoscience, and how the supply and mobilization of knowledge, innovation, and biotechnology intensifies the extraction, use, or proprietary management of biophysical resources. This relationship falls within the scope of the Knowledge-based Bio-Economy, or KBBE-a concept defined as the process of transforming life science knowledge into new, sustainable, eco-efficient, and competitive products and services (<link><marker>Sasson &amp; Malpica, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0315\"/></link>). KBBE has been strongly promoted by think tanks and government institutions to guide current economic policies and education reforms worldwide, including STEM education policy (<link><marker>Calliera &amp; L'Astorina, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0075\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0285\"/>Symptomatic of the dominant narratives shaping STEM fields and STEM education today, KBBE rationales have promoted the institutional neoliberalization of science and research through government policies and the re-organization of public universities and education systems, so that public institutions become providers of human capital compliant with neoliberal ideologies, and/or function as research and development arms of global corporations, services, and 'green' industries. This in turn has contributed to new fantasies of techno-science symbolized by the 'scientist-entrepreneur', the high-tech start-up company (<link><marker>Pellizzoni &amp; Yl\u00f6nen, 2012, p. 9</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0285\"/></link>), and the Silicon State (<link><marker>Green, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0160\"/></link>).</p><p>Saliently, CSS critiques share many of the same concerns identified by educators critical of STEM reforms, including the ways neoliberal ideologies of 'progress, innovation, and global competitiveness' are interwoven within sustainable development ideologies, and how ecological crises are rhetorically positioned to be best addressed by techno-capitalist 'solutions', or through top-down forms of neoliberalized governance and external coordination (<link><marker>Alonso-Yanez et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0020\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0280\"/>Alternatively, a vast body of literature is emerging, across diverse intellectual traditions and geographical locations, on the role of education in activating an informed and more critical citizenry capable of participating in, and making decisions about, current global and local problems. Informed by CSS, much of this work focuses on the complex impacts of science, technology (<link><marker>Pedretti &amp; Nazir, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0280\"/></link>), as well as on the limitations of instrumentalist orientations of science, technology, and environmental education (<link><marker>Sterling, 2001</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0355\"/></link>). In Latin America in particular, clusters of educators, ecological-economists and environmental scientists have promoted efforts for education to foster in students the capacities to make considered, contextually-informed decisions and actively critique technology innovations (<link><marker>Massarini et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0240\"/></link>) - what Latin American scholars have called 'mercenary techno-science' (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.etcgroup.org/\">http://www.etcgroup.org/</url>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0395\"/>Mercenary techno-science is understood as scientific and technological knowledge production subjugated to the ends of capital accumulation and profit (<link><marker>Massarini et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0240\"/></link>; <link><marker>Toledo, Garrido, &amp; Barrera-Bassols, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0395\"/></link>) or to the needs of the State in maximizing the efficient operations of social systems where scientific innovations are always already commodities within circuits of exchange and, as such, disconnected from critical values, questions of social justice, or alternative game moves and novel practices (in educational and research institutions) that might establish the lineaments for alternative futures (<link><marker>Bussey, 1998</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0065\"/></link>; <link><marker>Gidley, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0150\"/></link>; <link><marker>Lyotard, 1984</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0235\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0325\"/>It is fair to say that there is much theoretical work that has provided a vocabulary for critical discussions and 'speculative imaginings' (<link><marker>Gidley, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0150\"/></link>; <link><marker>Slaughter, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0325\"/></link>) that might transform STEM teaching and learning today. Often, however, the theoretical value of this literature, as robust as it is, remains largely unrealized in revisioning educational discourse and pedagogical action.</p><p>We suggest that CSS, as a field of inquiry, sets out ontological and epistemological presuppositions that stand as counternarratives to the conventional teaching of science and technology, as well as to STEM reforms. For one, CSS, as a field of inquiry and practice, refuses to enroll people (students) in, or prepare them for, science narratives and practices that are, we argue, fundamentally unsustainable. Further, CSS makes a strong contribution to understanding the complexities of socio-ecological and socio-technological systems by grasping the inherently political nature of negotiating sustainable futures, rather than silencing or coopting these debates.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0095\"/>Challenging the commoditization of scientific knowledge, CSS inquiry also emphasizes the immediate/local use value of scientific inquiry and making in relation to the needs and concerns of local actors and communities - from matters of governance to simply doing science and technology practices differently, according to the situated and self-defined interests of actors. CSS demands consideration of who is most affected by economic models premised on unsustainable 'sustainability' models that accelerate resource exploitation and wealth accumulation. It also interrogates the salvation narratives advanced in corporate, governmental, and STEM policy sectors-from romantically 'solving' worldwide humanitarian and ecological crises to having the last word on debates surrounding 'progress', from geoengineering and genetic modification to artificial intelligence, transhumanism (<link><marker>Dahlin, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0095\"/></link>) and the very meaning(s) of sustainability itself.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0330\"/>CSS thus provides a conceptual framework with which to begin analyzing a wide array of socio-technical and scientific issues and to thereby disrupt 'business as usual' orientations to STEM education, in turn enabling us to become more prescient of the impacts of science and technology innovation before those impacts endanger social and biophysical worlds (<link><marker>Slaughter, 1996</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0330\"/></link>). The framework offers a means to evaluate the pedagogical approaches and educational practices most suited to, on one hand, developing critical forms of engagement and action necessary for human and ecological survival and, on the other, bringing science and technology practices out of the domains of technocentric expertise and into everyday negotiation and meaningful use by situated actors. These approaches and practices can work in the realm of the 'not-yet possible' and challenge current formal education logics in modern capitalist societies (<link><marker>Amsler &amp; Facer, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0025\"/></link>; <link><marker>Hicks, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0190\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0090\"/>CSS problematizes the dominant objectives of science research and innovation narratives in the global North, which are aimed at promoting STEM disciplines so as to enhance each nation's competitiveness in the global market. And here, CSS activates critical and more democratic orientations that can transform the 'doing' science: for example, by acknowledging scientists' and engineers' social responsibility to engage in continuous and widespread consultation with diverse publics including local and indigenous knowledge keepers (as capable co-inquirers and sovereign partners); by ensuring public transparency into uncertainties and unknowns and inviting critical debate; by using extended peer communities of stakeholders to assess the quality and value of the scientific knowledge that is produced, and who's ends this knowledge serves (<link><marker>Craye, Funtowicz, &amp; Van Der Sluijs, 2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0090\"/></link>; <link><marker>Funtowicz &amp; Ravetz, 1993</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0145\"/></link>; <link><marker>Slaughter, 1996</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0330\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0105\"/>Extrapolating these considerations to educational contexts, it is possible to envision how CSS frameworks might create spaces for students to interrogate discourses of techno-scientific innovation, while also enacting science practices and critical modes of inquiry shaped by different values and different epistemological orientations to knowledge and artefactual making, including immediate and self-defined use value (<link><marker>de Castell, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0105\"/></link>). For example, in examining current responses to climate change advanced by governments and industries, CSS invites students to interrogate those world-altering engineering technologies portrayed as bringing unquestioned benefits. Students have an opportunity to then reconsider these purported benefits in terms of their potential to amplify inequalities, displace populations, threaten local cultures, and harm or even eradicate physical environments (<link><marker>Klein, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0210\"/></link>).</p><p>Critical sustainability, as educational practice, thus invites modes of inquiry that are socially situated, participatory, and openly \"political, and not neutral\" (<link><marker>Springett, 2005 p. 147</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0340\"/></link>). This perspective destabilizes the ideal of narrow technical specialization as the central goal for STEM learning and, further, invites closer attention to landscapes of power where capital, race, gender, and access are factors in reproducing unequal conditions that affect both biophysical realms and social futures. It invites educators and learners to act as \"skeptical agents\" (<link><marker>Springett, 2005 p. 157</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0340\"/></link>) and to question the teleological narratives of progress and competition that underwrite STEM education, as well as the uneven and exploitive distribution of resources and labour in globalized networks and economies.</p><p>In the following sections, we explore production pedagogy as one means to resituate and transform science education today.

Production pedagogies thus offer an interdisciplinary and multimodal pedagogical orientation where learning actors are supported to engage real-world research challenges and design competences, using real-world tools, \"through the making of authentic cultural artefacts-with correspondingly authentic audiences enabled to witness such acts of knowledge production\" (<link><marker>Thumlert et al., 2015, p. 797</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0385\"/></link>).</p><p>Student work starts off with active engagement that connects situated exploration and research to authentic production work -a process of situated doing and making followed by an iterative course of critical reflection and theorization (<link><marker>de Castell, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0100\"/></link>) where students consider the impacts of, and take responsibility for, what they have made.

In science and technology contexts, this translates to a more public framework for doing science, one that models and enacts much needed participation in the public governance of science and technology in democratic societies today.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0085\"/>Informing this view, feminist theories of science (<link><marker>Clarke &amp; Olesen, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0085\"/></link>; <link><marker>Haraway, 1988</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0180\"/></link>) suggest that the objects of inquiry, and the knowledge and things beings made through learner-directed research and making, do not need to be romantically or heroically conceived as 'solutions' to 'crises'; rather, they simply begin as interventions that matter to their makers. Here, the 'exchange value' of abstract scientific knowledge (as commodity) is replaced by local 'use value' and reconnected with local users and communities in ways that resonate with the more 'grounded' and ethical orientations to scientific practice as articulated in Critical Sustainability Studies. This pedagogical point of departure speaks to <link><marker>Slaughter (2004)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0325\"/></link> vision for \"a path to sustainability\" where 'intrinsic value' and 'meaning and purpose' are valorized over exchange value (p. 678), and where the \"hegemony of instrumental rationality\" (p. 677) is undone through learning and doing different<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ly</emphasis>.</p><p>Production pedagogies can transform science and technology learning, instating a focus on students' worlds - where knowing, designing, and making are embedded in the social contexts and communities where inquiry and making itself occurs (<link><marker>de Castell, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0100\"/></link>; <link><marker>de Castell, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0105\"/></link>). Central to production pedagogy is an engagement with external actors, models and communities of practice: sociotechnical sites and resources that shift learning into unfinished worlds and always unfinalizable futures.</p><p>In line with CSS, production pedagogies invite students to critically reflect on the personal purposes and theoretical premises that inform what they research and make, to take responsibility for what they make, and to understand that there are always human interests driving - or intervening in - states of affairs that matter. Using real-world technology tools and methods instead of curricularized surrogates, students engage in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">different</emphasis> processes of innovation that connect local and extra-local situations, and respond to the interests and values of the communities the students themselves belong to, are involved in, or imagine as possible. An object lesson of this approach is that students are invited to engage in tasks that they can, and want to, actually achieve: this is a significant aspect of the work since it (re)engages learners, and brings students in \"contact with what they themselves can accomplish\" (<link><marker>de Castell, 2010, p. 14</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0100\"/></link>), inviting a different kind of assessment-a process of self-critical appraisal of the products that they create, and of their wider impacts or ecological effects they may have in their world, whose ends are served, and who is involved in (or excluded from) public debates and governance matters.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0250\"/>For production pedagogy researchers, sociomaterial interventions in the world that are less 'school-bound' are operationalized: learners co-define questions and propose trajectories of inquiry for themselves through technology and materials-centric exploration (<link><marker>McBride, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>), and in terms of what is, or what emerges for them as, significant to their interests, passions, or public concerns: questions about what kind of world we will inhabit, how to make sense of things, and what we might do. Simply put, learners are invited to become the scientists of their own interdisciplinary endeavors: building theories, testing them and reflecting on results and relationships, and creating new knowledge not anticipated in advance.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0265\"/>Production pedagogies are thus grounded in social contexts and material localities, but are shaped, as well, by global concerns and relationships, and are thus always in principle 'connected' or 'connectable' to possible sites of intervention and action outside of schools. This orientation to education, informed by CSS, offers an alternative to discipline-narrowed STEM pedagogies (<link><marker>Krug &amp; Shaw, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0215\"/></link>) that often confine students solving contrived 'school-based' problems: matters abstracted from contexts and mediated by standardized assessments, by representations and texts (rather than materials and communities), and/or through the staging of science as a spectacle of 'expert wizardry' (<link><marker>McBride, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>; <link><marker>Nolan, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0265\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0115\"/>STEM pedagogies today, in efforts to developmentally prepare students for knowledge-economies and STEM fields, we argue, not only actively discourage students from seeing themselves as participants in science practices and creators of their own knowledge, but also commoditize the competences to be learned in accordance with the future 'exchange value' of those competences as 'workplace skills' (<link><marker>Weinstein et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0410\"/></link>). Here, as an alienated means to a predetermined and always distant end, 'preparation' itself is assumed to be the 'motivation' for learning (<link><marker>de Castell, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0105\"/></link>) and, through incremental development toward some professionalized 'specialization', students are endlessly equipped with skills and knowledge about states of affairs over which they themselves have neither critical agency nor embodied competence (<link><marker>de Castell, Jenson, &amp; Thumlert, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0115\"/></link>). Here, learners are not only alienated from the use-vale and immanent pleasures of their own learning, making and design, they also are insulated from critical reflection as they are procedurally inducted into dominant STEM narratives, epistemologies, and values.</p><p>By contrast, the 'outcomes' of production pedagogies are, we suggest, not just the potentially richer acquisition of competences, but, as importantly, affective investment in the processes and products of what is being made and done (<link><marker>de Castell, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0105\"/></link>). When learners take up embodied roles as researchers, designers, and makers, engaging problems and stakes criticall<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">y</emphasis> - stakes students have agency in identifying, interpreting, and co-defining - students directly engage discourses, technology tools, methods and actions in ways that enable them to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">do</emphasis> science differently: to perform practices and develop their own narratives of science and scientific 'doing' that disrupt instrumentalized schooling enterprises: the sequenced and segmented classroom 'activities' that too often characterize STEM education's developmental aims.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0345\"/>Asserting the possibility of fresh narratives and more critical science practices, <link><marker>Stengers (2005)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0345\"/></link> argues that \"another science is possible\", where actors reject the imperatives of the 'fast' knowledge economy and are, democratically, \"engaged in the creation of [a] future, a future which would be worth living\" (p. 12). And here, by refusing to developmentally prepare students for STEM futures and induct them into predetermined 'anticipation regimes' (<link><marker>Adams et al., 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0010\"/></link>), we see production pedagogies as an intentionally disruptive vehicle - not for anticipating the future - but for enabling learners to \"remake the present\" (<link><marker>Adams et al., 2009, p. 260</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0010\"/></link>; <link><marker>Slaughter, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0325\"/></link>).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. Remaking the present: production-pedagogies in action</emphasis></h><p>In this section, we show what production pedagogy in science education looks like, and how it challenges dominant STEM narratives. This example of production pedagogy is from a recent Design Thinking course in the Faculty of Education at the University of Calgary, Canada, where the values of CSS inform inquiry and making. The course was designed as an entry point for students to understand, engage with, and participate in public knowledge-making interventions, with three core components: The activities in the course (a) involved the use of technology, (b) connected (interdisciplinarily) with science, mathematics, and engineering (c) utilized the networked resources of online communities, which supported access to information and models, as well as provided membership in public spaces of informal inquiry and learning. In this course, pre-service teachers engaged in teaching and learning activities directed to the production of socially valued artefacts to be shared with various audiences (the community of learners within the course as well as online and/or local learning communities). Students were invited to participate in one task that helped them develop networks and competences relevant to their personal and professional interests, aspirations, and goals as educators of science, technology, and mathematics.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0060\"/>The project began by inviting pre-service teachers to produce something that was meaningful to them, that addressed a need or passion, and that entailed engaging with, and being apprenticed by, broader communities of practice involved in creating similar cultural/technology products. For developing their projects, the students were asked to research and engage an online community that might support their design work or reciprocally learn from the student as part of a community of practice. We (First Author) only required students to record field notes and capture critical reflections as strategies for focusing on the process of reflection about the learning processes and community interactions that occured in the project (<link><marker>Brett, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0060\"/></link>).</p><p>In the second phase of the project, students learned about and from the online community, and how they might contribute to the community knowledge-sharing dynamic (e.g, students would contribute a free-to-use asset that the community might build upon, use, or repurpose). Finally, in relation to purposeful making, students created a prototype or artefact that expressed their own interests in relation to science and technology and contributed knowledge to the community.</p><p>One student chose to work on a prototype for a tilt-shift lens camera that connected with his passion for photography and architecture. He described his project as follows:<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The tilt-shift lens was a common photography product that was typically used in architectural photography as a way to ensure vertical and horizontal lines were true. With the emergence of digital photography editing programs, vertical and horizontal lines can be corrected after the photograph has been taken. As such, usage of the tilt-shift lens has been limited to more creative applications. Some of these more creative applications that photographers now use the lens for is to produce unique focus in portraits and miniature landscape scenes. However, the \"Lensbaby\" variations of today are extremely expensive, starting at a price of about $1500 CAD</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Searching online, not surprisingly, I found a community of enthusiast photographers that have experimented and documented the process for creating your own tilt-shift lens for much less money. Empathizing the issue of making a tilt-shift lens for limited money, I began to design my version of the tilt-shift lens.</emphasis> (Student project log sample)</p><p>This student engaged with the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Stack Exchange: Photography Community</emphasis> and connected with online mentors and models to create a tilt-shift lens of his own. He used his old camera and a rubber tire from a toy monster truck as a movable connector piece. He documented the progress of his ongoing work via the project log and described the many failures he overcame to build and adjust the materials he was using to build the lens.</p><p>For example, he wrote about the off-road tire being too bendy; he described attaching duct tape and toilet plunger to the rubber tire to make it strong enough to hold the lens and still be malleable enough to be modified. Finally, he contributed to the Stack Exchange \"Hot Questions\" website section with a series of images he took, entitled \"Miniature world: A unique perspective of buildings,\" along with a set of instructions to create a tilt-shift lens for under $30.</p><p>Initially, the student expressed that the production task seemed disconnected from its application for science teaching. However, through ongoing reflections, the teacher-candidate modeled for himself, and recognized, the valuable learning processes, purposes, pleasures, and outcomes of the production pedagogy model, as well as its implicit collaborative social linkages with others, and with dynamic spaces and applications in the world.</p><p>For example, in his reflections, the student identified himself as a member of the lens-making community and recognized the level of expertise that group members had and shared in the online community. Furthermore, he articulated that the activity allowed him to have a genuine voice in what the next steps comprised as there were no specific steps to follow in order to build the lens, but merely guidelines in what a tilt-shift lens should be able to achieve. This allowed the student to choose the materials he needed and to engage or repurpose them through a materials-centric (<link><marker>McBride, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>) work process - and with substantially more agency, as these production processes were driven by self-and-community-defined interests, needs, and use-value (<link><marker>de Castell, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0105\"/></link>).</p><p>Once completed, the student closely analyzed the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Science Program of Studies</emphasis> curriculum resource-and through that he made clear connections between his project and the more official STEM objectives he had enacted through the production pedagogy (such as engineering, the science of light and optical devices, and situated 'design thinking'). The student describes how his own understanding of science and technology changed, using his experience making the tilt-shift lens and taking photographs:<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By making a lens I learned a lot about technology. I have never seen the inside of a lens before, even though I use the camera on my phone all the time. After I took the lens apart, I discovered that there was a lot more going on than I first thought. I was most challenged when I had to blueprint my new lens design because I was confused about how the angles would work. It was obvious that when I changed the angle of the lens, I could make some interesting effects. For example, when I bent the lens down, it would create a miniature effect on the scene I was photographing. Another technique I used a lot was bending the lens so it would only focus on certain things and makes other things blurry. What this tells me about technology is that it is actually rooted in basic principles of science. For example, my Image # One (McMahon Stadium): In this image I held the camera above the line of sight, and tilted the lens down towards McMahon Stadium. This was done to give the stadium a model-like effect. In my Image # Three (The #9 Bus), I tilted and compressed the lens to convey a sense of motion. Because we were also pointing the lens downward, objects acquired a \"miniature\" quality. All of these examples are examples of principles that are essential to an understanding of the science of light and how optical technologies work and how we can use them to predict the effects of changes in designs, alignments and compositions of images. Once I figured that out, I could do some interesting things with science of light and photographs and I could understand how the angles worked</emphasis>. (Student project log sample)</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0400\"/>This project, \"Capturing reflections: Meaning-making through a digital lens-making experience,\" allowed the student to, through production pedagogy, challenge the \"school as usual\" (<link><marker>Smythe et al., 2016 p. 13</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0335\"/></link>) framework, where science teaching and learning is dominantly mediated by prescribed outcomes, uniform instructional processes, and similarly uniform assessments. Furthermore, this production pedagogy additionally supported transparency into the material processes of making and innovation and, as well, connected inquiry and making to place (<link><marker>Verrax, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0400\"/></link>) and community-both virtual and concrete-and enabled the student to learn and develop and expand the stories of the places of the communities he visited during walkabout trips with his camera. This mode of engagement nurtured a very different kind of understanding of the ways in which science and technology might connect us, and of how we can create and communicate stories and revision the very purposes and impacts of science and technology learning.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6. Conclusion</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0195\"/>In this article, we have signalled new theoretical grounds and critical models for what science education might look like when we eschew grand narratives of expert science and corporate techno-solutionism. Production pedagogy redraws and contextualizes science and technology education in three significant ways: (i) by giving learners flexibility and agency to participate in processes of inquiry, meaning-making and design work through action and interaction within material and social worlds (ii) by engaging in a process of learning where students' own interests, passions and personal purposes have a legitimate place, and are fruitful and rich sites of actionable knowledge and 'youth-led engagement' (<link><marker>Ho, Clarke, &amp; Dougherty, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0195\"/></link>), and (iii) by inviting (in this case) future teachers to continually pose the question: how might we activate <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">this</emphasis> kind of pedagogy in education today? This latter question is fundamental in challenging that instrumentalist values and routinized pedagogies underpinning the schooling of STEM.</p><p>As an account of production pedagogy, this kind of work generates novel relations to science and technology, providing contexts and contingencies for embodying science practices outside of standardized STEM curriculum, and for engaging with the communities that are affected by science practices, and for communicating different stories - alternative narratives - about science practices. One result is that specialist orientations to doing science driven by STEM 'crisis and salvation' narratives are replaced by more immediate and multimodal investigations that emerge and evolve in relation to interests, purposes, materials, and collective forms of 'community intelligence' and community needs.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0070\"/>And while the making of a tilt-shift lens itself may not heroically 'solve' any global environmental crises, the model of action, interaction, and making refuses the commoditization of knowledge and skills and demystifies science as an expert practice or professionalized role within neoliberal economies of innovation and performativity. This is a very different orientation to science and technology learning, one that focuses less upon abstract conceptual principles, propositional knowledge, or textual representations about what things 'are', and instead provides insight into new relations about what things 'do', and what can be done with them, \"liberating the practical imagination\" in the present (<link><marker>Bussey, 2014, p. 11</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0070\"/></link>) and offering more tangibly transparent and embodied ways of learning and making (<link><marker>McBride, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>).</p><p>Above all, we argue that it is problematic to invoke STEM education - or any education - as a vehicle for 'preparation', particularly when students are being prepared for, and inducted into, dominant narratives and practices that sustain unsustainable futures. By contrast, we reconceive science and technology production pedagogies as a means of enabling students to engage, in the present, with present 'matters of concern' (<link><marker>Latour, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0225\"/></link>), invested in both the processes and social stakes of science and technology practices and futures. We contend that current STEM narratives and educational practices shaped by neoliberal logics and technocapitalist fantasies foreclose in advance opportunities for envisioning and enacting alternative futures. One way to challenge the dominant narratives of STEM reform is to attend to the socio-political domains of science and technology through locally situated and meaningful production pedagogies, with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">present</emphasis> attention \"to the possibilities which exist within a multiplicity of futures\" (<link><marker>Bateman, 2012, p. 21</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0045\"/></link>) In educational contexts, we suggest that science-based production pedagogies, informed by the ethos of Critical Sustainability Studies, can empower students to take agentive roles in relation to inquiry, knowledge and artefactual making, where actors <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">do</emphasis> science differently in their own communities, and in always unfinished worlds.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: \u204e Corresponding author.</p></bodyText></contact><graphic/><bibliography><bodyText><p><anchor id=\"reference0005\"/><link><marker>Access to Media Education Society, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref0005\"/></link> Access to Media Education Society (2018).

Patrick Armstrong from Plurimi Wealth -- from Plurimi Wealth is the CIO there, joins us out of London.  Mark, let's start with you.  2.4, why is it so important and will it hold?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUDMORE</emphasis>:  I don't think it is that important, I think it's become a short-term technical level, it's been hyped up by Gundlach, and, you know, while he's had a very successful bond career, has called, you know, many of the last zero kind of bond rates.  So I think the fact is that this is not suddenly a big level, I think it's been hyped up in the market, we might see a little bit of follow through, but I don't think the game has necessarily changed yet.  It might change with the new Fed chair, but even that I'm very suspicious of.    </p><p>      I think the people are getting excited by Taylor as a candidate, but they're getting excited by Taylor as a candidate because he made a plea recently that he might be more dovish, and many people are starting to interpret that in fact, the Taylor rule may not be that hawkish if you adapt inappropriately the -- the correct inputs for today's environment.  So overall, I think we're likely to get a more dovish chair, though I admit that if we do get Taylor, we will get a -- a decent spike in yield that can last for several weeks.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes, I do think -- sorry, Mark -- sorry, Matt.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Well, I just -- I mean, that's something I think, you mentioned there's a Bloomberg story on it, Guy and I -- I read the story and I thought it was great, but on the other hand, there are a lot of very smart strategists on Wall Street who do think that appointing Taylor would mean of rise in 10-year yields.  So I wonder, Patrick, if you agree?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  We're short treasuries, we think 10-year yields are moving higher, there will be a slow grind higher over the next 12 months.  It's not a call on Taylor being the next Fed chair.  He does seem that he'll be moderately more hawkish than Powell which I would characterize maybe as more of a status quo with Yellen.  But we just think interest rates are too low, we think the Fed's biased to hike, we think the bar for the Fed to hike, markets underestimating, they say they're going to hike once this year, maybe three times next year. The market's pricing in not even a hundred percent chance fort this year, and only once next year.  So we think market's too complacent on the outlook for rates regardless who comes in.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Obviously, this complacency is something that we've noted as well, Mark.  When do you think we're going to snap out of that?  I mean, could tax reform actually move us in that direction?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUDMORE</emphasis>:  I think tax reform will be a big really big thing, and I think, you know, Patrick's argument is very logical, that there is certainly a real desire to hike coming out of the Fed and the market is suspicious there and they might regret being suspicious there.  And certainly, I could buy into the narrative of a slow grind higher in yields.  I do also think, I should clarify that I accept that Taylor will be more hawkish than the Yellen or Powell status quo, I'm just saying that he's not going to suddenly be completely shift yields way higher.  It's not going to be as hawkish as the Taylor will might have want to suggest we don't modify it.  So I think the fact is, if we do yet tax reform, that is a great thing for the growth story.    </p><p>      I personally remain quite cynical that we'll get a -- a tax reform that is really so revolutionary to shift growth that massively. I think given the depth that's in the U.S., they're slightly constrained.  I'm sure some kind of package will be delivered, but it will be one of those packages where we get an excited headline, but then suddenly, the details (inaudible) going to go, you know what, how much does this really change things?  So I think we -- we could get a grind higher in yields, I just don't think we got any major change in tone and yields just because the 30-year bull market and bonds (inaudible) which I fully believe, I'm sure, ended a year ago.  The fact is, that doesn't mean we have to start into a long-term bear market, I think we're stuck in a range for a long time to come.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Patrick, what about the shape of the curve, what do these guys mean for the shape of the curve?  Rates coming up at the frontend, flattening that curve out, effect further down the -- further -- further down the curve in terms of the inflation outlook, kind of, is that where we should be looking?  We shouldn't be worrying too much about the levels, it's kind of, just actually, the -- the relationship and the forward-predictive power of that curve.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  That's very important.  I think if the Fed's doing their job properly, you'll will get a parallel shift, so they'll be hiking as the economic outlook is improving, so basically --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  That's not what we're seeing at the moment.  At the moment, the curve's flattening.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  It's very flat, and yes, and it's not even pricing in the Fed doing what they say they'll do which would make it even more flat.  But I think the economic numbers are going to continue the pace we've had for the last six months where you are getting jobs created. The missing ingredient is inflation, there's no inflation there, but if you're looking at wage growth, there are some signs that's there. If you look at companies issues right now, or that they can't fill job vacancies, finding quality people to fill employment on the NFIB survey, those are the small businesses that are saying, we're defining issues.  I think that points to the beginnings of some inflation.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Mark, talk to me about the relationship between two-year yields, rising two-year yields and the FX trade because you've written something interesting about this overnight.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUDMORE</emphasis>:  You know, I mean, I think there can be a bit of divergence going -- going forward in terms of yields and dollar.  I don't think that dollar has to track yields all the way up.  Like we saw on kind of November last year whether there's a slightly different narrative.  I think right now, there are a lot of other headwinds for the dollar, so I think we can get a bit more divergence.  The dollar trade might be nearly done to the topside, whereas, the yields can continue to go further, and I think one of those issues is, I actually do believe that we probably will still get a -- a flattening curve.   </p><p>      I would ask Patrick, I'm interested to know that, you know, given that there's no inflation, if we've got a good growth story, an OK growth story but there's no sign of inflation and we start to buy into the narrative of, you know, what, there are structural disinflationary pressures, why should the curves steepen much?  Because this is not a -- a story that they won't be, you know, need an extra risk premium. We know there's too much money out there, there's no sign of inflations, there's no reason to like, hike rates much more aggressively two years down the line.  I'm just not sure the curve should steepen much.  Even if they hike another couple of times at the front of the curve, and even if they do that with growth remaining strong.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  The way you posed your question, I would agree that wouldn't lead to a steepening of the curve by any means, but I actually do think we're starting to see the early signs that there will be inflationary pressures.  You don't get unemployment down below 4 percent, you don't have economic growth where we are with interest rates definitely still very accommodative, I would even characterized them still at emergency levels.  I think we've got a very accommodative Fed, it's beginning to take away some of the juice, but I may be old school maybe like a lot of the Fed governors right now that (inaudible).    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Patrick's (inaudible) believes in the Phillips curve.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  The Phillips curve isn't dead, Phillips curve is still there.  Intuitively, it should be there when you have lots of jobs and wage growth, that's going to create demand for goods and that's going to inflate the higher prices.  So think we can't see inflation now, but I think the early signs that inflation may be around the corner are there, and I think the Fed will be hiking next year based on inflation that will be there which will mean the curve shouldn't flatten.  I don't know if they will steepen, I think it'll be more of a parallel shift up because the Fed will be doing its job hiking appropriately because you got a stronger economy and the beginnings of some inflation.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  All right, we'll -- we will say thank you and goodbye to millennial Mark Cudmore, Bloomberg MLive strategist and continue to kick it old school with Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Still with us is Patrick Armstrong, CIO at Plurimi Wealth.  Just if -- if anyone's curious, I've dug in to the story and found that there is an unwritten rule of retirement at age 68, so you can't become the president after the age 68, at least that's kind of -- that's sort of the unwritten rule there.  Patrick, let me ask you what you think about Xi's tenure here and him -- setting himself up. I mean, he has to some extent, changed the face of Chinese socialism to a more capitalist or a more western-facing socialism.  Is he made -- has he made China more investable for you?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  We've not changed any of our views on a cyclical basis on anything that's happened in the last few days, I think they're still -- he's putting in macro prudential policy, slowing the housing market.  I think what he's positioned himself to do is create a very long-term story which I suppose, we have difficulty in the west, and he'll probably sounding off about the benefits of having a long-term vision and having stability versus the -- the chaos we maybe have with democracy in the west, and equalizing the -- the wealth between the richest urban dwellers and the poorest people in rural areas is a very big important macro tailwind for the Chinese consumer, the Chinese economy, and not only does he not have successors in place, I think this entrenches him in power.  If you get rid of that, that's the thing that creates the disharmony that leads to turmoil in countries, and if he does address that, you need to think very long term, and I think he's put himself in position to do that very well.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Has he stabilized the countries around him?  I mean, is the rest of EM more investable with Xi in place?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  I've not even thought of that question, it's a good question.  Anytime you've got some stability there, it's good for China.  China is still the manufacturer for the world, it's becoming less so, focusing much more on its consumer.  I don't think it's going to become the consumer for the world the way the U.S. is anytime in the next decade, but eventually, China will become a big purchasing country as well and that'll help flow on in terms of emerging markets, not just importing raw materials, but also goods, I suppose.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Are you invested in China?  Are you invested in China derivative trade?  Do you do it through the metals, do you do it through other areas?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  We've got no positions on in China right now, so at the beginning of the year, we were short renminbi, we closed that in about March, and since then, we've not put investments on -- on equities, you've had this incredible performance from some of the big tech companies there, but the governance is still an issue for us.  I don't think we see any signs that we are moving towards an open market by any means.  I think he's probably backtracked a little bit about that.  I'm even talking about a new era where they're outing in a model that's new custom to China, not just mimicking what the west has already built.  So as a minority shareholder, that still creates questions for me.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  OK.  I just want to show you, Patrick, this chart here, I showed it to him in the break, it certainly raised a few eyebrows. This is the State Bank of India this morning, the stock is up massively as you can see.  This as we've seen the Indian banks being recapped.  They needed it -- they needed to deal with their nonperforming loans, they needed to just get money back into the economy.  India, take a step back at (inaudible) emerging markets, there are some big ones out there, India is one of them, China is another one.  Kind of, where do you -- do you have to invest in the bigger ones?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  If you're going to invest in emerging markets, I think the bigger ones are the -- the easiest place to look at.  We 've got emerging market inflation-linked bonds, so as you can tell from the previous segment, I'm worried about inflation a little bit and I think the epicenter when inflation (inaudible) start, will be emerging market, so that's one place where you -- you do see basically, supply and demand, demand couldn't possibly be going faster than supply coming in to them so, the emerging market inflation bonds, you're getting a real yield of about 3 percent right now which is an equity like risk premium to take some bond-like risk characteristics.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Probably a slightly different story, but Argentina just hikes interest rates overnight by a hundred and fifty basis points. Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth is going to be sticking around.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth still with us.  Patrick, you're long Eurozone banks, industrials, talk to me about the banks first of all.  The regulatory environment in Europe is getting tougher, not easier, possibly unlike the United States.  They still trade on pretty big book discounts to their -- to their U.S. peers, and -- and theoretically, the European economy looks like it's doing pretty well right now.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  That's exactly our play, we've tried to get into the more cyclical sectors and we think banks and industrials are the two plays that you think we've got a robust recovery in Europe.  We think we do, we think the ECB is obviously going to announce a tapering at some point maybe this week or December at latest, and we should see some interest rate margin for the banks as well, so you know, you'd have a double win there where you've got a strong economy and potential for some sort of a yield curve.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  (inaudible) going out.  The problem with banks in Europe is that you scratch the surface and there are problems.  You kind of -- and -- and there are not many banks that -- that this doesn't apply to, that you kind of scratch the surface and there's -- there's other management problem, a -- a environment problem.  There's always a nonperforming-loan problem.  Most banks when you actually come down to at a granular level, have problems.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  Most of them do, and we're not in the cheapest banks for that reason, we're in the French banks which are trading 10 times earnings.  They don't have a significant amount of bad debts, trading at book value, 4 percent dividend yield, very well capitalized especially versus peers, so we're attracted to cheap assets that's not the cheapest, because I think they've got less issues than you just referred to anyway, on the SocGen, the BNPs.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Do you see -- I mean, there's a great story on the terminal, Patrick, about an ex-Barclays analyst leaving to start his own research firm and of course, not doing that in Europe, MiFID has driven him out.  You've got Brexit driving bankers out of the U.K., is there kind of a shakedown here where they're going to be a few winners and a lot of losers?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  Well, European banking system probably needs some consolidation.  I think that might be a trend that we start to see, but what you're talking about is a theme of basically, David and Goliath.  Basically, you've got some big slow-moving banks and that creates opportunities for small, nimble competitors.  So I think that's good for the industry.  Anytime you do have smaller competitors challenging some the big goliaths, it creates some innovation and efficiencies in order for them to maintain their profit margin, so it is a trend that's likely to be seen because we're very top-heavy on the banks, and they do have a lot of structural issues.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  What do you think about national heroes?  I mean, Deutsche Bank is one that maybe bit off a little bit more than it could chew, it's being punished -- been punished for that now, but it's unlikely that Germany would let its most important bank fall, so can you buy a dip in a company like that?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  Well, I think what you've just said, we agree with a hundred percent, but we don't have any of the equity.  We do buy Deutsche Bank bonds, we have some of their subordinated debt.  When there's worries about Deutsche Bank, we add to that position because the scenario you just outlined means it's valuable, it's going to be able to pay its debt, but it doesn't attract you as a shareholder necessarily.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Where do the bulk of your investors come from because currency seems to be really important in this process about where you invest in the world.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  Our investors and our funds?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  So we've got high net worth around Europe, so predominantly, European (inaudible) Swiss-based, U.K.-based.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  U.K. -- Swiss-based, U.K.-based.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  Those are the two countries where most --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  OK.  Because this -- because this is interesting, if -- if I may, euro investor into sterling, into the FTSE, I've made nothing, nothing this year which is fascinating.  If I've invested (inaudible) going to the States, I've only made 2.61 percent versus the S&amp;P 500 which has done nearly 15 percent.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  Very much, yes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Do you do this on a non-hedge basis?  Do you do this --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  So we've got base currency of our fund which is euro unfortunately because everything as you're just pointing out, when price in euro isn't doing that well, but we offer fully-hedge share classes, so if you buy our fund in euros, that's the base currency, you can buy Swiss francs, sterling, and bully head share class.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  But does it -- you -- when you go into the States, do you do it on a hedge basis?  When you go into the Japan, do you do it on an un-hedge basis?  Kind of, how do you --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  (inaudible) investing yet.  So if we're buying a telecom company, I'll hedge that into euros quite often because that -- that's currency (inaudible).  If I'm buying a multinational company, probably won't hedge that because you're getting foreign revenues coming in that way, so --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  So it's whether (inaudible) a domestic -- if it's got a domestic focus, you will -- you will hedge that, (inaudible) you got the currency risk, but if -- if the company already effectively is doing it for you, then it doesn't really matter.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARMSTRONG</emphasis>:  It's (inaudible) but exactly, you're getting the benefit if you've got a weak dollar, if things are priced in dollar, it's got foreign revenues coming in, so you get a bit of a natural hedge that way on multinationals.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Interesting stuff.  You can see this really clearly, guys.  Go to the WEI screen, and you'll see the options, you can change the currency on the right-hand side of the screen.  Patrick Armstrong, thank you very much indeed, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth Management, he's going to be joining our radio team live on London DAB Digital.     </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Patrick Armstrong from Plurimi  Wealth -- from Plurimi Wealth is the CIO there, joins us out of London.   Mark, let's start with you.  2.4, why is it so important and will it hold?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> MARK CUDMORE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  I don't think it is that important, I  think it's become a short-term technical level, it's been hyped up by  Gundlach, and, you know, while he's had a very successful bond career, has  called, you know, many of the last zero kind of bond rates.  So I think the  fact is that this is not suddenly a big level, I think it's been hyped up  in the market, we might see a little bit of follow through, but I don't  think the game has necessarily changed yet.  It might change with the new  Fed chair, but even that I'm very suspicious of.</p><p> I think the people are getting excited by Taylor as a candidate, but  they're getting excited by Taylor as a candidate because he made a plea  recently that he might be more dovish, and many people are starting to  interpret that in fact, the Taylor rule may not be that hawkish if you  adapt inappropriately the -- the correct inputs for today's environment.   So overall, I think we're likely to get a more dovish chair, though I admit  that if we do get Taylor, we will get a -- a decent spike in yield that can  last for several weeks.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes, I do think -- sorry, Mark -- sorry, Matt.</p><p> MATT MILLER, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Well, I just -- I mean, that's something I  think, you mentioned there's a Bloomberg story on it, Guy and I -- I read  the story and I thought it was great, but on the other hand, there are a  lot of very smart strategists on Wall Street who do think that appointing  Taylor would mean of rise in 10-year yields.  So I wonder, Patrick, if you  agree?</p><p> PATRICK ARMSTRONG, CIO, PLURIMI WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  We're short treasuries,  we think 10-year yields are moving higher, there will be a slow grind  higher over the next 12 months.  It's not a call on Taylor being the next  Fed chair.  He does seem that he'll be moderately more hawkish than Powell  which I would characterize maybe as more of a status quo with Yellen.  But  we just think interest rates are too low, we think the Fed's biased to  hike, we think the bar for the Fed to hike, markets underestimating, they  say they're going to hike once this year, maybe three times next year.  The  market's pricing in not even a hundred percent chance fort this year, and  only once next year.  So we think market's too complacent on the outlook  for rates regardless who comes in.</p><p> MILLER:  Obviously, this complacency is something that we've noted as well,  Mark.  When do you think we're going to snap out of that?  I mean, could  tax reform actually move us in that direction?</p><p> CUDMORE:  I think tax reform will be a big really big thing, and I think,  you know, Patrick's argument is very logical, that there is certainly a  real desire to hike coming out of the Fed and the market is suspicious  there and they might regret being suspicious there.  And certainly, I could  buy into the narrative of a slow grind higher in yields.  I do also think,  I should clarify that I accept that Taylor will be more hawkish than the  Yellen or Powell status quo, I'm just saying that he's not going to  suddenly be completely shift yields way higher.  It's not going to be as  hawkish as the Taylor will might have want to suggest we don't modify it.   So I think the fact is, if we do yet tax reform, that is a great thing for  the growth story.</p><p> I personally remain quite cynical that we'll get a -- a tax reform that is  really so revolutionary to shift growth that massively.  I think given the  depth that's in the U.S., they're slightly constrained.  I'm sure some kind  of package will be delivered, but it will be one of those packages where we  get an excited headline, but then suddenly, the details (inaudible) going  to go, you know what, how much does this really change things?  So I think  we -- we could get a grind higher in yields, I just don't think we got any  major change in tone and yields just because the 30-year bull market and  bonds (inaudible) which I fully believe, I'm sure, ended a year ago.  The  fact is, that doesn't mean we have to start into a long-term bear market, I  think we're stuck in a range for a long time to come.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Patrick, what about the shape of the curve, what do these guys  mean for the shape of the curve?  Rates coming up at the frontend,  flattening that curve out, effect further down the -- further -- further  down the curve in terms of the inflation outlook, kind of, is that where we  should be looking?  We shouldn't be worrying too much about the levels,  it's kind of, just actually, the -- the relationship and the forward- predictive power of that curve.</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  That's very important.  I think if the Fed's doing their job  properly, you'll will get a parallel shift, so they'll be hiking as the  economic outlook is improving, so basically --</p><p> JOHNSON:  That's not what we're seeing at the moment.  At the moment, the  curve's flattening.</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  It's very flat, and yes, and it's not even pricing in the Fed  doing what they say they'll do which would make it even more flat.  But I  think the economic numbers are going to continue the pace we've had for the  last six months where you are getting jobs created.  The missing ingredient  is inflation, there's no inflation there, but if you're looking at wage  growth, there are some signs that's there.  If you look at companies issues  right now, or that they can't fill job vacancies, finding quality people to  fill employment on the NFIB survey, those are the small businesses that are  saying, we're defining issues.  I think that points to the beginnings of  some inflation.</p><p> MILLER:  Mark, talk to me about the relationship between two-year yields,  rising two-year yields and the FX trade because you've written something  interesting about this overnight.</p><p> CUDMORE:  You know, I mean, I think there can be a bit of divergence going  -- going forward in terms of yields and dollar.  I don't think that dollar  has to track yields all the way up.  Like we saw on kind of November last  year whether there's a slightly different narrative.  I think right now,  there are a lot of other headwinds for the dollar, so I think we can get a  bit more divergence.  The dollar trade might be nearly done to the topside,  whereas, the yields can continue to go further, and I think one of those  issues is, I actually do believe that we probably will still get a -- a  flattening curve.</p><p> I would ask Patrick, I'm interested to know that, you know, given that  there's no inflation, if we've got a good growth story, an OK growth story  but there's no sign of inflation and we start to buy into the narrative of,  you know, what, there are structural disinflationary pressures, why should  the curves steepen much?  Because this is not a -- a story that they won't  be, you know, need an extra risk premium.  We know there's too much money  out there, there's no sign of inflations, there's no reason to like, hike  rates much more aggressively two years down the line.  I'm just not sure  the curve should steepen much.  Even if they hike another couple of times  at the front of the curve, and even if they do that with growth remaining  strong.</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  The way you posed your question, I would agree that wouldn't  lead to a steepening of the curve by any means, but I actually do think  we're starting to see the early signs that there will be inflationary  pressures.  You don't get unemployment down below 4 percent, you don't have  economic growth where we are with interest rates definitely still very  accommodative, I would even characterized them still at emergency levels.   I think we've got a very accommodative Fed, it's beginning to take away  some of the juice, but I may be old school maybe like a lot of the Fed  governors right now that (inaudible).</p><p> JOHNSON:  Patrick's (inaudible) believes in the Phillips curve.</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  The Phillips curve isn't dead, Phillips curve is still there.   Intuitively, it should be there when you have lots of jobs and wage growth,  that's going to create demand for goods and that's going to inflate the  higher prices.  So think we can't see inflation now, but I think the early  signs that inflation may be around the corner are there, and I think the  Fed will be hiking next year based on inflation that will be there which  will mean the curve shouldn't flatten.  I don't know if they will steepen,  I think it'll be more of a parallel shift up because the Fed will be doing  its job hiking appropriately because you got a stronger economy and the  beginnings of some inflation.</p><p> MILLER:  All right, we'll -- we will say thank you and goodbye to  millennial Mark Cudmore, Bloomberg MLive strategist and continue to kick it  old school with Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> MILLER:  Still with us is Patrick Armstrong, CIO at Plurimi Wealth.  Just  if -- if anyone's curious, I've dug in to the story and found that there is  an unwritten rule of retirement at age 68, so you can't become the  president after the age 68, at least that's kind of -- that's sort of the  unwritten rule there.  Patrick, let me ask you what you think about Xi's  tenure here and him -- setting himself up.  I mean, he has to some extent,  changed the face of Chinese socialism to a more capitalist or a more  western-facing socialism.  Is he made -- has he made China more investable  for you?</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  We've not changed any of our views on a cyclical basis on  anything that's happened in the last few days, I think they're still --  he's putting in macro prudential policy, slowing the housing market.  I  think what he's positioned himself to do is create a very long-term story  which I suppose, we have difficulty in the west, and he'll probably  sounding off about the benefits of having a long-term vision and having  stability versus the -- the chaos we maybe have with democracy in the west,  and equalizing the -- the wealth between the richest urban dwellers and the  poorest people in rural areas is a very big important macro tailwind for  the Chinese consumer, the Chinese economy, and not only does he not have  successors in place, I think this entrenches him in power.  If you get rid  of that, that's the thing that creates the disharmony that leads to turmoil  in countries, and if he does address that, you need to think very long  term, and I think he's put himself in position to do that very well.</p><p> MILLER:  Has he stabilized the countries around him?  I mean, is the rest  of EM more investable with Xi in place?</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  I've not even thought of that question, it's a good question.   Anytime you've got some stability there, it's good for China.  China is  still the manufacturer for the world, it's becoming less so, focusing much  more on its consumer.  I don't think it's going to become the consumer for  the world the way the U.S. is anytime in the next decade, but eventually,  China will become a big purchasing country as well and that'll help flow on  in terms of emerging markets, not just importing raw materials, but also  goods, I suppose.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Are you invested in China?  Are you invested in China derivative  trade?  Do you do it through the metals, do you do it through other areas?</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  We've got no positions on in China right now, so at the  beginning of the year, we were short renminbi, we closed that in about  March, and since then, we've not put investments on -- on equities, you've  had this incredible performance from some of the big tech companies there,  but the governance is still an issue for us.  I don't think we see any  signs that we are moving towards an open market by any means.  I think he's  probably backtracked a little bit about that.  I'm even talking about a new  era where they're outing in a model that's new custom to China, not just  mimicking what the west has already built.  So as a minority shareholder,  that still creates questions for me.</p><p> JOHNSON:  OK.  I just want to show you, Patrick, this chart here, I showed  it to him in the break, it certainly raised a few eyebrows.  This is the  State Bank of India this morning, the stock is up massively as you can see.   This as we've seen the Indian banks being recapped.  They needed it -- they  needed to deal with their nonperforming loans, they needed to just get  money back into the economy.  India, take a step back at (inaudible)  emerging markets, there are some big ones out there, India is one of them,  China is another one.  Kind of, where do you -- do you have to invest in  the bigger ones?</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  If you're going to invest in emerging markets, I think the  bigger ones are the -- the easiest place to look at.  We 've got emerging  market inflation-linked bonds, so as you can tell from the previous  segment, I'm worried about inflation a little bit and I think the epicenter  when inflation (inaudible) start, will be emerging market, so that's one  place where you -- you do see basically, supply and demand, demand couldn't  possibly be going faster than supply coming in to them so, the emerging  market inflation bonds, you're getting a real yield of about 3 percent  right now which is an equity like risk premium to take some bond-like risk  characteristics.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Probably a slightly different story, but Argentina just hikes  interest rates overnight by a hundred and fifty basis points.  Patrick  Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth is going to be sticking around.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> JOHNSON:  Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth still with us.   Patrick, you're long Eurozone banks, industrials, talk to me about the  banks first of all.  The regulatory environment in Europe is getting  tougher, not easier, possibly unlike the United States.  They still trade  on pretty big book discounts to their -- to their U.S. peers, and -- and  theoretically, the European economy looks like it's doing pretty well right  now.</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  That's exactly our play, we've tried to get into the more  cyclical sectors and we think banks and industrials are the two plays that  you think we've got a robust recovery in Europe.  We think we do, we think  the ECB is obviously going to announce a tapering at some point maybe this  week or December at latest, and we should see some interest rate margin for  the banks as well, so you know, you'd have a double win there where you've  got a strong economy and potential for some sort of a yield curve.</p><p> JOHNSON:  (inaudible) going out.  The problem with banks in Europe is that  you scratch the surface and there are problems.  You kind of -- and -- and  there are not many banks that -- that this doesn't apply to, that you kind  of scratch the surface and there's -- there's other management problem, a - - a environment problem.  There's always a nonperforming-loan problem.   Most banks when you actually come down to at a granular level, have  problems.</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  Most of them do, and we're not in the cheapest banks for that  reason, we're in the French banks which are trading 10 times earnings.   They don't have a significant amount of bad debts, trading at book value, 4  percent dividend yield, very well capitalized especially versus peers, so  we're attracted to cheap assets that's not the cheapest, because I think  they've got less issues than you just referred to anyway, on the SocGen,  the BNPs.</p><p> MILLER:  Do you see -- I mean, there's a great story on the terminal,  Patrick, about an ex-Barclays analyst leaving to start his own research  firm and of course, not doing that in Europe, MiFID has driven him out.   You've got Brexit driving bankers out of the U.K., is there kind of a  shakedown here where they're going to be a few winners and a lot of losers?</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  Well, European banking system probably needs some  consolidation.  I think that might be a trend that we start to see, but  what you're talking about is a theme of basically, David and Goliath.   Basically, you've got some big slow-moving banks and that creates  opportunities for small, nimble competitors.  So I think that's good for  the industry.  Anytime you do have smaller competitors challenging some the  big goliaths, it creates some innovation and efficiencies in order for them  to maintain their profit margin, so it is a trend that's likely to be seen  because we're very top-heavy on the banks, and they do have a lot of  structural issues.</p><p> MILLER:  What do you think about national heroes?  I mean, Deutsche Bank is  one that maybe bit off a little bit more than it could chew, it's being  punished -- been punished for that now, but it's unlikely that Germany  would let its most important bank fall, so can you buy a dip in a company  like that?</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  Well, I think what you've just said, we agree with a hundred  percent, but we don't have any of the equity.  We do buy Deutsche Bank  bonds, we have some of their subordinated debt.  When there's worries about  Deutsche Bank, we add to that position because the scenario you just  outlined means it's valuable, it's going to be able to pay its debt, but it  doesn't attract you as a shareholder necessarily.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Where do the bulk of your investors come from because currency  seems to be really important in this process about where you invest in the  world.</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  Our investors and our funds?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  So we've got high net worth around Europe, so predominantly,  European (inaudible) Swiss-based, U.K.-based.</p><p> JOHNSON:  U.K. -- Swiss-based, U.K.-based.</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  Those are the two countries where most --</p><p> JOHNSON:  OK.  Because this -- because this is interesting, if -- if I may,  euro investor into sterling, into the FTSE, I've made nothing, nothing this  year which is fascinating.  If I've invested (inaudible) going to the  States, I've only made 2.61 percent versus the S&amp;P 500 which has done  nearly 15 percent.</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  Very much, yes.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Do you do this on a non-hedge basis?  Do you do this --</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  So we've got base currency of our fund which is euro  unfortunately because everything as you're just pointing out, when price in  euro isn't doing that well, but we offer fully-hedge share classes, so if  you buy our fund in euros, that's the base currency, you can buy Swiss  francs, sterling, and bully head share class.</p><p> JOHNSON:  But does it -- you -- when you go into the States, do you do it  on a hedge basis?  When you go into the Japan, do you do it on an un-hedge  basis?  Kind of, how do you --</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  (inaudible) investing yet.  So if we're buying a telecom  company, I'll hedge that into euros quite often because that -- that's  currency (inaudible).  If I'm buying a multinational company, probably  won't hedge that because you're getting foreign revenues coming in that  way, so --</p><p> JOHNSON:  So it's whether (inaudible) a domestic -- if it's got a domestic  focus, you will -- you will hedge that, (inaudible) you got the currency  risk, but if -- if the company already effectively is doing it for you,  then it doesn't really matter.</p><p> ARMSTRONG:  It's (inaudible) but exactly, you're getting the benefit if  you've got a weak dollar, if things are priced in dollar, it's got foreign  revenues coming in, so you get a bit of a natural hedge that way on  multinationals.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Interesting stuff.  You can see this really clearly, guys.  Go to  the WEI screen, and you'll see the options, you can change the currency on  the right-hand side of the screen.  Patrick Armstrong, thank you very much  indeed, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth Management, he's going to be joining our  radio team live on London DAB Digital.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Patrick Armstrong from Plurimi Wealth -- from Plurimi Wealth is the CIO there, joins us out of London. Mark, let's start with you. 2.4, why is it so important and will it hold?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARK CUDMORE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: I don't think it is that important, I think it's become a short-term technical level, it's been hyped up by Gundlach, and, you know, while he's had a very successful bond career, has called, you know, many of the last zero kind of bond rates. So I think the fact is that this is not suddenly a big level, I think it's been hyped up in the market, we might see a little bit of follow through, but I don't think the game has necessarily changed yet. It might change with the new Fed chair, but even that I'm very suspicious of.</p><p>I think the people are getting excited by Taylor as a candidate, but they're getting excited by Taylor as a candidate because he made a plea recently that he might be more dovish, and many people are starting to interpret that in fact, the Taylor rule may not be that hawkish if you adapt inappropriately the -- the correct inputs for today's environment. So overall, I think we're likely to get a more dovish chair, though I admit that if we do get Taylor, we will get a -- a decent spike in yield that can last for several weeks.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, I do think -- sorry, Mark -- sorry, Matt.</p><p>MATT MILLER, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Well, I just -- I mean, that's something I think, you mentioned there's a Bloomberg story on it, Guy and I -- I read the story and I thought it was great, but on the other hand, there are a lot of very smart strategists on Wall Street who do think that appointing Taylor would mean of rise in 10-year yields. So I wonder, Patrick, if you agree?</p><p>PATRICK ARMSTRONG, CIO, PLURIMI WEALTH MANAGEMENT: We're short treasuries, we think 10-year yields are moving higher, there will be a slow grind higher over the next 12 months. It's not a call on Taylor being the next Fed chair. He does seem that he'll be moderately more hawkish than Powell which I would characterize maybe as more of a status quo with Yellen. But we just think interest rates are too low, we think the Fed's biased to hike, we think the bar for the Fed to hike, markets underestimating, they say they're going to hike once this year, maybe three times next year. The market's pricing in not even a hundred percent chance fort this year, and only once next year. So we think market's too complacent on the outlook for rates regardless who comes in.</p><p>MILLER: Obviously, this complacency is something that we've noted as well, Mark. When do you think we're going to snap out of that? I mean, could tax reform actually move us in that direction?</p><p>CUDMORE: I think tax reform will be a big really big thing, and I think, you know, Patrick's argument is very logical, that there is certainly a real desire to hike coming out of the Fed and the market is suspicious there and they might regret being suspicious there. And certainly, I could buy into the narrative of a slow grind higher in yields. I do also think, I should clarify that I accept that Taylor will be more hawkish than the Yellen or Powell status quo, I'm just saying that he's not going to suddenly be completely shift yields way higher. It's not going to be as hawkish as the Taylor will might have want to suggest we don't modify it. So I think the fact is, if we do yet tax reform, that is a great thing for the growth story.</p><p>I personally remain quite cynical that we'll get a -- a tax reform that is really so revolutionary to shift growth that massively. I think given the depth that's in the U.S., they're slightly constrained. I'm sure some kind of package will be delivered, but it will be one of those packages where we get an excited headline, but then suddenly, the details (inaudible) going to go, you know what, how much does this really change things? So I think we -- we could get a grind higher in yields, I just don't think we got any major change in tone and yields just because the 30-year bull market and bonds (inaudible) which I fully believe, I'm sure, ended a year ago. The fact is, that doesn't mean we have to start into a long-term bear market, I think we're stuck in a range for a long time to come.</p><p>JOHNSON: Patrick, what about the shape of the curve, what do these guys mean for the shape of the curve? Rates coming up at the frontend, flattening that curve out, effect further down the -- further -- further down the curve in terms of the inflation outlook, kind of, is that where we should be looking? We shouldn't be worrying too much about the levels, it's kind of, just actually, the -- the relationship and the forward- predictive power of that curve.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: That's very important. I think if the Fed's doing their job properly, you'll will get a parallel shift, so they'll be hiking as the economic outlook is improving, so basically --</p><p>JOHNSON: That's not what we're seeing at the moment. At the moment, the curve's flattening.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: It's very flat, and yes, and it's not even pricing in the Fed doing what they say they'll do which would make it even more flat. But I think the economic numbers are going to continue the pace we've had for the last six months where you are getting jobs created. The missing ingredient is inflation, there's no inflation there, but if you're looking at wage growth, there are some signs that's there. If you look at companies issues right now, or that they can't fill job vacancies, finding quality people to fill employment on the NFIB survey, those are the small businesses that are saying, we're defining issues. I think that points to the beginnings of some inflation.</p><p>MILLER: Mark, talk to me about the relationship between two-year yields, rising two-year yields and the FX trade because you've written something interesting about this overnight.</p><p>CUDMORE: You know, I mean, I think there can be a bit of divergence going -- going forward in terms of yields and dollar. I don't think that dollar has to track yields all the way up. Like we saw on kind of November last year whether there's a slightly different narrative. I think right now, there are a lot of other headwinds for the dollar, so I think we can get a bit more divergence. The dollar trade might be nearly done to the topside, whereas, the yields can continue to go further, and I think one of those issues is, I actually do believe that we probably will still get a -- a flattening curve.</p><p>I would ask Patrick, I'm interested to know that, you know, given that there's no inflation, if we've got a good growth story, an OK growth story but there's no sign of inflation and we start to buy into the narrative of, you know, what, there are structural disinflationary pressures, why should the curves steepen much? Because this is not a -- a story that they won't be, you know, need an extra risk premium. We know there's too much money out there, there's no sign of inflations, there's no reason to like, hike rates much more aggressively two years down the line. I'm just not sure the curve should steepen much. Even if they hike another couple of times at the front of the curve, and even if they do that with growth remaining strong.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: The way you posed your question, I would agree that wouldn't lead to a steepening of the curve by any means, but I actually do think we're starting to see the early signs that there will be inflationary pressures. You don't get unemployment down below 4 percent, you don't have economic growth where we are with interest rates definitely still very accommodative, I would even characterized them still at emergency levels. I think we've got a very accommodative Fed, it's beginning to take away some of the juice, but I may be old school maybe like a lot of the Fed governors right now that (inaudible).</p><p>JOHNSON: Patrick's (inaudible) believes in the Phillips curve.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: The Phillips curve isn't dead, Phillips curve is still there. Intuitively, it should be there when you have lots of jobs and wage growth, that's going to create demand for goods and that's going to inflate the higher prices. So think we can't see inflation now, but I think the early signs that inflation may be around the corner are there, and I think the Fed will be hiking next year based on inflation that will be there which will mean the curve shouldn't flatten. I don't know if they will steepen, I think it'll be more of a parallel shift up because the Fed will be doing its job hiking appropriately because you got a stronger economy and the beginnings of some inflation.</p><p>MILLER: All right, we'll -- we will say thank you and goodbye to millennial Mark Cudmore, Bloomberg MLive strategist and continue to kick it old school with Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MILLER: Still with us is Patrick Armstrong, CIO at Plurimi Wealth. Just if -- if anyone's curious, I've dug in to the story and found that there is an unwritten rule of retirement at age 68, so you can't become the president after the age 68, at least that's kind of -- that's sort of the unwritten rule there. Patrick, let me ask you what you think about Xi's tenure here and him -- setting himself up. I mean, he has to some extent, changed the face of Chinese socialism to a more capitalist or a more western-facing socialism. Is he made -- has he made China more investable for you?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: We've not changed any of our views on a cyclical basis on anything that's happened in the last few days, I think they're still -- he's putting in macro prudential policy, slowing the housing market. I think what he's positioned himself to do is create a very long-term story which I suppose, we have difficulty in the west, and he'll probably sounding off about the benefits of having a long-term vision and having stability versus the -- the chaos we maybe have with democracy in the west, and equalizing the -- the wealth between the richest urban dwellers and the poorest people in rural areas is a very big important macro tailwind for the Chinese consumer, the Chinese economy, and not only does he not have successors in place, I think this entrenches him in power. If you get rid of that, that's the thing that creates the disharmony that leads to turmoil in countries, and if he does address that, you need to think very long term, and I think he's put himself in position to do that very well.</p><p>MILLER: Has he stabilized the countries around him? I mean, is the rest of EM more investable with Xi in place?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: I've not even thought of that question, it's a good question. Anytime you've got some stability there, it's good for China. China is still the manufacturer for the world, it's becoming less so, focusing much more on its consumer. I don't think it's going to become the consumer for the world the way the U.S. is anytime in the next decade, but eventually, China will become a big purchasing country as well and that'll help flow on in terms of emerging markets, not just importing raw materials, but also goods, I suppose.</p><p>JOHNSON: Are you invested in China? Are you invested in China derivative trade? Do you do it through the metals, do you do it through other areas?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: We've got no positions on in China right now, so at the beginning of the year, we were short renminbi, we closed that in about March, and since then, we've not put investments on -- on equities, you've had this incredible performance from some of the big tech companies there, but the governance is still an issue for us. I don't think we see any signs that we are moving towards an open market by any means. I think he's probably backtracked a little bit about that. I'm even talking about a new era where they're outing in a model that's new custom to China, not just mimicking what the west has already built. So as a minority shareholder, that still creates questions for me.</p><p>JOHNSON: OK. I just want to show you, Patrick, this chart here, I showed it to him in the break, it certainly raised a few eyebrows. This is the State Bank of India this morning, the stock is up massively as you can see. This as we've seen the Indian banks being recapped. They needed it -- they needed to deal with their nonperforming loans, they needed to just get money back into the economy. India, take a step back at (inaudible) emerging markets, there are some big ones out there, India is one of them, China is another one. Kind of, where do you -- do you have to invest in the bigger ones?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: If you're going to invest in emerging markets, I think the bigger ones are the -- the easiest place to look at. We 've got emerging market inflation-linked bonds, so as you can tell from the previous segment, I'm worried about inflation a little bit and I think the epicenter when inflation (inaudible) start, will be emerging market, so that's one place where you -- you do see basically, supply and demand, demand couldn't possibly be going faster than supply coming in to them so, the emerging market inflation bonds, you're getting a real yield of about 3 percent right now which is an equity like risk premium to take some bond-like risk characteristics.</p><p>JOHNSON: Probably a slightly different story, but Argentina just hikes interest rates overnight by a hundred and fifty basis points. Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth is going to be sticking around.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth still with us. Patrick, you're long Eurozone banks, industrials, talk to me about the banks first of all. The regulatory environment in Europe is getting tougher, not easier, possibly unlike the United States. They still trade on pretty big book discounts to their -- to their U.S. peers, and -- and theoretically, the European economy looks like it's doing pretty well right now.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: That's exactly our play, we've tried to get into the more cyclical sectors and we think banks and industrials are the two plays that you think we've got a robust recovery in Europe. We think we do, we think the ECB is obviously going to announce a tapering at some point maybe this week or December at latest, and we should see some interest rate margin for the banks as well, so you know, you'd have a double win there where you've got a strong economy and potential for some sort of a yield curve.</p><p>JOHNSON: (inaudible) going out. The problem with banks in Europe is that you scratch the surface and there are problems. You kind of -- and -- and there are not many banks that -- that this doesn't apply to, that you kind of scratch the surface and there's -- there's other management problem, a - - a environment problem. There's always a nonperforming-loan problem. Most banks when you actually come down to at a granular level, have problems.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Most of them do, and we're not in the cheapest banks for that reason, we're in the French banks which are trading 10 times earnings. They don't have a significant amount of bad debts, trading at book value, 4 percent dividend yield, very well capitalized especially versus peers, so we're attracted to cheap assets that's not the cheapest, because I think they've got less issues than you just referred to anyway, on the SocGen, the BNPs.</p><p>MILLER: Do you see -- I mean, there's a great story on the terminal, Patrick, about an ex-Barclays analyst leaving to start his own research firm and of course, not doing that in Europe, MiFID has driven him out. You've got Brexit driving bankers out of the U.K., is there kind of a shakedown here where they're going to be a few winners and a lot of losers?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Well, European banking system probably needs some consolidation. I think that might be a trend that we start to see, but what you're talking about is a theme of basically, David and Goliath. Basically, you've got some big slow-moving banks and that creates opportunities for small, nimble competitors. So I think that's good for the industry. Anytime you do have smaller competitors challenging some the big goliaths, it creates some innovation and efficiencies in order for them to maintain their profit margin, so it is a trend that's likely to be seen because we're very top-heavy on the banks, and they do have a lot of structural issues.</p><p>MILLER: What do you think about national heroes? I mean, Deutsche Bank is one that maybe bit off a little bit more than it could chew, it's being punished -- been punished for that now, but it's unlikely that Germany would let its most important bank fall, so can you buy a dip in a company like that?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Well, I think what you've just said, we agree with a hundred percent, but we don't have any of the equity. We do buy Deutsche Bank bonds, we have some of their subordinated debt. When there's worries about Deutsche Bank, we add to that position because the scenario you just outlined means it's valuable, it's going to be able to pay its debt, but it doesn't attract you as a shareholder necessarily.</p><p>JOHNSON: Where do the bulk of your investors come from because currency seems to be really important in this process about where you invest in the world.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Our investors and our funds?</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: So we've got high net worth around Europe, so predominantly, European (inaudible) Swiss-based, U.K.-based.</p><p>JOHNSON: U.K. -- Swiss-based, U.K.-based.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Those are the two countries where most --</p><p>JOHNSON: OK. Because this -- because this is interesting, if -- if I may, euro investor into sterling, into the FTSE, I've made nothing, nothing this year which is fascinating. If I've invested (inaudible) going to the States, I've only made 2.61 percent versus the S&amp;P 500 which has done nearly 15 percent.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Very much, yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: Do you do this on a non-hedge basis? Do you do this --</p><p>ARMSTRONG: So we've got base currency of our fund which is euro unfortunately because everything as you're just pointing out, when price in euro isn't doing that well, but we offer fully-hedge share classes, so if you buy our fund in euros, that's the base currency, you can buy Swiss francs, sterling, and bully head share class.</p><p>JOHNSON: But does it -- you -- when you go into the States, do you do it on a hedge basis? When you go into the Japan, do you do it on an un-hedge basis? Kind of, how do you --</p><p>ARMSTRONG: (inaudible) investing yet. So if we're buying a telecom company, I'll hedge that into euros quite often because that -- that's currency (inaudible). If I'm buying a multinational company, probably won't hedge that because you're getting foreign revenues coming in that way, so --</p><p>JOHNSON: So it's whether (inaudible) a domestic -- if it's got a domestic focus, you will -- you will hedge that, (inaudible) you got the currency risk, but if -- if the company already effectively is doing it for you, then it doesn't really matter.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: It's (inaudible) but exactly, you're getting the benefit if you've got a weak dollar, if things are priced in dollar, it's got foreign revenues coming in, so you get a bit of a natural hedge that way on multinationals.</p><p>JOHNSON: Interesting stuff. You can see this really clearly, guys. Go to the WEI screen, and you'll see the options, you can change the currency on the right-hand side of the screen. Patrick Armstrong, thank you very much indeed, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth Management, he's going to be joining our radio team live on London DAB Digital.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Patrick Armstrong from Plurimi  Wealth -- from Plurimi Wealth is the CIO there, joins us out of London.   Mark, let's start with you.  2.4, why is it so important and will it hold?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARK CUDMORE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  I don't think it is that important, I  think it's become a short-term technical level, it's been hyped up by  Gundlach, and, you know, while he's had a very successful bond career, has  called, you know, many of the last zero kind of bond rates.  So I think the  fact is that this is not suddenly a big level, I think it's been hyped up  in the market, we might see a little bit of follow through, but I don't  think the game has necessarily changed yet.  It might change with the new  Fed chair, but even that I'm very suspicious of.</p><p>I think the people are getting excited by Taylor as a candidate, but  they're getting excited by Taylor as a candidate because he made a plea  recently that he might be more dovish, and many people are starting to  interpret that in fact, the Taylor rule may not be that hawkish if you  adapt inappropriately the -- the correct inputs for today's environment.   So overall, I think we're likely to get a more dovish chair, though I admit  that if we do get Taylor, we will get a -- a decent spike in yield that can  last for several weeks.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes, I do think -- sorry, Mark -- sorry, Matt.</p><p>MATT MILLER, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Well, I just -- I mean, that's something I  think, you mentioned there's a Bloomberg story on it, Guy and I -- I read  the story and I thought it was great, but on the other hand, there are a  lot of very smart strategists on Wall Street who do think that appointing  Taylor would mean of rise in 10-year yields.  So I wonder, Patrick, if you  agree?</p><p>PATRICK ARMSTRONG, CIO, PLURIMI WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  We're short treasuries,  we think 10-year yields are moving higher, there will be a slow grind  higher over the next 12 months.  It's not a call on Taylor being the next  Fed chair.  He does seem that he'll be moderately more hawkish than Powell  which I would characterize maybe as more of a status quo with Yellen.  But  we just think interest rates are too low, we think the Fed's biased to  hike, we think the bar for the Fed to hike, markets underestimating, they  say they're going to hike once this year, maybe three times next year.  The  market's pricing in not even a hundred percent chance fort this year, and  only once next year.  So we think market's too complacent on the outlook  for rates regardless who comes in.</p><p>MILLER:  Obviously, this complacency is something that we've noted as well,  Mark.  When do you think we're going to snap out of that?  I mean, could  tax reform actually move us in that direction?</p><p>CUDMORE:  I think tax reform will be a big really big thing, and I think,  you know, Patrick's argument is very logical, that there is certainly a  real desire to hike coming out of the Fed and the market is suspicious  there and they might regret being suspicious there.  And certainly, I could  buy into the narrative of a slow grind higher in yields.  I do also think,  I should clarify that I accept that Taylor will be more hawkish than the  Yellen or Powell status quo, I'm just saying that he's not going to  suddenly be completely shift yields way higher.  It's not going to be as  hawkish as the Taylor will might have want to suggest we don't modify it.   So I think the fact is, if we do yet tax reform, that is a great thing for  the growth story.</p><p>I personally remain quite cynical that we'll get a -- a tax reform that is  really so revolutionary to shift growth that massively.  I think given the  depth that's in the U.S., they're slightly constrained.  I'm sure some kind  of package will be delivered, but it will be one of those packages where we  get an excited headline, but then suddenly, the details (inaudible) going  to go, you know what, how much does this really change things?  So I think  we -- we could get a grind higher in yields, I just don't think we got any  major change in tone and yields just because the 30-year bull market and  bonds (inaudible) which I fully believe, I'm sure, ended a year ago.  The  fact is, that doesn't mean we have to start into a long-term bear market, I  think we're stuck in a range for a long time to come.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Patrick, what about the shape of the curve, what do these guys  mean for the shape of the curve?  Rates coming up at the frontend,  flattening that curve out, effect further down the -- further -- further  down the curve in terms of the inflation outlook, kind of, is that where we  should be looking?  We shouldn't be worrying too much about the levels,  it's kind of, just actually, the -- the relationship and the forward- predictive power of that curve.</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  That's very important.  I think if the Fed's doing their job  properly, you'll will get a parallel shift, so they'll be hiking as the  economic outlook is improving, so basically --</p><p>JOHNSON:  That's not what we're seeing at the moment.  At the moment, the  curve's flattening.</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  It's very flat, and yes, and it's not even pricing in the Fed  doing what they say they'll do which would make it even more flat.  But I  think the economic numbers are going to continue the pace we've had for the  last six months where you are getting jobs created.  The missing ingredient  is inflation, there's no inflation there, but if you're looking at wage  growth, there are some signs that's there.  If you look at companies issues  right now, or that they can't fill job vacancies, finding quality people to  fill employment on the NFIB survey, those are the small businesses that are  saying, we're defining issues.  I think that points to the beginnings of  some inflation.</p><p>MILLER:  Mark, talk to me about the relationship between two-year yields,  rising two-year yields and the FX trade because you've written something  interesting about this overnight.</p><p>CUDMORE:  You know, I mean, I think there can be a bit of divergence going  -- going forward in terms of yields and dollar.  I don't think that dollar  has to track yields all the way up.  Like we saw on kind of November last  year whether there's a slightly different narrative.  I think right now,  there are a lot of other headwinds for the dollar, so I think we can get a  bit more divergence.  The dollar trade might be nearly done to the topside,  whereas, the yields can continue to go further, and I think one of those  issues is, I actually do believe that we probably will still get a -- a  flattening curve.</p><p>I would ask Patrick, I'm interested to know that, you know, given that  there's no inflation, if we've got a good growth story, an OK growth story  but there's no sign of inflation and we start to buy into the narrative of,  you know, what, there are structural disinflationary pressures, why should  the curves steepen much?  Because this is not a -- a story that they won't  be, you know, need an extra risk premium.  We know there's too much money  out there, there's no sign of inflations, there's no reason to like, hike  rates much more aggressively two years down the line.  I'm just not sure  the curve should steepen much.  Even if they hike another couple of times  at the front of the curve, and even if they do that with growth remaining  strong.</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  The way you posed your question, I would agree that wouldn't  lead to a steepening of the curve by any means, but I actually do think  we're starting to see the early signs that there will be inflationary  pressures.  You don't get unemployment down below 4 percent, you don't have  economic growth where we are with interest rates definitely still very  accommodative, I would even characterized them still at emergency levels.   I think we've got a very accommodative Fed, it's beginning to take away  some of the juice, but I may be old school maybe like a lot of the Fed  governors right now that (inaudible).</p><p>JOHNSON:  Patrick's (inaudible) believes in the Phillips curve.</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  The Phillips curve isn't dead, Phillips curve is still there.   Intuitively, it should be there when you have lots of jobs and wage growth,  that's going to create demand for goods and that's going to inflate the  higher prices.  So think we can't see inflation now, but I think the early  signs that inflation may be around the corner are there, and I think the  Fed will be hiking next year based on inflation that will be there which  will mean the curve shouldn't flatten.  I don't know if they will steepen,  I think it'll be more of a parallel shift up because the Fed will be doing  its job hiking appropriately because you got a stronger economy and the  beginnings of some inflation.</p><p>MILLER:  All right, we'll -- we will say thank you and goodbye to  millennial Mark Cudmore, Bloomberg MLive strategist and continue to kick it  old school with Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MILLER:  Still with us is Patrick Armstrong, CIO at Plurimi Wealth.  Just  if -- if anyone's curious, I've dug in to the story and found that there is  an unwritten rule of retirement at age 68, so you can't become the  president after the age 68, at least that's kind of -- that's sort of the  unwritten rule there.  Patrick, let me ask you what you think about Xi's  tenure here and him -- setting himself up.  I mean, he has to some extent,  changed the face of Chinese socialism to a more capitalist or a more  western-facing socialism.  Is he made -- has he made China more investable  for you?</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  We've not changed any of our views on a cyclical basis on  anything that's happened in the last few days, I think they're still --  he's putting in macro prudential policy, slowing the housing market.  I  think what he's positioned himself to do is create a very long-term story  which I suppose, we have difficulty in the west, and he'll probably  sounding off about the benefits of having a long-term vision and having  stability versus the -- the chaos we maybe have with democracy in the west,  and equalizing the -- the wealth between the richest urban dwellers and the  poorest people in rural areas is a very big important macro tailwind for  the Chinese consumer, the Chinese economy, and not only does he not have  successors in place, I think this entrenches him in power.  If you get rid  of that, that's the thing that creates the disharmony that leads to turmoil  in countries, and if he does address that, you need to think very long  term, and I think he's put himself in position to do that very well.</p><p>MILLER:  Has he stabilized the countries around him?  I mean, is the rest  of EM more investable with Xi in place?</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  I've not even thought of that question, it's a good question.   Anytime you've got some stability there, it's good for China.  China is  still the manufacturer for the world, it's becoming less so, focusing much  more on its consumer.  I don't think it's going to become the consumer for  the world the way the U.S. is anytime in the next decade, but eventually,  China will become a big purchasing country as well and that'll help flow on  in terms of emerging markets, not just importing raw materials, but also  goods, I suppose.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Are you invested in China?  Are you invested in China derivative  trade?  Do you do it through the metals, do you do it through other areas?</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  We've got no positions on in China right now, so at the  beginning of the year, we were short renminbi, we closed that in about  March, and since then, we've not put investments on -- on equities, you've  had this incredible performance from some of the big tech companies there,  but the governance is still an issue for us.  I don't think we see any  signs that we are moving towards an open market by any means.  I think he's  probably backtracked a little bit about that.  I'm even talking about a new  era where they're outing in a model that's new custom to China, not just  mimicking what the west has already built.  So as a minority shareholder,  that still creates questions for me.</p><p>JOHNSON:  OK.  I just want to show you, Patrick, this chart here, I showed  it to him in the break, it certainly raised a few eyebrows.  This is the  State Bank of India this morning, the stock is up massively as you can see.   This as we've seen the Indian banks being recapped.  They needed it -- they  needed to deal with their nonperforming loans, they needed to just get  money back into the economy.  India, take a step back at (inaudible)  emerging markets, there are some big ones out there, India is one of them,  China is another one.  Kind of, where do you -- do you have to invest in  the bigger ones?</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  If you're going to invest in emerging markets, I think the  bigger ones are the -- the easiest place to look at.  We 've got emerging  market inflation-linked bonds, so as you can tell from the previous  segment, I'm worried about inflation a little bit and I think the epicenter  when inflation (inaudible) start, will be emerging market, so that's one  place where you -- you do see basically, supply and demand, demand couldn't  possibly be going faster than supply coming in to them so, the emerging  market inflation bonds, you're getting a real yield of about 3 percent  right now which is an equity like risk premium to take some bond-like risk  characteristics.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Probably a slightly different story, but Argentina just hikes  interest rates overnight by a hundred and fifty basis points.  Patrick  Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth is going to be sticking around.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON:  Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth still with us.   Patrick, you're long Eurozone banks, industrials, talk to me about the  banks first of all.  The regulatory environment in Europe is getting  tougher, not easier, possibly unlike the United States.  They still trade  on pretty big book discounts to their -- to their U.S. peers, and -- and  theoretically, the European economy looks like it's doing pretty well right  now.</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  That's exactly our play, we've tried to get into the more  cyclical sectors and we think banks and industrials are the two plays that  you think we've got a robust recovery in Europe.  We think we do, we think  the ECB is obviously going to announce a tapering at some point maybe this  week or December at latest, and we should see some interest rate margin for  the banks as well, so you know, you'd have a double win there where you've  got a strong economy and potential for some sort of a yield curve.</p><p>JOHNSON:  (inaudible) going out.  The problem with banks in Europe is that  you scratch the surface and there are problems.  You kind of -- and -- and  there are not many banks that -- that this doesn't apply to, that you kind  of scratch the surface and there's -- there's other management problem, a - - a environment problem.  There's always a nonperforming-loan problem.   Most banks when you actually come down to at a granular level, have  problems.</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  Most of them do, and we're not in the cheapest banks for that  reason, we're in the French banks which are trading 10 times earnings.   They don't have a significant amount of bad debts, trading at book value, 4  percent dividend yield, very well capitalized especially versus peers, so  we're attracted to cheap assets that's not the cheapest, because I think  they've got less issues than you just referred to anyway, on the SocGen,  the BNPs.</p><p>MILLER:  Do you see -- I mean, there's a great story on the terminal,  Patrick, about an ex-Barclays analyst leaving to start his own research  firm and of course, not doing that in Europe, MiFID has driven him out.   You've got Brexit driving bankers out of the U.K., is there kind of a  shakedown here where they're going to be a few winners and a lot of losers?</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  Well, European banking system probably needs some  consolidation.  I think that might be a trend that we start to see, but  what you're talking about is a theme of basically, David and Goliath.   Basically, you've got some big slow-moving banks and that creates  opportunities for small, nimble competitors.  So I think that's good for  the industry.  Anytime you do have smaller competitors challenging some the  big goliaths, it creates some innovation and efficiencies in order for them  to maintain their profit margin, so it is a trend that's likely to be seen  because we're very top-heavy on the banks, and they do have a lot of  structural issues.</p><p>MILLER:  What do you think about national heroes?  I mean, Deutsche Bank is  one that maybe bit off a little bit more than it could chew, it's being  punished -- been punished for that now, but it's unlikely that Germany  would let its most important bank fall, so can you buy a dip in a company  like that?</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  Well, I think what you've just said, we agree with a hundred  percent, but we don't have any of the equity.  We do buy Deutsche Bank  bonds, we have some of their subordinated debt.  When there's worries about  Deutsche Bank, we add to that position because the scenario you just  outlined means it's valuable, it's going to be able to pay its debt, but it  doesn't attract you as a shareholder necessarily.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Where do the bulk of your investors come from because currency  seems to be really important in this process about where you invest in the  world.</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  Our investors and our funds?</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  So we've got high net worth around Europe, so predominantly,  European (inaudible) Swiss-based, U.K.-based.</p><p>JOHNSON:  U.K. -- Swiss-based, U.K.-based.</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  Those are the two countries where most --</p><p>JOHNSON:  OK.  Because this -- because this is interesting, if -- if I may,  euro investor into sterling, into the FTSE, I've made nothing, nothing this  year which is fascinating.  If I've invested (inaudible) going to the  States, I've only made 2.61 percent versus the S&amp;P 500 which has done  nearly 15 percent.</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  Very much, yes.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Do you do this on a non-hedge basis?  Do you do this --</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  So we've got base currency of our fund which is euro  unfortunately because everything as you're just pointing out, when price in  euro isn't doing that well, but we offer fully-hedge share classes, so if  you buy our fund in euros, that's the base currency, you can buy Swiss  francs, sterling, and bully head share class.</p><p>JOHNSON:  But does it -- you -- when you go into the States, do you do it  on a hedge basis?  When you go into the Japan, do you do it on an un-hedge  basis?  Kind of, how do you --</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  (inaudible) investing yet.  So if we're buying a telecom  company, I'll hedge that into euros quite often because that -- that's  currency (inaudible).  If I'm buying a multinational company, probably  won't hedge that because you're getting foreign revenues coming in that  way, so --</p><p>JOHNSON:  So it's whether (inaudible) a domestic -- if it's got a domestic  focus, you will -- you will hedge that, (inaudible) you got the currency  risk, but if -- if the company already effectively is doing it for you,  then it doesn't really matter.</p><p>ARMSTRONG:  It's (inaudible) but exactly, you're getting the benefit if  you've got a weak dollar, if things are priced in dollar, it's got foreign  revenues coming in, so you get a bit of a natural hedge that way on  multinationals.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Interesting stuff.  You can see this really clearly, guys.  Go to  the WEI screen, and you'll see the options, you can change the currency on  the right-hand side of the screen.  Patrick Armstrong, thank you very much  indeed, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth Management, he's going to be joining our  radio team live on London DAB Digital.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Patrick Armstrong from Plurimi Wealth -- from Plurimi Wealth is the CIO there, joins us out of London. Mark, let's start with you. 2.4, why is it so important and will it hold?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARK CUDMORE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: I don't think it is that important, I think it's become a short-term technical level, it's been hyped up by Gundlach, and, you know, while he's had a very successful bond career, has called, you know, many of the last zero kind of bond rates. So I think the fact is that this is not suddenly a big level, I think it's been hyped up in the market, we might see a little bit of follow through, but I don't think the game has necessarily changed yet. It might change with the new Fed chair, but even that I'm very suspicious of.</p><p>I think the people are getting excited by Taylor as a candidate, but they're getting excited by Taylor as a candidate because he made a plea recently that he might be more dovish, and many people are starting to interpret that in fact, the Taylor rule may not be that hawkish if you adapt inappropriately the -- the correct inputs for today's environment. So overall, I think we're likely to get a more dovish chair, though I admit that if we do get Taylor, we will get a -- a decent spike in yield that can last for several weeks.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, I do think -- sorry, Mark -- sorry, Matt.</p><p>MATT MILLER, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Well, I just -- I mean, that's something I think, you mentioned there's a Bloomberg story on it, Guy and I -- I read the story and I thought it was great, but on the other hand, there are a lot of very smart strategists on Wall Street who do think that appointing Taylor would mean of rise in 10-year yields. So I wonder, Patrick, if you agree?</p><p>PATRICK ARMSTRONG, CIO, PLURIMI WEALTH MANAGEMENT: We're short treasuries, we think 10-year yields are moving higher, there will be a slow grind higher over the next 12 months. It's not a call on Taylor being the next Fed chair. He does seem that he'll be moderately more hawkish than Powell which I would characterize maybe as more of a status quo with Yellen. But we just think interest rates are too low, we think the Fed's biased to hike, we think the bar for the Fed to hike, markets underestimating, they say they're going to hike once this year, maybe three times next year. The market's pricing in not even a hundred percent chance fort this year, and only once next year. So we think market's too complacent on the outlook for rates regardless who comes in.</p><p>MILLER: Obviously, this complacency is something that we've noted as well, Mark. When do you think we're going to snap out of that? I mean, could tax reform actually move us in that direction?</p><p>CUDMORE: I think tax reform will be a big really big thing, and I think, you know, Patrick's argument is very logical, that there is certainly a real desire to hike coming out of the Fed and the market is suspicious there and they might regret being suspicious there. And certainly, I could buy into the narrative of a slow grind higher in yields. I do also think, I should clarify that I accept that Taylor will be more hawkish than the Yellen or Powell status quo, I'm just saying that he's not going to suddenly be completely shift yields way higher. It's not going to be as hawkish as the Taylor will might have want to suggest we don't modify it. So I think the fact is, if we do yet tax reform, that is a great thing for the growth story.</p><p>I personally remain quite cynical that we'll get a -- a tax reform that is really so revolutionary to shift growth that massively. I think given the depth that's in the U.S., they're slightly constrained. I'm sure some kind of package will be delivered, but it will be one of those packages where we get an excited headline, but then suddenly, the details (inaudible) going to go, you know what, how much does this really change things? So I think we -- we could get a grind higher in yields, I just don't think we got any major change in tone and yields just because the 30-year bull market and bonds (inaudible) which I fully believe, I'm sure, ended a year ago. The fact is, that doesn't mean we have to start into a long-term bear market, I think we're stuck in a range for a long time to come.</p><p>JOHNSON: Patrick, what about the shape of the curve, what do these guys mean for the shape of the curve? Rates coming up at the frontend, flattening that curve out, effect further down the -- further -- further down the curve in terms of the inflation outlook, kind of, is that where we should be looking? We shouldn't be worrying too much about the levels, it's kind of, just actually, the -- the relationship and the forward- predictive power of that curve.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: That's very important. I think if the Fed's doing their job properly, you'll will get a parallel shift, so they'll be hiking as the economic outlook is improving, so basically --</p><p>JOHNSON: That's not what we're seeing at the moment. At the moment, the curve's flattening.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: It's very flat, and yes, and it's not even pricing in the Fed doing what they say they'll do which would make it even more flat. But I think the economic numbers are going to continue the pace we've had for the last six months where you are getting jobs created. The missing ingredient is inflation, there's no inflation there, but if you're looking at wage growth, there are some signs that's there. If you look at companies issues right now, or that they can't fill job vacancies, finding quality people to fill employment on the NFIB survey, those are the small businesses that are saying, we're defining issues. I think that points to the beginnings of some inflation.</p><p>MILLER: Mark, talk to me about the relationship between two-year yields, rising two-year yields and the FX trade because you've written something interesting about this overnight.</p><p>CUDMORE: You know, I mean, I think there can be a bit of divergence going -- going forward in terms of yields and dollar. I don't think that dollar has to track yields all the way up. Like we saw on kind of November last year whether there's a slightly different narrative. I think right now, there are a lot of other headwinds for the dollar, so I think we can get a bit more divergence. The dollar trade might be nearly done to the topside, whereas, the yields can continue to go further, and I think one of those issues is, I actually do believe that we probably will still get a -- a flattening curve.</p><p>I would ask Patrick, I'm interested to know that, you know, given that there's no inflation, if we've got a good growth story, an OK growth story but there's no sign of inflation and we start to buy into the narrative of, you know, what, there are structural disinflationary pressures, why should the curves steepen much? Because this is not a -- a story that they won't be, you know, need an extra risk premium. We know there's too much money out there, there's no sign of inflations, there's no reason to like, hike rates much more aggressively two years down the line. I'm just not sure the curve should steepen much. Even if they hike another couple of times at the front of the curve, and even if they do that with growth remaining strong.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: The way you posed your question, I would agree that wouldn't lead to a steepening of the curve by any means, but I actually do think we're starting to see the early signs that there will be inflationary pressures. You don't get unemployment down below 4 percent, you don't have economic growth where we are with interest rates definitely still very accommodative, I would even characterized them still at emergency levels. I think we've got a very accommodative Fed, it's beginning to take away some of the juice, but I may be old school maybe like a lot of the Fed governors right now that (inaudible).</p><p>JOHNSON: Patrick's (inaudible) believes in the Phillips curve.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: The Phillips curve isn't dead, Phillips curve is still there. Intuitively, it should be there when you have lots of jobs and wage growth, that's going to create demand for goods and that's going to inflate the higher prices. So think we can't see inflation now, but I think the early signs that inflation may be around the corner are there, and I think the Fed will be hiking next year based on inflation that will be there which will mean the curve shouldn't flatten. I don't know if they will steepen, I think it'll be more of a parallel shift up because the Fed will be doing its job hiking appropriately because you got a stronger economy and the beginnings of some inflation.</p><p>MILLER: All right, we'll -- we will say thank you and goodbye to millennial Mark Cudmore, Bloomberg MLive strategist and continue to kick it old school with Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MILLER: Still with us is Patrick Armstrong, CIO at Plurimi Wealth. Just if -- if anyone's curious, I've dug in to the story and found that there is an unwritten rule of retirement at age 68, so you can't become the president after the age 68, at least that's kind of -- that's sort of the unwritten rule there. Patrick, let me ask you what you think about Xi's tenure here and him -- setting himself up. I mean, he has to some extent, changed the face of Chinese socialism to a more capitalist or a more western-facing socialism. Is he made -- has he made China more investable for you?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: We've not changed any of our views on a cyclical basis on anything that's happened in the last few days, I think they're still -- he's putting in macro prudential policy, slowing the housing market. I think what he's positioned himself to do is create a very long-term story which I suppose, we have difficulty in the west, and he'll probably sounding off about the benefits of having a long-term vision and having stability versus the -- the chaos we maybe have with democracy in the west, and equalizing the -- the wealth between the richest urban dwellers and the poorest people in rural areas is a very big important macro tailwind for the Chinese consumer, the Chinese economy, and not only does he not have successors in place, I think this entrenches him in power. If you get rid of that, that's the thing that creates the disharmony that leads to turmoil in countries, and if he does address that, you need to think very long term, and I think he's put himself in position to do that very well.</p><p>MILLER: Has he stabilized the countries around him? I mean, is the rest of EM more investable with Xi in place?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: I've not even thought of that question, it's a good question. Anytime you've got some stability there, it's good for China. China is still the manufacturer for the world, it's becoming less so, focusing much more on its consumer. I don't think it's going to become the consumer for the world the way the U.S. is anytime in the next decade, but eventually, China will become a big purchasing country as well and that'll help flow on in terms of emerging markets, not just importing raw materials, but also goods, I suppose.</p><p>JOHNSON: Are you invested in China? Are you invested in China derivative trade? Do you do it through the metals, do you do it through other areas?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: We've got no positions on in China right now, so at the beginning of the year, we were short renminbi, we closed that in about March, and since then, we've not put investments on -- on equities, you've had this incredible performance from some of the big tech companies there, but the governance is still an issue for us. I don't think we see any signs that we are moving towards an open market by any means. I think he's probably backtracked a little bit about that. I'm even talking about a new era where they're outing in a model that's new custom to China, not just mimicking what the west has already built. So as a minority shareholder, that still creates questions for me.</p><p>JOHNSON: OK. I just want to show you, Patrick, this chart here, I showed it to him in the break, it certainly raised a few eyebrows. This is the State Bank of India this morning, the stock is up massively as you can see. This as we've seen the Indian banks being recapped. They needed it -- they needed to deal with their nonperforming loans, they needed to just get money back into the economy. India, take a step back at (inaudible) emerging markets, there are some big ones out there, India is one of them, China is another one. Kind of, where do you -- do you have to invest in the bigger ones?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: If you're going to invest in emerging markets, I think the bigger ones are the -- the easiest place to look at. We 've got emerging market inflation-linked bonds, so as you can tell from the previous segment, I'm worried about inflation a little bit and I think the epicenter when inflation (inaudible) start, will be emerging market, so that's one place where you -- you do see basically, supply and demand, demand couldn't possibly be going faster than supply coming in to them so, the emerging market inflation bonds, you're getting a real yield of about 3 percent right now which is an equity like risk premium to take some bond-like risk characteristics.</p><p>JOHNSON: Probably a slightly different story, but Argentina just hikes interest rates overnight by a hundred and fifty basis points. Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth is going to be sticking around.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Patrick Armstrong, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth still with us. Patrick, you're long Eurozone banks, industrials, talk to me about the banks first of all. The regulatory environment in Europe is getting tougher, not easier, possibly unlike the United States. They still trade on pretty big book discounts to their -- to their U.S. peers, and -- and theoretically, the European economy looks like it's doing pretty well right now.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: That's exactly our play, we've tried to get into the more cyclical sectors and we think banks and industrials are the two plays that you think we've got a robust recovery in Europe. We think we do, we think the ECB is obviously going to announce a tapering at some point maybe this week or December at latest, and we should see some interest rate margin for the banks as well, so you know, you'd have a double win there where you've got a strong economy and potential for some sort of a yield curve.</p><p>JOHNSON: (inaudible) going out. The problem with banks in Europe is that you scratch the surface and there are problems. You kind of -- and -- and there are not many banks that -- that this doesn't apply to, that you kind of scratch the surface and there's -- there's other management problem, a - - a environment problem. There's always a nonperforming-loan problem. Most banks when you actually come down to at a granular level, have problems.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Most of them do, and we're not in the cheapest banks for that reason, we're in the French banks which are trading 10 times earnings. They don't have a significant amount of bad debts, trading at book value, 4 percent dividend yield, very well capitalized especially versus peers, so we're attracted to cheap assets that's not the cheapest, because I think they've got less issues than you just referred to anyway, on the SocGen, the BNPs.</p><p>MILLER: Do you see -- I mean, there's a great story on the terminal, Patrick, about an ex-Barclays analyst leaving to start his own research firm and of course, not doing that in Europe, MiFID has driven him out. You've got Brexit driving bankers out of the U.K., is there kind of a shakedown here where they're going to be a few winners and a lot of losers?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Well, European banking system probably needs some consolidation. I think that might be a trend that we start to see, but what you're talking about is a theme of basically, David and Goliath. Basically, you've got some big slow-moving banks and that creates opportunities for small, nimble competitors. So I think that's good for the industry. Anytime you do have smaller competitors challenging some the big goliaths, it creates some innovation and efficiencies in order for them to maintain their profit margin, so it is a trend that's likely to be seen because we're very top-heavy on the banks, and they do have a lot of structural issues.</p><p>MILLER: What do you think about national heroes? I mean, Deutsche Bank is one that maybe bit off a little bit more than it could chew, it's being punished -- been punished for that now, but it's unlikely that Germany would let its most important bank fall, so can you buy a dip in a company like that?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Well, I think what you've just said, we agree with a hundred percent, but we don't have any of the equity. We do buy Deutsche Bank bonds, we have some of their subordinated debt. When there's worries about Deutsche Bank, we add to that position because the scenario you just outlined means it's valuable, it's going to be able to pay its debt, but it doesn't attract you as a shareholder necessarily.</p><p>JOHNSON: Where do the bulk of your investors come from because currency seems to be really important in this process about where you invest in the world.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Our investors and our funds?</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: So we've got high net worth around Europe, so predominantly, European (inaudible) Swiss-based, U.K.-based.</p><p>JOHNSON: U.K. -- Swiss-based, U.K.-based.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Those are the two countries where most --</p><p>JOHNSON: OK. Because this -- because this is interesting, if -- if I may, euro investor into sterling, into the FTSE, I've made nothing, nothing this year which is fascinating. If I've invested (inaudible) going to the States, I've only made 2.61 percent versus the S&amp;P 500 which has done nearly 15 percent.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Very much, yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: Do you do this on a non-hedge basis? Do you do this --</p><p>ARMSTRONG: So we've got base currency of our fund which is euro unfortunately because everything as you're just pointing out, when price in euro isn't doing that well, but we offer fully-hedge share classes, so if you buy our fund in euros, that's the base currency, you can buy Swiss francs, sterling, and bully head share class.</p><p>JOHNSON: But does it -- you -- when you go into the States, do you do it on a hedge basis? When you go into the Japan, do you do it on an un-hedge basis? Kind of, how do you --</p><p>ARMSTRONG: (inaudible) investing yet. So if we're buying a telecom company, I'll hedge that into euros quite often because that -- that's currency (inaudible). If I'm buying a multinational company, probably won't hedge that because you're getting foreign revenues coming in that way, so --</p><p>JOHNSON: So it's whether (inaudible) a domestic -- if it's got a domestic focus, you will -- you will hedge that, (inaudible) you got the currency risk, but if -- if the company already effectively is doing it for you, then it doesn't really matter.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: It's (inaudible) but exactly, you're getting the benefit if you've got a weak dollar, if things are priced in dollar, it's got foreign revenues coming in, so you get a bit of a natural hedge that way on multinationals.</p><p>JOHNSON: Interesting stuff. You can see this really clearly, guys. Go to the WEI screen, and you'll see the options, you can change the currency on the right-hand side of the screen. Patrick Armstrong, thank you very much indeed, the CIO of Plurimi Wealth Management, he's going to be joining our radio team live on London DAB Digital.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Facebook also published a white paper on the subject.</p><p>The PR broadside was launched as Zuckerberg visited Brussels for talks with the European Commission ahead of the unveiling of new EU rules on data protection and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). &amp; I believe good regulation may hurt Facebook's business in the near term but it will be better for everyone, including us, over the long term,&amp; he writes in the FT.</p><p>That is an understatement. Zuckerberg has good reason to fear the EU's strict privacy regulations, the general data protection regulation (GDPR).</p><p>The penalties for violations are potentially huge: the EU can levy fines of 4% of annual global revenue, which has been calculated as up to $1.6bn for Facebook. When GDPR was implemented in May 2018, Facebook shifted two-thirds of its then users (1.5-billion) from its European base in Ireland back to California.</p><p>European legislators, unlike their US counterparts, are not sympathetic to US tech giants. They see them, quite rightly, as tax dodgers and piracy abusers. Extremely beneficial tax structures in Ireland have long been a bone of contention for the EU, which has ordered the likes of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft to pay real tax rates. These tax dodges, though seemingly legitimate and within an individual country's laws, have allowed these Big Tech firms to pay tiny amounts of tax - something the EU thinks should not be allowed. If a foreign firm is earning billions off a country's citizens, it should be paying the correct amount of tax. Can't really argue with that.</p><p>But what Zuckerberg - whose company makes its income from advertising and knowing its customers' likes, dislikes and other intimate details - is trying to do is pre-empt tighter regulation and get as good a deal for Facebook as he can.</p><p>He's not the only one. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google's holding company, Alphabet, was in Brussels in January on a similar lobbying mission focused on the new rules for AI.</p><p>Zuckerberg is spot on when he writes, &amp; people need to feel that global technology platforms answer to someone&amp; He argues that what Facebook wants &amp; isn't about passing off responsibility&amp; but that is all it has done since its various scandals, such as the one involving Cambridge Analytica, broke. Zuckerberg insists he's ultimately responsible, but he never does anything about it.</p><p>This might be the first time we're hearing this line of argument from companies that profit from our personal data, but it won't be the last.</p><p>Shapshak is editor-in-chief and publisher of Stuff magazine (stuff.co.za)</p><p>European legislators, unlike in the US, are not sympathetic to US tech giants</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLFM-FMfmFM2002fxTrending</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLFM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y80-8G91-DYT4-K1J7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"521\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

Does that actually change the economy if -- not about the market sell-off,  but if you're really starting question these big tech companies?</p><p>PAUL DONOVAN, GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST, UBS: No. I think the -- I mean, the  thing is, of course, that tech is far more important to the market than it  is to the real world, and economists live in a real world whereas people  like Tim --</p><p>LACQUA: (Inaudible) applications, Paul, but continue, please.</p><p>DONOVAN: So -- but the issue here is that the role of tech in terms of  employment, in terms of generating economic growth, it doesn't matter  nearly as much to the economy as it does to the market. But I think there's  an interesting question here that if we go back two, three, four years, the  digital anarchists where they're saying, well, tech is above government.  Governments don't matter anymore. Technology is all that matters. And what  I think we're discovering or rediscovering is, actually, you know what,  governments do matter. And technology companies are just like any other  company. They don't have some kind of super power. They are going to be  regulated, they are going to be subject to government interference, and  that realization, I think, in a broader sense, combined with the fact that  in the United States, we have a less predictable government, perhaps this  is creating a shift in terms of risk.</p><p>LACQUA: Well, joining us now for more, Guy Stear, Head of Fixed Income  Research at SocGen. Paul Donovan from UBS is still with us. So, Guy,  welcome to the program. Paul, thank you so much for sticking around. Paul,  when you look at global growth, it's fine, it's rosy, it's better than  expected according to the IMF. And then you have these trade tensions. How  much of a worry is that, that actually they're going to be the catalyst or  the fear in the markets for the next recession?</p><p>DONOVAN: So I think we've got a couple of issues here. So the first point  is that a lot of the global growth that we're seeing is domestic-led. So  it's not really synchronized global growth. It's what I'd call simultaneous  global growth. So the U.S. consumer is alive and well and sort of not  necessarily in a shopping mall but at least online spending money. The  European consumer is showing signs of revival. In Southeast Asia, domestic  demand is picking up. So you've got independent growth stories coming  through. And the second thing is that, so far, the trade tensions are  basically noise. We're not in a trade war. We're nowhere near a trade war.  I mean, Trump has just reversed two-thirds of the tax on steel and one-half  of the tax on aluminum by giving exemptions to anybody that matters. So  we're moving away from the spin of Twitter and so on, so the substance  isn't that damaging.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you agree with that, Guy, that, overall, you're pretty confident  about the future?</p><p>GUY STEAR, HEAD EM &amp; CREDIT RESEARCH, SOCIETE GENERALE: I think the nearer  future, yes. I mean, I think a lot of the things that Paul has mentioned  are absolutely correct. My concerns would be more on the profit side in  terms of the U.S., maybe six to nine months out. One of the things that I  see in the profit data in the U.S. is that corporate cash generation has  been low relative to nominal -- relative to net income for the past nine  months. And that's typically a sign that companies are building up their  receivables, so they're having to offer better terms to their end clients  in order to get sales done. So, effectively, they're moving inventories  from their warehouses to their client's warehouses. And that to me is  always a sign that we end up seeing revenues begin to decline for these  companies. So I do have some concern particularly about the U.S. profit  cycle as we head into the second half of the year.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, talking about inflation, so I don't know whether -- if you  look at inflation dynamics in the U.S. and we go back to wage growth, is it  that there are too monopolies so people are concerned or usually get a wage  raise if you change company, right? So that's difficult to do. Or whether  they're still not confident enough about their future to (inaudible) pay  rise?</p><p>DONOVAN: But we are getting pay increases. So we're seeing --</p><p>LACQUA: A little bit.</p><p>DONOVAN: Well, we're seeing about 3% pay rise on the Atlanta Fed Wage  Tracker, which is the only reliable thing. Average early earnings should  not be published in my view. But the wage tracker is a decent index around  about 3% growth. But that may actually be understating what's going on.  Because what we've also had is a rise of self-employment and self- employment income growth doesn't necessarily show up as wage growth. You  may be paying yourself a dividend instead. And this has been one of the big  things in the U.K. where we do have some data on this which has shown that  the U.K. consumer is actually far better resourced than previously thought  because of the self-employment issue. So I don't think it's necessarily  that we're seeing weakness in the labor market or weakness in the ability  to get pay rises through. And when we look at the Beige Book, for example,  that keeps reporting that companies are paying sign-on bonuses, they're  having to do more to attract people to come and work for them, which is  really indicative of a late market, which at least, in certain factors, has  become quite tight and where we are seeing some labor cost pressures  creeping in.</p><p>LACQUA: And, Guy, what have we heard from J. Powell? So he's looking on it.  He is reliant is how I interpret it, but maybe wrong on models, right, and  on theory and wants to look at the economy. Does it not mean that there's a  danger that the fed is actually behind the curve?</p><p>STEAR: Well, I think this is really the point that, as Paul was mentioning,  we are seeing a beginning sort of incipient signs of -- maybe even more  than incipient signs of underlying inflation pressures. There needs to be  response from central banks. Globally, the fed is definitely the lead in  terms of global central banks. That means that pressure on the front end of  the curve definitely as people start to factor in those anticipations or  continue to factor in those anticipations so the five-year area of the U.S.  curve can still go higher. And we can still see steepening in the two  slides area of the U.S. curve. Where the risk is more, I think, when you  look beyond the five-year area of the curve and even though we've got more  supply coming into the market, I think people are going to start to be more  concerned about the more medium-term growth story. So it could be the case  that we see the U.S. curve actually flattening from beyond the five-year  area. And while we're all very focused on the ten-year area of the curve,  that can give a slightly deceptive picture because different parts of the  U.S. curve and global credit curve -- credit -- sorry, rate curves will be  doing different things.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, this is my chart and it goes back to what Guy is saying. It's  basically -- you can see the curve collapse and this is a spread between 5  and 30-year treasuries.</p><p>DONOVAN: Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: What does this tell us? Where does it go next?</p><p>DONOVAN: It tells that there's a spread between 5 and 30-year treasuries --</p><p>LACQUA: That's collapsing.</p><p>DONOVAN: -- that is collapsing. I am increasingly skeptical about the value  of the shape of the yield curve as an economic indicator. Back in the 70's  when inflation dominates the bond markets and when inflation is closely  correlated with the economic cycle, then you would expect the shape of the  yield curve to tell something about whether you're going economically up or  economically down. But that's not what happens now. Inflation is not the  dominant part of a bond yield. The real yield plays a significant role far  more than it used to. And inflation is not quite so positively correlated  with the economic cycle for various reasons around its calculation and so  forth. So we take those factors into account and then you add in the fact  that bond markets are basically rigged, that you have regulation --</p><p>LACQUA: Rigged by central banks?</p><p>DONOVAN: Well, regulation forcing investors to buy bonds. And, yes, Powell  can't wake up one morning and think, you know what, I'm going to move out  of treasuries and into equities, because the fed can't buy equities, it's  illegal. Most central banks can't buy equities. Swiss are an exception, but  that's basically a hedge fund. And so what they're doing is creating a  captive demand for the market, which is a distortion. It has to be a  distortion. Think about the gilt market for most of the last 30 years with  generally an inverted curve, again, because of pension regulation, creating  captive investors. So I am not so sure that in the modern world, the  information content of the bond yield curve is what it was back in the 70's  or the early 80's when we were in a far higher inflation environment and  when yields were perhaps an indication of economic expectations.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you both. We'll have plenty more. I love the idea  that actually the Swiss National Bank is somehow a hedge fund. I'm sure the  governor would love that. We'll get back to Guy and Paul.</p><p>Guy Stear from Societe Generale and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management  are still with us. Paul, I don't know whether this means -- so you're in  the White House and President Trump or the administration, and you see --  so the Chinese leadership leaning with North Korea, and you say, okay, so I  need actually to keep China on the side, so whether they go a little bit  easier on the tariffs.</p><p>DONOVAN: I think it's unlikely at this stage. I think there is a clear view  in the administration particularly with Bolton coming in, but you're going  aggressive and aggression gets results. So I'm not sure that that would  necessarily be seen as being part of this process. Now, we've had the spin,  the big announcement on the tariffs, and we're going to find out what Good  Samaritan consumers are going to be taxed on at some point in the next week  or so. And I think after that, then there may be a dialing back. But that's  nothing to do with Korea. That's just -- this is what we get all the time.  First, you make the big announcement, you get lots of American steel  workers applauding and then you reverse everything that you previously said  you were going to do. So I think that pattern will reassert itself. But  it's not about the Korean issue at the moment.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you so much. Guy Stear there, Head of FI Research  at Societe Generale, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management, both stay  with us.</p><p>Guy Stear from Societe Generale and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management  are still with us. Guy, you look at emerging markets. You focus on this day  in, day out. Does the inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the Footsie Russell  change anything at all?</p><p>STEAR: Well, I think it's important in terms of the share of mind that  Saudi Arabia gets from global investors. Whether it has a big impact in  terms of equity, money flows, we'll have to wait and see. I think the focus  is a little bit more on the debt because as you're well aware, Saudi Arabia  has done a couple of big issues in the past couple of years. What we have  really been waiting for in terms of emerging market debt is more issues by  the Gulf banks in general. And I think in this sense, you could see more  opportunities for issuance in terms of the dollar market coming out of the  region particularly from banks.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Does it change? I mean, what needs to happen in Saudi Arabia  for investors to go back in? I mean, they had a very successful PIF forum,  I heard a lot of chatter in the markets that they were willing to go back  in Saudi Arabia, that this was going to be a different market and then you  had a crackdown and the people imprisoned at the Ritz, and that kind of  changed investor's views completely.</p><p>STEAR: Well, I think there is political risk but I think there're also  opportunities in terms of the region. And I think investors need to balance  the two together, one off against the other. Particularly in the debt  markets, when you look at Saudi Arabia or you look at the Gulf in general  compared to the other alternatives in emerging markets, it's high quality  with high ratings, and so I suppose less risks than there might in some  other sectors, and I suppose, in that sense, it's a draw. And I think you  get a similar idea from the inclusion to the equity indices that you really  start to compare it with the other alternatives, and in that sense, it can  be something which people find attractive.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, what's your take on Saudi Arabia?</p><p>DONOVAN: So I think the global issue for Saudi at the moment is with oil,  where it is. They're still running the budget deficit, we had the VAT  increase at the start of the year, and three days later, they're raising  the pay for the army. So they have not tackled that specifically. And what  matters to me as an economist then is, well, how do Saudi finance this. And  the repatriation flow that we've been sitting over the last 18 months. I  mean, some have sold about $100 billion last year of overseas assets, they  bring the money back. What that means to me is not only have we then lost a  key supporter of the dollar, but the key supporter of the dollar has  actually turned into a sell-out because most of Saudi's assets have tended  to be in dollar assets. If they're repatriating to finance their domestic  fiscal position, this is creating a negative flow for the dollar by the  time when U.S. needs to be borrowing more from the rest of the world.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Paul and Guy, thank you so much. Guy Stear there, Head  of Research at Societe Generale, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth  Management, and we'll be talking a little bit about luxury and Italian  reform next.</p><p>LACQUA: Joining us now is Michele Norsa, Industrial Partner at Fondo  Strategico, former Ferragamo Chief Executive, as well as current Board  Member of Rocco Forte Hotels and Ermenegildo Zegna, just as a couple of  examples. Paul Donovan from UBS is also still with us. So, Paul, thank you  so much for sticking around. Michele, welcome to the program. So last time  we saw each other was actually overlooking the coliseum in Rome, and this  was after the elections, straight after the elections. What have we learned  in the last month? Italian politics is difficult but is the economy strong  enough to withhold it?</p><p>MICHELE NORSA, INDUSTRIAL PARTNER, FSI SGR SPA: I think that (inaudible)  have surprises. When I was there in Rome on March 5th with just had the  first result, and they were saying that it was worst possible situation. In  fact, it is proving to be a situation where, anyhow, a majority will be  very thin, it is not a big chance to have a government with a strong  majority. But there have been two important steps. One, the change in both  Five Start and the League because they have started working on programs,  they have been able to elect the Head of Senate and Chamber in 48 hours and  they seem to be much more flexible than people expected. This doesn't mean  that this alliance is going to be done. There are still other alternatives.  The second point is nobody wants to vote again, mostly the members. Two- third of the members are new, so they want at least to stay there one year.  But if they can, they will stay even longer. So there will be possibly  majorities are also very afraid (ph), but based on 30, 40, 50 votes, when  it is secured, which can move from one side to another.</p><p>LACQUA: But, Michele Norsa, this is a point that we were making at the day  after the election is, first, what do Chief Executives want. So do they  need reforms, maybe more labor, do they need the banks dealt with? And  actually, is there a huge difference between what Chief Executives want and  what the person on the street want? Because actually there was a recovery  in Italy, but a lot of the people on the streets don't feel it.</p><p>NORSA: The bane risk is the volatility because we have no history about  these parties and these people, they have never managed the -- not even a  city or a region, in some regions, the League in the north. But it is very  difficult to predict. I think there is a lack of economies, there is a lack  of people with strong political history, international relationship  network, this is going to miss. On the other side, you have a feeling that  the new has more energy, is moving faster and is also changing faster. So  the whole piece (ph), they can adapt to a situation, maybe get some  injection from outside of high profile people, not for technical  government, but I think a government with some injection of know-how and  seniority.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, let me bring you over to my chart. This is a ten-year and we  actually chart it. So this is the Italian ten-year compared to the Spanish  ten-year. Is this the right one to look at or do you chart it next to  Germany? What's fair to compare it with?</p><p>DONOVAN: I think given that we're also looking to the ECB to be ending its  bond buying program at some point before the end of this year. It's  probably better to be looking against Spain. Because, obviously, the  trouble with comparing the ten-year against Germany is the ten-year Germany  is distorted very much by the ECB's bond buying program, whereas it tends  to be a shorter dated Italian and Spanish bonds that are bought by the ECB.  So I think that this is probably a better indication. But basically, I  think, what that chart is saying is most Italian debt is owned by Italians.  And Italians are relatively used to political uncertainty. As you were  probably (ph) mentioning it, they have quite a lot of experience of  political uncertainty --</p><p>LACQUA: Well, a lot of governments for sure.</p><p>DONOVAN: -- a lot of governments over the last 70 years. So I don't think  Italian investors are panicked about what is happening in this, and there's  a reason for them to panic at this stage. And as a result, we've got some  reaction in the bond market, but it's hardly an abnormal reaction compared  to recent history.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. I guess, Michele Norsa, you said on many boards and a lot of  them are hospitality or luxury. But these are companies that are doing very  well because they're looking abroad, right? Is the Italian consumer  consuming?</p><p>NORSA: This is the point. I think that the Italian economy is growing  because of export and because of tourism. Tourism, there is not much  attention, but tourism is as big as fashion and food together. And this is  potentially an area of development. Luxury is not suffering that much  because, in fact, you have a distribution worldwide for nobody (ph) for  companies like Ferragamo. They represent 10%, not more, and so you can  compensate with other markets doing better. The concern is I think with the  duties. It could take as to an increase in prices, because at the end,  everybody will increase. Nobody decreases. So if you have to compensate,  then you to align the prices. And you always align going up and not going  down. And this could be also a negative influence on the inflation, for  example, in some country. But the market is still doing -- it's not the  growth that we were used to. It would be a more selective growth. But there  is still room for geographical expansion, for perimeter, and there's room  for diversification. The point is that the companies will clearly separate  winners and losers. It's not as it used to be. So the potential is quite  different. If you look at the single shares, you will see how these two  groups are moving.</p><p>LACQUA: Michele Norsa, would you worry -- if you're a Chief Executive today  from a luxury brand, and we'll talk about luxury in a second, do you worry  about your supply chain because of the noise on tariffs and trade?</p><p>NORSA: No. Honestly, I think that the luxury supply chain is quite unique.  You cannot change. If you go down to mass (ph) market or sportswear, you  have alternatives. But if you want to stay luxury at France, Italy, mostly  France, okay, you can do a (inaudible) in Spain, you can go there. But  you'll never go to a different because the quality and the perception of a  customer is the value. If you change the supply chain, then you lose your  soul.</p><p>LACQUA: Thank you so much. Michele Norsa there, former Chief Executive at  Ferragamo, now, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico, and Paul Donovan  from UBS Wealth Management, both stay with us.</p><p>Michele Norsa, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico and former Ferragamo  Chief Executive, and Paul Donovan from UBS are both still with us. Michele  Norsa, when you look at, I guess, how people consume luxury online, what's  more important for a Chief Executive to get it right? So the online or  actually how the Chinese consume?</p><p>NORSA: They are both important. I think it's easier to grow the Chinese  consumption because they are growing by number, they are growing by  welfare, they growing by traveling. And so it's something which is moving  with an organic -- on an organic trend. Online has always been surprising,  some time in a good sense but mostly in a negative. Everybody expected ten  years ago that now there would be more than 10% of luxury both online,  which has happened in the United States already, it's close to happen in  the U.K., but globally still, you're talking about mid single-digit. And  most companies are not even disclosing the number yet in their balance  sheet.</p><p>LACQUA: Are you expecting that to pick up or is it just because of touch  and feel? And also when you spend o1,000 or o2,000 for a dress or suit, you  want to touch it.</p><p>NORSA: This is the reason and, of course, in the United States, they are  more used in receiving, sending back, receiving, sending back, which is not  as easy in other countries, for example, in China. But I think one risk  which is an older technology is, really, the brand evolution. So if you  look at the online operators of maybe the five, six companies which are  dealing with luxury goods, they always have a trend, a perception as a  discounting offers, special sales. Plus you have seen the problem of a  counterfeit or fake or other brands, production of other brands mostly in  Asia and China. So companies are still very cautious in moving massively  towards the online. I was reading yesterday, there is a prediction which is  -- which I don't believe earlier is from a big (ph) company who says, by  2025, online business could be 25%. I don't see this kind of growth because  companies are getting more cautious, they're trying to get the online  business inside, not to deal with counterparts, which are unreliable  sometimes, totally unreliable like in Asia.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, this was also translated also into your world, right, and how  you look at economics and trying to figure out shopping habits in the  future.</p><p>DONOVAN: So one of the things that I think is coming out as part of the  fourth industrial revolution concept is, in many ways, we're sort of  reinventing the first industrial revolution which brought in for the very  first time shopping a leisure activity just like Wedgwood (ph) was really  basically created shopping as a leisure activity. And I think that's  something which we're now seeing. So with luxury, if you're shopping for  luxury, for the most part, this is a leisure activity, this is a special  occasion. You go to a store, you have very sales staff who are very helpful  and you buy something special, whereas if I'm doing the weekly shop for  cleaning equipment for home and laundry detergent, this is not quite such a  special experience for me and far more likely to do that online. And I  think this division is going to be quite important. And it sort of  emphasizes one of the key things about the fourth industrial revolution and  this fear that we're all going to be replaced by robots and so on. That's  not necessarily the case because you want the personal experience of being  helped by a sales assistant in the store if you're buying luxury, you want  the human interaction. You don't want an unanimous -- please click here and  enter your credit card number if you're going for the luxury experience. So  I think that this is, in many ways, symptomatic of what is happening in the  broader economy that we're going to see this gravitation towards online  retail for regular growth sort of mundane shopping, but then shopping as a  leisure experience perhaps reaching yet another level as it did in the late  1700's</p><p>NORSA: And there is also another distinction. Local people are more  attracted in some countries, like the United States and China, which are  very (inaudible) to buy online because they cannot reach your store. But  travelers, they really travel for the pleasure of spending time at  (inaudible) Zegna, at Ferragamo and Valentino. It is a pleasure to get  there. You'll see things you don't find in online. So I think there will be  a development of the online business specializing really in luxury. When  they ask me Amazon could be difficult to think.</p><p>DONOVAN: And I think also there are -- some consumers will have a different  experience as well. Some consumers regard luxury almost as being like  shopping to (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Guys, thank you so much. Michele Norsa there, former Ferragamo, and  Paul Donovan from UBS.

Does that actually change the economy if -- not about the market sell-off, but if you're really starting question these big tech companies?</p><p>PAUL DONOVAN, GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST, UBS: No. I think the -- I mean, the thing is, of course, that tech is far more important to the market than it is to the real world, and economists live in a real world whereas people like Tim --</p><p>LACQUA: (Inaudible) applications, Paul, but continue, please.</p><p>DONOVAN: So -- but the issue here is that the role of tech in terms of employment, in terms of generating economic growth, it doesn't matter nearly as much to the economy as it does to the market. But I think there's an interesting question here that if we go back two, three, four years, the digital anarchists where they're saying, well, tech is above government. Governments don't matter anymore. Technology is all that matters. And what I think we're discovering or rediscovering is, actually, you know what, governments do matter. And technology companies are just like any other company. They don't have some kind of super power. They are going to be regulated, they are going to be subject to government interference, and that realization, I think, in a broader sense, combined with the fact that in the United States, we have a less predictable government, perhaps this is creating a shift in terms of risk.</p><p>LACQUA: Well, joining us now for more, Guy Stear, Head of Fixed Income Research at SocGen. Paul Donovan from UBS is still with us. So, Guy, welcome to the program. Paul, thank you so much for sticking around. Paul, when you look at global growth, it's fine, it's rosy, it's better than expected according to the IMF. And then you have these trade tensions. How much of a worry is that, that actually they're going to be the catalyst or the fear in the markets for the next recession?</p><p>DONOVAN: So I think we've got a couple of issues here. So the first point is that a lot of the global growth that we're seeing is domestic-led. So it's not really synchronized global growth. It's what I'd call simultaneous global growth. So the U.S. consumer is alive and well and sort of not necessarily in a shopping mall but at least online spending money. The European consumer is showing signs of revival. In Southeast Asia, domestic demand is picking up. So you've got independent growth stories coming through. And the second thing is that, so far, the trade tensions are basically noise. We're not in a trade war. We're nowhere near a trade war. I mean, Trump has just reversed two-thirds of the tax on steel and one-half of the tax on aluminum by giving exemptions to anybody that matters. So we're moving away from the spin of Twitter and so on, so the substance isn't that damaging.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you agree with that, Guy, that, overall, you're pretty confident about the future?</p><p>GUY STEAR, HEAD EM &amp; CREDIT RESEARCH, SOCIETE GENERALE: I think the nearer future, yes. I mean, I think a lot of the things that Paul has mentioned are absolutely correct. My concerns would be more on the profit side in terms of the U.S., maybe six to nine months out. One of the things that I see in the profit data in the U.S. is that corporate cash generation has been low relative to nominal -- relative to net income for the past nine months. And that's typically a sign that companies are building up their receivables, so they're having to offer better terms to their end clients in order to get sales done. So, effectively, they're moving inventories from their warehouses to their client's warehouses. And that to me is always a sign that we end up seeing revenues begin to decline for these companies. So I do have some concern particularly about the U.S. profit cycle as we head into the second half of the year.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, talking about inflation, so I don't know whether -- if you look at inflation dynamics in the U.S. and we go back to wage growth, is it that there are too monopolies so people are concerned or usually get a wage raise if you change company, right? So that's difficult to do. Or whether they're still not confident enough about their future to (inaudible) pay rise?</p><p>DONOVAN: But we are getting pay increases. So we're seeing --</p><p>LACQUA: A little bit.</p><p>DONOVAN: Well, we're seeing about 3% pay rise on the Atlanta Fed Wage Tracker, which is the only reliable thing. Average early earnings should not be published in my view. But the wage tracker is a decent index around about 3% growth. But that may actually be understating what's going on. Because what we've also had is a rise of self-employment and self- employment income growth doesn't necessarily show up as wage growth. You may be paying yourself a dividend instead. And this has been one of the big things in the U.K. where we do have some data on this which has shown that the U.K. consumer is actually far better resourced than previously thought because of the self-employment issue. So I don't think it's necessarily that we're seeing weakness in the labor market or weakness in the ability to get pay rises through. And when we look at the Beige Book, for example, that keeps reporting that companies are paying sign-on bonuses, they're having to do more to attract people to come and work for them, which is really indicative of a late market, which at least, in certain factors, has become quite tight and where we are seeing some labor cost pressures creeping in.</p><p>LACQUA: And, Guy, what have we heard from J. Powell? So he's looking on it. He is reliant is how I interpret it, but maybe wrong on models, right, and on theory and wants to look at the economy. Does it not mean that there's a danger that the fed is actually behind the curve?</p><p>STEAR: Well, I think this is really the point that, as Paul was mentioning, we are seeing a beginning sort of incipient signs of -- maybe even more than incipient signs of underlying inflation pressures. There needs to be response from central banks. Globally, the fed is definitely the lead in terms of global central banks. That means that pressure on the front end of the curve definitely as people start to factor in those anticipations or continue to factor in those anticipations so the five-year area of the U.S. curve can still go higher. And we can still see steepening in the two slides area of the U.S. curve. Where the risk is more, I think, when you look beyond the five-year area of the curve and even though we've got more supply coming into the market, I think people are going to start to be more concerned about the more medium-term growth story. So it could be the case that we see the U.S. curve actually flattening from beyond the five-year area. And while we're all very focused on the ten-year area of the curve, that can give a slightly deceptive picture because different parts of the U.S. curve and global credit curve -- credit -- sorry, rate curves will be doing different things.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, this is my chart and it goes back to what Guy is saying. It's basically -- you can see the curve collapse and this is a spread between 5 and 30-year treasuries.</p><p>DONOVAN: Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: What does this tell us? Where does it go next?</p><p>DONOVAN: It tells that there's a spread between 5 and 30-year treasuries --</p><p>LACQUA: That's collapsing.</p><p>DONOVAN: -- that is collapsing. I am increasingly skeptical about the value of the shape of the yield curve as an economic indicator. Back in the 70's when inflation dominates the bond markets and when inflation is closely correlated with the economic cycle, then you would expect the shape of the yield curve to tell something about whether you're going economically up or economically down. But that's not what happens now. Inflation is not the dominant part of a bond yield. The real yield plays a significant role far more than it used to. And inflation is not quite so positively correlated with the economic cycle for various reasons around its calculation and so forth. So we take those factors into account and then you add in the fact that bond markets are basically rigged, that you have regulation --</p><p>LACQUA: Rigged by central banks?</p><p>DONOVAN: Well, regulation forcing investors to buy bonds. And, yes, Powell can't wake up one morning and think, you know what, I'm going to move out of treasuries and into equities, because the fed can't buy equities, it's illegal. Most central banks can't buy equities. Swiss are an exception, but that's basically a hedge fund. And so what they're doing is creating a captive demand for the market, which is a distortion. It has to be a distortion. Think about the gilt market for most of the last 30 years with generally an inverted curve, again, because of pension regulation, creating captive investors. So I am not so sure that in the modern world, the information content of the bond yield curve is what it was back in the 70's or the early 80's when we were in a far higher inflation environment and when yields were perhaps an indication of economic expectations.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you both. We'll have plenty more. I love the idea that actually the Swiss National Bank is somehow a hedge fund. I'm sure the governor would love that. We'll get back to Guy and Paul.</p><p>Guy Stear from Societe Generale and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management are still with us. Paul, I don't know whether this means -- so you're in the White House and President Trump or the administration, and you see -- so the Chinese leadership leaning with North Korea, and you say, okay, so I need actually to keep China on the side, so whether they go a little bit easier on the tariffs.</p><p>DONOVAN: I think it's unlikely at this stage. I think there is a clear view in the administration particularly with Bolton coming in, but you're going aggressive and aggression gets results. So I'm not sure that that would necessarily be seen as being part of this process. Now, we've had the spin, the big announcement on the tariffs, and we're going to find out what Good Samaritan consumers are going to be taxed on at some point in the next week or so. And I think after that, then there may be a dialing back. But that's nothing to do with Korea. That's just -- this is what we get all the time. First, you make the big announcement, you get lots of American steel workers applauding and then you reverse everything that you previously said you were going to do. So I think that pattern will reassert itself. But it's not about the Korean issue at the moment.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you so much. Guy Stear there, Head of FI Research at Societe Generale, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management, both stay with us.</p><p>Guy Stear from Societe Generale and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management are still with us. Guy, you look at emerging markets. You focus on this day in, day out. Does the inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the Footsie Russell change anything at all?</p><p>STEAR: Well, I think it's important in terms of the share of mind that Saudi Arabia gets from global investors. Whether it has a big impact in terms of equity, money flows, we'll have to wait and see. I think the focus is a little bit more on the debt because as you're well aware, Saudi Arabia has done a couple of big issues in the past couple of years. What we have really been waiting for in terms of emerging market debt is more issues by the Gulf banks in general. And I think in this sense, you could see more opportunities for issuance in terms of the dollar market coming out of the region particularly from banks.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Does it change? I mean, what needs to happen in Saudi Arabia for investors to go back in? I mean, they had a very successful PIF forum, I heard a lot of chatter in the markets that they were willing to go back in Saudi Arabia, that this was going to be a different market and then you had a crackdown and the people imprisoned at the Ritz, and that kind of changed investor's views completely.</p><p>STEAR: Well, I think there is political risk but I think there're also opportunities in terms of the region. And I think investors need to balance the two together, one off against the other. Particularly in the debt markets, when you look at Saudi Arabia or you look at the Gulf in general compared to the other alternatives in emerging markets, it's high quality with high ratings, and so I suppose less risks than there might in some other sectors, and I suppose, in that sense, it's a draw. And I think you get a similar idea from the inclusion to the equity indices that you really start to compare it with the other alternatives, and in that sense, it can be something which people find attractive.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, what's your take on Saudi Arabia?</p><p>DONOVAN: So I think the global issue for Saudi at the moment is with oil, where it is. They're still running the budget deficit, we had the VAT increase at the start of the year, and three days later, they're raising the pay for the army. So they have not tackled that specifically. And what matters to me as an economist then is, well, how do Saudi finance this. And the repatriation flow that we've been sitting over the last 18 months. I mean, some have sold about $100 billion last year of overseas assets, they bring the money back. What that means to me is not only have we then lost a key supporter of the dollar, but the key supporter of the dollar has actually turned into a sell-out because most of Saudi's assets have tended to be in dollar assets. If they're repatriating to finance their domestic fiscal position, this is creating a negative flow for the dollar by the time when U.S. needs to be borrowing more from the rest of the world.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Paul and Guy, thank you so much. Guy Stear there, Head of Research at Societe Generale, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management, and we'll be talking a little bit about luxury and Italian reform next.</p><p>LACQUA: Joining us now is Michele Norsa, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico, former Ferragamo Chief Executive, as well as current Board Member of Rocco Forte Hotels and Ermenegildo Zegna, just as a couple of examples. Paul Donovan from UBS is also still with us. So, Paul, thank you so much for sticking around. Michele, welcome to the program. So last time we saw each other was actually overlooking the coliseum in Rome, and this was after the elections, straight after the elections. What have we learned in the last month? Italian politics is difficult but is the economy strong enough to withhold it?</p><p>MICHELE NORSA, INDUSTRIAL PARTNER, FSI SGR SPA: I think that (inaudible) have surprises. When I was there in Rome on March 5th with just had the first result, and they were saying that it was worst possible situation. In fact, it is proving to be a situation where, anyhow, a majority will be very thin, it is not a big chance to have a government with a strong majority. But there have been two important steps. One, the change in both Five Start and the League because they have started working on programs, they have been able to elect the Head of Senate and Chamber in 48 hours and they seem to be much more flexible than people expected. This doesn't mean that this alliance is going to be done. There are still other alternatives. The second point is nobody wants to vote again, mostly the members. Two- third of the members are new, so they want at least to stay there one year. But if they can, they will stay even longer. So there will be possibly majorities are also very afraid (ph), but based on 30, 40, 50 votes, when it is secured, which can move from one side to another.</p><p>LACQUA: But, Michele Norsa, this is a point that we were making at the day after the election is, first, what do Chief Executives want. So do they need reforms, maybe more labor, do they need the banks dealt with? And actually, is there a huge difference between what Chief Executives want and what the person on the street want? Because actually there was a recovery in Italy, but a lot of the people on the streets don't feel it.</p><p>NORSA: The bane risk is the volatility because we have no history about these parties and these people, they have never managed the -- not even a city or a region, in some regions, the League in the north. But it is very difficult to predict. I think there is a lack of economies, there is a lack of people with strong political history, international relationship network, this is going to miss. On the other side, you have a feeling that the new has more energy, is moving faster and is also changing faster. So the whole piece (ph), they can adapt to a situation, maybe get some injection from outside of high profile people, not for technical government, but I think a government with some injection of know-how and seniority.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, let me bring you over to my chart. This is a ten-year and we actually chart it. So this is the Italian ten-year compared to the Spanish ten-year. Is this the right one to look at or do you chart it next to Germany? What's fair to compare it with?</p><p>DONOVAN: I think given that we're also looking to the ECB to be ending its bond buying program at some point before the end of this year. It's probably better to be looking against Spain. Because, obviously, the trouble with comparing the ten-year against Germany is the ten-year Germany is distorted very much by the ECB's bond buying program, whereas it tends to be a shorter dated Italian and Spanish bonds that are bought by the ECB. So I think that this is probably a better indication. But basically, I think, what that chart is saying is most Italian debt is owned by Italians. And Italians are relatively used to political uncertainty. As you were probably (ph) mentioning it, they have quite a lot of experience of political uncertainty --</p><p>LACQUA: Well, a lot of governments for sure.</p><p>DONOVAN: -- a lot of governments over the last 70 years. So I don't think Italian investors are panicked about what is happening in this, and there's a reason for them to panic at this stage. And as a result, we've got some reaction in the bond market, but it's hardly an abnormal reaction compared to recent history.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. I guess, Michele Norsa, you said on many boards and a lot of them are hospitality or luxury. But these are companies that are doing very well because they're looking abroad, right? Is the Italian consumer consuming?</p><p>NORSA: This is the point. I think that the Italian economy is growing because of export and because of tourism. Tourism, there is not much attention, but tourism is as big as fashion and food together. And this is potentially an area of development. Luxury is not suffering that much because, in fact, you have a distribution worldwide for nobody (ph) for companies like Ferragamo. They represent 10%, not more, and so you can compensate with other markets doing better. The concern is I think with the duties. It could take as to an increase in prices, because at the end, everybody will increase. Nobody decreases. So if you have to compensate, then you to align the prices. And you always align going up and not going down. And this could be also a negative influence on the inflation, for example, in some country. But the market is still doing -- it's not the growth that we were used to. It would be a more selective growth. But there is still room for geographical expansion, for perimeter, and there's room for diversification. The point is that the companies will clearly separate winners and losers. It's not as it used to be. So the potential is quite different. If you look at the single shares, you will see how these two groups are moving.</p><p>LACQUA: Michele Norsa, would you worry -- if you're a Chief Executive today from a luxury brand, and we'll talk about luxury in a second, do you worry about your supply chain because of the noise on tariffs and trade?</p><p>NORSA: No. Honestly, I think that the luxury supply chain is quite unique. You cannot change. If you go down to mass (ph) market or sportswear, you have alternatives. But if you want to stay luxury at France, Italy, mostly France, okay, you can do a (inaudible) in Spain, you can go there. But you'll never go to a different because the quality and the perception of a customer is the value. If you change the supply chain, then you lose your soul.</p><p>LACQUA: Thank you so much. Michele Norsa there, former Chief Executive at Ferragamo, now, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management, both stay with us.</p><p>Michele Norsa, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico and former Ferragamo Chief Executive, and Paul Donovan from UBS are both still with us. Michele Norsa, when you look at, I guess, how people consume luxury online, what's more important for a Chief Executive to get it right? So the online or actually how the Chinese consume?</p><p>NORSA: They are both important. I think it's easier to grow the Chinese consumption because they are growing by number, they are growing by welfare, they growing by traveling. And so it's something which is moving with an organic -- on an organic trend. Online has always been surprising, some time in a good sense but mostly in a negative. Everybody expected ten years ago that now there would be more than 10% of luxury both online, which has happened in the United States already, it's close to happen in the U.K., but globally still, you're talking about mid single-digit. And most companies are not even disclosing the number yet in their balance sheet.</p><p>LACQUA: Are you expecting that to pick up or is it just because of touch and feel? And also when you spend \u01531,000 or \u01532,000 for a dress or suit, you want to touch it.</p><p>NORSA: This is the reason and, of course, in the United States, they are more used in receiving, sending back, receiving, sending back, which is not as easy in other countries, for example, in China. But I think one risk which is an older technology is, really, the brand evolution. So if you look at the online operators of maybe the five, six companies which are dealing with luxury goods, they always have a trend, a perception as a discounting offers, special sales. Plus you have seen the problem of a counterfeit or fake or other brands, production of other brands mostly in Asia and China. So companies are still very cautious in moving massively towards the online. I was reading yesterday, there is a prediction which is -- which I don't believe earlier is from a big (ph) company who says, by 2025, online business could be 25%. I don't see this kind of growth because companies are getting more cautious, they're trying to get the online business inside, not to deal with counterparts, which are unreliable sometimes, totally unreliable like in Asia.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, this was also translated also into your world, right, and how you look at economics and trying to figure out shopping habits in the future.</p><p>DONOVAN: So one of the things that I think is coming out as part of the fourth industrial revolution concept is, in many ways, we're sort of reinventing the first industrial revolution which brought in for the very first time shopping a leisure activity just like Wedgwood (ph) was really basically created shopping as a leisure activity. And I think that's something which we're now seeing. So with luxury, if you're shopping for luxury, for the most part, this is a leisure activity, this is a special occasion. You go to a store, you have very sales staff who are very helpful and you buy something special, whereas if I'm doing the weekly shop for cleaning equipment for home and laundry detergent, this is not quite such a special experience for me and far more likely to do that online. And I think this division is going to be quite important. And it sort of emphasizes one of the key things about the fourth industrial revolution and this fear that we're all going to be replaced by robots and so on. That's not necessarily the case because you want the personal experience of being helped by a sales assistant in the store if you're buying luxury, you want the human interaction. You don't want an unanimous -- please click here and enter your credit card number if you're going for the luxury experience. So I think that this is, in many ways, symptomatic of what is happening in the broader economy that we're going to see this gravitation towards online retail for regular growth sort of mundane shopping, but then shopping as a leisure experience perhaps reaching yet another level as it did in the late 1700's</p><p>NORSA: And there is also another distinction. Local people are more attracted in some countries, like the United States and China, which are very (inaudible) to buy online because they cannot reach your store. But travelers, they really travel for the pleasure of spending time at (inaudible) Zegna, at Ferragamo and Valentino. It is a pleasure to get there. You'll see things you don't find in online. So I think there will be a development of the online business specializing really in luxury. When they ask me Amazon could be difficult to think.</p><p>DONOVAN: And I think also there are -- some consumers will have a different experience as well. Some consumers regard luxury almost as being like shopping to (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Guys, thank you so much. Michele Norsa there, former Ferragamo, and Paul Donovan from UBS.

Does that actually change the economy if -- not about the market sell-off,  but if you're really starting question these big tech companies?</p><p> PAUL DONOVAN, GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST, UBS: No. I think the -- I mean, the  thing is, of course, that tech is far more important to the market than it  is to the real world, and economists live in a real world whereas people  like Tim --</p><p> LACQUA: (Inaudible) applications, Paul, but continue, please.</p><p> DONOVAN: So -- but the issue here is that the role of tech in terms of  employment, in terms of generating economic growth, it doesn't matter  nearly as much to the economy as it does to the market. But I think there's  an interesting question here that if we go back two, three, four years, the  digital anarchists where they're saying, well, tech is above government.  Governments don't matter anymore. Technology is all that matters. And what  I think we're discovering or rediscovering is, actually, you know what,  governments do matter. And technology companies are just like any other  company. They don't have some kind of super power. They are going to be  regulated, they are going to be subject to government interference, and  that realization, I think, in a broader sense, combined with the fact that  in the United States, we have a less predictable government, perhaps this  is creating a shift in terms of risk.</p><p> LACQUA: Well, joining us now for more, Guy Stear, Head of Fixed Income  Research at SocGen. Paul Donovan from UBS is still with us. So, Guy,  welcome to the program. Paul, thank you so much for sticking around. Paul,  when you look at global growth, it's fine, it's rosy, it's better than  expected according to the IMF. And then you have these trade tensions. How  much of a worry is that, that actually they're going to be the catalyst or  the fear in the markets for the next recession?</p><p> DONOVAN: So I think we've got a couple of issues here. So the first point  is that a lot of the global growth that we're seeing is domestic-led. So  it's not really synchronized global growth. It's what I'd call simultaneous  global growth. So the U.S. consumer is alive and well and sort of not  necessarily in a shopping mall but at least online spending money. The  European consumer is showing signs of revival. In Southeast Asia, domestic  demand is picking up. So you've got independent growth stories coming  through. And the second thing is that, so far, the trade tensions are  basically noise. We're not in a trade war. We're nowhere near a trade war.  I mean, Trump has just reversed two-thirds of the tax on steel and one-half  of the tax on aluminum by giving exemptions to anybody that matters. So  we're moving away from the spin of Twitter and so on, so the substance  isn't that damaging.</p><p> LACQUA: Do you agree with that, Guy, that, overall, you're pretty confident  about the future?</p><p> GUY STEAR, HEAD EM &amp; CREDIT RESEARCH, SOCIETE GENERALE: I think the nearer  future, yes. I mean, I think a lot of the things that Paul has mentioned  are absolutely correct. My concerns would be more on the profit side in  terms of the U.S., maybe six to nine months out. One of the things that I  see in the profit data in the U.S. is that corporate cash generation has  been low relative to nominal -- relative to net income for the past nine  months. And that's typically a sign that companies are building up their  receivables, so they're having to offer better terms to their end clients  in order to get sales done. So, effectively, they're moving inventories  from their warehouses to their client's warehouses. And that to me is  always a sign that we end up seeing revenues begin to decline for these  companies. So I do have some concern particularly about the U.S. profit  cycle as we head into the second half of the year.</p><p> LACQUA: Paul, talking about inflation, so I don't know whether -- if you  look at inflation dynamics in the U.S. and we go back to wage growth, is it  that there are too monopolies so people are concerned or usually get a wage  raise if you change company, right? So that's difficult to do. Or whether  they're still not confident enough about their future to (inaudible) pay  rise?</p><p> DONOVAN: But we are getting pay increases. So we're seeing --</p><p> LACQUA: A little bit.</p><p> DONOVAN: Well, we're seeing about 3% pay rise on the Atlanta Fed Wage  Tracker, which is the only reliable thing. Average early earnings should  not be published in my view. But the wage tracker is a decent index around  about 3% growth. But that may actually be understating what's going on.  Because what we've also had is a rise of self-employment and self- employment income growth doesn't necessarily show up as wage growth. You  may be paying yourself a dividend instead. And this has been one of the big  things in the U.K. where we do have some data on this which has shown that  the U.K. consumer is actually far better resourced than previously thought  because of the self-employment issue. So I don't think it's necessarily  that we're seeing weakness in the labor market or weakness in the ability  to get pay rises through. And when we look at the Beige Book, for example,  that keeps reporting that companies are paying sign-on bonuses, they're  having to do more to attract people to come and work for them, which is  really indicative of a late market, which at least, in certain factors, has  become quite tight and where we are seeing some labor cost pressures  creeping in.</p><p> LACQUA: And, Guy, what have we heard from J. Powell? So he's looking on it.  He is reliant is how I interpret it, but maybe wrong on models, right, and  on theory and wants to look at the economy. Does it not mean that there's a  danger that the fed is actually behind the curve?</p><p> STEAR: Well, I think this is really the point that, as Paul was mentioning,  we are seeing a beginning sort of incipient signs of -- maybe even more  than incipient signs of underlying inflation pressures. There needs to be  response from central banks. Globally, the fed is definitely the lead in  terms of global central banks. That means that pressure on the front end of  the curve definitely as people start to factor in those anticipations or  continue to factor in those anticipations so the five-year area of the U.S.  curve can still go higher. And we can still see steepening in the two  slides area of the U.S. curve. Where the risk is more, I think, when you  look beyond the five-year area of the curve and even though we've got more  supply coming into the market, I think people are going to start to be more  concerned about the more medium-term growth story. So it could be the case  that we see the U.S. curve actually flattening from beyond the five-year  area. And while we're all very focused on the ten-year area of the curve,  that can give a slightly deceptive picture because different parts of the  U.S. curve and global credit curve -- credit -- sorry, rate curves will be  doing different things.</p><p> LACQUA: Paul, this is my chart and it goes back to what Guy is saying. It's  basically -- you can see the curve collapse and this is a spread between 5  and 30-year treasuries.</p><p> DONOVAN: Yes.</p><p> LACQUA: What does this tell us? Where does it go next?</p><p> DONOVAN: It tells that there's a spread between 5 and 30-year treasuries --</p><p> LACQUA: That's collapsing.</p><p> DONOVAN: -- that is collapsing. I am increasingly skeptical about the value  of the shape of the yield curve as an economic indicator. Back in the 70's  when inflation dominates the bond markets and when inflation is closely  correlated with the economic cycle, then you would expect the shape of the  yield curve to tell something about whether you're going economically up or  economically down. But that's not what happens now. Inflation is not the  dominant part of a bond yield. The real yield plays a significant role far  more than it used to. And inflation is not quite so positively correlated  with the economic cycle for various reasons around its calculation and so  forth. So we take those factors into account and then you add in the fact  that bond markets are basically rigged, that you have regulation --</p><p> LACQUA: Rigged by central banks?</p><p> DONOVAN: Well, regulation forcing investors to buy bonds. And, yes, Powell  can't wake up one morning and think, you know what, I'm going to move out  of treasuries and into equities, because the fed can't buy equities, it's  illegal. Most central banks can't buy equities. Swiss are an exception, but  that's basically a hedge fund. And so what they're doing is creating a  captive demand for the market, which is a distortion. It has to be a  distortion. Think about the gilt market for most of the last 30 years with  generally an inverted curve, again, because of pension regulation, creating  captive investors. So I am not so sure that in the modern world, the  information content of the bond yield curve is what it was back in the 70's  or the early 80's when we were in a far higher inflation environment and  when yields were perhaps an indication of economic expectations.</p><p> LACQUA: All right. Thank you both. We'll have plenty more. I love the idea  that actually the Swiss National Bank is somehow a hedge fund. I'm sure the  governor would love that. We'll get back to Guy and Paul.</p><p> Guy Stear from Societe Generale and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management  are still with us. Paul, I don't know whether this means -- so you're in  the White House and President Trump or the administration, and you see --  so the Chinese leadership leaning with North Korea, and you say, okay, so I  need actually to keep China on the side, so whether they go a little bit  easier on the tariffs.</p><p> DONOVAN: I think it's unlikely at this stage. I think there is a clear view  in the administration particularly with Bolton coming in, but you're going  aggressive and aggression gets results. So I'm not sure that that would  necessarily be seen as being part of this process. Now, we've had the spin,  the big announcement on the tariffs, and we're going to find out what Good  Samaritan consumers are going to be taxed on at some point in the next week  or so. And I think after that, then there may be a dialing back. But that's  nothing to do with Korea. That's just -- this is what we get all the time.  First, you make the big announcement, you get lots of American steel  workers applauding and then you reverse everything that you previously said  you were going to do. So I think that pattern will reassert itself. But  it's not about the Korean issue at the moment.</p><p> LACQUA: All right. Thank you so much. Guy Stear there, Head of FI Research  at Societe Generale, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management, both stay  with us.</p><p> Guy Stear from Societe Generale and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management  are still with us. Guy, you look at emerging markets. You focus on this day  in, day out. Does the inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the Footsie Russell  change anything at all?</p><p> STEAR: Well, I think it's important in terms of the share of mind that  Saudi Arabia gets from global investors. Whether it has a big impact in  terms of equity, money flows, we'll have to wait and see. I think the focus  is a little bit more on the debt because as you're well aware, Saudi Arabia  has done a couple of big issues in the past couple of years. What we have  really been waiting for in terms of emerging market debt is more issues by  the Gulf banks in general. And I think in this sense, you could see more  opportunities for issuance in terms of the dollar market coming out of the  region particularly from banks.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. Does it change? I mean, what needs to happen in Saudi Arabia  for investors to go back in? I mean, they had a very successful PIF forum,  I heard a lot of chatter in the markets that they were willing to go back  in Saudi Arabia, that this was going to be a different market and then you  had a crackdown and the people imprisoned at the Ritz, and that kind of  changed investor's views completely.</p><p> STEAR: Well, I think there is political risk but I think there're also  opportunities in terms of the region. And I think investors need to balance  the two together, one off against the other. Particularly in the debt  markets, when you look at Saudi Arabia or you look at the Gulf in general  compared to the other alternatives in emerging markets, it's high quality  with high ratings, and so I suppose less risks than there might in some  other sectors, and I suppose, in that sense, it's a draw. And I think you  get a similar idea from the inclusion to the equity indices that you really  start to compare it with the other alternatives, and in that sense, it can  be something which people find attractive.</p><p> LACQUA: Paul, what's your take on Saudi Arabia?</p><p> DONOVAN: So I think the global issue for Saudi at the moment is with oil,  where it is. They're still running the budget deficit, we had the VAT  increase at the start of the year, and three days later, they're raising  the pay for the army. So they have not tackled that specifically. And what  matters to me as an economist then is, well, how do Saudi finance this. And  the repatriation flow that we've been sitting over the last 18 months. I  mean, some have sold about $100 billion last year of overseas assets, they  bring the money back. What that means to me is not only have we then lost a  key supporter of the dollar, but the key supporter of the dollar has  actually turned into a sell-out because most of Saudi's assets have tended  to be in dollar assets. If they're repatriating to finance their domestic  fiscal position, this is creating a negative flow for the dollar by the  time when U.S. needs to be borrowing more from the rest of the world.</p><p> LACQUA: All right. Paul and Guy, thank you so much. Guy Stear there, Head  of Research at Societe Generale, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth  Management, and we'll be talking a little bit about luxury and Italian  reform next.</p><p> LACQUA: Joining us now is Michele Norsa, Industrial Partner at Fondo  Strategico, former Ferragamo Chief Executive, as well as current Board  Member of Rocco Forte Hotels and Ermenegildo Zegna, just as a couple of  examples. Paul Donovan from UBS is also still with us. So, Paul, thank you  so much for sticking around. Michele, welcome to the program. So last time  we saw each other was actually overlooking the coliseum in Rome, and this  was after the elections, straight after the elections. What have we learned  in the last month? Italian politics is difficult but is the economy strong  enough to withhold it?</p><p> MICHELE NORSA, INDUSTRIAL PARTNER, FSI SGR SPA: I think that (inaudible)  have surprises. When I was there in Rome on March 5th with just had the  first result, and they were saying that it was worst possible situation. In  fact, it is proving to be a situation where, anyhow, a majority will be  very thin, it is not a big chance to have a government with a strong  majority. But there have been two important steps. One, the change in both  Five Start and the League because they have started working on programs,  they have been able to elect the Head of Senate and Chamber in 48 hours and  they seem to be much more flexible than people expected. This doesn't mean  that this alliance is going to be done. There are still other alternatives.  The second point is nobody wants to vote again, mostly the members. Two- third of the members are new, so they want at least to stay there one year.  But if they can, they will stay even longer. So there will be possibly  majorities are also very afraid (ph), but based on 30, 40, 50 votes, when  it is secured, which can move from one side to another.</p><p> LACQUA: But, Michele Norsa, this is a point that we were making at the day  after the election is, first, what do Chief Executives want. So do they  need reforms, maybe more labor, do they need the banks dealt with? And  actually, is there a huge difference between what Chief Executives want and  what the person on the street want? Because actually there was a recovery  in Italy, but a lot of the people on the streets don't feel it.</p><p> NORSA: The bane risk is the volatility because we have no history about  these parties and these people, they have never managed the -- not even a  city or a region, in some regions, the League in the north. But it is very  difficult to predict. I think there is a lack of economies, there is a lack  of people with strong political history, international relationship  network, this is going to miss. On the other side, you have a feeling that  the new has more energy, is moving faster and is also changing faster. So  the whole piece (ph), they can adapt to a situation, maybe get some  injection from outside of high profile people, not for technical  government, but I think a government with some injection of know-how and  seniority.</p><p> LACQUA: Paul, let me bring you over to my chart. This is a ten-year and we  actually chart it. So this is the Italian ten-year compared to the Spanish  ten-year. Is this the right one to look at or do you chart it next to  Germany? What's fair to compare it with?</p><p> DONOVAN: I think given that we're also looking to the ECB to be ending its  bond buying program at some point before the end of this year. It's  probably better to be looking against Spain. Because, obviously, the  trouble with comparing the ten-year against Germany is the ten-year Germany  is distorted very much by the ECB's bond buying program, whereas it tends  to be a shorter dated Italian and Spanish bonds that are bought by the ECB.  So I think that this is probably a better indication. But basically, I  think, what that chart is saying is most Italian debt is owned by Italians.  And Italians are relatively used to political uncertainty. As you were  probably (ph) mentioning it, they have quite a lot of experience of  political uncertainty --</p><p> LACQUA: Well, a lot of governments for sure.</p><p> DONOVAN: -- a lot of governments over the last 70 years. So I don't think  Italian investors are panicked about what is happening in this, and there's  a reason for them to panic at this stage. And as a result, we've got some  reaction in the bond market, but it's hardly an abnormal reaction compared  to recent history.</p><p> LACQUA: Yes. I guess, Michele Norsa, you said on many boards and a lot of  them are hospitality or luxury. But these are companies that are doing very  well because they're looking abroad, right? Is the Italian consumer  consuming?</p><p> NORSA: This is the point. I think that the Italian economy is growing  because of export and because of tourism. Tourism, there is not much  attention, but tourism is as big as fashion and food together. And this is  potentially an area of development. Luxury is not suffering that much  because, in fact, you have a distribution worldwide for nobody (ph) for  companies like Ferragamo. They represent 10%, not more, and so you can  compensate with other markets doing better. The concern is I think with the  duties. It could take as to an increase in prices, because at the end,  everybody will increase. Nobody decreases. So if you have to compensate,  then you to align the prices. And you always align going up and not going  down. And this could be also a negative influence on the inflation, for  example, in some country. But the market is still doing -- it's not the  growth that we were used to. It would be a more selective growth. But there  is still room for geographical expansion, for perimeter, and there's room  for diversification. The point is that the companies will clearly separate  winners and losers. It's not as it used to be. So the potential is quite  different. If you look at the single shares, you will see how these two  groups are moving.</p><p> LACQUA: Michele Norsa, would you worry -- if you're a Chief Executive today  from a luxury brand, and we'll talk about luxury in a second, do you worry  about your supply chain because of the noise on tariffs and trade?</p><p> NORSA: No. Honestly, I think that the luxury supply chain is quite unique.  You cannot change. If you go down to mass (ph) market or sportswear, you  have alternatives. But if you want to stay luxury at France, Italy, mostly  France, okay, you can do a (inaudible) in Spain, you can go there. But  you'll never go to a different because the quality and the perception of a  customer is the value. If you change the supply chain, then you lose your  soul.</p><p> LACQUA: Thank you so much. Michele Norsa there, former Chief Executive at  Ferragamo, now, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico, and Paul Donovan  from UBS Wealth Management, both stay with us.</p><p> Michele Norsa, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico and former Ferragamo  Chief Executive, and Paul Donovan from UBS are both still with us. Michele  Norsa, when you look at, I guess, how people consume luxury online, what's  more important for a Chief Executive to get it right? So the online or  actually how the Chinese consume?</p><p> NORSA: They are both important. I think it's easier to grow the Chinese  consumption because they are growing by number, they are growing by  welfare, they growing by traveling. And so it's something which is moving  with an organic -- on an organic trend. Online has always been surprising,  some time in a good sense but mostly in a negative. Everybody expected ten  years ago that now there would be more than 10% of luxury both online,  which has happened in the United States already, it's close to happen in  the U.K., but globally still, you're talking about mid single-digit. And  most companies are not even disclosing the number yet in their balance  sheet.</p><p> LACQUA: Are you expecting that to pick up or is it just because of touch  and feel? And also when you spend o1,000 or o2,000 for a dress or suit, you  want to touch it.</p><p> NORSA: This is the reason and, of course, in the United States, they are  more used in receiving, sending back, receiving, sending back, which is not  as easy in other countries, for example, in China. But I think one risk  which is an older technology is, really, the brand evolution. So if you  look at the online operators of maybe the five, six companies which are  dealing with luxury goods, they always have a trend, a perception as a  discounting offers, special sales. Plus you have seen the problem of a  counterfeit or fake or other brands, production of other brands mostly in  Asia and China. So companies are still very cautious in moving massively  towards the online. I was reading yesterday, there is a prediction which is  -- which I don't believe earlier is from a big (ph) company who says, by  2025, online business could be 25%. I don't see this kind of growth because  companies are getting more cautious, they're trying to get the online  business inside, not to deal with counterparts, which are unreliable  sometimes, totally unreliable like in Asia.</p><p> LACQUA: Paul, this was also translated also into your world, right, and how  you look at economics and trying to figure out shopping habits in the  future.</p><p> DONOVAN: So one of the things that I think is coming out as part of the  fourth industrial revolution concept is, in many ways, we're sort of  reinventing the first industrial revolution which brought in for the very  first time shopping a leisure activity just like Wedgwood (ph) was really  basically created shopping as a leisure activity. And I think that's  something which we're now seeing. So with luxury, if you're shopping for  luxury, for the most part, this is a leisure activity, this is a special  occasion. You go to a store, you have very sales staff who are very helpful  and you buy something special, whereas if I'm doing the weekly shop for  cleaning equipment for home and laundry detergent, this is not quite such a  special experience for me and far more likely to do that online. And I  think this division is going to be quite important. And it sort of  emphasizes one of the key things about the fourth industrial revolution and  this fear that we're all going to be replaced by robots and so on. That's  not necessarily the case because you want the personal experience of being  helped by a sales assistant in the store if you're buying luxury, you want  the human interaction. You don't want an unanimous -- please click here and  enter your credit card number if you're going for the luxury experience. So  I think that this is, in many ways, symptomatic of what is happening in the  broader economy that we're going to see this gravitation towards online  retail for regular growth sort of mundane shopping, but then shopping as a  leisure experience perhaps reaching yet another level as it did in the late  1700's</p><p> NORSA: And there is also another distinction. Local people are more  attracted in some countries, like the United States and China, which are  very (inaudible) to buy online because they cannot reach your store. But  travelers, they really travel for the pleasure of spending time at  (inaudible) Zegna, at Ferragamo and Valentino. It is a pleasure to get  there. You'll see things you don't find in online. So I think there will be  a development of the online business specializing really in luxury. When  they ask me Amazon could be difficult to think.</p><p> DONOVAN: And I think also there are -- some consumers will have a different  experience as well. Some consumers regard luxury almost as being like  shopping to (inaudible).</p><p> LACQUA: Guys, thank you so much. Michele Norsa there, former Ferragamo, and  Paul Donovan from UBS.

Does that actually change the economy if -- not about the market sell-off, but if you're really starting question these big tech companies?</p><p>PAUL DONOVAN, GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST, UBS: No. I think the -- I mean, the thing is, of course, that tech is far more important to the market than it is to the real world, and economists live in a real world whereas people like Tim --</p><p>LACQUA: (Inaudible) applications, Paul, but continue, please.</p><p>DONOVAN: So -- but the issue here is that the role of tech in terms of employment, in terms of generating economic growth, it doesn't matter nearly as much to the economy as it does to the market. But I think there's an interesting question here that if we go back two, three, four years, the digital anarchists where they're saying, well, tech is above government. Governments don't matter anymore. Technology is all that matters. And what I think we're discovering or rediscovering is, actually, you know what, governments do matter. And technology companies are just like any other company. They don't have some kind of super power. They are going to be regulated, they are going to be subject to government interference, and that realization, I think, in a broader sense, combined with the fact that in the United States, we have a less predictable government, perhaps this is creating a shift in terms of risk.</p><p>LACQUA: Well, joining us now for more, Guy Stear, Head of Fixed Income Research at SocGen. Paul Donovan from UBS is still with us. So, Guy, welcome to the program. Paul, thank you so much for sticking around. Paul, when you look at global growth, it's fine, it's rosy, it's better than expected according to the IMF. And then you have these trade tensions. How much of a worry is that, that actually they're going to be the catalyst or the fear in the markets for the next recession?</p><p>DONOVAN: So I think we've got a couple of issues here. So the first point is that a lot of the global growth that we're seeing is domestic-led. So it's not really synchronized global growth. It's what I'd call simultaneous global growth. So the U.S. consumer is alive and well and sort of not necessarily in a shopping mall but at least online spending money. The European consumer is showing signs of revival. In Southeast Asia, domestic demand is picking up. So you've got independent growth stories coming through. And the second thing is that, so far, the trade tensions are basically noise. We're not in a trade war. We're nowhere near a trade war. I mean, Trump has just reversed two-thirds of the tax on steel and one-half of the tax on aluminum by giving exemptions to anybody that matters. So we're moving away from the spin of Twitter and so on, so the substance isn't that damaging.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you agree with that, Guy, that, overall, you're pretty confident about the future?</p><p>GUY STEAR, HEAD EM &amp; CREDIT RESEARCH, SOCIETE GENERALE: I think the nearer future, yes. I mean, I think a lot of the things that Paul has mentioned are absolutely correct. My concerns would be more on the profit side in terms of the U.S., maybe six to nine months out. One of the things that I see in the profit data in the U.S. is that corporate cash generation has been low relative to nominal -- relative to net income for the past nine months. And that's typically a sign that companies are building up their receivables, so they're having to offer better terms to their end clients in order to get sales done. So, effectively, they're moving inventories from their warehouses to their client's warehouses. And that to me is always a sign that we end up seeing revenues begin to decline for these companies. So I do have some concern particularly about the U.S. profit cycle as we head into the second half of the year.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, talking about inflation, so I don't know whether -- if you look at inflation dynamics in the U.S. and we go back to wage growth, is it that there are too monopolies so people are concerned or usually get a wage raise if you change company, right? So that's difficult to do. Or whether they're still not confident enough about their future to (inaudible) pay rise?</p><p>DONOVAN: But we are getting pay increases. So we're seeing --</p><p>LACQUA: A little bit.</p><p>DONOVAN: Well, we're seeing about 3% pay rise on the Atlanta Fed Wage Tracker, which is the only reliable thing. Average early earnings should not be published in my view. But the wage tracker is a decent index around about 3% growth. But that may actually be understating what's going on. Because what we've also had is a rise of self-employment and self- employment income growth doesn't necessarily show up as wage growth. You may be paying yourself a dividend instead. And this has been one of the big things in the U.K. where we do have some data on this which has shown that the U.K. consumer is actually far better resourced than previously thought because of the self-employment issue. So I don't think it's necessarily that we're seeing weakness in the labor market or weakness in the ability to get pay rises through. And when we look at the Beige Book, for example, that keeps reporting that companies are paying sign-on bonuses, they're having to do more to attract people to come and work for them, which is really indicative of a late market, which at least, in certain factors, has become quite tight and where we are seeing some labor cost pressures creeping in.</p><p>LACQUA: And, Guy, what have we heard from J. Powell? So he's looking on it. He is reliant is how I interpret it, but maybe wrong on models, right, and on theory and wants to look at the economy. Does it not mean that there's a danger that the fed is actually behind the curve?</p><p>STEAR: Well, I think this is really the point that, as Paul was mentioning, we are seeing a beginning sort of incipient signs of -- maybe even more than incipient signs of underlying inflation pressures. There needs to be response from central banks. Globally, the fed is definitely the lead in terms of global central banks. That means that pressure on the front end of the curve definitely as people start to factor in those anticipations or continue to factor in those anticipations so the five-year area of the U.S. curve can still go higher. And we can still see steepening in the two slides area of the U.S. curve. Where the risk is more, I think, when you look beyond the five-year area of the curve and even though we've got more supply coming into the market, I think people are going to start to be more concerned about the more medium-term growth story. So it could be the case that we see the U.S. curve actually flattening from beyond the five-year area. And while we're all very focused on the ten-year area of the curve, that can give a slightly deceptive picture because different parts of the U.S. curve and global credit curve -- credit -- sorry, rate curves will be doing different things.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, this is my chart and it goes back to what Guy is saying. It's basically -- you can see the curve collapse and this is a spread between 5 and 30-year treasuries.</p><p>DONOVAN: Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: What does this tell us? Where does it go next?</p><p>DONOVAN: It tells that there's a spread between 5 and 30-year treasuries --</p><p>LACQUA: That's collapsing.</p><p>DONOVAN: -- that is collapsing. I am increasingly skeptical about the value of the shape of the yield curve as an economic indicator. Back in the 70's when inflation dominates the bond markets and when inflation is closely correlated with the economic cycle, then you would expect the shape of the yield curve to tell something about whether you're going economically up or economically down. But that's not what happens now. Inflation is not the dominant part of a bond yield. The real yield plays a significant role far more than it used to. And inflation is not quite so positively correlated with the economic cycle for various reasons around its calculation and so forth. So we take those factors into account and then you add in the fact that bond markets are basically rigged, that you have regulation --</p><p>LACQUA: Rigged by central banks?</p><p>DONOVAN: Well, regulation forcing investors to buy bonds. And, yes, Powell can't wake up one morning and think, you know what, I'm going to move out of treasuries and into equities, because the fed can't buy equities, it's illegal. Most central banks can't buy equities. Swiss are an exception, but that's basically a hedge fund. And so what they're doing is creating a captive demand for the market, which is a distortion. It has to be a distortion. Think about the gilt market for most of the last 30 years with generally an inverted curve, again, because of pension regulation, creating captive investors. So I am not so sure that in the modern world, the information content of the bond yield curve is what it was back in the 70's or the early 80's when we were in a far higher inflation environment and when yields were perhaps an indication of economic expectations.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you both. We'll have plenty more. I love the idea that actually the Swiss National Bank is somehow a hedge fund. I'm sure the governor would love that. We'll get back to Guy and Paul.</p><p>Guy Stear from Societe Generale and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management are still with us. Paul, I don't know whether this means -- so you're in the White House and President Trump or the administration, and you see -- so the Chinese leadership leaning with North Korea, and you say, okay, so I need actually to keep China on the side, so whether they go a little bit easier on the tariffs.</p><p>DONOVAN: I think it's unlikely at this stage. I think there is a clear view in the administration particularly with Bolton coming in, but you're going aggressive and aggression gets results. So I'm not sure that that would necessarily be seen as being part of this process. Now, we've had the spin, the big announcement on the tariffs, and we're going to find out what Good Samaritan consumers are going to be taxed on at some point in the next week or so. And I think after that, then there may be a dialing back. But that's nothing to do with Korea. That's just -- this is what we get all the time. First, you make the big announcement, you get lots of American steel workers applauding and then you reverse everything that you previously said you were going to do. So I think that pattern will reassert itself. But it's not about the Korean issue at the moment.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you so much. Guy Stear there, Head of FI Research at Societe Generale, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management, both stay with us.</p><p>Guy Stear from Societe Generale and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management are still with us. Guy, you look at emerging markets. You focus on this day in, day out. Does the inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the Footsie Russell change anything at all?</p><p>STEAR: Well, I think it's important in terms of the share of mind that Saudi Arabia gets from global investors. Whether it has a big impact in terms of equity, money flows, we'll have to wait and see. I think the focus is a little bit more on the debt because as you're well aware, Saudi Arabia has done a couple of big issues in the past couple of years. What we have really been waiting for in terms of emerging market debt is more issues by the Gulf banks in general. And I think in this sense, you could see more opportunities for issuance in terms of the dollar market coming out of the region particularly from banks.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Does it change? I mean, what needs to happen in Saudi Arabia for investors to go back in? I mean, they had a very successful PIF forum, I heard a lot of chatter in the markets that they were willing to go back in Saudi Arabia, that this was going to be a different market and then you had a crackdown and the people imprisoned at the Ritz, and that kind of changed investor's views completely.</p><p>STEAR: Well, I think there is political risk but I think there're also opportunities in terms of the region. And I think investors need to balance the two together, one off against the other. Particularly in the debt markets, when you look at Saudi Arabia or you look at the Gulf in general compared to the other alternatives in emerging markets, it's high quality with high ratings, and so I suppose less risks than there might in some other sectors, and I suppose, in that sense, it's a draw. And I think you get a similar idea from the inclusion to the equity indices that you really start to compare it with the other alternatives, and in that sense, it can be something which people find attractive.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, what's your take on Saudi Arabia?</p><p>DONOVAN: So I think the global issue for Saudi at the moment is with oil, where it is. They're still running the budget deficit, we had the VAT increase at the start of the year, and three days later, they're raising the pay for the army. So they have not tackled that specifically. And what matters to me as an economist then is, well, how do Saudi finance this. And the repatriation flow that we've been sitting over the last 18 months. I mean, some have sold about $100 billion last year of overseas assets, they bring the money back. What that means to me is not only have we then lost a key supporter of the dollar, but the key supporter of the dollar has actually turned into a sell-out because most of Saudi's assets have tended to be in dollar assets. If they're repatriating to finance their domestic fiscal position, this is creating a negative flow for the dollar by the time when U.S. needs to be borrowing more from the rest of the world.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Paul and Guy, thank you so much. Guy Stear there, Head of Research at Societe Generale, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management, and we'll be talking a little bit about luxury and Italian reform next.</p><p>LACQUA: Joining us now is Michele Norsa, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico, former Ferragamo Chief Executive, as well as current Board Member of Rocco Forte Hotels and Ermenegildo Zegna, just as a couple of examples. Paul Donovan from UBS is also still with us. So, Paul, thank you so much for sticking around. Michele, welcome to the program. So last time we saw each other was actually overlooking the coliseum in Rome, and this was after the elections, straight after the elections. What have we learned in the last month? Italian politics is difficult but is the economy strong enough to withhold it?</p><p>MICHELE NORSA, INDUSTRIAL PARTNER, FSI SGR SPA: I think that (inaudible) have surprises. When I was there in Rome on March 5th with just had the first result, and they were saying that it was worst possible situation. In fact, it is proving to be a situation where, anyhow, a majority will be very thin, it is not a big chance to have a government with a strong majority. But there have been two important steps. One, the change in both Five Start and the League because they have started working on programs, they have been able to elect the Head of Senate and Chamber in 48 hours and they seem to be much more flexible than people expected. This doesn't mean that this alliance is going to be done. There are still other alternatives. The second point is nobody wants to vote again, mostly the members. Two- third of the members are new, so they want at least to stay there one year. But if they can, they will stay even longer. So there will be possibly majorities are also very afraid (ph), but based on 30, 40, 50 votes, when it is secured, which can move from one side to another.</p><p>LACQUA: But, Michele Norsa, this is a point that we were making at the day after the election is, first, what do Chief Executives want. So do they need reforms, maybe more labor, do they need the banks dealt with? And actually, is there a huge difference between what Chief Executives want and what the person on the street want? Because actually there was a recovery in Italy, but a lot of the people on the streets don't feel it.</p><p>NORSA: The bane risk is the volatility because we have no history about these parties and these people, they have never managed the -- not even a city or a region, in some regions, the League in the north. But it is very difficult to predict. I think there is a lack of economies, there is a lack of people with strong political history, international relationship network, this is going to miss. On the other side, you have a feeling that the new has more energy, is moving faster and is also changing faster. So the whole piece (ph), they can adapt to a situation, maybe get some injection from outside of high profile people, not for technical government, but I think a government with some injection of know-how and seniority.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, let me bring you over to my chart. This is a ten-year and we actually chart it. So this is the Italian ten-year compared to the Spanish ten-year. Is this the right one to look at or do you chart it next to Germany? What's fair to compare it with?</p><p>DONOVAN: I think given that we're also looking to the ECB to be ending its bond buying program at some point before the end of this year. It's probably better to be looking against Spain. Because, obviously, the trouble with comparing the ten-year against Germany is the ten-year Germany is distorted very much by the ECB's bond buying program, whereas it tends to be a shorter dated Italian and Spanish bonds that are bought by the ECB. So I think that this is probably a better indication. But basically, I think, what that chart is saying is most Italian debt is owned by Italians. And Italians are relatively used to political uncertainty. As you were probably (ph) mentioning it, they have quite a lot of experience of political uncertainty --</p><p>LACQUA: Well, a lot of governments for sure.</p><p>DONOVAN: -- a lot of governments over the last 70 years. So I don't think Italian investors are panicked about what is happening in this, and there's a reason for them to panic at this stage. And as a result, we've got some reaction in the bond market, but it's hardly an abnormal reaction compared to recent history.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. I guess, Michele Norsa, you said on many boards and a lot of them are hospitality or luxury. But these are companies that are doing very well because they're looking abroad, right? Is the Italian consumer consuming?</p><p>NORSA: This is the point. I think that the Italian economy is growing because of export and because of tourism. Tourism, there is not much attention, but tourism is as big as fashion and food together. And this is potentially an area of development. Luxury is not suffering that much because, in fact, you have a distribution worldwide for nobody (ph) for companies like Ferragamo. They represent 10%, not more, and so you can compensate with other markets doing better. The concern is I think with the duties. It could take as to an increase in prices, because at the end, everybody will increase. Nobody decreases. So if you have to compensate, then you to align the prices. And you always align going up and not going down. And this could be also a negative influence on the inflation, for example, in some country. But the market is still doing -- it's not the growth that we were used to. It would be a more selective growth. But there is still room for geographical expansion, for perimeter, and there's room for diversification. The point is that the companies will clearly separate winners and losers. It's not as it used to be. So the potential is quite different. If you look at the single shares, you will see how these two groups are moving.</p><p>LACQUA: Michele Norsa, would you worry -- if you're a Chief Executive today from a luxury brand, and we'll talk about luxury in a second, do you worry about your supply chain because of the noise on tariffs and trade?</p><p>NORSA: No. Honestly, I think that the luxury supply chain is quite unique. You cannot change. If you go down to mass (ph) market or sportswear, you have alternatives. But if you want to stay luxury at France, Italy, mostly France, okay, you can do a (inaudible) in Spain, you can go there. But you'll never go to a different because the quality and the perception of a customer is the value. If you change the supply chain, then you lose your soul.</p><p>LACQUA: Thank you so much. Michele Norsa there, former Chief Executive at Ferragamo, now, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management, both stay with us.</p><p>Michele Norsa, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico and former Ferragamo Chief Executive, and Paul Donovan from UBS are both still with us. Michele Norsa, when you look at, I guess, how people consume luxury online, what's more important for a Chief Executive to get it right? So the online or actually how the Chinese consume?</p><p>NORSA: They are both important. I think it's easier to grow the Chinese consumption because they are growing by number, they are growing by welfare, they growing by traveling. And so it's something which is moving with an organic -- on an organic trend. Online has always been surprising, some time in a good sense but mostly in a negative. Everybody expected ten years ago that now there would be more than 10% of luxury both online, which has happened in the United States already, it's close to happen in the U.K., but globally still, you're talking about mid single-digit. And most companies are not even disclosing the number yet in their balance sheet.</p><p>LACQUA: Are you expecting that to pick up or is it just because of touch and feel? And also when you spend o1,000 or o2,000 for a dress or suit, you want to touch it.</p><p>NORSA: This is the reason and, of course, in the United States, they are more used in receiving, sending back, receiving, sending back, which is not as easy in other countries, for example, in China. But I think one risk which is an older technology is, really, the brand evolution. So if you look at the online operators of maybe the five, six companies which are dealing with luxury goods, they always have a trend, a perception as a discounting offers, special sales. Plus you have seen the problem of a counterfeit or fake or other brands, production of other brands mostly in Asia and China. So companies are still very cautious in moving massively towards the online. I was reading yesterday, there is a prediction which is -- which I don't believe earlier is from a big (ph) company who says, by 2025, online business could be 25%. I don't see this kind of growth because companies are getting more cautious, they're trying to get the online business inside, not to deal with counterparts, which are unreliable sometimes, totally unreliable like in Asia.</p><p>LACQUA: Paul, this was also translated also into your world, right, and how you look at economics and trying to figure out shopping habits in the future.</p><p>DONOVAN: So one of the things that I think is coming out as part of the fourth industrial revolution concept is, in many ways, we're sort of reinventing the first industrial revolution which brought in for the very first time shopping a leisure activity just like Wedgwood (ph) was really basically created shopping as a leisure activity. And I think that's something which we're now seeing. So with luxury, if you're shopping for luxury, for the most part, this is a leisure activity, this is a special occasion. You go to a store, you have very sales staff who are very helpful and you buy something special, whereas if I'm doing the weekly shop for cleaning equipment for home and laundry detergent, this is not quite such a special experience for me and far more likely to do that online. And I think this division is going to be quite important. And it sort of emphasizes one of the key things about the fourth industrial revolution and this fear that we're all going to be replaced by robots and so on. That's not necessarily the case because you want the personal experience of being helped by a sales assistant in the store if you're buying luxury, you want the human interaction. You don't want an unanimous -- please click here and enter your credit card number if you're going for the luxury experience. So I think that this is, in many ways, symptomatic of what is happening in the broader economy that we're going to see this gravitation towards online retail for regular growth sort of mundane shopping, but then shopping as a leisure experience perhaps reaching yet another level as it did in the late 1700's</p><p>NORSA: And there is also another distinction. Local people are more attracted in some countries, like the United States and China, which are very (inaudible) to buy online because they cannot reach your store. But travelers, they really travel for the pleasure of spending time at (inaudible) Zegna, at Ferragamo and Valentino. It is a pleasure to get there. You'll see things you don't find in online. So I think there will be a development of the online business specializing really in luxury. When they ask me Amazon could be difficult to think.</p><p>DONOVAN: And I think also there are -- some consumers will have a different experience as well. Some consumers regard luxury almost as being like shopping to (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Guys, thank you so much. Michele Norsa there, former Ferragamo, and Paul Donovan from UBS.

But I think there's an interesting question here that if we go back two, three, four years, the digital anarchists where they're saying, well, tech is above government. Governments don't matter anymore. Technology is all that matters. And what I think we're discovering or rediscovering is, actually, you know what, governments do matter. And technology companies are just like any other company. They don't have some kind of super power. They are going to be regulated, they are going to be subject to government interference, and that realization, I think, in a broader sense, combined with the fact that in the United States, we have a less predictable government, perhaps this is creating a shift in terms of risk.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Well, joining us now for more, Guy Stear, Head of Fixed Income Research at SocGen. Paul Donovan from UBS is still with us. So, Guy, welcome to the program. Paul, thank you so much for sticking around. Paul, when you look at global growth, it's fine, it's rosy, it's better than expected according to the IMF. And then you have these trade tensions. How much of a worry is that, that actually they're going to be the catalyst or the fear in the markets for the next recession?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  So I think we've got a couple of issues here. So the first point is that a lot of the global growth that we're seeing is domestic-led. So it's not really synchronized global growth. It's what I'd call simultaneous global growth. So the U.S. consumer is alive and well and sort of not necessarily in a shopping mall but at least online spending money. The European consumer is showing signs of revival. In Southeast Asia, domestic demand is picking up. So you've got independent growth stories coming through. And the second thing is that, so far, the trade tensions are basically noise. We're not in a trade war. We're nowhere near a trade war. I mean, Trump has just reversed two-thirds of the tax on steel and one-half of the tax on aluminum by giving exemptions to anybody that matters. So we're moving away from the spin of Twitter and so on, so the substance isn't that damaging.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Do you agree with that, Guy, that, overall, you're pretty confident about the future?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEAR</emphasis>:  I think the nearer future, yes. I mean, I think a lot of the things that Paul has mentioned are absolutely correct. My concerns would be more on the profit side in terms of the U.S., maybe six to nine months out. One of the things that I see in the profit data in the U.S. is that corporate cash generation has been low relative to nominal -- relative to net income for the past nine months. And that's typically a sign that companies are building up their receivables, so they're having to offer better terms to their end clients in order to get sales done. So, effectively, they're moving inventories from their warehouses to their client's warehouses. And that to me is always a sign that we end up seeing revenues begin to decline for these companies. So I do have some concern particularly about the U.S. profit cycle as we head into the second half of the year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Paul, talking about inflation, so I don't know whether -- if you look at inflation dynamics in the U.S. and we go back to wage growth, is it that there are too monopolies so people are concerned or usually get a wage raise if you change company, right? So that's difficult to do. Or whether they're still not confident enough about their future to (inaudible) pay rise?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  But we are getting pay increases. So we're seeing --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  A little bit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  Well, we're seeing about 3% pay rise on the Atlanta Fed Wage Tracker, which is the only reliable thing. Average early earnings should not be published in my view. But the wage tracker is a decent index around about 3% growth. But that may actually be understating what's going on. Because what we've also had is a rise of self-employment and self-employment income growth doesn't necessarily show up as wage growth. You may be paying yourself a dividend instead. And this has been one of the big things in the U.K. where we do have some data on this which has shown that the U.K. consumer is actually far better resourced than previously thought because of the self-employment issue. So I don't think it's necessarily that we're seeing weakness in the labor market or weakness in the ability to get pay rises through. And when we look at the Beige Book, for example, that keeps reporting that companies are paying sign-on bonuses, they're having to do more to attract people to come and work for them, which is really indicative of a late market, which at least, in certain factors, has become quite tight and where we are seeing some labor cost pressures creeping in.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  And, Guy, what have we heard from J. Powell? So he's looking on it. He is reliant is how I interpret it, but maybe wrong on models, right, and on theory and wants to look at the economy. Does it not mean that there's a danger that the fed is actually behind the curve?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEAR</emphasis>:  Well, I think this is really the point that, as Paul was mentioning, we are seeing a beginning sort of incipient signs of -- maybe even more than incipient signs of underlying inflation pressures. There needs to be response from central banks. Globally, the fed is definitely the lead in terms of global central banks. That means that pressure on the front end of the curve definitely as people start to factor in those anticipations or continue to factor in those anticipations so the five-year area of the U.S. curve can still go higher. And we can still see steepening in the two slides area of the U.S. curve. Where the risk is more, I think, when you look beyond the five-year area of the curve and even though we've got more supply coming into the market, I think people are going to start to be more concerned about the more medium-term growth story. So it could be the case that we see the U.S. curve actually flattening from beyond the five-year area. And while we're all very focused on the ten-year area of the curve, that can give a slightly deceptive picture because different parts of the U.S. curve and global credit curve -- credit -- sorry, rate curves will be doing different things.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Paul, this is my chart and it goes back to what Guy is saying. It's basically -- you can see the curve collapse and this is a spread between 5 and 30-year treasuries.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What does this tell us? Where does it go next?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  It tells that there's a spread between 5 and 30-year treasuries --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  That's collapsing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  -- that is collapsing. I am increasingly skeptical about the value of the shape of the yield curve as an economic indicator. Back in the 70's when inflation dominates the bond markets and when inflation is closely correlated with the economic cycle, then you would expect the shape of the yield curve to tell something about whether you're going economically up or economically down. But that's not what happens now. Inflation is not the dominant part of a bond yield. The real yield plays a significant role far more than it used to. And inflation is not quite so positively correlated with the economic cycle for various reasons around its calculation and so forth. So we take those factors into account and then you add in the fact that bond markets are basically rigged, that you have regulation --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Rigged by central banks?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  Well, regulation forcing investors to buy bonds. And, yes, Powell can't wake up one morning and think, you know what, I'm going to move out of treasuries and into equities, because the fed can't buy equities, it's illegal. Most central banks can't buy equities. Swiss are an exception, but that's basically a hedge fund. And so what they're doing is creating a captive demand for the market, which is a distortion. It has to be a distortion. Think about the gilt market for most of the last 30 years with generally an inverted curve, again, because of pension regulation, creating captive investors. So I am not so sure that in the modern world, the information content of the bond yield curve is what it was back in the 70's or the early 80's when we were in a far higher inflation environment and when yields were perhaps an indication of economic expectations.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. Thank you both. We'll have plenty more. I love the idea that actually the Swiss National Bank is somehow a hedge fund. I'm sure the governor would love that. We'll get back to Guy and Paul.  </p><p>      Guy Stear from Societe Generale and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management are still with us. Paul, I don't know whether this means -- so you're in the White House and President Trump or the administration, and you see -- so the Chinese leadership leaning with North Korea, and you say, okay, so I need actually to keep China on the side, so whether they go a little bit easier on the tariffs.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  I think it's unlikely at this stage. I think there is a clear view in the administration particularly with Bolton coming in, but you're going aggressive and aggression gets results. So I'm not sure that that would necessarily be seen as being part of this process. Now, we've had the spin, the big announcement on the tariffs, and we're going to find out what Good Samaritan consumers are going to be taxed on at some point in the next week or so. And I think after that, then there may be a dialing back. But that's nothing to do with Korea. That's just -- this is what we get all the time. First, you make the big announcement, you get lots of American steel workers applauding and then you reverse everything that you previously said you were going to do. So I think that pattern will reassert itself. But it's not about the Korean issue at the moment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. Thank you so much. Guy Stear there, Head of FI Research at Societe Generale, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management, both stay with us.  </p><p>      Guy Stear from Societe Generale and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management are still with us. Guy, you look at emerging markets. You focus on this day in, day out. Does the inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the Footsie Russell change anything at all?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEAR</emphasis>:  Well, I think it's important in terms of the share of mind that Saudi Arabia gets from global investors. Whether it has a big impact in terms of equity, money flows, we'll have to wait and see. I think the focus is a little bit more on the debt because as you're well aware, Saudi Arabia has done a couple of big issues in the past couple of years. What we have really been waiting for in terms of emerging market debt is more issues by the Gulf banks in general. And I think in this sense, you could see more opportunities for issuance in terms of the dollar market coming out of the region particularly from banks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Okay. Does it change? I mean, what needs to happen in Saudi Arabia for investors to go back in? I mean, they had a very successful PIF forum, I heard a lot of chatter in the markets that they were willing to go back in Saudi Arabia, that this was going to be a different market and then you had a crackdown and the people imprisoned at the Ritz, and that kind of changed investor's views completely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEAR</emphasis>:  Well, I think there is political risk but I think there're also opportunities in terms of the region. And I think investors need to balance the two together, one off against the other. Particularly in the debt markets, when you look at Saudi Arabia or you look at the Gulf in general compared to the other alternatives in emerging markets, it's high quality with high ratings, and so I suppose less risks than there might in some other sectors, and I suppose, in that sense, it's a draw. And I think you get a similar idea from the inclusion to the equity indices that you really start to compare it with the other alternatives, and in that sense, it can be something which people find attractive.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Paul, what's your take on Saudi Arabia?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  So I think the global issue for Saudi at the moment is with oil, where it is. They're still running the budget deficit, we had the VAT increase at the start of the year, and three days later, they're raising the pay for the army. So they have not tackled that specifically. And what matters to me as an economist then is, well, how do Saudi finance this. And the repatriation flow that we've been sitting over the last 18 months. I mean, some have sold about $100 billion last year of overseas assets, they bring the money back. What that means to me is not only have we then lost a key supporter of the dollar, but the key supporter of the dollar has actually turned into a sell-out because most of Saudi's assets have tended to be in dollar assets. If they're repatriating to finance their domestic fiscal position, this is creating a negative flow for the dollar by the time when U.S. needs to be borrowing more from the rest of the world.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. Paul and Guy, thank you so much. Guy Stear there, Head of Research at Societe Generale, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management, and we'll be talking a little bit about luxury and Italian reform next.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Joining us now is Michele Norsa, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico, former Ferragamo Chief Executive, as well as current Board Member of Rocco Forte Hotels and Ermenegildo Zegna, just as a couple of examples. Paul Donovan from UBS is also still with us. So, Paul, thank you so much for sticking around. Michele, welcome to the program. So last time we saw each other was actually overlooking the coliseum in Rome, and this was after the elections, straight after the elections. What have we learned in the last month? Italian politics is difficult but is the economy strong enough to withhold it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NORSA</emphasis>:  I think that (inaudible) have surprises. When I was there in Rome on March 5th with just had the first result, and they were saying that it was worst possible situation. In fact, it is proving to be a situation where, anyhow, a majority will be very thin, it is not a big chance to have a government with a strong majority. But there have been two important steps. One, the change in both Five Start and the League because they have started working on programs, they have been able to elect the Head of Senate and Chamber in 48 hours and they seem to be much more flexible than people expected. This doesn't mean that this alliance is going to be done. There are still other alternatives. The second point is nobody wants to vote again, mostly the members. Two-third of the members are new, so they want at least to stay there one year. But if they can, they will stay even longer. So there will be possibly majorities are also very afraid (ph), but based on 30, 40, 50 votes, when it is secured, which can move from one side to another.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But, Michele Norsa, this is a point that we were making at the day after the election is, first, what do Chief Executives want. So do they need reforms, maybe more labor, do they need the banks dealt with? And actually, is there a huge difference between what Chief Executives want and what the person on the street want? Because actually there was a recovery in Italy, but a lot of the people on the streets don't feel it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NORSA</emphasis>:  The bane risk is the volatility because we have no history about these parties and these people, they have never managed the -- not even a city or a region, in some regions, the League in the north. But it is very difficult to predict. I think there is a lack of economies, there is a lack of people with strong political history, international relationship network, this is going to miss. On the other side, you have a feeling that the new has more energy, is moving faster and is also changing faster. So the whole piece (ph), they can adapt to a situation, maybe get some injection from outside of high profile people, not for technical government, but I think a government with some injection of know-how and seniority.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Paul, let me bring you over to my chart. This is a ten-year and we actually chart it. So this is the Italian ten-year compared to the Spanish ten-year. Is this the right one to look at or do you chart it next to Germany? What's fair to compare it with?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  I think given that we're also looking to the ECB to be ending its bond buying program at some point before the end of this year. It's probably better to be looking against Spain. Because, obviously, the trouble with comparing the ten-year against Germany is the ten-year Germany is distorted very much by the ECB's bond buying program, whereas it tends to be a shorter dated Italian and Spanish bonds that are bought by the ECB. So I think that this is probably a better indication. But basically, I think, what that chart is saying is most Italian debt is owned by Italians. And Italians are relatively used to political uncertainty. As you were probably (ph) mentioning it, they have quite a lot of experience of political uncertainty --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Well, a lot of governments for sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  -- a lot of governments over the last 70 years. So I don't think Italian investors are panicked about what is happening in this, and there's a reason for them to panic at this stage. And as a result, we've got some reaction in the bond market, but it's hardly an abnormal reaction compared to recent history.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes. I guess, Michele Norsa, you said on many boards and a lot of them are hospitality or luxury. But these are companies that are doing very well because they're looking abroad, right? Is the Italian consumer consuming?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NORSA</emphasis>:  This is the point. I think that the Italian economy is growing because of export and because of tourism. Tourism, there is not much attention, but tourism is as big as fashion and food together. And this is potentially an area of development. Luxury is not suffering that much because, in fact, you have a distribution worldwide for nobody (ph) for companies like Ferragamo. They represent 10%, not more, and so you can compensate with other markets doing better. The concern is I think with the duties. It could take as to an increase in prices, because at the end, everybody will increase. Nobody decreases. So if you have to compensate, then you to align the prices. And you always align going up and not going down. And this could be also a negative influence on the inflation, for example, in some country. But the market is still doing -- it's not the growth that we were used to. It would be a more selective growth. But there is still room for geographical expansion, for perimeter, and there's room for diversification. The point is that the companies will clearly separate winners and losers. It's not as it used to be. So the potential is quite different. If you look at the single shares, you will see how these two groups are moving.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Michele Norsa, would you worry -- if you're a Chief Executive today from a luxury brand, and we'll talk about luxury in a second, do you worry about your supply chain because of the noise on tariffs and trade?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NORSA</emphasis>:  No. Honestly, I think that the luxury supply chain is quite unique. You cannot change. If you go down to mass (ph) market or sportswear, you have alternatives. But if you want to stay luxury at France, Italy, mostly France, okay, you can do a (inaudible) in Spain, you can go there. But you'll never go to a different because the quality and the perception of a customer is the value. If you change the supply chain, then you lose your soul.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Thank you so much. Michele Norsa there, former Chief Executive at Ferragamo, now, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico, and Paul Donovan from UBS Wealth Management, both stay with us.  </p><p>      Michele Norsa, Industrial Partner at Fondo Strategico and former Ferragamo Chief Executive, and Paul Donovan from UBS are both still with us. Michele Norsa, when you look at, I guess, how people consume luxury online, what's more important for a Chief Executive to get it right? So the online or actually how the Chinese consume?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NORSA</emphasis>:  They are both important. I think it's easier to grow the Chinese consumption because they are growing by number, they are growing by welfare, they growing by traveling. And so it's something which is moving with an organic -- on an organic trend. Online has always been surprising, some time in a good sense but mostly in a negative. Everybody expected ten years ago that now there would be more than 10% of luxury both online, which has happened in the United States already, it's close to happen in the U.K., but globally still, you're talking about mid single-digit. And most companies are not even disclosing the number yet in their balance sheet.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Are you expecting that to pick up or is it just because of touch and feel? And also when you spend L1,000 or L2,000 for a dress or suit, you want to touch it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NORSA</emphasis>:  This is the reason and, of course, in the United States, they are more used in receiving, sending back, receiving, sending back, which is not as easy in other countries, for example, in China. But I think one risk which is an older technology is, really, the brand evolution. So if you look at the online operators of maybe the five, six companies which are dealing with luxury goods, they always have a trend, a perception as a discounting offers, special sales. Plus you have seen the problem of a counterfeit or fake or other brands, production of other brands mostly in Asia and China. So companies are still very cautious in moving massively towards the online. I was reading yesterday, there is a prediction which is -- which I don't believe earlier is from a big (ph) company who says, by 2025, online business could be 25%. I don't see this kind of growth because companies are getting more cautious, they're trying to get the online business inside, not to deal with counterparts, which are unreliable sometimes, totally unreliable like in Asia.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Paul, this was also translated also into your world, right, and how you look at economics and trying to figure out shopping habits in the future.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  So one of the things that I think is coming out as part of the fourth industrial revolution concept is, in many ways, we're sort of reinventing the first industrial revolution which brought in for the very first time shopping a leisure activity just like Wedgwood (ph) was really basically created shopping as a leisure activity. And I think that's something which we're now seeing. So with luxury, if you're shopping for luxury, for the most part, this is a leisure activity, this is a special occasion. You go to a store, you have very sales staff who are very helpful and you buy something special, whereas if I'm doing the weekly shop for cleaning equipment for home and laundry detergent, this is not quite such a special experience for me and far more likely to do that online. And I think this division is going to be quite important. And it sort of emphasizes one of the key things about the fourth industrial revolution and this fear that we're all going to be replaced by robots and so on. That's not necessarily the case because you want the personal experience of being helped by a sales assistant in the store if you're buying luxury, you want the human interaction. You don't want an unanimous -- please click here and enter your credit card number if you're going for the luxury experience. So I think that this is, in many ways, symptomatic of what is happening in the broader economy that we're going to see this gravitation towards online retail for regular growth sort of mundane shopping, but then shopping as a leisure experience perhaps reaching yet another level as it did in the late 1700's  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NORSA</emphasis>:  And there is also another distinction. Local people are more attracted in some countries, like the United States and China, which are very (inaudible) to buy online because they cannot reach your store. But travelers, they really travel for the pleasure of spending time at (inaudible) Zegna, at Ferragamo and Valentino. It is a pleasure to get there. You'll see things you don't find in online. So I think there will be a development of the online business specializing really in luxury. When they ask me Amazon could be difficult to think.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONOVAN</emphasis>:  And I think also there are -- some consumers will have a different experience as well. Some consumers regard luxury almost as being like shopping to (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Guys, thank you so much.

President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is looking for unity on tax reform. Earlier today he said that he would be making some changes to the framework that was originally unveiled last month. The announcement comes as key senators raise concerns with the specifics of the plan which includes eliminating the state and local tax deduction.</p><p>Let's bring in <person><nameText>Paul Krugman. </nameText></person>He's Nobel Prize-winning economist, columnist of the New York Times and a professor at the City University of New York.</p><p>Professor Krugman, it's an honor to have you on the show. Thank you so much.</p><p><person><nameText>PAUL KRUGMAN, </nameText></person>PROFESSOR OF ECOMONICS AND NOBEL PRIZE-WINNING ECONOMIST, UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK: Great to be on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Prospects for tax reform for this administration?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, you know, I can never - I'm not a legislative expert. I mean, intellectually it's completely incoherent. They seem to have fallen - they seem to have lost the thread on what it is they're trying to do. They have no way to actually accomplish, you know, anything that looks remotely like deficit neutrality without actually sharply raising taxes on a lot of middle class people. So, it's a mess. Now, that wouldn't be the first time that something that was a mess made it through Congress. But, it's not looking very good.</p><p>JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: When you say that it's completely incoherent, what do you mean by that? When you look at the range of policies, what stands out to you as not making any sense?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, first of all, you know, they keep on saying Americans are overtaxed - the highest taxed country - that's a lie. We're not. Actually, we're just about the lowest taxed among major countries. But, still they keep on implying that they're going to do a tax cut for middle income people. They keep on saying, well, we're not going to - you know, we're responsible fiscally. And, yet, there's no way you can have what they really, really want, which is a huge tax cut for businesses - this pass- through thing which would be a huge tax cut for people with high incomes without somehow or other raising taxes on a lot of people to pay for it. So, they haven't figured out a way to make the thing hang together at all.</p><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: And, don't forget the middle class tax cut that they've been promising as well.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, there is no middle class tax cut in there. In fact, there's a substantial middle class - you know, random pieces of the middle class tax increase in everything we've seen so far. So, yeah - they - I mean, they had a couple of ways they thought they were going to be able to pay for it, one of which involved, you know, repealing the Affordable Care Act .</p><p>FU: That didn't go so well.</p><p>KRUGMAN: The other of which involved the border tax adjustment. Since both of those have died, now they have absolutely no idea how to make the arithmetic work.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You just pushed back on the idea that the United States is one of the highest taxed. You said actually it's one of the lowest.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. If you just take taxes as a share of GDP .</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Then among advanced countries, we're right at the bottom. Now, you know, there were - you can try to make some excuses. We have a relatively high top-line corporate tax rate .</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: But on the other hand we have lots and lots of deductions and so on. So, our effective corporate tax rate is only sort of normal and our individual taxes are definitely low. So, it's amazing that Trump just repeats this again and again. And, it's as flatly false as anything there is in the world.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: On the corporate tax side, leaving aside the individual taxes for the moment - on the corporate tax side, are there ways that you think that taxes could be reformed in a productive way that would make things more efficient - more logical?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, it's actually kind of funny. The reform that Paul Ryan originally floated early this year - the destination-based cash flow tax which included the border tax adjustment, was a not stupid idea. In fact, it was one of the few things I've seen from Paul Ryan .</p><p>WEISENTHAL: This is a big moment where <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>is praising something that Paul Ryan .</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Not stupid.</p><p>KRUGMAN: No. It's actually - in fact it has kind of bipartisan support among tax experts. People like Alan Auerbach were saying this is a good idea. I support - so, and of course, it being the one thing that I've seen from Paul Ryan that was really not a terrible idea, it died instantly in the political arena. And, without that - without the border tax adjustment that's a piece of that, there's no way to make a significant corporate - you know, cut in corporate marginal tax rates that doesn't explode the deficit.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'll ask you about Art Laffer and the Laffer Curve and the implications for Kansas and what happened there.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is that a specific example of where something didn't go wrong because they made mistakes or does that theory just be - has been blown out of the water by the example?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, it's been blown out of the water by every single example we've seen, right? There has been not a single case where anything like the Laffer Curve has seemed to be true. I mean, there was Kansas - I mean a state level is actually an especially favorable case for it because capital labor can easily flow into a state. So, the chances that cutting taxes might actually increase revenue is much higher .</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: At the level of one state than it is for the United States as a whole. And, even so, all it did in Kansas was create a fiscal crisis. And, nothing - look, the Clinton tax hike was supposed to destroy the economy. Then we had the best boom of the post-war era. Obama substantially increased taxes in 2013. Nothing terrible happened. So, this is a - there is nothing supporting this point of view except the fact that some very rich people would like it to be true.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, based on all that, wouldn't (ph) we understand the impact of tax cuts in aggregate, is that a fair argument to make - a fair point to make?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, there is very little reason to think that tax cuts matter much one way or the other for underlying growth. I mean, the (base) would have to cut taxes is you cut tax collection. That's basically what happens.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: If you're arguing this case, that actually a lot of the financing is going to be provided by higher growth as a result of the tax cuts .</p><p>KRUGMAN: You might as well just assume that unicorns will come and deliver packages of money, right? There's no reason to believe this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: OK.</p><p>FU: I need to ask you about healthcare, because the President says that he plans to sign executive action to allow new health plans outside of Obamacare, creating more healthcare options for people. That's his sell. Now, experts say this would destabilize already fragile markets. So, what happens in the interim? Because, whatever plan he does open this up to wouldn't take affect right away.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. The thing however is you have - you know insurers have to make decisions about whether to participate in the market. They have to submit requests for premiums. So all of this - all of this is uncertainty is wreaking huge damage already. So, you know, premiums are going way up for 2018 and most of that - most of that is because of the Trump administration and the uncertainty it's created.</p><p>FU: So can it survive until 2019?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, yes, because most people - even in the individual market, most people are receiving subsidies which cushion them from the increases. And, then there's Medicaid, which is unaffected by all of this. So, it gets worse but it doesn't collapse.</p><p>FU: Right. Nobel Prize-winning economist Professor <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>is sticking with us for the next hour.</p><p>Coming up next we're going to talk about the President's search for the next fed chair and whether the central banks' independence is perhaps at risk.</p><p>This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: What'd You Miss? Concern that the search for the next fed chair may take a political turn - Nobel Prize-winning economist <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>wrote in his column last week \"surely it's possible, even probable that the Federal Reserve, like other government agencies, is about the get Trumpified, that one of American policies last remaining havens of competence and expertise will soon share in the general degradation.\"</p><p>Professor Krugman is back with us and not holding back on opinion here. What is an example of a Trumpified fed pick versus one that showcases the fed's competence and expertise?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, there's a very clear dichotomy here, right? We have a perfectly fine fed chair who could be reappointed. Janet Yellen has probably every indicator - done a stellar job. Why not just keep her? On the other hand we - for a while there, the betting (ph) was kind of - the prediction markets were thinking that the most likely pick was Kevin Warsh, former fed governor who has - there's a lot of things you can say about them (ph) - but, one thing is he does have a track record over the past decade and it's quite consistent. He's been wrong about everything.</p><p>FU: Economic forecast .</p><p>KRUGMAN: Economic forecast, worried about inflation as the world was sliding into depression, worried that terrible things - thought that fiscal policy was going to be - you know, we were going to turn into Greece. It's amazing. It's kind of almost awesome. You can almost make money by taking whatever he thinks is going to happen and betting the other way - but, politically correct from a republican point of view - has some family connections with Trump. So, that would have been - you know, he might still be appointed, although apparently his stock has declined a little bit.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: How much do you weigh concern of a - what you would see as a bad pick, and obviously it sounds like you don't think Kevin Warsh would be a good pick .</p><p>KRUGMAN: Right.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: A bad pick versus a pick who is perceived to be at Trump's beck and call - and so, Trump calling him out - him or her out on Twitter for a rate hike - stuff like that. Which of those would concern you more?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, boy, both. I mean, in some ways - I think those go together. I don't think they really separate, because you had somebody who was actually good and respected within the fed and respects the institution of the fed - that person is also not going to be particularly pressurable by the White House. So, it's a - if you had somebody who had no real reason for being there except the fact that Trump decided that he liked him or her, although it's going to be a him, if that's who it is - then that would then be the kind of person you would worry about being politicized.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We've seen U-turns on many occasions in <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Do you think there's a chance here that his criticism of Janet Yellen was made perhaps before he'd spoken to people who may have known more about monetary policy and actually having learned subsequently - he's perhaps realizing that continuity of the fed might not be a bad thing and actually reappoint Janet Yellen at the end?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, I'm hoping so. I mean, that would be the best outcome I think given what's happening right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But, you don't think .</p><p>KRUGMAN: You know, his U-turns tend to be followed by further U-turns. Every time you think he's reached a reasonable agreement on something, then he finds a way to go back on it. So, I worry about that, even here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Even there.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Speaking of Janet Yellen, and speaking - getting away from the question of who the next fed chair is going to be, one of the most notable things going on in the economy is the persistent failure of the fed or the economy overall to get to 2 percent inflation - to hit the inflation goal (ph). In light of what we've seen over the last several years - all of the things that have tried - have you changed or evolved in your thinking of what the fed can do to hit inflation? What have you learned about the fed and inflation by watching this persistent short-fall?</p><p>KRUGMAN: OK. There's two different things. One is monetary policy just doesn't have that much traction when interest rates are very low. That still remains true. Even though the fed has normalized a little bit, we're still kind of in that regime .</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Where the fed - all of the attention is on the fed and yet the fed has much less power than it would in what we used to think of as normal times.</p><p>The other thing is, there is something going on in the inflation process. It looks as if - you know, whether it's the natural rate of unemployment, if such a thing exists, is weighed down, or the Phillips Curve has gotten flatter or there's downward nominal wage rigidity or something. But, something - clearly the underlying models we were using to try to predict inflation, which were never very good, are now looking completely useless (ph).</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Do you have a favorite theory or explanation for what that something is?</p><p>KRUGMAN: I think it's a mix - there still being pent-up wage cuts that don't want to happen and there's just sort of - there's still an overhang from the past. And, I think there's nervousness. I think that people having been through the Great Recession and the long, slow recovery are just very reluctant to grant or demand wage increases that might end up being locked in during the next slump.</p><p>FU: So, does that mean that the Federal Reserve should re-think its approach to targeting 2 percent inflation? Should it give up that target?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, no, on the contrary. I mean, everything we've seen that says that 2 percent inflation is if anything, too low, that given that we've seen how hard it is to get inflation up once it's too low, given that it's - I'm a secularist stagnation guy - that we really need to have the opportunity of having significantly negative real interest rates, that the fed's target should be above 2 percent .</p><p>FU: What - 3 percent?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, I would - I mean, I would - I'm old enough. I'm older than all you guys. I remember a 4 percent. I remember Reagan's second term when we had 4 percent inflation. It wasn't so bad. It gave you a lot more room for monetary policy. So, I would go there. It's not - it's a long way from being politically acceptable but, no - by no means to say that because we're having trouble getting to the 2 percent target which actually looks too low, that we should give up on even trying to get there.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Could the fed be not hiking right now? If you were a fed chair, would you not be .</p><p>KRUGMAN: I would not be hiking right now. I think the fed is trying to normalize and that version of normality went out the window ten years ago.</p><p>FU: Economist <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>is sticking with us, because we're talking about changing political dynamics in the age of Trump. We can take that in many directions.</p><p>From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: What'd You Miss? Republican Senator Bob Corker is in open opposition to the President, calling the White House \"an adult daycare center,\" and worrying whether President Trump can lead the nation to a Third World War - or, whether he would. But, perhaps the real battle is within the Republican Party itself.</p><p>We're back with <person><nameText>Paul Krugman, </nameText></person>Nobel Prize-winning economist.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Paul, one of the interesting things about Corker's comments is he said, \"There are a lot of people within my caucus who feel the same way I do.\" But of course, none of them have really called out Trump to the same degree. What do you think the reluctance is all about?</p><p>KRUGMAN: It's about their political careers. I mean, you know, I've been paying attention to this stuff for a long time and I read a lot. Today's republican legislators - people in the senate and even more so in the house, they grew up in an era of a monolithic, very tightly organized Republican Party.</p><p>These are not people who courageously staked out a position that might have been unpopular. These are people who joined the political machine that guaranteed them a good living, even if they lost an election, right? We call it \"wingnut welfare,\" all of that, right? And, so they are not - these are apparatchiks. These are not people who are going to step out and take a stand on principle. It's not the kind of people they are. It would require a lot of - Corker turns out to be a more interesting guy than we thought. But, it's also he's decided that his political career is over. There are going to be very few who are willing to do that, even under the most extreme circumstances.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But, you've got now Senator John McCain of course as well, who is getting treatment for brain cancer and you've got Bob Corker - so you've got two kind of .</p><p>KRUGMAN: So, people who are on the edge of retirement or possibly don't have very long to live are willing to say something that I don't think is going to be enough to be an effectively large caucus.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But, in terms of trying to get legislation through, losing two big senators like that actually, is critical for the GOP.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, that's right. And, remember, we already - we already saw Obamacare repeal crash and burn .</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Tax reform or tax reform tax or whatever it is they're trying to do on taxes is in big trouble. So, it's quite possible that they'll have a completely sterile legislative agenda - and - which, you know, from my point of view is a good thing. In any case, yes. They don't have the kind of margin that would allow them to push stuff through if they have even a few people who decide, oh, the hell with it, I'm just going to say what I think.</p><p>FU: Well, the party is in a little bit of a dilemma here, because they've rallied around principles that seem to be in opposition to themselves. For instance, they want tax cuts on investment income to boost the economy. They want tax cuts for the middle class, all the while avoiding widening the budget deficit. You can't have one without the other.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Right.</p><p>FU: Something's got to give and no one is willing to concede any of that.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. We have a phrase that's in other circumstances but it works in international economics - we talk about the impossible trinity. There are three different things that everybody wants and you can only have two of them. And, they've definitely got themselves in the impossible trinity.</p><p>They also have the problem which is that Trump sold himself to his base as a populist - I'm going to help you against the swamp and against the big guys and then everything that they're trying to do legislatively is standard republican - you know, let's give more to the oligarchy.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: How do you think the tension is going to resolve ultimately? Because, it does seem like there's - you know, the McConnell wing and the Trump wing are distinct, especially in how they see the economy and populism - taxes perhaps. Ultimately do you think the old McConnell wing will just completely be swept out?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, no. If you actually look at concrete legislative measures - look at what Trump has actually proposed or at least signed on to - first on healthcare and now on taxes, it's totally been McConnell Ryan wing. There's been no hint at all of that economic populism in anything he actually does. He talks a populist game but in fact his populism never translates into economics.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p>KRUGMAN: He's populist on, you know, race relations. He's populist on culture war. But, on economics, there's been no - it appears to be entirely just rhetoric.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So far he hasn't gotten anything done. So, if he actually tries to get legislation passed - I mean he called Chuck Schumer apparently on Friday to try and get something done on healthcare. The risk is that perhaps he tries to see what he can get away with on tax cuts, if not tax reform. Does the sort of bipartisan outreach become the end-game here if he wants to get things done, because he's a deal-maker? He wants action - results.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, the thing about him as a deal-maker is he tends to re-neg on all of his deals, right? They thought they had a deal on the dreamers. He now suddenly .</p><p>FU: Now they're outraged.</p><p>KRUGMAN: He said, \"I'm willing to deal on healthcare.\" But, you know, now he seems to be imposing other conditions. So, you know, who's going to make a deal with him now, really?</p><p>FU: So, what should the democrats do during this time where they may possibly be working with the President on some kind of deal even though they're not confident it's going to come to fruition - because they themselves are at risk of fracturing or splintering into an extreme left and a shrinking moderate presence (ph)?</p><p>KRUGMAN: I think that's much exaggerated. If you look on policy substance, there's really not a whole lot of division. You know, we talk about different wings of the Democratic Party but in fact the whole party is pretty much unified in anything that involves policy in the medium term.</p><p>FU: Well, right now they're unified against <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>KRUGMAN: And, they're also unified for, you know, we're going to defend Obamacare - maybe we'd like single-payer eventually, but even if you look at the standard single-payer plan, most of it is a transition to a public option. So, I think it's much less real division there. I think what the democrats probably do is they, you know, sound flexible, they talk with Trump - they make it clear, we need to talk with Trump, but they don't actually offer him anything much because, why? They know that they'll get shafted if they do and they know that the base will be angry if they do.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Sounds like the debt raise (ph), actually, doesn't it? They actually didn't give up anything and Trump did (ph).</p><p><person><nameText>Paul Krugman, </nameText></person>Nobel Prize-winning economist joins us for the market close. Stay with us. From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>1556</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>1559</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What'd You Miss? Stocks climb to a record high, as the dollar weakens.</p><p>I'm Julia CHATTERLEY.</p><p>FU: I'm Scarlet Fu.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: And, I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p><p>If you're tuning in live on Twitter, we want to welcome you to our closing bell coverage every weekday from 4 to 5 pm Eastern.</p><p>FU: Let's begin with Market Minutes. Look, it's another day of record highs here for the Dow and the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ. You could see gains of anywhere from one-tenth of 1 percent to three-tenths of 1 percent. So, the big tech names are probably lagging behind, given the NASDAQ's smaller gain than the other two.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes, but new highs once again. It's pretty remarkable. The melt-up .</p><p>FU: The melt-up continues.</p><p>All right. Let's look at some individual names here - Proctor &amp; Gamble declaring victory in its bid to keep Nelson Pelts off its board, even as Nelson Pelts' activist hedge fund try-in (ph) said the vote is still too close to call. So, that stock is down just by half of 1 percent.</p><p>Wal-Mart gaining almost 5 percent. That's a big move for Wal-Mart after announcing a $20 billion stock buy-back. Also, it says it expects U.S. e- commerce sales to surge 40 percent in the next fiscal year.</p><p>And, a quick mention here of UAL and American Air. United Continental surging after bolstering of financial outlook despite hurricanes and a continued fare war and of course as expert (ph) analysts raise their earnings forecast you can see American Airlines getting a little bit of a lift from that as well.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Finally, let's go to the government bond market - very quiet today - hardly anything going on. Tier (ph) yields unchanged. Ten-year yields down moderately. Remember bond yields was closed yesterday for Columbus Day, so this is catch-up - really nothing going on here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And, that (inaudible) in what we saw in the FX markets as well. I'm showing you a seven-day here for the dollar index. That's actually not a pretty chart, but the dollar is lower for a third day versus most of the G10 tiers (ph). I mean, we talked about those concerns about tax reform. I think we just have to take it as a pause, and the recent rallying looking like its run out of steam.</p><p>I'm showing you what's going on in Euro dollar too. Of course, we have that Catalonian presidential talk or speech today to Parliament, stepping back from the prospect of unilateral declaration of independence - he wants to engage. We have got the Euro there above 118, the figure. I also want to show you what's going on in that Euro dollar - sorry, in sterling as well. The rally now that we've seen this week to around 1 percent manufacturing and construction outcome beating (inaudible). The data is showing a pretty mixed picture I'd say for the U.S. economy here, but still more chatter about the Bank of England raising rates in November with a one and done move.</p><p>FU: And, just a quick update here on stocks, the Dow finished at a record but the S&amp;P and NASDAQ fell just short.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Finally, on commodities, let's look at oil and gold - oil gaining nearly 3 percent, rising optimism that more countries are going to join with OPEC to cut production. So, some hope (ph) diminished supply up - back up about $50 a barrel in West Texas intermediate to run 51. And, gold futures, gaining again up to just over 12.90 an ounce.</p><p>And, those are today's Market Minutes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Well, you may see a post-election market rally that wasn't predicted. We're still here with <person><nameText>Paul Krugman, </nameText></person>Nobel Prize-winning economist.</p><p>Paul, you made the call that markets would tank if President Trump were elected.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Right. And, I retracted it very soon afterwards. And, you know, I did what you should never ever do, which is to let your political, you know, biases, interfere with your judgment. I thought, this is a terrible thing, which it was, but it isn't necessarily going to be terrible for every indicator. And, so, this is a mea culpa. I did that already.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you did.</p><p>KRUGMAN: This was me doing exactly what I tell people not to do. And, you know, it's going to happen. We're all mortal. One thing is worth saying, by the way. We talk about there's a Trump bump. There's also a Merkel bump, a Macron bump, a (inaudible) bump, an (inaudible) bump - stock markets have been up all around the world. So, something's going on. People like stocks.</p><p>What is the - I always quote my old teacher, Paul Samuelson (ph), who said that the stock market had predicted nine of the last five recessions. The market may not be telling us much of anything at all, except that for some reason people are liking stocks.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We have a viewer question actually, and I think you've kind of already answered it there, asking whether the Trump stock bump reflects a fundamental change to the economy or just the expectation that business owners will eat a larger piece of the pie with employees and the public at large eating less pie and more externalities like dirty air and water?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes, or it might just reflect the fact that investors think that other investors are going to pay more for stocks. I mean, it doesn't have to mean anything much at all.</p><p>Let me say, just I am little surprised that the market doesn't worry more about the downside of a totally catastrophic response if something bad happens, you know? What if we have something really bad happen and they handle everything the way they handled Puerto Rico? That ought to be some kind of weight on the market. But, we know that markets tend not to - tend to ignore those things until they actually do happen.</p><p>FU: You know, I wanted to play for you a comment from Richard Thaler, the Nobel Prize-winning economist ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>FU: On what he thinks about what's going on the stock market. Take a listen.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD THALER, NOBEL PRIZE WINNING ECONOMIST: I don't know about you, but I'm nervous and it seems like when investors are nervous, they're prone to being spooked and nothing seems to spook the market. As you said, it just crawls up, slowly but surely. And, if it's all based on the expectation of some big tax cut, surely investors should have lost confidence that that was going to happen, given what's happened so far out of Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FU: Especially what we've heard of late, Joe, which is the President is going to back to tweak the tax proposal.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right. So, there's all this uncertainty as you said, like we've seen an example of disaster response and .</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Hasn't been impressive. There is active saber rattling about North Korea now almost every other day - threat of our military conflict. So, is your theory that basically markets are not really good forward discounters - basically just take into account what already happened?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. We - it's not - that isn't even a theory. That's an observation. We know. And, some of us again remember - you know, remember the housing bubble. And, it was - that was the clearest thing I'd ever seen in my life. That was just overwhelming in numbers. And, yet, month after month the prices kept on rising and people kept saying, oh, there's no - if there were really a bubble, surely it would have burst by now. And, then one day it did.</p><p>FU: Do you see a bubble right now?</p><p>KRUGMAN: It's much less clear. Let's put it - there were - profits are high. Interest rates are still very low so it makes kind of sense for stock prices to be high, given that. It's more - in this case I don't see it's a really overwhelming bubble. I just think that there's a disaster risk that the markets are not taking into account.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When we ask people about this though they say, look, for the first time in two decades, maybe more, we've got this synchronous growth pattern when they look around the world and actually that lifts all boats. Do you buy that?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, not necessarily, because sometimes a synchronous growth pattern means that interests rates rise which tends to - and, that's not happening. So, I don't - you know, at some level - look, Bob Schiller famously - he did a study during the '87 stock crash and he asked people, why are you selling - in real time, using fax machines, because that's all you had at the time, and the only answer that appeared with any frequency - you know, there were all kinds of (inaudible) for rationalizations (ph) - the only answer was, I'm selling because stocks - because prices are falling. I think people are buying stocks because prices are rising. And, I think that's all that's really gone .</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Well, we have a show, so we have to have better (inaudible) than that. If only people just gave us those (inaudible).</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We need to (inaudible).</p><p>FU: Now, in terms of the economy, I wanted to get your sense of the labor market, because you can't really read too much in the latest jobs report. Yet, people were saying, oh, look at the participation rate, it's gone up. Look at earnings. It's gone up. What do you take away from the latest couple of reports and what it says about the economy?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. I'm having a hard time figuring out what the - lately I've been looking at actually at the QUIPS rate, which is back up to normal levels. And, that seems to be signaling that we really are kind of - people seem to feel that it's OK to leave a job because they can find another one, which suggests that we are kind of at full employment. Earnings are not really showing that. Wage increases are still sub-par. But, you know, maybe - and, also it's interesting that prime age labor reports participation is creeping back up to previous levels. So, all the people who said, this is structural, it really is nothing - turns out, no, it's just lack of jobs. So, there's some actual good stuff. And, I wouldn't take one month's number on the NFP very much.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: And, just a reminder. We're going to get the QUIPS rate tomorrow - the JOLTS number comes out tomorrow, so something to watch.</p><p>FU: Perfect timing.</p><p>All right. Nobel Prize-winning economist <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>will be sticking with us. We're going to talk about urban policy and perhaps how to avoid disasters like Hurricane Harvey in Houston - or at least it could have been minimized.</p><p>From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: What'd You Miss? We are back now with Nobel Prize-winning economist, <person><nameText>Paul Krugman. </nameText></person>And, we turn our focus to urban policy and infrastructure.</p><p>Professor, you've written about the flooding disaster that was caused by Hurricane Harvey in Houston and how it was largely due to bad policy, including unregulated development.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>FU: Some estimates have the storm causing up to $200 billion dollars in damage.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>FU: So, what's the lesson here? What should be done differently?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, in Houston it's pretty clear. People have been warning about this for a long time, that it essentially - too much of it is paved. You need to have places to drain. You need to have - you know, you have to - you cannot just - in (ph) what is very much a place that nature wants to flood occasionally - even the side (ph) climate change that wants to happen, even more so now - if you have completely unregulated development then you end up with no place for water to go.</p><p>Now the funny this is - the thing that makes it agonizing is, on the other hand, in some ways Houston does it right by not restricting development in ways that prevent people from building housing. So, you know, you have a kind of extreme San Francisco-style which is nimbyism gone wild .</p><p>FU: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Which is disastrous. And, Houston is a - has much, much cheaper housing because it didn't do that.</p><p>On the other hand, you have complete, you know, ignoring the environmental consequences of unrestricted development and we seem to find it very hard politically to find the balance there.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right. You know, if you look at all the other boom cities over the last decade, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco - completely unaffordable for homeowners for the middle class - Houston has been a success story on this front - you know, a thriving city economically where middle class people can afford to buy a home.</p><p>KRUGMAN: That's right. No. If you look at - I mean, when they (ph) ask why does Texas grow faster in general than the rest of the country, it's none of the things that the Texans like to boast about. It's not because of low taxes. It's not because they're cruel to the poor. It's because they have a housing policy that lets you build houses which the northeast, and even worse, the far west, do not have. But - so, that's a good thing. But, you know, you have to have some place for the water to go when there's a hurricane and they haven't done that.</p><p>So, it's a real - it - no one seems to - I mean, the only city that seems to have adequate regulation - big city, and affordable housing, is Chicago. Unfortunately they've also got Chicago winters, so I don't know what you do about that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, but can you steal (ph) from them in terms of the way they've tackled this, because as you say, I mean, it's kind of bad city planning - the zoning laws - and, we've talked about them on this show before in Houston, also a huge problem. But, then you compare it to San Francisco as well and say actually, look at the situation that they've created, where people have extreme commuting, which actually I've never even heard about.</p><p>KRUGMAN: No. Well, we have - you know, we have some of that here. I know people - a couple of people who live in Bucks County and commute to Manhattan.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How long does that take?</p><p>KRUGMAN: About two hours.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. (Inaudible) four hours and .</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. No. It's - the thing is, technically there are no problems. We know how to do this. We know what should be done. It's easy to throw up a list. The question is, how .</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Politics.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Politics. And, I don't know if we've found a way to make that happen. It just seems to be - you know, de Blasio came in with very good ideas about trying to expand affordable housing and he's done what in absolute terms is quite a lot in New York. But, of course it's such a huge city that it's just a drop in the bucket relative to the size of the problem.</p><p>FU: How much are we going to rely on local politicians, city mayors, state governors to do a lot of the work here, because everything is so gummed up at the federal level?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, first of all, this is going to have to be local policy in any case.</p><p>FU: Sure.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Sure, it is going to require local politicians. The trouble - I mean, when people talk about decentralization, the fact of the matter is, by and large, with many - with honorable exceptions, but a lot of local politicians are really pretty terrible. Not that many people vote in state and local elections and so you'll often - you have machine politicians.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You're not getting the best people .</p><p>KRUGMAN: On the whole, even - you know, much as I can denounce stuff that goes on in Congress, I'm not sure that there are many state legislatures (ph) that I would prefer.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Is there something here in New York City when you look at regulations of the housing marking that you think could be done that a mayor or city council could do to ease housing crisis?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, sure. I mean, even though we're an enormously enormous city and very dense, there's still lots of potential building. There's lots of places where we could still build up. There's still in fact land that is un-built that could be built without destroying the quality of life. There is - you know, if you're going to have a city - a metro area with 20 plus billion (ph) people, you're going to have to have some really dense developments. And, look, I live - I actually checked - my zip code has got about 70,000 per square mile. It doesn't feel impossibly overcrowded. You know, it's high rises. You can live that way and we need more of that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Nobel Prize-winning economist <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>is staying with us.</p><p>Up next we get his take on the political uncertainty in Europe. From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Catalonia backs away from declaring independence outright. The Catalan president opted for a middle ground in his message to Parliament today, calling for talks with Spain. But, what will the recent fiscal uncertainty mean for Europe's economy? <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>is still with us.</p><p>Paul, let's talk about Spain to start off with. What do you think here?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, not at all familiar. I mean, I don't know Spain. I certainly don't know Catalonia. I mean, it's odd to have this timing. I mean, if you were thinking bad things were going to happen in Spain, you would have expected those three or four years ago when the Spanish economy was really in the dumps.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Spain is actually making a comeback and a fair bit of that actually in Catalonia. But, you know, having the auto industry is coming back - Spain is - it's an enormous, incredibly expensive (ph) process of internal devaluation (ph). But, they have finally been - you know, there's some light at the end of the tunnel. So, it's kind of odd to have this happening now.</p><p>Now, I understand Catalonia has in fact been deeply oppressed culturally, but you try to think about what it would mean to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain now. And, my God, it's like trying to imagine Virginia seceding again now, right? It would be a really impossible thing to happen.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But, when you look at Europe optically (ph), I mean we've got - we've had the Macron victory over in France, Angela Merkel has just come back in in Germany - yes (ph) we've got these hot spots like Italy and we've got the tensions now in Spain, but overall what's your sense of Europe at this moment?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, Europe - the Euro continues to function badly, right? The Euro was a mistake. It has been a big constraint. They paid a huge price in high unemployment but the political cohesiveness of Europe, with the exception of Britain, has turned out to be much stronger. I mean, us Anglo- Saxons didn't quite understand just how deep the commitment of much of the European elite was to it.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: In 10 years will all of the countries that are in the Euro zone still be there?</p><p>KRUGMAN: You know, if Greece wasn't going to leave the Euro with the 27 percent unemployment and a depression-level slump, who's going to leave? I think it's very, very hard. People just .</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Don't want to do that, even when the economics of it makes a lot of sense.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: They always said in Brussels, \"don't underestimate Angela Merkel's will to keep this thing together.\"</p><p>FU: No, that's a really, really good point. Yet, there is an attraction to populism, right? People in Spain, people in France can't turn away from it completely. People in Germany with AfDs .</p><p>KRUGMAN: That's right.</p><p>FU: Strong showing.</p><p>KRUGMAN: There are - everybody's got their little Trumps. Everybody's got their - and, not necessarily in countries you would think. You know, Germany - by the way, this is a demonstration that is not - economic anxiety is a very distinctly secondary thing. Germany has been the great success story this whole period. Even so, they have a resurgent hard right.</p><p>FU: All right. Well, we want to bring in some viewer questions to wrap it all up - to wrap up your hour with us.</p><p>Joe, why don't you start with this one on the broken Phillips Curve?</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Yes, so a question about the Phillips Curve - we talked about it a little bit very earlier on. What do you make of it? Some wondering if it's the changing nature of the economy from a manufacturing to a service economy - maybe it was never valid in the first place. What's your take on that debate?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. My take is that I don't really know. We're trying - look, some things we can see. We can still see that there's an awful lot - if you look at the distribution of wage changes, there's a spike at zero, which tells us that one thing that's still going on is that people - there are still people who are - really should from a market sense be taking wage cuts and because they can't, there's kind of a pent up demand for wage decline that's sitting there.</p><p>Some of it is it may be that expectations - that after years and years of inflation falling below forecasts that that is starting to get reflected in expectations. But, I have to say, all of this stuff - I have a feeling that I'm like a pre-Copernican astronomer, you know, doing epicycles trying to make this model that really doesn't want to - so, the answer is, at some level, we don't know.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Hector (ph) is asking if it's related to the transition mechanism, though - I guess in some sense, did it fall out in the wash at some point?</p><p>KRUGMAN: I don't think that there's a - I mean, I don't think that the service economy change or any of the - in general, structural change is overrated, right? Things like - the fact of the matter - that people obviously think it's easy to find jobs, should be showing up in higher wage demands. And, why it isn't showing up is still a puzzle.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: A mystery.</p><p>FU: Janet Yellen has said so as much.</p><p>All right. Final question to you: will the fed be successful in reducing its balance sheet?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, yes. I don't - that is really not - the idea (ph) that there was ever going to be a big problem there was always a fundamental misunderstanding. They have plenty of tools to offset it. If they tried to dump it all at once it would be a big problem, but I don't see any problem there.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: One last question. We just have a few seconds left. Years ago you said that big coin was even and it hasn't died yet. I'm curious whether you - what you think about it these days, because so many conversations come back to that.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes, I think it's still evil. I don't think that there is any very legitimate purpose for it. And, yes, it is kind of - it's suspended. I still think it's a Wiley Coyote thing, right?</p><p>WEISENTHAL: (Inaudible).</p><p>KRUGMAN: You run off the edge of the cliff. One day you look down and realize there's nothing under you. But, I've been saying that for years and it's been wrong all along.</p><p>FU: In the meantime, the legs are moving really, really, really fast.</p><p>KRUGMAN: That's right.</p><p>FU: <person><nameText>Paul Krugman, </nameText></person>thank you so much.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Thanks a lot.</p><p>FU: Thank you for spending the time with us.</p><p>Nobel Prize-winning economist - he's a columnist for the New York Times and of course, a professor at the City University of New York.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

President Donald Trump  is looking for unity on tax reform. Earlier today he said that he would be  making some changes to the framework that was originally unveiled last  month. The announcement comes as key senators raise concerns with the  specifics of the plan which includes eliminating the state and local tax  deduction.</p><p>Let's bring in Paul Krugman. He's Nobel Prize-winning economist, columnist  of the New York Times and a professor at the City University of New York.</p><p>Professor Krugman, it's an honor to have you on the show. Thank you so  much.</p><p>PAUL KRUGMAN, PROFESSOR OF ECOMONICS AND NOBEL PRIZE-WINNING ECONOMIST,  UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK: Great to be on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Prospects for tax reform for this administration?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, you know, I can never - I'm not a legislative expert. I  mean, intellectually it's completely incoherent. They seem to have fallen -  they seem to have lost the thread on what it is they're trying to do. They  have no way to actually accomplish, you know, anything that looks remotely  like deficit neutrality without actually sharply raising taxes on a lot of  middle class people. So, it's a mess. Now, that wouldn't be the first time  that something that was a mess made it through Congress. But, it's not  looking very good.</p><p>JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: When you say that it's completely  incoherent, what do you mean by that? When you look at the range of  policies, what stands out to you as not making any sense?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, first of all, you know, they keep on saying Americans are  overtaxed - the highest taxed country - that's a lie. We're not. Actually,  we're just about the lowest taxed among major countries. But, still they  keep on implying that they're going to do a tax cut for middle income  people. They keep on saying, well, we're not going to - you know, we're  responsible fiscally. And, yet, there's no way you can have what they  really, really want, which is a huge tax cut for businesses - this pass- through thing which would be a huge tax cut for people with high incomes  without somehow or other raising taxes on a lot of people to pay for it.  So, they haven't figured out a way to make the thing hang together at all.</p><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: And, don't forget the middle class tax cut  that they've been promising as well.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, there is no middle class tax cut in there. In fact, there's  a substantial middle class - you know, random pieces of the middle class  tax increase in everything we've seen so far. So, yeah - they - I mean,  they had a couple of ways they thought they were going to be able to pay  for it, one of which involved, you know, repealing the Affordable Care Act  ...</p><p>FU: That didn't go so well.</p><p>KRUGMAN: The other of which involved the border tax adjustment. Since both  of those have died, now they have absolutely no idea how to make the  arithmetic work.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You just pushed back on the idea that the United States is one  of the highest taxed. You said actually it's one of the lowest.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. If you just take taxes as a share of GDP ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Then among advanced countries, we're right at the bottom. Now, you  know, there were - you can try to make some excuses. We have a relatively  high top-line corporate tax rate ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: But on the other hand we have lots and lots of deductions and so  on. So, our effective corporate tax rate is only sort of normal and our  individual taxes are definitely low. So, it's amazing that Trump just  repeats this again and again. And, it's as flatly false as anything there  is in the world.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: On the corporate tax side, leaving aside the individual taxes  for the moment - on the corporate tax side, are there ways that you think  that taxes could be reformed in a productive way that would make things  more efficient - more logical?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, it's actually kind of funny. The reform that Paul Ryan  originally floated early this year - the destination-based cash flow tax  which included the border tax adjustment, was a not stupid idea. In fact,  it was one of the few things I've seen from Paul Ryan ...</p><p>WEISENTHAL: This is a big moment where Paul Krugman is praising something  that Paul Ryan ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Not stupid.</p><p>KRUGMAN: No. It's actually - in fact it has kind of bipartisan support  among tax experts. People like Alan Auerbach were saying this is a good  idea. I support - so, and of course, it being the one thing that I've seen  from Paul Ryan that was really not a terrible idea, it died instantly in  the political arena. And, without that - without the border tax adjustment  that's a piece of that, there's no way to make a significant corporate -  you know, cut in corporate marginal tax rates that doesn't explode the  deficit.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'll ask you about Art Laffer and the Laffer Curve and the  implications for Kansas and what happened there.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is that a specific example of where something didn't go wrong  because they made mistakes or does that theory just be - has been blown out  of the water by the example?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, it's been blown out of the water by every single example we've  seen, right? There has been not a single case where anything like the  Laffer Curve has seemed to be true. I mean, there was Kansas - I mean a  state level is actually an especially favorable case for it because capital  labor can easily flow into a state. So, the chances that cutting taxes  might actually increase revenue is much higher ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: At the level of one state than it is for the United States as a  whole. And, even so, all it did in Kansas was create a fiscal crisis. And,  nothing - look, the Clinton tax hike was supposed to destroy the economy.  Then we had the best boom of the post-war era. Obama substantially  increased taxes in 2013. Nothing terrible happened. So, this is a - there  is nothing supporting this point of view except the fact that some very  rich people would like it to be true.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, based on all that, wouldn't (ph) we understand the impact  of tax cuts in aggregate, is that a fair argument to make - a fair point to  make?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, there is very little reason to think that tax cuts matter  much one way or the other for underlying growth. I mean, the (base) would  have to cut taxes is you cut tax collection. That's basically what happens.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: If you're arguing this case, that actually a lot of the  financing is going to be provided by higher growth as a result of the tax  cuts ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: You might as well just assume that unicorns will come and deliver  packages of money, right? There's no reason to believe this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: OK.</p><p>FU: I need to ask you about healthcare, because the President says that he  plans to sign executive action to allow new health plans outside of  Obamacare, creating more healthcare options for people. That's his sell.  Now, experts say this would destabilize already fragile markets. So, what  happens in the interim? Because, whatever plan he does open this up to  wouldn't take affect right away.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. The thing however is you have - you know insurers have to  make decisions about whether to participate in the market. They have to  submit requests for premiums. So all of this - all of this is uncertainty  is wreaking huge damage already. So, you know, premiums are going way up  for 2018 and most of that - most of that is because of the Trump  administration and the uncertainty it's created.</p><p>FU: So can it survive until 2019?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, yes, because most people - even in the individual market,  most people are receiving subsidies which cushion them from the increases.  And, then there's Medicaid, which is unaffected by all of this. So, it gets  worse but it doesn't collapse.</p><p>FU: Right. Nobel Prize-winning economist Professor Paul Krugman is sticking  with us for the next hour.</p><p>Coming up next we're going to talk about the President's search for the  next fed chair and whether the central banks' independence is perhaps at  risk.</p><p>This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: What'd You Miss? Concern that the search for the next fed chair may  take a political turn - Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman wrote in  his column last week \"surely it's possible, even probable that the Federal  Reserve, like other government agencies, is about the get Trumpified, that  one of American policies last remaining havens of competence and expertise  will soon share in the general degradation.\"</p><p>Professor Krugman is back with us and not holding back on opinion here.  What is an example of a Trumpified fed pick versus one that showcases the  fed's competence and expertise?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, there's a very clear dichotomy here, right? We have a  perfectly fine fed chair who could be reappointed. Janet Yellen has  probably every indicator - done a stellar job. Why not just keep her? On  the other hand we - for a while there, the betting (ph) was kind of - the  prediction markets were thinking that the most likely pick was Kevin Warsh,  former fed governor who has - there's a lot of things you can say about  them (ph) - but, one thing is he does have a track record over the past  decade and it's quite consistent. He's been wrong about everything.</p><p>FU: Economic forecast ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: Economic forecast, worried about inflation as the world was  sliding into depression, worried that terrible things - thought that fiscal  policy was going to be - you know, we were going to turn into Greece. It's  amazing. It's kind of almost awesome. You can almost make money by taking  whatever he thinks is going to happen and betting the other way - but,  politically correct from a republican point of view - has some family  connections with Trump. So, that would have been - you know, he might still  be appointed, although apparently his stock has declined a little bit.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: How much do you weigh concern of a - what you would see as a  bad pick, and obviously it sounds like you don't think Kevin Warsh would be  a good pick ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: Right.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: A bad pick versus a pick who is perceived to be at Trump's beck  and call - and so, Trump calling him out - him or her out on Twitter for a  rate hike - stuff like that. Which of those would concern you more?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, boy, both. I mean, in some ways - I think those go together.  I don't think they really separate, because you had somebody who was  actually good and respected within the fed and respects the institution of  the fed - that person is also not going to be particularly pressurable by  the White House. So, it's a - if you had somebody who had no real reason  for being there except the fact that Trump decided that he liked him or  her, although it's going to be a him, if that's who it is - then that would  then be the kind of person you would worry about being politicized.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We've seen U-turns on many occasions in Donald Trump. Do you  think there's a chance here that his criticism of Janet Yellen was made  perhaps before he'd spoken to people who may have known more about monetary  policy and actually having learned subsequently - he's perhaps realizing  that continuity of the fed might not be a bad thing and actually reappoint  Janet Yellen at the end?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, I'm hoping so. I mean, that would be the best outcome I  think given what's happening right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But, you don't think ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: You know, his U-turns tend to be followed by further U-turns.  Every time you think he's reached a reasonable agreement on something, then  he finds a way to go back on it. So, I worry about that, even here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Even there.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Speaking of Janet Yellen, and speaking - getting away from the  question of who the next fed chair is going to be, one of the most notable  things going on in the economy is the persistent failure of the fed or the  economy overall to get to 2 percent inflation - to hit the inflation goal  (ph). In light of what we've seen over the last several years - all of the  things that have tried - have you changed or evolved in your thinking of  what the fed can do to hit inflation? What have you learned about the fed  and inflation by watching this persistent short-fall?</p><p>KRUGMAN: OK. There's two different things. One is monetary policy just  doesn't have that much traction when interest rates are very low. That  still remains true. Even though the fed has normalized a little bit, we're  still kind of in that regime ...</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Where the fed - all of the attention is on the fed and yet the fed  has much less power than it would in what we used to think of as normal  times.</p><p>The other thing is, there is something going on in the inflation process.  It looks as if - you know, whether it's the natural rate of unemployment,  if such a thing exists, is weighed down, or the Phillips Curve has gotten  flatter or there's downward nominal wage rigidity or something. But,  something - clearly the underlying models we were using to try to predict  inflation, which were never very good, are now looking completely useless  (ph).</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Do you have a favorite theory or explanation for what that  something is?</p><p>KRUGMAN: I think it's a mix - there still being pent-up wage cuts that  don't want to happen and there's just sort of - there's still an overhang  from the past. And, I think there's nervousness. I think that people having  been through the Great Recession and the long, slow recovery are just very  reluctant to grant or demand wage increases that might end up being locked  in during the next slump.</p><p>FU: So, does that mean that the Federal Reserve should re-think its  approach to targeting 2 percent inflation? Should it give up that target?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, no, on the contrary. I mean, everything we've seen that says  that 2 percent inflation is if anything, too low, that given that we've  seen how hard it is to get inflation up once it's too low, given that it's  - I'm a secularist stagnation guy - that we really need to have the  opportunity of having significantly negative real interest rates, that the  fed's target should be above 2 percent ...</p><p>FU: What - 3 percent?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, I would - I mean, I would - I'm old enough. I'm older than  all you guys. I remember a 4 percent. I remember Reagan's second term when  we had 4 percent inflation. It wasn't so bad. It gave you a lot more room  for monetary policy. So, I would go there. It's not - it's a long way from  being politically acceptable but, no - by no means to say that because  we're having trouble getting to the 2 percent target which actually looks  too low, that we should give up on even trying to get there.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Could the fed be not hiking right now? If you were a fed chair,  would you not be ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: I would not be hiking right now. I think the fed is trying to  normalize and that version of normality went out the window ten years ago.</p><p>FU: Economist Paul Krugman is sticking with us, because we're talking about  changing political dynamics in the age of Trump.  We can take that in many  directions.</p><p>From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: What'd You Miss? Republican Senator Bob Corker is in open opposition to  the President, calling the White House \"an adult daycare center,\" and  worrying whether President Trump can lead the nation to a Third World War -  or, whether he would. But, perhaps the real battle is within the Republican  Party itself.</p><p>We're back with Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning economist.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Paul, one of the interesting things about Corker's comments is  he said, \"There are a lot of people within my caucus who feel the same way  I do.\" But of course, none of them have really called out Trump to the same  degree. What do you think the reluctance is all about?</p><p>KRUGMAN: It's about their political careers. I mean, you know, I've been  paying attention to this stuff for a long time and I read a lot. Today's  republican legislators - people in the senate and even more so in the  house, they grew up in an era of a monolithic, very tightly organized  Republican Party.</p><p>These are not people who courageously staked out a position that might have  been unpopular. These are people who joined the political machine that  guaranteed them a good living, even if they lost an election, right? We  call it \"wingnut welfare,\" all of that, right? And, so they are not - these  are apparatchiks. These are not people who are going to step out and take a  stand on principle. It's not the kind of people they are. It would require  a lot of - Corker turns out to be a more interesting guy than we thought.  But, it's also he's decided that his political career is over. There are  going to be very few who are willing to do that, even under the most  extreme circumstances.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But, you've got now Senator John McCain of course as well, who  is getting treatment for brain cancer and you've got Bob Corker - so you've  got two kind of ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: So, people who are on the edge of retirement or possibly don't  have very long to live are willing to say something that I don't think is  going to be enough to be an effectively large caucus.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But, in terms of trying to get legislation through, losing two  big senators like that actually, is critical for the GOP.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, that's right. And, remember, we already - we already saw  Obamacare repeal crash and burn ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Tax reform or tax reform tax or whatever it is they're trying to  do on taxes is in big trouble. So, it's quite possible that they'll have a  completely sterile legislative agenda - and - which, you know, from my  point of view is a good thing. In any case, yes. They don't have the kind  of margin that would allow them to push stuff through if they have even a  few people who decide, oh, the hell with it, I'm just going to say what I  think.</p><p>FU: Well, the party is in a little bit of a dilemma here, because they've  rallied around principles that seem to be in opposition to themselves. For  instance, they want tax cuts on investment income to boost the economy.  They want tax cuts for the middle class, all the while avoiding widening  the budget deficit. You can't have one without the other.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Right.</p><p>FU: Something's got to give and no one is willing to concede any of that.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. We have a phrase that's in other circumstances but it works  in international economics - we talk about the impossible trinity. There  are three different things that everybody wants and you can only have two  of them. And, they've definitely got themselves in the impossible trinity.</p><p>They also have the problem which is that Trump sold himself to his base as  a populist - I'm going to help you against the swamp and against the big  guys and then everything that they're trying to do legislatively is  standard republican - you know, let's give more to the oligarchy.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: How do you think the tension is going to resolve ultimately?  Because, it does seem like there's - you know, the McConnell wing and the  Trump wing are distinct, especially in how they see the economy and  populism - taxes perhaps. Ultimately do you think the old McConnell wing  will just completely be swept out?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, no. If you actually look at concrete legislative measures -  look at what Trump has actually proposed or at least signed on to - first  on healthcare and now on taxes, it's totally been McConnell Ryan wing.  There's been no hint at all of that economic populism in anything he  actually does. He talks a populist game but in fact his populism never  translates into economics.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p>KRUGMAN: He's populist on, you know, race relations. He's populist on  culture war. But, on economics, there's been no - it appears to be entirely  just rhetoric.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So far he hasn't gotten anything done. So, if he actually tries  to get legislation passed - I mean he called Chuck Schumer apparently on  Friday to try and get something done on healthcare. The risk is that  perhaps he tries to see what he can get away with on tax cuts, if not tax  reform. Does the sort of bipartisan outreach become the end-game here if he  wants to get things done, because he's a deal-maker? He wants action -  results.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, the thing about him as a deal-maker is he tends to re-neg on  all of his deals, right? They thought they had a deal on the dreamers. He  now suddenly ...</p><p>FU: Now they're outraged.</p><p>KRUGMAN: He said, \"I'm willing to deal on healthcare.\" But, you know, now  he seems to be imposing other conditions. So, you know, who's going to make  a deal with him now, really?</p><p>FU: So, what should the democrats do during this time where they may  possibly be working with the President on some kind of deal even though  they're not confident it's going to come to fruition - because they  themselves are at risk of fracturing or splintering into an extreme left  and a shrinking moderate presence (ph)?</p><p>KRUGMAN: I think that's much exaggerated. If you look on policy substance,  there's really not a whole lot of division. You know, we talk about  different wings of the Democratic Party but in fact the whole party is  pretty much unified in anything that involves policy in the medium term.</p><p>FU: Well, right now they're unified against Donald Trump.</p><p>KRUGMAN: And, they're also unified for, you know, we're going to defend  Obamacare - maybe we'd like single-payer eventually, but even if you look  at the standard single-payer plan, most of it is a transition to a public  option. So, I think it's much less real division there. I think what the  democrats probably do is they, you know, sound flexible, they talk with  Trump - they make it clear, we need to talk with Trump, but they don't  actually offer him anything much because, why? They know that they'll get  shafted if they do and they know that the base will be angry if they do.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Sounds like the debt raise (ph), actually, doesn't it? They  actually didn't give up anything and Trump did (ph).</p><p>Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning economist joins us for the market close.  Stay with us. From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>1556</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>1559</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What'd You Miss? Stocks climb to a record high, as the dollar  weakens.</p><p>I'm Julia CHATTERLEY.</p><p>FU: I'm Scarlet Fu.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: And, I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p><p>If you're tuning in live on Twitter, we want to welcome you to our closing  bell coverage every weekday from 4 to 5 pm Eastern.</p><p>FU: Let's begin with Market Minutes.  Look, it's another day of record  highs here for the Dow and the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ.  You could see gains of  anywhere from one-tenth of 1 percent to three-tenths of 1 percent. So, the  big tech names are probably lagging behind, given the NASDAQ's smaller gain  than the other two.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes, but new highs once again. It's pretty remarkable. The melt-up  ...</p><p>FU: The melt-up continues.</p><p>All right. Let's look at some individual names here - Proctor &amp; Gamble  declaring victory in its bid to keep Nelson Pelts off its board, even as  Nelson Pelts' activist hedge fund try-in (ph) said the vote is still too  close to call. So, that stock is down just by half of 1 percent.</p><p>Wal-Mart gaining almost 5 percent. That's a big move for Wal-Mart after  announcing a $20 billion stock buy-back. Also, it says it expects U.S. e- commerce sales to surge 40 percent in the next fiscal year.</p><p>And, a quick mention here of UAL and American Air. United Continental  surging after bolstering of financial outlook despite hurricanes and a  continued fare war and of course as expert (ph) analysts raise their  earnings forecast you can see American Airlines getting a little bit of a  lift from that as well.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Finally, let's go to the government bond market - very quiet  today - hardly anything going on. Tier (ph) yields unchanged. Ten-year  yields down moderately. Remember bond yields was closed yesterday for  Columbus Day, so this is catch-up - really nothing going on here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And, that (inaudible) in what we saw in the FX markets as well.  I'm showing you a seven-day here for the dollar index. That's actually not  a pretty chart, but the dollar is lower for a third day versus most of the  G10 tiers (ph). I mean, we talked about those concerns about tax reform. I  think we just have to take it as a pause, and the recent rallying looking  like its run out of steam.</p><p>I'm showing you what's going on in Euro dollar too. Of course, we have that  Catalonian presidential talk or speech today to Parliament, stepping back  from the prospect of unilateral declaration of independence - he wants to  engage. We have got the Euro there above 118, the figure. I also want to  show you what's going on in that Euro dollar - sorry, in sterling as well.  The rally now that we've seen this week to around 1 percent manufacturing  and construction outcome beating (inaudible). The data is showing a pretty  mixed picture I'd say for the U.S. economy here, but still more chatter  about the Bank of England raising rates in November with a one and done  move.</p><p>FU: And, just a quick update here on stocks, the Dow finished at a record  but the S&amp;P and NASDAQ fell just short.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Finally, on commodities, let's look at oil and gold - oil  gaining nearly 3 percent, rising optimism that more countries are going to  join with OPEC to cut production. So, some hope (ph) diminished supply up -  back up about $50 a barrel in West Texas intermediate to run 51. And, gold  futures, gaining again up to just over 12.90 an ounce.</p><p>And, those are today's Market Minutes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Well, you may see a post-election market rally that wasn't  predicted. We're still here with Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning  economist.</p><p>Paul, you made the call that markets would tank if President Trump were  elected.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Right. And, I retracted it very soon afterwards. And, you know, I  did what you should never ever do, which is to let your political, you  know, biases, interfere with your judgment. I thought, this is a terrible  thing, which it was, but it isn't necessarily going to be terrible for  every indicator. And, so, this is a mea culpa. I did that already.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you did.</p><p>KRUGMAN: This was me doing exactly what I tell people not to do. And, you  know, it's going to happen. We're all mortal. One thing is worth saying, by  the way. We talk about there's a Trump bump. There's also a Merkel bump, a  Macron bump, a (inaudible) bump, an (inaudible) bump - stock markets have  been up all around the world. So, something's going on. People like stocks.</p><p>What is the - I always quote my old teacher, Paul Samuelson (ph), who said  that the stock market had predicted nine of the last five recessions.  The  market may not be telling us much of anything at all, except that for some  reason people are liking stocks.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We have a viewer question actually, and I think you've kind of  already answered it there, asking whether the Trump stock bump reflects a  fundamental change to the economy or just the expectation that business  owners will eat a larger piece of the pie with employees and the public at  large eating less pie and more externalities like dirty air and water?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes, or it might just reflect the fact that investors think that  other investors are going to pay more for stocks. I mean, it doesn't have  to mean anything much at all.</p><p>Let me say, just I am little surprised that the market doesn't worry more  about the downside of a totally catastrophic response if something bad  happens, you know? What if we have something really bad happen and they  handle everything the way they handled Puerto Rico? That ought to be some  kind of weight on the market. But, we know that markets tend not to - tend  to ignore those things until they actually do happen.</p><p>FU: You know, I wanted to play for you a comment from Richard Thaler, the  Nobel Prize-winning economist ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>FU: On what he thinks about what's going on the stock market.  Take a  listen.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD THALER, NOBEL PRIZE WINNING ECONOMIST: I don't know about you, but  I'm nervous and it seems like when investors are nervous, they're prone to  being spooked and nothing seems to spook the market. As you said, it just  crawls up, slowly but surely. And, if it's all based on the expectation of  some big tax cut, surely investors should have lost confidence that that  was going to happen, given what's happened so far out of Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FU: Especially what we've heard of late, Joe, which is the President is  going to back to tweak the tax proposal.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right. So, there's all this uncertainty as you said, like we've  seen an example of disaster response and ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Hasn't been impressive. There is active saber rattling about  North Korea now almost every other day - threat of our military conflict.  So, is your theory that basically markets are not really good forward  discounters - basically just take into account what already happened?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. We - it's not - that isn't even a theory. That's an  observation. We know. And, some of us again remember - you know, remember  the housing bubble. And, it was - that was the clearest thing I'd ever seen  in my life. That was just overwhelming in numbers. And, yet, month after  month the prices kept on rising and people kept saying, oh, there's no - if  there were really a bubble, surely it would have burst by now. And, then  one day it did.</p><p>FU: Do you see a bubble right now?</p><p>KRUGMAN: It's much less clear. Let's put it - there were - profits are  high. Interest rates are still very low so it makes kind of sense for stock  prices to be high, given that. It's more - in this case I don't see it's a  really overwhelming bubble. I just think that there's a disaster risk that  the markets are not taking into account.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When we ask people about this though they say, look, for the  first time in two decades, maybe more, we've got this synchronous growth  pattern when they look around the world and actually that lifts all boats.  Do you buy that?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, not necessarily, because sometimes a synchronous growth  pattern means that interests rates rise which tends to - and, that's not  happening. So, I don't - you know, at some level - look, Bob Schiller  famously - he did a study during the '87 stock crash and he asked people,  why are you selling - in real time, using fax machines, because that's all  you had at the time, and the only answer that appeared with any frequency -  you know, there were all kinds of (inaudible) for rationalizations (ph) -  the only answer was, I'm selling because stocks - because prices are  falling. I think people are buying stocks because prices are rising. And, I  think that's all that's really gone ...</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Well, we have a show, so we have to have better (inaudible)  than that. If only people just gave us those (inaudible).</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We need to (inaudible).</p><p>FU: Now, in terms of the economy, I wanted to get your sense of the labor  market, because you can't really read too much in the latest jobs report.  Yet, people were saying, oh, look at the participation rate, it's gone up.  Look at earnings. It's gone up. What do you take away from the latest  couple of reports and what it says about the economy?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. I'm having a hard time figuring out what the - lately I've  been looking at actually at the QUIPS rate, which is back up to normal  levels. And, that seems to be signaling that we really are kind of - people  seem to feel that it's OK to leave a job because they can find another one,  which suggests that we are kind of at full employment. Earnings are not  really showing that. Wage increases are still sub-par. But, you know, maybe  - and, also it's interesting that prime age labor reports participation is  creeping back up to previous levels. So, all the people who said, this is  structural, it really is nothing - turns out, no, it's just lack of jobs.  So, there's some actual good stuff. And, I wouldn't take one month's number  on the NFP very much.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: And, just a reminder. We're going to get the QUIPS rate  tomorrow - the JOLTS number comes out tomorrow, so something to watch.</p><p>FU: Perfect timing.</p><p>All right.  Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman will be sticking  with us. We're going to talk about urban policy and perhaps how to avoid  disasters like Hurricane Harvey in Houston - or at least it could have been  minimized.</p><p>From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: What'd You Miss? We are back now with Nobel Prize-winning economist,  Paul Krugman. And, we turn our focus to urban policy and infrastructure.</p><p>Professor, you've written about the flooding disaster that was caused by  Hurricane Harvey in Houston and how it was largely due to bad policy,  including unregulated development.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>FU: Some estimates have the storm causing up to $200 billion dollars in  damage.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>FU: So, what's the lesson here? What should be done differently?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, in Houston it's pretty clear. People have been warning about  this for a long time, that it essentially - too much of it is paved. You  need to have places to drain. You need to have - you know, you have to -  you cannot just - in (ph) what is very much a place that nature wants to  flood occasionally - even the side (ph) climate change that wants to  happen, even more so now - if you have completely unregulated development  then you end up with no place for water to go.</p><p>Now the funny this is - the thing that makes it agonizing is, on the other  hand, in some ways Houston does it right by not restricting development in  ways that prevent people from building housing. So, you know, you have a  kind of extreme San Francisco-style which is nimbyism gone wild ...</p><p>FU: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Which is disastrous. And, Houston is a - has much, much cheaper  housing because it didn't do that.</p><p>On the other hand, you have complete, you know, ignoring the environmental  consequences of unrestricted development and we seem to find it very hard  politically to find the balance there.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right. You know, if you look at all the other boom cities over  the last decade, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco - completely  unaffordable for homeowners for the middle class - Houston has been a  success story on this front - you know, a thriving city economically where  middle class people can afford to buy a home.</p><p>KRUGMAN: That's right. No. If you look at - I mean, when they (ph) ask why  does Texas grow faster in general than the rest of the country, it's none  of the things that the Texans like to boast about. It's not because of low  taxes. It's not because they're cruel to the poor. It's because they have a  housing policy that lets you build houses which the northeast, and even  worse, the far west, do not have. But - so, that's a good thing. But, you  know, you have to have some place for the water to go when there's a  hurricane and they haven't done that.</p><p>So, it's a real - it - no one seems to - I mean, the only city that seems  to have adequate regulation - big city, and affordable housing, is Chicago.  Unfortunately they've also got Chicago winters, so I don't know what you do  about that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, but can you steal (ph) from them in terms of the way  they've tackled this, because as you say, I mean, it's kind of bad city  planning - the zoning laws - and, we've talked about them on this show  before in Houston, also a huge problem. But, then you compare it to San  Francisco as well and say actually, look at the situation that they've  created, where people have extreme commuting, which actually I've never  even heard about.</p><p>KRUGMAN: No. Well, we have - you know, we have some of that here. I know  people - a couple of people who live in Bucks County and commute to  Manhattan.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How long does that take?</p><p>KRUGMAN: About two hours.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. (Inaudible) four hours and ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. No. It's - the thing is, technically there are no problems.  We know how to do this. We know what should be done. It's easy to throw up  a list. The question is, how ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Politics.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Politics. And, I don't know if we've found a way to make that  happen. It just seems to be - you know, de Blasio came in with very good  ideas about trying to expand affordable housing and he's done what in  absolute terms is quite a lot in New York. But, of course it's such a huge  city that it's just a drop in the bucket relative to the size of the  problem.</p><p>FU: How much are we going to rely on local politicians, city mayors, state  governors to do a lot of the work here, because everything is so gummed up  at the federal level?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, first of all, this is going to have to be local policy in  any case.</p><p>FU: Sure.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Sure, it is going to require local politicians. The trouble - I  mean, when people talk about decentralization, the fact of the matter is,  by and large, with many - with honorable exceptions, but a lot of local  politicians are really pretty terrible. Not that many people vote in state  and local elections and so you'll often - you have machine politicians.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You're not getting the best people ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: On the whole, even - you know, much as I can denounce stuff that  goes on in Congress, I'm not sure that there are many state legislatures  (ph) that I would prefer.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Is there something here in New York City when you look at  regulations of the housing marking that you think could be done that a  mayor or city council could do to ease housing crisis?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, sure. I mean, even though we're an enormously enormous city  and very dense, there's still lots of potential building. There's lots of  places where we could still build up. There's still in fact land that is  un-built that could be built without destroying the quality of life. There  is - you know, if you're going to have a city - a metro area with 20 plus  billion (ph) people, you're going to have to have some really dense  developments. And, look, I live - I actually checked - my zip code has got  about 70,000 per square mile. It doesn't feel impossibly overcrowded. You  know, it's high rises. You can live that way and we need more of that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman is staying with us.</p><p>Up next we get his take on the political uncertainty in Europe. From New  York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Catalonia backs away from declaring independence outright. The  Catalan president opted for a middle ground in his message to Parliament  today, calling for talks with Spain. But, what will the recent fiscal  uncertainty mean for Europe's economy? Paul Krugman is still with us.</p><p>Paul, let's talk about Spain to start off with. What do you think here?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, not at all familiar. I mean, I don't know Spain. I certainly  don't know Catalonia. I mean, it's odd to have this timing. I mean, if you  were thinking bad things were going to happen in Spain, you would have  expected those three or four years ago when the Spanish economy was really  in the dumps.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Spain is actually making a comeback and a fair bit of that  actually in Catalonia. But, you know, having the auto industry is coming  back - Spain is - it's an enormous, incredibly expensive (ph) process of  internal devaluation (ph). But, they have finally been - you know, there's  some light at the end of the tunnel. So, it's kind of odd to have this  happening now.</p><p>Now, I understand Catalonia has in fact been deeply oppressed culturally,  but you try to think about what it would mean to break Catalonia away from  the rest of Spain now. And, my God, it's like trying to imagine Virginia  seceding again now, right? It would be a really impossible thing to happen.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But, when you look at Europe optically (ph), I mean we've got -  we've had the Macron victory over in France, Angela Merkel has just come  back in in Germany - yes (ph) we've got these hot spots like Italy and  we've got the tensions now in Spain, but overall what's your sense of  Europe at this moment?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, Europe - the Euro continues to function badly, right? The  Euro was a mistake. It has been a big constraint. They paid a huge price in  high unemployment but the political cohesiveness of Europe, with the  exception of Britain, has turned out to be much stronger. I mean, us Anglo- Saxons didn't quite understand just how deep the commitment of much of the  European elite was to it.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: In 10 years will all of the countries that are in the Euro zone  still be there?</p><p>KRUGMAN: You know, if Greece wasn't going to leave the Euro with the 27  percent unemployment and a depression-level slump, who's going to leave? I  think it's very, very hard. People just ...</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Don't want to do that, even when the economics of it makes a lot  of sense.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: They always said in Brussels, \"don't underestimate Angela  Merkel's will to keep this thing together.\"</p><p>FU: No, that's a really, really good point. Yet, there is an attraction to  populism, right? People in Spain, people in France can't turn away from it  completely. People in Germany with AfDs ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: That's right.</p><p>FU: Strong showing.</p><p>KRUGMAN: There are - everybody's got their little Trumps. Everybody's got  their - and, not necessarily in countries you would think. You know,  Germany - by the way, this is a demonstration that is not - economic  anxiety is a very distinctly secondary thing. Germany has been the great  success story this whole period. Even so, they have a resurgent hard right.</p><p>FU: All right. Well, we want to bring in some viewer questions to wrap it  all up - to wrap up your hour with us.</p><p>Joe, why don't you start with this one on the broken Phillips Curve?</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Yes, so a question about the Phillips Curve - we talked about  it a little bit very earlier on. What do you make of it? Some wondering if  it's the changing nature of the economy from a manufacturing to a service  economy - maybe it was never valid in the first place. What's your take on  that debate?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. My take is that I don't really know. We're trying - look,  some things we can see. We can still see that there's an awful lot - if you  look at the distribution of wage changes, there's a spike at zero, which  tells us that one thing that's still going on is that people - there are  still people who are - really should from a market sense be taking wage  cuts and because they can't, there's kind of a pent up demand for wage  decline that's sitting there.</p><p>Some of it is it may be that expectations - that after years and years of  inflation falling below forecasts that that is starting to get reflected in  expectations. But, I have to say, all of this stuff - I have a feeling that  I'm like a pre-Copernican astronomer, you know, doing epicycles trying to  make this model that really doesn't want to - so, the answer is, at some  level, we don't know.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Hector (ph) is asking if it's related to the transition  mechanism, though - I guess in some sense, did it fall out in the wash at  some point?</p><p>KRUGMAN: I don't think that there's a - I mean, I don't think that the  service economy change or any of the - in general, structural change is  overrated, right? Things like - the fact of the matter - that people  obviously think it's easy to find jobs, should be showing up in higher wage  demands. And, why it isn't showing up is still a puzzle.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: A mystery.</p><p>FU: Janet Yellen has said so as much.</p><p>All right. Final question to you: will the fed be successful in reducing  its balance sheet?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, yes. I don't - that is really not - the idea (ph) that there  was ever going to be a big problem there was always a fundamental  misunderstanding. They have plenty of tools to offset it. If they tried to  dump it all at once it would be a big problem, but I don't see any problem  there.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: One last question. We just have a few seconds left. Years ago  you said that big coin was even and it hasn't died yet. I'm curious whether  you - what you think about it these days, because so many conversations  come back to that.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes, I think it's still evil. I don't think that there is any very  legitimate purpose for it. And, yes, it is kind of - it's suspended. I  still think it's a Wiley Coyote thing, right?</p><p>WEISENTHAL: (Inaudible).</p><p>KRUGMAN: You run off the edge of the cliff. One day you look down and  realize there's nothing under you. But, I've been saying that for years and  it's been wrong all along.</p><p>FU: In the meantime, the legs are moving really, really, really fast.</p><p>KRUGMAN: That's right.</p><p>FU: Paul Krugman, thank you so much.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Thanks a lot.</p><p>FU: Thank you for spending the time with us.</p><p>Nobel Prize-winning economist - he's a columnist for the New York Times and  of course, a professor at the City University of New York.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.
