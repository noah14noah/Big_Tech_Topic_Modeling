The catalyst for the march, 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg[3], has become an inspiration for the young generation passionate about climate change. Business Insider spoke with Gen Z demonstrators at the strike to find out what they had to say about the demonstration, Thunberg, and the dangers of ignoring climate change. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[4]. Young people around the world[5] are on strike. An estimated 250,000 demonstrators gathered at Foley Square in Manhattan on Friday as part of the Global Climate Strike[6]. New York is just one of hundreds of cities in 156 countries and regions (including Antarctica) with thousands of protesters filling the streets. </p><p>For the most part, they've all been students[7]. New York's Education Department let students skip class[8] to join the ranks in the march, which began at 12:30 pm, making its way down Broadway toward Battery Park[9]. Despite students getting the city's permission to attend the strike, teachers were barred from it to avoid political influence in the classroom. One of the main reasons Gen Zers are passionate about climate change is Greta Thunberg[10], a 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who gained worldwide attention after skipping school to protest in front of Stockholm's parliament building last year. Since then, she has met with former President Barack Obama, sailed across the Atlantic Ocean[11] to lower her carbon footprint, and been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize[12]. Here's what Gen Zers had to say about the strike, Thunberg, and the dangers of ignoring climate change. Sophie, a 19-year-old, said that Greta Thunberg is an inspiration for her. Ivan De Luce/Business Insider\"I'm really passionate about helping the environment, and it's something that needs to happen,\" Sophie told Business Insider. \"We've gone so long with just people not doing anything about it, and it's time.\" Sophie also talked about what Thunberg means to her. \"I'm so excited. She's so inspiring. She is a symbol of everything \u2014 she's inspiring to young women. She's what we need right now.\"Estella and Bella, who go to the Chapin School in the Upper East Side, were also fans of Thunberg. Ivan De Luce/Business Insider\"She's really just such an inspiration, and I just really want to help save the Earth,\" Estella said. \"I think that she has such a platform to help spread that.\" \"She doesn't care what [people] think. She's ready to tell them what they need to hear,\" said Bella.Two seventh graders, Barrett and Isabella, liked the way Thunberg stressed the importance of listening to scientists about climate change. Ivan De Luce/Business Insider\"Everyone on this planet, if they want to keep it, has to make a difference,\" Barrett (pictured left) said. \"We can't vote yet, we can't really do much because we're young, so this is our way to do something.\" \"Everyone has made a big mistake wasting plastic, cutting down so many trees, and ruining the Earth at this point,\" Isabella (pictured right) said. \"We're trying to make our change.\" Isabella and Barrett spoke about why they support Thunberg's activism. \"I think she means courage and strength,\" Isabella said. \"She's just such an inspirational girl.\" \"She's so brave,\" Barrett said. \"It shows that age doesn't matter with what you can do.\"See the rest of the story at Business Insider[13] See Also: Don't break up Big Tech, says Bill Gates.

By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 17%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 21%. (The second-best performing sector is real estate, up 25%.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stellar gains are always welcome, but they do pose a challenge for investors. After such a big run-up, is there anything left worth buying at current levels?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Analyst sure think so. Between momentum and the sector's outsize growth prospects, plenty of tech stocks have nowhere near topped out, they say.</p><p>To see which picks analysts like best at this point, we screened the Nasdaq Composite for the top-rated small, midsize and large tech stocks.\u00a0S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence surveys analysts' ratings on stocks and scores them on a five-point scale, where 1.0 equals Strong Buy and 5.0 means Strong Sell. Any score of 2.0 or lower means that analysts, on average, rate the stock a Buy. The closer the score gets to 1.0, the better.</p><p>Here are the 12 tech stocks the analysts love right now. This group is broken down into the four best-rated stock picks in the small-, mid- and large-cap spaces.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t052-s001-all-30-dow-stocks-ranked-the-analysts-weigh-in/index.html\">All 30 Dow Stocks Ranked: The Analysts Weigh In</url></p><p>Top-Rated Small Tech Stock #4: Varonis Systems</p><p>Market value: $2.1 billion</p><p>Dividend yield: N/A</p><p>Analysts' average recommendation: 1.86</p><p>Analysts think highly of Varonis Systems' (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=vrns&amp;page=stocktipsheet\">VRNS</url>, $70.28) strategic plan.</p><p>Like many tech stocks, the cybersecurity software company is transitioning away from selling licenses and toward a cloud-based subscription model. Although pivoting to software-as-a-service is rarely pain-free - VRNS' revenue fell 4% in Q2 - such transitions boost margins over the long haul.</p><p>At the same time, VRNS is benefitting from new regulations on digital privacy such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), stricter compliance requirements and the \" ominous threat environment,\" write Wedbush analysts, who rate shares at Outperform (equivalent to Buy).</p><p>\" In the numerous software business model transitions we have seen play out over the past decade, we can never remember seeing a company so quickly ramp subscription revenues in the course of a few quarters, which speaks to a massive success story so far for the company (and its investors),\" Wedbush writes.</p><p>Of the 14 analysts covering the stock tracked by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, seven rate VRNS at Strong Buy, two say Buy and five call it a Hold.

It's then able to bundle the software services it picks up through M&amp;A. Most recently, the firm bought cloud-based software provider Cimpl on Aug. 22 for $23.1 million in cash and a $2.6 million cash holdback payable in 12 months. (It also announced a guidance upgrade in concert with the acquisition.)</p><p>\" Our acquisition pipeline is robust, and we are actively pursuing additional opportunities to build out our solution suites,\" said Jack McDonald, Upland chairman and CEO, in a press release.</p><p>William Blair analysts, who rate the tech stock at Outperform, note that enterprise customers increasingly want bundled software, and UPLD enjoyed \" record expansion and major customer growth\" in Q2.

Analysts spot a bargain.</p><p>The company - which provides IT, business consulting and application outsourcing services - posted better-than-expected quarterly results in early August. The firm also gifted investors a share repurchase program of up to $30 million over the next 12 months.</p><p>Wedbush analysts rate shares at Outperform, citing Virtusa's potential to take market share and improving margins at its Polaris subsidiary in India. \" We continue to expect a combination of pipeline strength, expanding digital mix, and record level pipeline growth in FS vertical to generate above-sector growth this year,\" they write.</p><p>VRTU also wants to make strategic, niche acquisitions, Wedbush notes.</p><p>Of the seven analysts covering Virtusa tracked by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, five call the stock a Strong Buy and two call them a Buy. Their average price target of $51.50 gives VRTU implied upside of about 46% over the next year or so. Analysts also expect the company to be a profit-growth machine.

DBX beat Wall Street's quarterly profit and revenue estimates in early August, but shares still tumbled as much as 14% on the report. Weaker-than-expected billings were blamed for the selloff.</p><p>Although the stock appears to have recently stabilized, it's been a tough run for the bulls.</p><p>\" It's frustrating to face nearly ceaseless negativity and middling performance of the stock, but it is more frustrating to try to argue against arguments that the missing of some unguided number or deceleration of a favorite metric reflects anything other than the normal stochastic nature of real-life business operations,\" write Canaccord Genuity analysts. \" We're willing to stick with this name with a Buy rating and push back on the negative knights who say Ni.\"</p><p>The broader analyst community is mixed but lean bullish. Eight analysts tracked by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence rate DBX at Strong Buy, and three have it at Buy. But three say it's a Hold and another two say to sell Dropbox. Overall, however, their $29.64 target price gives DBX whopping implied upside of 65% - among the highest on this list of tech stocks.

Analysts average price target of $15.35 gives VIAV implied upside of about 10% over the next year or so - that small relative upside is largely because the stock has been quickly sprinting toward that price target, up 37% year-to-date.

At least not yet. We'll get more clarity after the computer-assisted design company posts quarterly results, currently slated for Aug. 27. Generally, a slowdown in manufacturing is not good for Autodesk.</p><p>Keybanc analysts recently surveyed Autodesk's North American resellers. The takeaway was that the software company should hit its quarterly numbers. Keybanc reiterated its Overweight (Buy) rating on shares. Longer-term, Stifel, which calls shares a Buy, likes ADSK's opportunities in 3D printing and increasing use of digital design in the architecture, engineering and construction industries.</p><p>Out of 25 analysts polled by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, 14 rate ADSK at Strong Buy, four say Buy, six have it a Hold and one says Sell.

They're bullish: 21 rate PYPL at Strong Buy, nine say Buy, nine have it at Hold and one says Sell.</p><p>Shares in PayPal have tumbled about 9% after hitting an all-time high in late July. The culprit? The company cut its full-year revenue outlook when it posted second-quarter results. Shares had been a white-hot tear heading into the earnings release, which set them up for a significant drawdown on anything less than a perfect report. (The broader market's tantrum didn't help.)</p><p>Analysts aren't fazed. If anything, the recent drop makes PayPal even more attractive.

Our industry has had a roller coaster ride in 2013 with numerous ups and downs and a few bumps in between. Letas take a look at the top 13 tech stories that mattered in 2013.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Steve Ballmer retires as Microsoft CEO</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the most recognizable figures in the tech industry a\" Microsoftas CEO Steve Ballmer a\" shocked the world when he announced that he would be retiring in 12 months. The loud and often eccentric man whose keynotes had more drama than TV soaps was going to step down after more than a decade at the helm. The industry in general was sad to see such a character leave and his tearful farewell to his colleagues showed just how much he was going to miss the spotlight. His announcement also kickstarted the ongoing race to find the next CEO, which has thrown up some big names like Alan Mulally, Satya Nadella and Nokiaas own Stephen Elop among others.</p><p>Microsoft to acquire Nokiaas devices and services unit</p><p>After months of speculations, Microsoft finally announced that it had finally stuck a deal with Nokia and was going to acquire the Finnish companyas devices and services unit for $7.2 billion. What followed was a whole lot of analysis, speculations and the drama only intensified when Nokiaas Stephen Elop was suddenly in contention to become Microsoftas next CEO. Later in the year, Nokiaas shareholders, the EU regulators and the US Justice Department gave the deal their thumbs-up. The Indian tax case was also resolved before the final date to decide on the fate of the Chennai manufacturing plant. The only thing standing between the two companies is the green signal from China.</p><p>BlackBerry puts itself up for sale but fails to get a buyer</p><p>BlackBerry was another company which was up for sale, but unlike the Nokia-Microsoft saga, BlackBerryas deal with Fairfax Financial fell apart at the last moment. The failed deal also saw CEO Thorsten Heins booted out of the company and being replaced by John Chen. The companyas fortunes though didnat turn for the good and it saw huge losses, layoffs and even its move to release BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) on multiple platforms didnat change things. The release created a lot of interest initially, but soon fizzled out and many concluded that the move was atoo little too latea. Chen yesterday released an open letter talking about BlackBerry in 2014 and its manufacturing deal with Foxconn but few expect the company to make a turnaround. Will BlackBerry survive 2014 is the billion dollar question on everyone's mind.</p><p>HTCas downward spiral</p><p>Another company, which had a torrid year, was Taiwanese HTC. A company, which was once a major player, has seen its market share shrink to a measly 3-4 percent. Though it is credited with having launched the One, which is one of the best Android devices you can buy today, high pricing and delays in shipments saw it lose to its immediate rival a\" the Samsung Galaxy S4. Things only got worse as the year progressed with the company investigating certain employees for having allegedly stolen and subsequently sold company secrets. There were layoffs, CEO Peter Chou was put under tremendous pressure and also saw the company suffering its first every quarterly loss.</p><p>Twitter IPO</p><p>Not all companies had a bad time though. Twitter, for one, can look back at 2013 fondly having become the latest big tech-startup to go public. Unlike Facebookas IPO though, Twitter enjoyed a good start opening at $45.10 and also reaching a record high of $71.65 last week. Though the company is making good money from the NYSE listing, we will wait to see how it uses the resources to improve the service.</p><p>Yahoo juggernaut under Marissa Mayer</p><p>Ever since taking over as the CEO of the company, Marissa Mayer has been busy trying to revive the huge brand that Yahoo once was. In about seven months, Mayer has acquired around two dozen startups and companies in a bid to completely refresh its ageing products. Some results were immediately visible, with Yahooas iOS weather app receiving a lot of positive feedback and also winning Appleas prestigious Design Award. Other acquisitions though are a part of a long term plan as Mayer tries to rejuvenate the Yahoo brand and make it more suitable for the contemporary crowd. One of her biggest acquisitions was Tumblr, which is said to have cost the company around a billion dollars.</p><p>Apple-Samsung patent war</p><p>The year also saw legal battles being fought between companies and the most publicized of all was the patent war between Samsung and Apple. The back and forth between the two companies over the former allegedly copying the latteras iPhone design saw a lot of trials, re-trials and appeals and both companies saw victories and defeats. The first round was won by Apple where it was awarded $1 billion in damages, Samsung won the next round at the ITC, and later this year Samsung again lost an appeal and was ordered to pay Apple an additional $290 million in damages. If recent reports are to be believed, the two companies have finally started talks to resolve their differences outside the court. Let's see if 2014 turns out to be the year when more drama happens at store shelves than courtrooms.</p><p>Hacktivison - hacking/defacing websites and twitter handles</p><p>We witnessed quite a few attacks on the websites of government agencies, news publications, on private user account information and also the act of defacing various websites. Some of the biggest attacks were carried out by the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), which defaced many news publications like Huffington Post, NY Times, BBC,A Thomson Reuters, Telegraph, Associate Press, FT, The Onion among others and also hacked and gained access to user information on Twitter, Truecaller and Viber.</p><p>NSA snooping</p><p>Another highly controversial series of events was related to National Security Agency (NSA), one of the premier security agencies of the United States. It was revealed that NSA was spying on various computers and telecommunication medium, which was a blatant breach of a personas privacy. Whistleblower Edward Snowden made this revelation, and it shook the very foundations of the democratic government in the country. Later reports revealed that at one point NSA had hacked into and was snooping on more than 50,000 computer networks globally. The revelations will have long-term impact, especially with countries taking steps to secure \"their\" Internet possibly leading to Balkanization of the World Wide Web. Snowden's leaks about the part many tech companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and others play will also have a significant impact.</p><p>The rise and fall of Bitcoins</p><p>Virtual currency bitcoin gained a lot of prominence this year and with it the value of the currency went through the roof. Recently, the value of a single bitcoin was equal to a staggering $1,000. People who had forgotten or given up on the currency suddenly found themselves rich. One such man in Britain who had disposed his hard disk containing bitcoins realized (a bit too late, we might add) that his collection was worth millions of pounds. The currency though, has received far from a warm welcome globally and in India, the RBI has deemed the virtual currency illegal and doesnat allow any kind of transactions in the country.</p><p>Year of the wearable devices</p><p>The evolution of tech has always seen devices become smaller and slimmer than before and this was the year when smart devices became small enough to fit on oneas wrist. That said, this category always had promise but failed to deliver. The most talked about Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch was only an expensive piece of glass and plastic and Google Glass is nothing more than a field project. Other smartwatches like Pebble, Sony Smartwatch 2 or Qualcomm Toq havenat done any better either and health-related smart devices like Nike FuelBand and FitBit too have a long way to go. Hopefully, in the coming year, we will get to see a breakthrough product from companies like Google or Apple or even an improved product from Samsung that could kickstart this genre in a big way.</p><p>Gaming console wars</p><p>When talking about tech, gaming cannot possibly be left out of discussion. 2013 was the year of the next-generation where Sony and Microsoft unveiled and consequently launched the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One respectively. Any doubts about whether there would be enough buyers for the next-generation consoles considering their high price were laid to rest when both the companies managed to sell more than a million consoles on day one of launch. Since then they have introduced the consoles at other markets around the world and the sales graph is only pointing in one direction a\" Up!</p><p>Google looks to the future</p><p>Google has never been shy about trying to do something, which sounds or looks impossible. But its Google X labs continues to dish out things that would be a mainstay on sci-fi novels. This year, Google introduced the driverless car, acquired Boston Dynamics to build and develop highly intelligent robots in the near future and also announced Project Loona\" a highly ambitious project, which will bring Internet connectivity to the world using hot air balloons.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGRIND-0010772862</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGRIND2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B61-R3K1-JB5M-W0B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404835</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1548\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 India.com, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BGR India</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>December 31, 2013</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0001W7E</classCode><className>BLACKBERRY LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>BBRY (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>BB (TSX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008X7D</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING FACILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001010</classCode><className>LAYOFFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp; TAXATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001681</classCode><className>TAX LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Tax</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST00097CJ</classCode><className>JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N332991MM</classCode><className>BALL &amp; ROLLER BEARING MFG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008X7D</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING FACILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE0009V8P</classCode><className>STEVEN A BALLMER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DERT</classCode><className>SATYA NADELLA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>GX146</classCode><className>CHENNAI, TAMIL NADU, INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>GC302</classCode><className>CHINA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GC316</classCode><className>FINLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>GC312</classCode><className>TAIWAN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Our industry has had a roller coaster ride in 2013 with numerous ups and downs and a few bumps in between. Let's take a look at the top 13 tech stories that mattered in 2013. </p><p><br/><person><nameText>Steve Ballmer </nameText></person>retires as Microsoft CEO<br/> One of the most recognizable figures in the tech industry \u2014 Microsoft's CEO <person><nameText>Steve Ballmer </nameText></person>\u2014 shocked the world when he announced that he would be retiring in 12 months[1]. The loud and often eccentric man whose keynotes had more drama than TV soaps[2] was going to step down after more than a decade at the helm. The industry in general was sad to see such a character leave and his tearful farewell to his colleagues[3] showed just how much he was going to miss the spotlight. His announcement also kickstarted the ongoing race to find the next CEO[4], which has thrown up some big names like Alan Mulally, <person><nameText>Satya Nadella </nameText></person>and Nokia's own Stephen Elop among others.<br/>Microsoftto acquire Nokia's devices and services unit<br/> After months of speculations, Microsoftfinally announced that it had finally stuck a deal with Nokia and was going to acquire the Finnish company's devices and services unit for $7.2 billion[5]. What followed was a whole lot of analysis, speculations and the drama only intensified when Nokia's Stephen Elop was suddenly in contention to become Microsoft's next CEO[6]. Later in the year, Nokia's shareholders[7], the EU regulators[8] and the US Justice Department[9] gave the deal their thumbs-up. The Indian tax case was also resolved before the final date to decide on the fate of the Chennai manufacturing plant[10]. The only thing standing between the two companies is the green signal from China.<br/>BlackBerry puts itself up for sale but fails to get a buyer<br/>BlackBerry was another company which was up for sale, but unlike the Nokia-Microsoftsaga, BlackBerry's deal with Fairfax Financial fell apart at the last moment[11]. The failed deal also saw CEO Thorsten Heins booted out of the company and being replaced by John Chen[12]. The company's fortunes though didn't turn for the good and it saw huge losses[13], layoffs[14] and even its move to release BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) on multiple platforms[15] didn't change things. The release created a lot of interest initially, but soon fizzled out and many concluded that the move was 'too little too late'. Chen yesterday released an open letter talking about BlackBerry in 2014[16] and its manufacturing deal with Foxconn[17] but few expect the company to make a turnaround. Will BlackBerry survive 2014 is the billion dollar question on everyone's mind.<br/> HTC's downward spiral<br/> Another company, which had a torrid year, was Taiwanese HTC. A company, which was once a major player, has seen its market share shrink to a measly 3-4 percent. Though it is credited with having launched the One, which is one of the best Android devices you can buy today[18], high pricing and delays in shipments[19] saw it lose to its immediate rival \u2014 the Samsung Galaxy S4. Things only got worse as the year progressed with the company investigating certain employees for having allegedly stolen and subsequently sold company secrets[20]. There were layoffs, CEO Peter Chou was put under tremendous pressure and also saw the company suffering its first every quarterly loss[21].<br/>Twitter IPO <br/> Not all companies had a bad time though. Twitter, for one, can look back at 2013 fondly having become the latest big tech-startup to go public. Unlike Facebook's IPO though, Twitter enjoyed a good start opening at $45.10[22] and also reaching a record high of $71.65 last week[23]. Though the company is making good money from the NYSE listing, we will wait to see how it uses the resources to improve the service.<br/>Yahoo juggernaut under Marissa Mayer<br/> Ever since taking over as the CEO of the company[24], Marissa Mayer has been busy trying to revive the huge brand that Yahoo once was. In about seven months, Mayer has acquired around two dozen startups and companies in a bid to completely refresh its ageing products. Some results were immediately visible, with Yahoo's iOS weather app receiving a lot of positive feedback and also winning Apple's prestigious Design Award. Other acquisitions though are a part of a long term plan as Mayer tries to rejuvenate the Yahoo brand and make it more suitable for the contemporary crowd. One of her biggest acquisitions was Tumblr, which is said to have cost the company around a billion dollars[25].<br/>Apple-Samsung patent war<br/> The year also saw legal battles being fought between companies and the most publicized of all was the patent war between Samsung and Apple[26]. The back and forth between the two companies over the former allegedly copying the latter's iPhone design saw a lot of trials, re-trials and appeals and both companies saw victories and defeats. The first round was won by Apple where it was awarded $1 billion in damages, Samsung won the next round at the ITC, and later this year Samsung again lost an appeal and was ordered to pay Apple an additional $290 million in damages[27]. If recent reports are to be believed, the two companies have finally started talks to resolve their differences outside the court. Let's see if 2014 turns out to be the year when more drama happens at store shelves than courtrooms.<br/> Hacktivison - hacking/defacing websites and twitter handles<br/> We witnessed quite a few attacks on the websites of government agencies, news publications, on private user account information and also the act of defacing various websites. Some of the biggest attacks were carried out by the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA)[28], which defaced many news publications like Huffington Post, NY Times, BBC,\u00a0Thomson Reuters[29], Telegraph, Associate Press, FT, The Onion among others and also hacked and gained access to user information on Twitter, Truecaller[30] and Viber[31].<br/> NSA snooping<br/> Another highly controversial series of events was related to National Security Agency (NSA), one of the premier security agencies of the United States. It was revealed that NSA was spying on various computers and telecommunication medium, which was a blatant breach of a person's privacy. Whistleblower Edward Snowden made this revelation, and it shook the very foundations of the democratic government in the country. Later reports revealed that at one point NSA had hacked into and was snooping on more than 50,000 computer networks globally[32]. The revelations will have long-term impact, especially with countries taking steps to secure 'their' Internet possibly leading to Balkanization of the World Wide Web. Snowden's leaks about the part many tech companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoftand others play will also have a significant impact.<br/> The rise and fall of Bitcoins<br/> Virtual currency bitcoin gained a lot of prominence this year and with it the value of the currency went through the roof. Recently, the value of a single bitcoin was equal to a staggering $1,000. People who had forgotten or given up on the currency suddenly found themselves rich. One such man in Britain who had disposed his hard disk containing bitcoins[33] realized (a bit too late, we might add) that his collection was worth millions of pounds. The currency though, has received far from a warm welcome globally and in India, the RBI has deemed the virtual currency illegal and doesn't allow any kind of transactions[34] in the country.<br/> Year of the wearable devices<br/> The evolution of tech has always seen devices become smaller and slimmer than before and this was the year when smart devices became small enough to fit on one's wrist. That said, this category always had promise but failed to deliver. The most talked about Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch[35] was only an expensive piece of glass and plastic and Google Glass is nothing more than a field project. Other smartwatches like Pebble[36], Sony Smartwatch 2[37] or Qualcomm Toq[38] haven't done any better either and health-related smart devices like Nike FuelBand and FitBit too have a long way to go. Hopefully, in the coming year, we will get to see a breakthrough product from companies like Google[39] or Apple[40] or even an improved product from Samsung that could kickstart this genre in a big way.<br/> Gaming console wars<br/> When talking about tech, gaming cannot possibly be left out of discussion. 2013 was the year of the next-generation where Sony and Microsoftunveiled and consequently launched the PlayStation 4[41] and the Xbox One respectively. Any doubts about whether there would be enough buyers for the next-generation consoles considering their high price were laid to rest when both the companies managed to sell more than a million consoles[42] on day one of launch[43]. Since then they have introduced the consoles at other markets around the world and the sales graph is only pointing in one direction \u2014 Up!<br/>Google looks to the future<br/>Google has never been shy about trying to do something, which sounds or looks impossible. But its Google X labs continues to dish out things that would be a mainstay on sci-fi novels. This year, Google introduced the driverless car, acquired Boston Dynamics to build and develop highly intelligent robots[44] in the near future and also announced Project Loon[45]\u2014 a highly ambitious project, which will bring Internet connectivity to the world using hot air balloons.<br/> [1]: <url

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3]There's been a shift in corporate America over the past few years toward equality and accountability.Leaders are increasingly being held accountable for not only their role in the economy, but in society, as evidenced by Wednesday's Congressional hearing with big tech CEOs like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos. The executives will face questions on whether they're hampering innovation and contributing to a fair society.The move toward accountability gained speed in August 2019, when nearly 200 CEOs of America's largest companies declared their companies exist for the \"benefit of all stakeholders[4]\u2014 customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.\" This collection of CEOs, the lobbying group the Business Roundtable, rejected the idea that maximizing shareholder value at all costs will take care of everything else.Their statement was not legally binding, but even if it ends up merely symbolic, it marks a significant shift in the conversation. </p><p>Since the beginning of last year, Business Insider has been exploring the momentum behind this shift \u2014 why we need \"Better Capitalism[5],\" as we call it, and how we can achieve it.Our series started with the rejection of the shareholder primacy theory that grew in popularity in the late 1970s and became the norm beginning in the '80s. That theory led to a short-term focus on profits above all else, and we're arguing that this has come at the expense of other stakeholders, and has been a significant factor in the country's out-of-control wage-and-wealth inequality.We've found that there is an increasingly loud call to tie profits to purpose, and it's not just a moral argument, especially today amid the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide calls for racial justice.To make sense of where we are today and where we should be headed, we've gathered some of our favorite books on the economy and the role of business in society.This is an updated version of a story that ran on March 16, 2019. 'Transaction Man' by Nicholas Lemann The shift in the conversation Americans are having about capitalism has direct ties to the financial crisis and the ensuing populist movements, but its roots are in the American economy's rise to dominance following World War II.Nicholas Lemann, a New Yorker staff writer and professor and dean emeritus at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, takes a look at how the US economy got to where it is right now. [Full disclosure, a contributor to this article, Richard Feloni, attended the school of journalism when Lemann was the dean.]He explores how the theories of shareholder primacy and trickle-down economics led to, as the subtitle of the book captures, \"the rise of the deal and the decline of the American Dream.\" And it's not simply theoretical. Lemann makes his narrative resonate through the stories of both those who have thrived and those who have suffered through the past several decades in America. Find it here [6] 'The Enlightened Capitalists' by James O'Toole O'Toole, the founding director of the University of Southern California's Neely Center for Ethical Leadership and Decision-Making, chronicles the ways business leaders tried to align their profits with social good, sometimes with poor results.Using case studies of entrepreneurs behind brands like J.C. Penney and Levi Strauss &amp;#38; Co., O'Toole examines what works and what doesn't when it comes to building sustainable, socially-conscious companies. Find it here [7] 'The Shareholder Value Myth' by Lynn Stout The late Cornell Law professor Lynn Stout rose to prominence challenging the ideas that have dominated the past 40 years. In 2012, she took on the theory of shareholder primacy, which is the idea that public companies exist above all else to serve the needs of shareholders, and that if they make decisions with this approach, customers and employees will naturally benefit.There's an argument to be made that this approach may have made sense in the 1980s, after the stagflation of the '70s, but Stout shows that it was inherently flawed and achieving the opposite result. Shareholder primacy can benefit investors in the short term, but it's an approach considering all stakeholders that creates lasting long-term value for investors, as well. Find it here [8] 'Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy' by Joseph Sitglitz Joseph Stiglitz is a Nobel Prize-winning economist based at Columbia University, and his 2015 book looks at how shareholder primacy has been one of many policies that he believes have been hurting the American economy.Stiglitz dismisses the argument that implementing policies that would decrease inequality would hinder growth. Instead, he explains, the wealthiest Americans have increasingly captured the benefits of the growth seen in the past few decades, which handicaps the economy from performing at its best. Find it here [9] 'Conscious Capitalism' by John Mackey and Raj Sisodia Whole Foods founder John Mackey and Babson College professor Raj Sisodia kicked off a movement with their 2013 book, \"Conscious Capitalism.\"Stout and Stiglitz used their books to show that prevailing business theories were not only detrimental to workers and communities, but to shareholders and the economy as a whole; Mackey and Sisodia use theirs to show that businesses were already in a position to link their profits to purpose, and that investing in all stakeholders also increased the bottom line. Find it here [10] 'Winners Take All' by Anand Giridharadas Anand Giridharadas is a journalist and former McKinsey consultant who was fully enmeshed in the world of the elite. As an Aspen Institute Fellow, he was a true believer in \"doing well by doing good.\" But by 2015, he felt like everything was built on a charade.In his book, Giridharadas gives a scathing critique of how countries like the United States have essentially handed over societal problems to corporations and billionaires, without addressing the roots of the issues.We're using our list to highlight ways that those in power can better use that power, but Giridharadas' book is an important wake-up call that will ensure you are always conscious of the bigger picture. Find it here [11] 'Janesville' by Amy Goldstein We're in the early stages of another major shift in industry, where advances in technology will be both replacing and creating millions of new jobs. New solutions around job retraining and skills-based education will play a vital role in ensuring the changes benefit as many people as possible, but \"Janesville\" also shows there are no quick fixes.Washington Post reporter Amy Goldstein reported extensively in Janesville, Wisconsin[12], from 2011 to 2017, tracking the struggles of a town after its General Motors plant closed. Her findings included the insight that when we talk about \"closing the skills gap,\" we must be very deliberate about the path from training to job. It will require the cooperation of educators, politicians, corporations, and labor. Find it here [13] 'This Changes Everything' by Naomi Klein We've been focusing on how the neoliberal policies of the past 40 years have negatively impacted people, but reporter and activist Naomi Klein's 2014 book focuses on how those same policies of growth at all costs have also ravaged the planet.The literature on the harmful effects of climate change is extensive, but \"This Changes Everything\" specifically focuses on the role business has played, and why citizens must demand that significant moves toward sustainability are enforced. Find it here [14] 'Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World' by Adam Tooze The debate over the role of public companies, the wealthy, and policy in America has been waged for decades, but it's begun a new phase as the generation that entered the workforce during the financial crisis has come of age.Columbia historian Adam Tooze offers perhaps the most extensive explanation of the crisis itself, its causes, and ramifications, and how what happened in the American financial system was closely linked to the crisis that shook Europe. Find it here [15] 'Capital in the 21st Century' by Thomas Piketty French economist Thomas Piketty had an unexpected best-seller when his 800-page economics book was published in English in 2013.It's still the gold standard on understanding how we've come to a new Gilded Age. Find it here [16] 'The Curse of Bigness' by Tim Wu Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has breaking up big tech in her presidential campaign platform, and it's based on a growing movement of economists and lawyers pushing for enhanced antitrust law.Columbia law professor and former Federal Trade Commission adviser Tim Wu has provided the most succinct and persuasive case for why we should revitalize antitrust, to weaken the effects increased market concentration is having on workers, politics, and customers. Find it here [17] 'The Big Nine' by Amy Webb \"Artificial intelligence\" is a ubiquitous but often misunderstood buzzword when we discuss the future of business.New York University professor Amy Webb is here to help. She breaks down how \"The Big Nine\" developers of AI are shaping our futures, but that nothing they create has inevitable ramifications.She uses data and history to show what's actually happening in the world of AI, dispelling both excessive fear and optimism[18], and proposes ways that countries and corporations will have to work together to create regulations and expectations around increasingly powerful technology. Find it here [19] 'The Third Wave' by Steve Case There are different ways of categorizing the industrial shift we're in \u2014 there's a debate over whether it qualifies as \"the Fourth Industrial Revolution\" \u2014 but it's undeniable that technological changes are transforming the way we work.AOL founder and venture capitalist Steve Case sees this period as the beginning of \"The Third Wave of the Internet,\"[20] following the first wave of foundational internet companies like AOL and second wave companies like Facebook.We're headed into a world where \"the internet of things\" will become the internet of everything, and Case believes that this is going to more evenly distribute the power concentrated in Silicon Valley and Wall Street. It's why he's investing in rising startup scenes throughout the country, which he thinks will be critical to the future success of the American economy. Find it here [21] 'The Meritocracy Trap' by Daniel Markovits A meritocrat turns on his own class in this provocative read. The book argues that the American Dream that was built on a post-aristocracy mindset has actually replicated aristocracy by another name: meritocracy.Daniel Markovits, a Yale Law School professor, enhances in this book an argument he first gave in a 2015 commencement speech[22] at the same school. In short, he argues that elite American workers, typified by lawyers, have driven increasing inequality by commanding ever higher wages. These \"meritocrats\" work longer hours than other Americans, for greater outcomes, leading to an unhealthy situation for them, for the increasingly underpaid and underworked majority of workers, and for the economy as a whole.It's anunprecedented accomplishment in human history that the richest Americans overwhelmingly work for a living, and he argues it requires an unprecedented solution. Find it here [23] 'Goliath' by Matthew Stoller Monopoly isn't just a board game, it's the enemy of democracy, as Matthew Stoller puts it in his 2019 book \"Goliath,\" which highlights \"concentrated financial power\" as the major culprit. Whether a monopoly is US Steel or Amazon or Google, the end result is bad for the democratic political system, he argues.Stoller is a fellow at the Open Markets Institute but is better known for his voluble Twitter presence[24], his substack newsletter[25], and before this book, his essay published on the virtual eve of the 2016 election in The Atlantic: \"How Democrats Killed Their Populist Soul.\"[26]In the essay and the book it inspired, Stoller brings his own perspective as a former Capitol Hill staffer to the story of how the Democratic Party began to embrace the financial sector in the 1970s, leading to what he argues were disastrous results. The New Deal of the 1930s, he argued, broadly redefined American politics in general, and the Democratic Party in particular, as distrustful of concentrations of power. But the Democrats of today forgot its lessons.The book ranges much farther afield than the financial sector, exposing what Stoller calls \"the 100-year war\" between democracy as a political system and its opposite: monopoly power. President Franklin Roosevelt, in his telling, built off the previous era of \"trust-busting\" to investigate concentrated power in the housing, newsprint, steel, fertilizer, and tobacco, industries, to name just a few.

The decisions made by lawmakers can set the precedent for responsible (or irresponsible) technology use, so tech professionals need to get involved and speak up to bring the right topics and policies on the table.    We asked the members of Forbes Technology Council to share some advice for politically minded industry leaders who want to make sure appropriate and effective tech legislation is passed. Their best answers are below.    1. Read articles from multiple sources every day.    Reading domestic and world headlines is a regular part of my day, but it\u2019s not with the goal of weighing in and influencing the right decision. In tech/security, there may be several right answers. I like consuming them all from different source types so that I can gain perspective. It helps me understand potential audiences better. - Joe Morin , CyFlare     2. Do your part by building good products and services.    Build honest and genuinely good products and services. Honesty is the best policy, and it is very important that you build and support solutions for the larger good of people in the society and country at large. Ensure you are backing ethical and citizen-centric platforms and policies. - Vishwa Prasad , People Tech Group     Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?     3. Support existing initiatives.    Build credibility gradually by supporting existing projects. Getting involved in legislative discussions as a technologist carries some risks. If you are serious about participating, focus on finding common ground between your agenda and broader concerns. You can enter this debate gradually by sponsoring existing public initiatives like National Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October. - Nelson Cicchitto , Avatier Corporation    4. Balance innovation with an awareness of potential harm.    The question of regulating tech is at the forefront these days \u2014 an example is San Francisco\u2019s ban on facial recognition. When it comes to legislation and policy, it is not enough to think about how one rule applies to all but how can we balance innovation with actual harm. Understanding different countries\u2019 laws is equally important, because the United States\u2019 Fourth Amendment does not exist in China or South Korea. - Swathi Young , Integrity Management Systems Inc.    5. Use your expertise to help protect the public.    In the First, Third, Fourth and Fifth Amendments, the U.S. Constitution implicitly grants a right to privacy against governmental intrusion. Therefore, it\u2019s imperative that cybersecurity is in compliance with the protection of privacy. As tech leaders, we should be vocal, especially since the public doesn\u2019t share our level of expertise. It\u2019s incumbent upon us to sound the alarm on such matters. - Frank Speiser , Talla    6. Emphasize the importance of cybersecurity.    A federal cyber-disaster assistance program is needed. This will put the severity, magnitude and importance in its proper perspective. Cyberattacks are not going away, and I expect them to get much worse. Expect the types of cybercrimes in healthcare to become terrifying. Until cybersecurity is \u201cmarketed\u201d correctly, it will not get the attention that it deserves. - Will Conaway , The HCI Group/Tech Mahindra    7. Be a part of the legislative process.    Big tech leaders understand that, in general, \u201cIf you\u2019re not sitting at the dinner table, you\u2019re next on the menu.\u201d Accordingly, the only way for leaders to make sure that the \u201cright\u201d tech-focused legislation is passed is to be part of the legislative process. Whether through expert testimony, public debate and opinion building, leaders can shape this process by being a proactive part of it. - Ahmad (Al) Fares , CeliTech Inc.    8. Be informed and get involved.    Tech leaders who want to be involved in policies or need to be involved due to the type of work we do (in our case, face detection is a hot topic out there) need to make sure that we are first of all informed about what is going on in Washington \u2014 but also we need to be involved. We have chosen to become involved with organizations that guide decisions. - Mercedes Soria , Knightscope    9. Foster open communication to reach consensus.    Keep an open mind and realize that numbers represent power. Invest in the occasional town hall meeting with your employees. Urge them that free thinking is promoted and that an open mindset is a plus. Once there is an agreement among the majority, we can tip the scales of democracy and hopefully get the right legislation passed. With more people comes more influence, both around the state and around the country. - WaiJe Coler , InfoTracer    10. Promote the benefits of technology solutions.    Be outspoken about what good your technology can bring to society and life in your country. If politicians notice you and keep you in the back of their minds, they will think about the benefits of implementing your solutions when passing certain legislations. - Daria Leshchenko , SupportYourApp Inc.    11. Encourage politicians to consider the worst-case scenario.    Encourage every politician to watch Black Mirror on Netflix. That\u2019s no joke. Our leaders need to be able to imagine the butterfly effect of societal change that can be wrought by new tech legislation. Whether they\u2019re draconian or overly permissive, misguided tech laws move us closer to a truly dystopian future, so we need to make sure that politicians understand that they\u2019re playing with fire. - Chris Turlica , MaintainX Inc.    12. Focus first on industry standards and guidelines.    Work on guidelines and standards for the industry first, which will help uninformed or non-tech legislators better understand what to do next. The tech industry is still pretty lawless, so unless we legislate ourselves, laws are always going to benefit those rich enough to hire lobbyists. More importantly, they\u2019ll ignore the rights and needs of the users. - Thomas Griffin , OptinMonster    13. Avoid ethically questionable income.    Put your money where your mouth is. If you want to get involved in the political implications of something, make sure you\u2019re willing to walk the walk. Refuse the ethically sticky money even if it\u2019s legal. - Tim Conkle , The 20    14. Consider both industry and user needs.    For politically minded tech leaders to ensure the right legislation is passed, they must consider the desires and needs of both the industry and its users. It\u2019s vital that leaders have an objective, balanced perspective on any issue involving technology, as well as any implications that arise from implementing a particular solution. It\u2019s tough to do this, but all opinions must be accounted for. - Marc Fischer , Dogtown Media LLC    15. Reach out to industry peers and legislators.    As a tech leader, you have a right to be involved in the aspects of the legislation that will impact your business. Therefore, make sure to be involved. Contact those who are drafting the legislation, join groups that align with your point of view, and reach out to your fellow tech businesses and let them know the impact the legislation will have and why they should speak up. Get involved! - Alexandro Pando , Xyrupt Technologies</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Behind the closed doors of a congressional task force a month ago, the media giant's video ads unit FreeWheel accused Google of using privacy concerns as a pretext to limit FreeWheel's ability to sell ads on behalf of its clients' YouTube channels, the authors say, citing four people briefed on the discussion. Comcast wants to avoid letting the Alphabet unit do to the video ad industry what it has done to the online ad market, the authors note. \"FreeWheel would embrace a solution that allowed it to continue to meaningfully serve its clients when they publish their content on YouTube, as it had for over a decade on that platform,\" Comcast said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, the actions to remove or degrade FreeWheel's capabilities on YouTube fall well short of that.\" [Reference Link]:[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-alphabet-antitrust-exclusive-idUSKBN1WG3J7?utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_content=5d93bc2fb1a00400017b6d74&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-alphabet-antitrust-exclusive-idUSKBN1WG3J7?utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_content=5d93bc2fb1a00400017b6d74&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter</url>]</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLYCOM-353688443</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLYCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5W-S4W1-JCD8-M271-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">295234</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"211\"/><timeReceived>4:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Comtex News Network, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheFlyOnTheWall.com</copyright><bodyText><p>This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.</p></bodyText><publicationName>Theflyonthewall.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 1, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While these developments may not yet be well-known to the public, they\u2019ll soon be coming online\u2014and when they do come, you\u2019ll want to be ready for them.    As industry leaders, the members of Forbes Technology Council stay on top of the latest tech trends as well as how those trends will affect the world at large. Below, they share 16 major tech developments they believe will shake things up in the consumer market.    1. Digitization Of Healthcare    Digitization of healthcare is on a fast-track due to Covid-19 and is headed towards major disruption. Consumers will start seeing some of the following technologies become mainstream: virtual nurse consultations using chatbots; predictive analytics and preventative care using artificial intelligence; augmented reality for analyzing MRIs and CT scans; the storage of patient data using blockchain; etc. Low-cost, patient-centered healthcare could soon be a reality. - Beena Jacob , Donoma Software     2. Quantum Computing    Quantum computing is a major tech trend that has the potential to deliver solutions to some of the earth\u2019s most complicated predicaments and solve complex problems across industries. Its utilization will affect consumers in a myriad of ways\u2014the most immediate being its ability to completely upend data security, including cracking encryption, which would render current encryption methods obsolete. - Rodney Joffe , Neustar     Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?     3. Cloud Computing    Cloud computing is likely to receive an increase in implementation across all types of apps. As Covid-19 spread, the demand for cloud-based video conferencing and online teaching skyrocketed. Moving forward, businesses and educational institutions are likely to continue to make use of this technology, as student and employee behaviors change and the demand to access resources remotely grows. - Sanjay Malhotra , Clearbridge Mobile    4. Video Surveillance AI    Scaling video surveillance AI with the right card-reading technologies will severely disrupt the hypermarket business. We\u2019ve already seen pilot projects for staffless shops. Once this technology is mature enough, the whole shopping experience will be redesigned as it will no longer need to be organized around cash desks. - Ivailo Nikolov , SiteGround    5. Digitization Of The Financial Industry    The relatively slow pace of the financial industry\u2019s digital transformation to date has been sped up significantly by Covid-19. As more financial institutions begin turning into data companies, they move beyond mere transactions and acting as intermediaries to become true financial advocates for their customers, resulting in our society reaping the benefits of improved financial strength. - Brandon Dewitt , MX    6. Virtual Learning    Healthcare and education are two sectors that are headed towards major disruption. Healthcare is already an election conversation, but big tech like Amazon\u2019s 24/7 medication delivery platform, Apple\u2019s fitness monitoring and Alphabet\u2019s entry into EHR are examples. Virtual learning during Covid-19 has proven that students from early education to college can thrive using online learning platforms. - Swathi Young , Integrity Management Systems Inc    7. 5G And 3D Printing On Demand    5G and 3D printing on demand will be the next big waves that will affect consumer purchasing behavior and the types of products they will put their disposable income into. 5G will open up a whole new world of more advanced tech products such as mobile phones and tablets, while 3D printing on demand will allow consumers to customize and buy products with limited lead time. - Abhinav Somani , Leverton, An MRI Software Company    8. Enhanced Data Privacy    I believe that we will start to see more industry adoption of solutions that are looking to improve the way enterprises are handling data and preserving the privacy of their customers. The General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act and other local acts are driving this transformation; however, customers\u2019 education and understanding will give this trend another major push. - Assaf Cohen , Anqlave    9. Digital Twins    Digital twins have already transformed predictive modeling capabilities in the industrial IoT, and soon they\u2019ll begin to transform the customer experience in retail and hospitality. Advancements in AI and machine learning will continue to improve our capability to simulate and predict buyer behavior for truly one-to-one recommendations, offers and products. - Shiv Sundar , Esper    10. Autonomous Vehicles    I think that autonomous vehicles will greatly impact the lives of consumers. The self-driving revolution will diminish the need for an individual to purchase his or her own car because self-driving fleets will emerge as a more optimal method of transport. As a result, consumers will save the vast amounts of time and money that are required to own and maintain an automobile. - Ashwini Choudhary , Recogni    11. Safer Online Security    More and more security measures are going to be implemented as we move forward. Two-factor authentication is already a standard for giants like Google and Salesforce, which means that soon it is not going to be enough. Soon, storing your data online is not going to be such a big risk, which is what we have been striving for since the dawn of the internet. - Daria Leshchenko , SupportYourApp Inc.    12. Remote Condition Monitoring    Remote condition monitoring is a big trend for manufacturing companies looking to assess the health of their assets from afar. Using Industrial Internet of Things tech\u2014such as temperature and vibration sensors connected to an app\u2014an engineer can spot exactly when a problem is happening in real time and act quickly to make changes. - Ryan Chan , UpKeep Maintenance Management    13. Augmented Reality    Augmented reality is becoming more and more mainstream, from walking directions to furniture placement\u2014and of course some amazing AR games. I think we will see consumers continuing to embrace its capabilities and demanding richer features. - Amy Czuchlewski , Bottle Rocket    14. Data Fabrics    Data fabrics are going to fundamentally change the way technology works. and consumers are going to see a massive increase in data privacy protections as a result. Imagine a world where a person can decide what data they want to share and whom they want to share it with and have those permissions persist universally\u2014because that\u2019s what data fabrics eventually will allow. - Dan Demers , Cinchy    15. E-Personalization For Remote Work    Working from home will be the new normal, and e-personalization will be the new revolution. Although one-on-one interactions are important, Covid-19 has taught not only employers but employees how to function in a virtual and e-adaptation environment. Technology around it will be at an all-time high. - Bhavna Juneja , Infinity, a Stamford Technology Company    16. Virtualization Of Cellular Networks    Cellular networks are being virtualized and moved to the cloud. What used to be an expensive hardware-based network core can now be software modules running on-demand on multiple cloud instances. This will make new generations of cellular networks less expensive to build and scale, and consumers will eventually see their mobile bills shrinking\u2014starting with 5G. - Ahmad (Al) Fares , CeliTech Inc.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42650759147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DH-75K1-JCSC-J29H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1304\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Over 750 companies, including Unilever and Coca-Cola, are taking part in a one month boycott of the platform, in an effort to increase the platform\u2019s accountability and combat hate speech.    Facebook is no stranger to controversy. Zuckerberg has been warding off criticism for years, most notably for allowing data to be harvested without consent. Facebook\u2019s behaviour modification technology has also been criticised. Silicon Valley investor, and one-time mentor to Mark Zuckerberg, Roger McNamee describes the \u201cpersuasive technology\u201d used by Facebook as a combination of psychology, propaganda and rewards linked to people\u2019s need for validation and approval. Sean Parker, Facebook\u2019s first president, said that \u201cwe need to give you a little dopamine hit once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a post or whatever\u2026it\u2019s a social validation feedback loop\u201d. He went on to say \u201c[this technology] literally changes your relationship with society.\u201d    If advertisers fail, will then regulators succeed?    Even though 98% of Facebook\u2019s revenues come from advertising, the senior management team seems confident that the current boycott will be a flash in the pan. However, an advertising drought is not Facebook\u2019s only problem. Zuckerberg, along with Bezos of Amazon and Pichai of Alphabet, is, later this month, set to appear before Congress at an antitrust hearing whose aim is to ascertain if smaller companies are being marginalised, stymying competition.    The thorny factor here is data. Like Facebook, Amazon is an expert in data collection and mining. In its dual role as a retailer and marketplace, Amazon gathers data from small, independent sellers, which is then used to promote its own products.    Could these antitrust hearings be the start of a wider pattern to rein in the powers of big tech? It\u2019s probably too early to say for sure, but there is an increasing political will to weaken them. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s a contender to be Joe Biden\u2019s VP running mate in the 2020 presidential election, has been vocal about the need to bring such companies to heel, promising to break them up. For Facebook, that would involve reversing major acquisitions, such as Instagram and WhatsApp.    US tech titans have also drawn the ire of the Trump administration, so regardless of who wins The Whitehouse in November, there are likely to be numerous bumps in the road ahead. As investors, we\u2019ve been wary for some time about companies dependent on the use of big data . Recent developments have cemented that view especially as these high-flyers are priced for perfection, making them vulnerable to a change in sentiment.

In a statement regarding quarterly guidance, Apple (AAPL) said that: \"As the public health response to COVID-19 continues, our thoughts remain with the communities and individuals most deeply affected by the disease, and with those working around the clock to contain its spread and to treat the ill. [...] Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated. As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter due to two main factors. The first is that worldwide iPhone supply will be temporarily constrained. </p><p>While our iPhone manufacturing partner sites are located outside the Hubei province - and while all of these facilities have reopened - they are ramping up more slowly than we had anticipated. [...] The second is that demand for our products within China has been affected. All of our stores in China and many of our partner stores have been closed. Additionally, stores that are open have been operating at reduced hours and with very low customer traffic.\" 2. Bombardier (BDRBF) announced that it has made the strategic decision to focus exclusively on business aviation and plans to accelerate its deleveraging through the sale of its rail business. Bombardier has signed a memorandum of understanding with Alstom SA (ALSMY) and the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec for the sale of its Transportation business to Alstom. Under the transaction, Bombardier and la Caisse will sell their interests in Bombardier Transportation to Alstom on the basis of an enterprise value of $8.2B. Total proceeds, after the deduction of debt-like items and transferred liabilities, including pension obligations, and net of BT cash, are expected to be approximately $6.4B, subject to upward adjustments of up to $440M. After deducting la Caisse's equity position between $2.1B-$2.3B, Bombardier would receive net proceeds of between $4.2B-$4.5B, including $550M of Alstom shares for a fixed subscription price of EUR 47.50, monetizable after a three-month lock-up post-closing, subject to closing adjustments, indemnities and the EUR to USD exchange rate. 3. Pier 1 Imports (PIR) announced that it has entered into a Plan Support Agreement with a majority of its term loan lenders and is pursuing a sale of the company. To facilitate an orderly sale process and implement the PSA, the company and its subsidiaries have commenced voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The company also intends to use this process to complete the previously announced closure of up to 450 store locations, which includes the closure of all its stores in Canada. 4. For months now, regulators, legislators, activists, and presidential candidates have been calling out the toxic impact that big tech platforms are having on privacy, security, and consumer choice, and there are signs that regulation is starting to hurt, Eric Savitz wrote in this week's edition of Barron's. But it is actually the self-imposed checks that could be most damaging to tech's bottom line in the months to come, with Google (GOOGL) beginning to limit cookies in its Chrome browser and Apple adding a feature in its iPhone software that alerts consumers when an app tracks their location, the author noted. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) is starting to feel the effects of restrictions on both ad targeting and measurement, as the company says that \"the majority of that impact lies in front of us.\" 5.

Microsoft (MSFT) has confirmed that it has held talks with ByteDance to acquire TikTok in the U.S. In a statement, Microsoft said that, \"Following a conversation between Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and President Donald J. Trump, Microsoft is prepared to continue discussions to explore a purchase of TikTok in the United States. Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President's concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury. </p><p>Microsoft will move quickly to pursue discussions with TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in a matter of weeks, and in any event completing these discussions no later than September 15, 2020. [...] The operating model for the service would be built to ensure transparency to users as well as appropriate security oversight by governments in these countries. Among other measures, Microsoft would ensure that all private data of TikTok's American users is transferred to and remains in the United States. To the extent that any such data is currently stored or backed-up outside the United States, Microsoft would ensure that this data is deleted from servers outside the country after it is transferred.\" 2. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) announced that it and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into a definitive agreement with 7-Eleven, a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Seven &amp; i Holdings, whereby 7-Eleven will acquire Speedway for $21B in cash. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. 3. On Wednesday, Alphabet's (GOOG; GOOGL) Sundar Pichai, Amazon's (AMZN), Apple's (AAPL) Tim Cook, and Facebook's (FB) Mark Zuckerberg were hauled in front of a virtual Congressional hearing, where they were subjected to more than five hours of cantankerous questions from both sides of the aisle, Eric Savitz wrote in this week's edition of Barron's. But investors basically ignored the proceedings, with all four stocks rising as the hearings went on, the author noted. Less than 24 hours later, investors' confidence was validated, when the same four companies reported their June quarter earnings, posting \"impressive, Street-beating sales and profits,\" he added. Ultimately, there are still regulatory risks for all of these stocks, but the risks seem increasingly modest compared with the enduring appeal of big tech's businesses, the publication contended. 4. Apple is pushing for huge rent reductions across its UK stores despite its sales soaring to new heights during the lockdown, The Sunday Times' Sam Chambers reported. The tech giant has told landlords of a portion of its 38-store estate in the U.K. that it wants rents slashed by up to 50% and a rent-free period. In return, it has offered to extend leases by a few years, the author noted. 5. AutoNation (AN), Group 1 Automotive (GPI) and CarMax (KMX) saw positive mentions in this week's edition of Barron's.|</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLYCOM-368777517</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLYCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H2-T3J1-DYWB-B2W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">295234</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"522\"/><timeReceived>7:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Comtex News Network, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Fly</copyright><bodyText><p>This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.</p></bodyText><publicationName>Theflyonthewall.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002LP6</classCode><className>7-ELEVEN INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009RKX</classCode><className>SEVEN &amp;

So, once a year I list my firm's holdings in this column.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Currently I own 20 stocks for most of my clients. I own most of them personally as well.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I hold two stocks that depend on consumer discretionary spending \"\u201d NVR Inc. (NVR), a homebuilder, and Sony Corp. (SNE), a Japanese consumer electronics company. NVR is my longest-standing holding, going back to 2012. I've owned Sony for two years; it went nowhere for a while but is up 32 percent this year.  </p><p>Consumer-staples stocks are popular these days, but I deem most of them overpriced. I own only Sanderson Farms Inc. (SAFM), a Mississippi-based chicken producer and processor. It's a longstanding trend for Americans to eat less beef and more chicken each year.  </p><p>In the energy sector, I own nothing. There will be big gains to be made by piling back into energy at the right time \"\u201d but in my opinion that time hasn't yet come.  </p><p>I hold four financial stocks. Two of them are big banks, JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp.(BAC). They are likely to earn better lending spreads if interest rates rise over the next two to three years. They might also benefit from looser regulation, if the Trump administration gets its way. </p><p>Two from Tom </p><p>My other two financial holdings are stocks that my colleague Tom Macpherson is sweet on \"\u201d Mastercard Inc.(MA) and T. Rowe Price Inc. (TROW). Mastercard has earned a return on stockholders' equity of more than 40 percent in nine of the past 10 years.  </p><p>T. Rowe Price, which runs mutual funds, has also been unusually profitable but is fighting the increasing popularity of \"passive\" or index investing. </p><p>Up for grabs </p><p>I am light in health care, because the rules for financing health care in the country are up for grabs. However, I like Fonar Corp. (FONR) of Melville, N.Y., which makes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines in which patients can stand up, allowing doctors to see a weight-bearing image. We also own Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO), a Danish company that is a world leader in diabetes treatments.  </p><p>In the industrial sector, I hold a pair of defense stocks, General Dynamics Corp. (GD) and Leonardo SA (FINMY). General Dynamics is a broad-stream defense contractor that I have liked for many years. Leonardo is an Italian defense contractor. </p><p>I figure that European defense companies will do more business as Europe reacts on the east to the threat of Vladimir Putin's Russia, and on the west to President Trump's insistence that it pay more of its own defense cost. </p><p>What glitters? </p><p>The only security I own in the materials sector is SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which represents holdings of physical gold. Gold frequently (not always) does well during periods of inflation or international turmoil. Both conditions appear reasonably likely to me in the next two to three years.  </p><p>In technology, my firm has several holdings, mostly picked by my colleague Katharine Davidge. We have two semiconductor equipment stocks, Lam Research Corp. (LRCX) and Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT).  </p><p>From Israel comes Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP), a leader in loss prevention and cybersecurity. And from Canada comes Computer Modelling Group Ltd. (CMDXF), which makes software used to more efficiently drill for oil and gas.  </p><p>The uber-popular big tech stocks such as Microsoft and Facebook are represented by Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK). </p><p>Naked </p><p>In telecommunications, utilities and real estate, we are naked, with no positions at all for most clients.  </p><p>To me, the utilities are way too expensive considering what slow-growth companies they are. I have nothing against Telecom in the abstract, but find little to excite me there. </p><p>As for real estate, I'm troubled that the \"cap rate\" (rents as a percentage of the price to purchase a building are now ranging mostly between 5.5 percent and 7 percent. So, buyers of buildings are counting on capital appreciation, which may or may not come. </p><p>Foreign exposure </p><p>Rounding out our model portfolio, we own three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in addition to XLK, mentioned above. They are iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG), SPDR S&amp;P Emerging Markets Dividend ETF (EDIV), and Index IQ Australia Small Cap ETF (KROO). </p><p>As you can surmise from these holdings, I'm specifically looking for equity exposure outside the U.S. I think the American economy is okay and strengthening but stock prices here are on the high side, about 25 earnings compared to a normal multiple of about 15. </p><p>John Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Newton Upper Falls, Mass., and a syndicated columnist.

With the biggest wave of multi-billion-dollar tech-powered IPOs hitting the market, there has been[2] some talk[3] about[4] a dot-com crash II[5]. But a lot has changed over the last 20 years. In the late 1990s everybody was hatching a plan to 'monetize' the internet. There weremore than a few[6]questionable ventures. </p><p>Remember whenFlooz[7]spent millions onads[8]with Whoopi Goldberg? Maybe not. It collapsed soon after. Just half of U.S. adultsused the internet in 2000,[9]compared with 90% now. Many were wary of sharing their credit card information online. Now malls are closing because millions do so every day. E-commerce's share of U.S. retail sales grew 16-fold between1999[10]and2016[11]to 8%, or $389 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Another big difference: The cost of growing a tech company is lower because there's a cost-efficient and powerful infrastructure of online services that didn't exist 20 years ago. Why buy servers when you can rent them from Amazon, Google, or Microsoft? Why enter into a long-term office lease when you can lease by seat from WeWork[12]? Today you don't need deep pockets to get the same 'bells and whistles' as the big players. Probably the biggest cost for startups during the dot-com era was marketing. A lot of money was wasted on events that produced dubious ROI. Traditional marketing tools \u2014 like print ads and broadcast commercials \u2014 were expensive and inefficient. Now startups can create their own online ads and target whatever demographic they wish to sell to using Facebook, Twitter, Google, and LinkedIn. To be sure, the cost of acquiring a customer is on the rise again, depending on the sector. Two decades ago, a pile of dot-com companies went public without meaningful revenues or market share. When Pets.com filed to go public in 2000, it had 'lifetime revenue below $6 million and just one year of operations under its belt[13].' That's no longer the norm. The median age for companies going public in1999 was four years, compared with 12 in 2018[14]. Case in point: The former CEO of Pets.com took luxury consignment marketplace The RealReal public in June, eight years after founding it. The RealReal had more than $200 million in revenue last year. Another huge shift since sock puppet days: It's easier for tech startups to go global[15] and reach many more markets: Airbnb, Peloton, Uber, and Zoom all have a growing presence in markets outside the U.S. That wasn't the case for most dot-com companies with U.S. headquarters. Another difference between then and now was the sudden pause in technology upgrades after huge investments ahead of Y2K. Tech providers saw their business shrivel up. Today corporate America is investing billions in a broad range of new smart technologies, such as AI. One thing all of the 2019 crop of tech IPOs do that almost nobody did in 1999 is leverage their data as a revenue source and powerful tool. Thanks to new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP[16]), today's tech companies can quickly sell new products and services as they identify new opportunities and unaddressed markets. Amazon started out selling just books. To be sure, there are a number of challenges that this year's would-be unicorns must manage that weren't on the horizon two decades ago. Near the top of that list is crossing paths with one of the 'Four Horsemen[17]' of the tech industry \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. They are all deepening their participation in the markets they dominate while expanding to new verticals. The challenge for entrepreneurs will be how to increase market share and revenue in a sector before they get trampled. Given the Four Horsemen'sunique access to data, they can easily identify the latest trends and hot companies and buy the most interesting players before others realize they even exist. Momentum is building among politicians, regulators, and consumers to take a more critical view of the business practices of these four companies. The Justice Department's decision[18]last month to open an antitrust review of big tech companies could lead to huge transformations, and opportunities. The 1984 breakup of AT...shered in a new age of telecommunications and tech innovation. Another big question: How will the EU's General Data Protection Regulation[19](GDPR) affect tech companies' collection and use of data? Tech giants and startups have self-policed themselves, but those days are ending. The data privacy challenges of Facebook, Google, et al over the last year have made this clear. Widespread adoption of AI and 5G will create new opportunities and lay waste to companies and industries that don't adapt quickly enough. Still, I believe the chances of another dot-com bubble event are far less than 50% and can be offset by new tech opportunities and expansion into new verticals. Being nimble, proactive, and reactive are the new norm. There will be companies that don't make it and investors that lose money, but there has to be a bubble for a bubble to burst.

Simultaneously, the use of catalysts has increased in chemical and fuel production to reduce pollutants and toxic emissions. Many of these advances could not have occurred without critical materials (CMs), i.e., rare earth elements (REEs), and precious and specialty metals. Although various gases and liquids are important, this article focuses on metals because of their overwhelming importance economically, societally, and in the defense sector. Similarly, while lithium is widely and increasingly used in batteries, it will likely remain sufficiently available in the foreseeable future at a practical cost and therefore is also not discussed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several countries are taking steps at the national level to increase production and develop more efficient extraction and purification processes for CMs. The U.S. federal government has prepared a preliminary list of materials identified as having strategic importance for the security and prosperity of the country (Table 1) (1). Table 2 lists eight CMs and provides examples of their use; the limited availability and high prices of many of these metals have concerned equipment suppliers.</p><p>The criticality of various materials depends on their economic importance, supply risks, and other environmental considerations. The European Union (EU), the U.S. Dept, of Energy (DOE), and private companies have evaluated these criteria for many materials. Their approaches and conclusions are publicly available and are discussed in a previous CEP article (2).</p><p>Initial sources of critical materials</p><p>Almost all CMs are available somewhere in the earth's crust or oceans, commonly as compounds such as chlorides, oxides, phosphates, or sulfides. A few are synthetic. Many sources are located in regions of political instability, or countries where corruption of high-level government officials is common, as well as in areas with poor infrastructure or poor environmental, health, and safety (EHS) practices. For example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the source of approximately two-thirds of the world's cobalt and copper, was publicly criticized for allowing unsafe working conditions and the use of child labor (3, 4). Many large companies have policies that prohibit transactions with entities that allow such practices, and encourage using only ethically sourced cobalt, straining the supply. Conversely, China, the source of most REEs, has now shut down much of the illegal mining and raised the EHS requirements for official mines. These positive steps toward human rights have, however, undoubtedly incurred costs that will be passed on to customers.</p><p>Many source countries tend to view their mineral resources as strategic assets. They sometimes limit exports for political reasons as a tactic in trade and tariff wars, or to benefit their domestic industries. China reduced exports for molybdenum and tungsten by 40% in 2010, citing environmental reasons (5). The U.S., EU, and Japan sued in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to overturn this practice, won, and after an unsuccessful appeal, China removed these caps in 2015 (6). Indonesia banned the export of nickel ores and bauxite in 2014 specifically to help its smelting industry. International nickel prices then increased by 50%, but the country's revenues from the export taxes were lost and its national budget was seriously harmed; the ban was removed in 2017 (7).</p><p>To remain competitive, many countries do not provide detailed information about production rates and inventories of their mineral resources. This introduces large uncertainties into the economic viability of opening a new mine or expanding the capacity of one already in existence.</p><p>Rare earth elements and other desired materials found in the earth's crust or oceans are present in higher volumes than the word \"rare\" implies. The practical problem is that their concentrations vary considerably from mine to mine and even from one location to another within a mine. Many of the REE concentrations are very low, in the range of parts per million (ppm) or even parts per billion (ppb) by weight. The threshold concentration for economically viable REE separation and purification by current technologies is approximately 0.03 wt% (300 ppm). Below this concentration, production of many REEs would likely entail prohibitively high costs.</p><p>To further complicate the supply of CMs, there are virtually no mines built and operated for the main purpose of producing CMs. CMs are almost entirely obtained as byproducts from mines that produce more abundant and widely used metals such as copper, lead, nickel, and zinc and, to a lesser extent, aluminum, and iron. The production rates of CMs are therefore closely tied to the demand for other metals.</p><p>Improving the supply chain</p><p>One approach to increasing the availability of CMs is to convert other elements to the desired ones within highenergy particle accelerators or to collect them from decay products of radioactive elements in nuclear reactors. These conversion methods are currently economically impractical, and are expected to remain so for many decades, so this article will not discuss them further.</p><p>Research and development is currently underway to develop additional sources and processes to make larger quantities of cobalt and other metals available worldwide. Fortune Minerals Ltd. has designed a plant to produce 2,000 tons of cobalt per year, along with gold and bismuth. Scheduled to begin commercial opperation in the Canadian Northwest in 2021, this project's success would significantly increase the availability of cobalt.</p><p>Large quantities of REEs, at relatively high concentrations, were discovered in 2013 and were recently characterized quantitatively (8). The source, located approximately 25 ft beneath the seabed, is about 18,000 ft below sea level, within the Japanese Exclusive Economic Zone around the western North Pacific island of Minami-Tori-shima (also known as Marcus Island). This has the potential to change the supply, availability, and price of REEs throughout the world. Given its depth and location, however, successful development will be very difficult.</p><p>Oil diid g\u00e5s\u00ab companies have extracted crude materials from subsea beds for many years, confirming the viability of ultra-deep-water ventures. For example, the multibillion-dollar Stones Field project in the Gulf of Mexico, which operates at a water depth of 9,576 ft, has been operating since 2016 and is producing approximately 50,000 bbl/day of oil (9).</p><p>As those projects demonstrate, the necessary facilities are complicated and costly and they involve substantial technical, environmental, and economic risks. Additional difficulties such as corrosion and erosion will also need to be addressed to recover REEs from the Minami-Tori-shima site, which will require collecting and raising a salty mud to the ocean surface. Numerous chemical engineering challenges must be overcome in the design of the process and equipment for the separation and purification operations, the selection of the materials of construction, and the development and design of the process instrumentation and control systems. National legal requirements and international treaties, as well as financial challenges, must be addressed for the extraction to become a reality (10).</p><p>An earlier project, Solwara 1, to recover copper, gold, silver, and zinc from a bed located 5,200 ft below sea level in the Bismarck Sea off Papua, New Guinea (PNG), experienced delays. Although the PNG government granted Nautilus Minerals an environmental permit in 2009 and a development license in 2012, the project encountered substantial public opposition due to concerns about marine life and a lack of transparency. While progress remains on hold, the developer, which has already invested over $11 million, is seeking additional project financing of $350 million for further development until production commences (11).</p><p>Although numerous companies in a variety of CM-using applications may ultimately benefit, it will be many years before significant amounts of CMs are available from deep subsea sources at commercially acceptable costs.</p><p>Byproduct sources of CMs</p><p>Several realistic projects are currently underway for CM extraction as a byproduct of more common materials. Alkane Resources Ltd. is now seeking final financing of $603 million to $970 million to increase the production of zirconium from an open-pit mine in New South Wales, Australia. Although focusing on zirconium, the plant will also produce 50 ton/yr of 99.8%-pure hafnium chloride and hafnium dioxide and/or 25 ton/yr of 99.9%-pure hafnium for use in semiconductors; the company's target production rate for these is 250 ton/yr of hafnium products. If the goals are met, the amount of hafnium currently available in the global marketplace will double. Other possible side products include niobium, tantalum, and yttrium.</p><p>CMs are also found in the U.S., but at very low concentrations that make their recovery uneconomical. The DOE, through its National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), is currently funding several projects to recover REEs from domestic U.S. coals and their byproducts. The projects aim to increase the yield, purity, and production rates of CMs, with a goal of 90% purity at a production rate of 10 lb of purified product. Table 3 presents interim results of pilot plant and bench-scale studies using a variety of coal wastes (12).</p><p>Recycling and CMs</p><p>The benefits of recycling are widely known, and the practice is encouraged by the UN and the EU, among others. Various countries have passed legislation governing disposal and recycling practices. Within the U.S., half of the states have enacted regulations focused on the recycling of electronic equipment. They define the items that are covered (and those that are specifically excluded), quantitative targets, the role of manufacturers, and requirements to use qualified disposal and recycling sites (13-15).</p><p>The extent to which common materials such as copper, nickel, and aluminum are recycled further complicates the supply of CMs. The practicality of recycling depends on the concentration of the desired material in the feed stream, its required purity in the product, and the amount and nature of the feed stream. Each recovered metal has unique physical and thermodynamic properties, which limit the types of recovery processes that can be used.</p><p>The required purity depends on the particular CM being considered and its intended use. The purities for semiconductor applications generally range from 90% to 99.9999%. Various unit operations, such as milling followed by flotation, purify the CM content of mining byproducts or recycled devices to the required levels. Thermal means (e.g., smelting), electrolysis (such as is used for aluminum production), or vapor deposition (such as is used to produce carbon nanotubes) are used to further purify the concentrated material. Other preliminary separation routes include leaching with sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide, followed by solvent extraction and then a final purification process. Other processes, including staged membrane-based designs, ion exchange leaching, reverse osmosis, and bio-oxidation, are also being investigated as ways to improve yields and/or reduce the costs of current separation/purification processes (16).</p><p>Relatively little consideration is currently given to specifying the composition of the major non-CM portions. End-use products, overall design, and packaging could all be altered to facilitate recycling possibilities.</p><p>An average cellphone weighs approximately 170 g and may contain approximately 34 mg of gold, 350 mg of silver, and 15 mg of palladium, as well as aluminum, copper, and even smaller amounts of valuable REEs (17). These desirable materials therefore represent only 0.23% (2,300 ppm) of the total weight. Their economic values, however, justify separating them from the device then from each other to obtain purified products.</p><p>Designing a suitable CM recovery facility requires data on melting points, densities, and viscosities, as well as phase equilibrium information such as the distribution of the desired products among the liquid, gas, and solid phases. Radar charts are a useful way to organize and visualize equilibrium phase data (Figure 1). If chemical reactions are involved in the CM extraction and purification, information about reaction rates as a function of feed composition, pressure, and temperature are required. The design of recovery and purification equipment, such as tanks, piping, pumps, instrumentation, sensors, insulation, and other plant components, also requires an understanding of the materials' corrosivity and toxicity.</p><p>Several processes for recovering CMs, whether from ores, mine wastes, or recycled materials, use hydrogen fluoride, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, ammonia, organic solvents, or ion exchange resins. These, or their reaction products, may be hazardous to humans, animals, marine species, and vegetation. The concentrations of plant emissions must therefore be reduced to acceptable levels and properly monitored. Many of the mines containing REEs also contain noticeable amounts of uranium and thorium. Handling and disposing of these radioactive materials adds additional complexities and costs to plant design and operation.</p><p>Regardless of the processes used to recover CMs, overall plant operations are very energy intensive and have high capital and operating costs - all of which contribute to the high prices of CMs.</p><p>Successfully designing, installing, and operating a CM production facility is a formidable chemical engineering challenge likely to yield dramatic benefits. A 2014 study reported that 41.8 million m.t. of used electrical and electronic equipment were discarded that year, and the amount was expected to increase to 50 million m.t. by 2018 (19). Of this, approximately 5% is copper, gold, palladium, and silver, with an overall market value of about $32 billion for just these four metals. The presence of other CMs will substantially increase this value. The current private sector, government, and academic efforts to recover and reuse CMs are certainly justifiable from economic, societal, and defense viewpoints.</p><p>Many companies around the world are capable of recycling and purifying electronic waste. A few, however, account for most of the electric vehicle battery recovery market, which involves the recycling of not just precious metals and copper, but also of REEs and other CMs. One company relies on flotation for separation and concentration. Another, a precious-metals refining operation, employs an ultra-high-temperature technology that combines pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical methods; it is now increasing its capacity from 350,000 ton/yr to 500,000 ton/yr of electrical waste. Another company has announced plans for a plant that will include recycling of streams from sources other than its own mine; the facility, however, is not yet under construction.</p><p>There are sound technical, societal, and economic reasons to recycle materials, including:</p><p>* upgrading a material to its initial composition requires less energy than refining raw ores</p><p>* less pollution is discharged to the environment</p><p>* material that would otherwise be disposed of in a landfill at the end of a product's life is put to another use.</p><p>While the economic and social benefits of recycling in general are clear, there is a subtle disadvantage in the context of CMs. Recycling reduces the amount of various widely used metals, such as nickel, copper, aluminum, and others, that need to be produced from mines, which in turn reduces the amount of CMs obtained as byproducts.</p><p>Price matters</p><p>Price-related risks may be reduced to some extent through a futures market (an auction of contracts to buy/sell a commodity at a fixed price on a specific future date) if one exists for the metal of interest. Futures markets exist for the more common metals, such as copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum, and rhodium. However, there are no futures markets for most of the other metals discussed here, which are typically purchased directly from a producer or from a broker that purchases and stores the metal for resale.</p><p>Given the high prices and the importance of CMs in markets that are growing, much work is underway to monetize the CMs present in streams of ores from mines, in their wastes such as acid mine drainage, and in flyash from coal combustion.</p><p>Demand for CMs is undoubtedly increasing. Since few new mines that secured their financing are under construction, CM production capacity is virtually static and will essentially remain so for the next five to ten years. Capacity relative to increasing demand is therefore falling. This will remain so for the immediate future, since the design, construction, and startup of a new mine and its ore-handling and waste-treatment systems is a multiyear effort requiring a multimillion-dollar investment, numerous government approvals, and a qualified production and support staff.</p><p>The prices of many metals are volatile and strongly depend on the particular metal of interest, its major uses, and its sources. Table 4 and Figure 2 show the recent price history of the eight CMs listed in Table 2 (20, 21). Contributing to their price changes:</p><p>* As automobile production has tilted away from diesel engines and toward engines that rely on gasoline and electricity, palladium prices have fluctuated while platinum prices have continuously fallen.</p><p>* Neodymium and praseodymium prices dropped in 2016 at the peak of illegal mining in China; as the illegal mining has decreased, prices have risen.</p><p>* Gallium prices also dropped in 2016 in tandem with a real estate crisis in China.</p><p>* Rhenium prices have been dropping since 2015. Rhenium is an important metal that is used for hotgas-path components in combustion turbines. Forecasts expect the demand for these units on a worldwide basis to increase because the major turbine users (aircraft and electric power plants) will soon need to add additional equipment to their fleets and plants.</p><p>* Cobalt prices have occasionally dropped, but have recently dramatically increased, and continue to do so, partly due to concerns about market concentration. Several automobile, battery, and fuel cell producers are now entering into long-term contracts with cobalt producers to assure the metal's availability at reasonable and predictable prices. However, recent news reports indicate that an overproduction of cobalt might significantly reduce prices in the near future (22).</p><p>If the transformation from gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles to electric vehicles continues, it is likely to impact the availabilities and prices of many of the CMs. Since the demand for catalytic converters for hydrocarbon-fueled vehicles will correspondingly decrease, the demand for rhodium, platinum, and palladium, the active components in their catalyst beds, will decrease and prices will tend to fall. More instrumentation might be needed in electric vehicles both for normal operation and for battery charging, the net effect of which is not yet clear.</p><p>Major disruptive changes, such as a drastic increase in the widespread use of electric vehicles, do not occur suddenly. Society and industry will need decades to adjust to their impacts. Producers of many types of 21 st-century products that rely on CMs will therefore face an extended period of uncertainty.</p><p>Market concentration risk</p><p>Attempts to profit by manipulating metal markets in the 1980s included efforts to monopolize the amount of silver available for sale by purchasing large quantities of the physical metal. Another company made a similar effort in the 1990s with respect to copper to manipulate the futures market by providing funds (in the form of futures) to a trader (23, 24). These were briefly successful, but ultimately had serious negative consequences to the instigators.</p><p>In both of these examples, the illegal activities were successful for many years before they were shut down. The various exchanges and government regulators have learned from their past mistakes and have improved their internal oversight procedures. Thus, a similar scheme based on manipulating the quantities of various CMs is not as easy today as it was a few decades ago.</p><p>Given these examples and their consequences, the cobalt market concentration could be at risk. Currently, a single company owns 3,000 m.t. of cobalt, making it the world's second-largest owner of the metal, with China's State Reserve Bureau owning 5,000 m.t. (25). This adds to the uncertainty that lies in the future supply of the cobalt.</p><p>Recomendations</p><p>Companies that depend on the availability of adequate quantities of rare earth elements and precious and specialty metals at reasonable and predictable prices are likely to face a challenging economic future that could last decades. To provide some protection against uncertainties, users of these metals would be wise to:</p><p>* secure access to an economically appropriate amount of the metal</p><p>* go beyond contractual production arrangements and create storage for the metal while it is easier to obtain</p><p>* identify substitute materials that can function as substitutes in a device, if necessary</p><p>* focus on alternative technologies that are independent of, or less reliant on, CMs for their performance</p><p>* develop a deep understanding of the production, supply chain, and market mechanics for each CM that they rely on.</p><p>Regardless of the processes used to recover CMs, overall plant operations are very energy-intensive and have high capital and operating costs - all of which contribute to the high prices of CMs.</p><p>HERBERT W.

Simultaneously, the use of catalysts has increased in chemical and fuel production to reduce pollutants and toxic emissions. Many of these advances could not have occurred without critical materials (CMs), i.e., rare earth elements (REEs), and precious and specialty metals. Although various gases and liquids are important, this article focuses on metals because of their overwhelming importance economically, societally, and in the defense sector. Similarly, while lithium is widely and increasingly used in batteries, it will likely remain sufficiently available in the foreseeable future at a practical cost and therefore is also not discussed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several countries are taking steps at the national level to increase production and develop more efficient extraction and purification processes for CMs. The U.S. federal government has prepared a preliminary list of materials identified as having strategic importance for the security and prosperity of the country (Table 1) (1). Table 2 lists eight CMs and provides examples of their use; the limited availability and high prices of many of these metals have concerned equipment suppliers.</p><p>The criticality of various materials depends on their economic importance, supply risks, and other environmental considerations. The European Union (EU), the U.S. Dept, of Energy (DOE), and private companies have evaluated these criteria for many materials. Their approaches and conclusions are publicly available and are discussed in a previous CEP article (2).</p><p>Initial sources of critical materials</p><p>Almost all CMs are available somewhere in the earth's crust or oceans, commonly as compounds such as chlorides, oxides, phosphates, or sulfides. A few are synthetic. Many sources are located in regions of political instability, or countries where corruption of high-level government officials is common, as well as in areas with poor infrastructure or poor environmental, health, and safety (EHS) practices. For example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the source of approximately two-thirds of the world's cobalt and copper, was publicly criticized for allowing unsafe working conditions and the use of child labor (3, 4). Many large companies have policies that prohibit transactions with entities that allow such practices, and encourage using only ethically sourced cobalt, straining the supply. Conversely, China, the source of most REEs, has now shut down much of the illegal mining and raised the EHS requirements for official mines. These positive steps toward human rights have, however, undoubtedly incurred costs that will be passed on to customers.</p><p>Many source countries tend to view their mineral resources as strategic assets. They sometimes limit exports for political reasons as a tactic in trade and tariff wars, or to benefit their domestic industries. China reduced exports for molybdenum and tungsten by 40% in 2010, citing environmental reasons (5). The U.S., EU, and Japan sued in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to overturn this practice, won, and after an unsuccessful appeal, China removed these caps in 2015 (6). Indonesia banned the export of nickel ores and bauxite in 2014 specifically to help its smelting industry. International nickel prices then increased by 50%, but the country's revenues from the export taxes were lost and its national budget was seriously harmed; the ban was removed in 2017 (7).</p><p>To remain competitive, many countries do not provide detailed information about production rates and inventories of their mineral resources. This introduces large uncertainties into the economic viability of opening a new mine or expanding the capacity of one already in existence.</p><p>Rare earth elements and other desired materials found in the earth's crust or oceans are present in higher volumes than the word \"rare\" implies. The practical problem is that their concentrations vary considerably from mine to mine and even from one location to another within a mine. Many of the REE concentrations are very low, in the range of parts per million (ppm) or even parts per billion (ppb) by weight. The threshold concentration for economically viable REE separation and purification by current technologies is approximately 0.03 wt% (300 ppm). Below this concentration, production of many REEs would likely entail prohibitively high costs.</p><p>To further complicate the supply of CMs, there are virtually no mines built and operated for the main purpose of producing CMs. CMs are almost entirely obtained as byproducts from mines that produce more abundant and widely used metals such as copper, lead, nickel, and zinc and, to a lesser extent, aluminum, and iron. The production rates of CMs are therefore closely tied to the demand for other metals.</p><p>Improving the supply chain</p><p>One approach to increasing the availability of CMs is to convert other elements to the desired ones within highenergy particle accelerators or to collect them from decay products of radioactive elements in nuclear reactors. These conversion methods are currently economically impractical, and are expected to remain so for many decades, so this article will not discuss them further.</p><p>Research and development is currently underway to develop additional sources and processes to make larger quantities of cobalt and other metals available worldwide. Fortune Minerals Ltd. has designed a plant to produce 2,000 tons of cobalt per year, along with gold and bismuth. Scheduled to begin commercial opperation in the Canadian Northwest in 2021, this project's success would significantly increase the availability of cobalt.</p><p>Large quantities of REEs, at relatively high concentrations, were discovered in 2013 and were recently characterized quantitatively (8). The source, located approximately 25 ft beneath the seabed, is about 18,000 ft below sea level, within the Japanese Exclusive Economic Zone around the western North Pacific island of Minami-Tori-shima (also known as Marcus Island). This has the potential to change the supply, availability, and price of REEs throughout the world. Given its depth and location, however, successful development will be very difficult.</p><p>Oil diid g\u00e5s\u00ab companies have extracted crude materials from subsea beds for many years, confirming the viability of ultra-deep-water ventures. For example, the multibillion-dollar Stones Field project in the Gulf of Mexico, which operates at a water depth of 9,576 ft, has been operating since 2016 and is producing approximately 50,000 bbl/day of oil (9).</p><p>As those projects demonstrate, the necessary facilities are complicated and costly and they involve substantial technical, environmental, and economic risks. Additional difficulties such as corrosion and erosion will also need to be addressed to recover REEs from the Minami-Tori-shima site, which will require collecting and raising a salty mud to the ocean surface. Numerous chemical engineering challenges must be overcome in the design of the process and equipment for the separation and purification operations, the selection of the materials of construction, and the development and design of the process instrumentation and control systems. National legal requirements and international treaties, as well as financial challenges, must be addressed for the extraction to become a reality (10).</p><p>An earlier project, Solwara 1, to recover copper, gold, silver, and zinc from a bed located 5,200 ft below sea level in the Bismarck Sea off Papua, New Guinea (PNG), experienced delays. Although the PNG government granted Nautilus Minerals an environmental permit in 2009 and a development license in 2012, the project encountered substantial public opposition due to concerns about marine life and a lack of transparency. While progress remains on hold, the developer, which has already invested over $11 million, is seeking additional project financing of $350 million for further development until production commences (11).</p><p>Although numerous companies in a variety of CM-using applications may ultimately benefit, it will be many years before significant amounts of CMs are available from deep subsea sources at commercially acceptable costs.</p><p>Byproduct sources of CMs</p><p>Several realistic projects are currently underway for CM extraction as a byproduct of more common materials. Alkane Resources Ltd. is now seeking final financing of $603 million to $970 million to increase the production of zirconium from an open-pit mine in New South Wales, Australia. Although focusing on zirconium, the plant will also produce 50 ton/yr of 99.8%-pure hafnium chloride and hafnium dioxide and/or 25 ton/yr of 99.9%-pure hafnium for use in semiconductors; the company's target production rate for these is 250 ton/yr of hafnium products. If the goals are met, the amount of hafnium currently available in the global marketplace will double. Other possible side products include niobium, tantalum, and yttrium.</p><p>CMs are also found in the U.S., but at very low concentrations that make their recovery uneconomical. The DOE, through its National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), is currently funding several projects to recover REEs from domestic U.S. coals and their byproducts. The projects aim to increase the yield, purity, and production rates of CMs, with a goal of 90% purity at a production rate of 10 lb of purified product. Table 3 presents interim results of pilot plant and bench-scale studies using a variety of coal wastes (12).</p><p>Recycling and CMs</p><p>The benefits of recycling are widely known, and the practice is encouraged by the UN and the EU, among others. Various countries have passed legislation governing disposal and recycling practices. Within the U.S., half of the states have enacted regulations focused on the recycling of electronic equipment. They define the items that are covered (and those that are specifically excluded), quantitative targets, the role of manufacturers, and requirements to use qualified disposal and recycling sites (13-15).</p><p>The extent to which common materials such as copper, nickel, and aluminum are recycled further complicates the supply of CMs. The practicality of recycling depends on the concentration of the desired material in the feed stream, its required purity in the product, and the amount and nature of the feed stream. Each recovered metal has unique physical and thermodynamic properties, which limit the types of recovery processes that can be used.</p><p>The required purity depends on the particular CM being considered and its intended use. The purities for semiconductor applications generally range from 90% to 99.9999%. Various unit operations, such as milling followed by flotation, purify the CM content of mining byproducts or recycled devices to the required levels. Thermal means (e.g., smelting), electrolysis (such as is used for aluminum production), or vapor deposition (such as is used to produce carbon nanotubes) are used to further purify the concentrated material. Other preliminary separation routes include leaching with sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide, followed by solvent extraction and then a final purification process. Other processes, including staged membrane-based designs, ion exchange leaching, reverse osmosis, and bio-oxidation, are also being investigated as ways to improve yields and/or reduce the costs of current separation/purification processes (16).</p><p>Relatively little consideration is currently given to specifying the composition of the major non-CM portions. End-use products, overall design, and packaging could all be altered to facilitate recycling possibilities.</p><p>An average cellphone weighs approximately 170 g and may contain approximately 34 mg of gold, 350 mg of silver, and 15 mg of palladium, as well as aluminum, copper, and even smaller amounts of valuable REEs (17). These desirable materials therefore represent only 0.23% (2,300 ppm) of the total weight. Their economic values, however, justify separating them from the device then from each other to obtain purified products.</p><p>Designing a suitable CM recovery facility requires data on melting points, densities, and viscosities, as well as phase equilibrium information such as the distribution of the desired products among the liquid, gas, and solid phases. Radar charts are a useful way to organize and visualize equilibrium phase data (Figure 1). If chemical reactions are involved in the CM extraction and purification, information about reaction rates as a function of feed composition, pressure, and temperature are required. The design of recovery and purification equipment, such as tanks, piping, pumps, instrumentation, sensors, insulation, and other plant components, also requires an understanding of the materials' corrosivity and toxicity.</p><p>Several processes for recovering CMs, whether from ores, mine wastes, or recycled materials, use hydrogen fluoride, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, ammonia, organic solvents, or ion exchange resins. These, or their reaction products, may be hazardous to humans, animals, marine species, and vegetation. The concentrations of plant emissions must therefore be reduced to acceptable levels and properly monitored. Many of the mines containing REEs also contain noticeable amounts of uranium and thorium. Handling and disposing of these radioactive materials adds additional complexities and costs to plant design and operation.</p><p>Regardless of the processes used to recover CMs, overall plant operations are very energy intensive and have high capital and operating costs - all of which contribute to the high prices of CMs.</p><p>Successfully designing, installing, and operating a CM production facility is a formidable chemical engineering challenge likely to yield dramatic benefits. A 2014 study reported that 41.8 million m.t. of used electrical and electronic equipment were discarded that year, and the amount was expected to increase to 50 million m.t. by 2018 (19). Of this, approximately 5% is copper, gold, palladium, and silver, with an overall market value of about $32 billion for just these four metals. The presence of other CMs will substantially increase this value. The current private sector, government, and academic efforts to recover and reuse CMs are certainly justifiable from economic, societal, and defense viewpoints.</p><p>Many companies around the world are capable of recycling and purifying electronic waste. A few, however, account for most of the electric vehicle battery recovery market, which involves the recycling of not just precious metals and copper, but also of REEs and other CMs. One company relies on flotation for separation and concentration. Another, a precious-metals refining operation, employs an ultra-high-temperature technology that combines pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical methods; it is now increasing its capacity from 350,000 ton/yr to 500,000 ton/yr of electrical waste. Another company has announced plans for a plant that will include recycling of streams from sources other than its own mine; the facility, however, is not yet under construction.</p><p>There are sound technical, societal, and economic reasons to recycle materials, including:</p><p>* upgrading a material to its initial composition requires less energy than refining raw ores</p><p>* less pollution is discharged to the environment</p><p>* material that would otherwise be disposed of in a landfill at the end of a product's life is put to another use.</p><p>While the economic and social benefits of recycling in general are clear, there is a subtle disadvantage in the context of CMs. Recycling reduces the amount of various widely used metals, such as nickel, copper, aluminum, and others, that need to be produced from mines, which in turn reduces the amount of CMs obtained as byproducts.</p><p>Price matters</p><p>Price-related risks may be reduced to some extent through a futures market (an auction of contracts to buy/sell a commodity at a fixed price on a specific future date) if one exists for the metal of interest. Futures markets exist for the more common metals, such as copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum, and rhodium. However, there are no futures markets for most of the other metals discussed here, which are typically purchased directly from a producer or from a broker that purchases and stores the metal for resale.</p><p>Given the high prices and the importance of CMs in markets that are growing, much work is underway to monetize the CMs present in streams of ores from mines, in their wastes such as acid mine drainage, and in flyash from coal combustion.</p><p>Demand for CMs is undoubtedly increasing. Since few new mines that secured their financing are under construction, CM production capacity is virtually static and will essentially remain so for the next five to ten years. Capacity relative to increasing demand is therefore falling. This will remain so for the immediate future, since the design, construction, and startup of a new mine and its ore-handling and waste-treatment systems is a multiyear effort requiring a multimillion-dollar investment, numerous government approvals, and a qualified production and support staff.</p><p>The prices of many metals are volatile and strongly depend on the particular metal of interest, its major uses, and its sources. Table 4 and Figure 2 show the recent price history of the eight CMs listed in Table 2 (20, 21). Contributing to their price changes:</p><p>* As automobile production has tilted away from diesel engines and toward engines that rely on gasoline and electricity, palladium prices have fluctuated while platinum prices have continuously fallen.</p><p>* Neodymium and praseodymium prices dropped in 2016 at the peak of illegal mining in China; as the illegal mining has decreased, prices have risen.</p><p>* Gallium prices also dropped in 2016 in tandem with a real estate crisis in China.</p><p>* Rhenium prices have been dropping since 2015. Rhenium is an important metal that is used for hotgas-path components in combustion turbines. Forecasts expect the demand for these units on a worldwide basis to increase because the major turbine users (aircraft and electric power plants) will soon need to add additional equipment to their fleets and plants.</p><p>* Cobalt prices have occasionally dropped, but have recently dramatically increased, and continue to do so, partly due to concerns about market concentration. Several automobile, battery, and fuel cell producers are now entering into long-term contracts with cobalt producers to assure the metal's availability at reasonable and predictable prices. However, recent news reports indicate that an overproduction of cobalt might significantly reduce prices in the near future (22).</p><p>If the transformation from gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles to electric vehicles continues, it is likely to impact the availabilities and prices of many of the CMs. Since the demand for catalytic converters for hydrocarbon-fueled vehicles will correspondingly decrease, the demand for rhodium, platinum, and palladium, the active components in their catalyst beds, will decrease and prices will tend to fall. More instrumentation might be needed in electric vehicles both for normal operation and for battery charging, the net effect of which is not yet clear.</p><p>Major disruptive changes, such as a drastic increase in the widespread use of electric vehicles, do not occur suddenly. Society and industry will need decades to adjust to their impacts. Producers of many types of 21 st-century products that rely on CMs will therefore face an extended period of uncertainty.</p><p>Market concentration risk</p><p>Attempts to profit by manipulating metal markets in the 1980s included efforts to monopolize the amount of silver available for sale by purchasing large quantities of the physical metal. Another company made a similar effort in the 1990s with respect to copper to manipulate the futures market by providing funds (in the form of futures) to a trader (23, 24). These were briefly successful, but ultimately had serious negative consequences to the instigators.</p><p>In both of these examples, the illegal activities were successful for many years before they were shut down. The various exchanges and government regulators have learned from their past mistakes and have improved their internal oversight procedures. Thus, a similar scheme based on manipulating the quantities of various CMs is not as easy today as it was a few decades ago.</p><p>Given these examples and their consequences, the cobalt market concentration could be at risk. Currently, a single company owns 3,000 m.t. of cobalt, making it the world's second-largest owner of the metal, with China's State Reserve Bureau owning 5,000 m.t. (25). This adds to the uncertainty that lies in the future supply of the cobalt.</p><p>Recomendations</p><p>Companies that depend on the availability of adequate quantities of rare earth elements and precious and specialty metals at reasonable and predictable prices are likely to face a challenging economic future that could last decades. To provide some protection against uncertainties, users of these metals would be wise to:</p><p>* secure access to an economically appropriate amount of the metal</p><p>* go beyond contractual production arrangements and create storage for the metal while it is easier to obtain</p><p>* identify substitute materials that can function as substitutes in a device, if necessary</p><p>* focus on alternative technologies that are independent of, or less reliant on, CMs for their performance</p><p>* develop a deep understanding of the production, supply chain, and market mechanics for each CM that they rely on.</p><p>Regardless of the processes used to recover CMs, overall plant operations are very energy-intensive and have high capital and operating costs - all of which contribute to the high prices of CMs.</p><p>HERBERT W.

Simultaneously, the use of catalysts has increased in chemical and fuel production to reduce pollutants and toxic emissions. Many of these advances could not have occurred without critical materials (CMs), i.e., rare earth elements (REEs), and precious and specialty metals. Although various gases and liquids are important, this article focuses on metals because of their overwhelming importance economically, societally, and in the defense sector. Similarly, while lithium is widely and increasingly used in batteries, it will likely remain sufficiently available in the foreseeable future at a practical cost and therefore is also not discussed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several countries are taking steps at the national level to increase production and develop more efficient extraction and purification processes for CMs. The U.S. federal government has prepared a preliminary list of materials identified as having strategic importance for the security and prosperity of the country (Table 1) (1). Table 2 lists eight CMs and provides examples of their use; the limited availability and high prices of many of these metals have concerned equipment suppliers.</p><p>The criticality of various materials depends on their economic importance, supply risks, and other environmental considerations. The European Union (EU), the U.S. Dept, of Energy (DOE), and private companies have evaluated these criteria for many materials. Their approaches and conclusions are publicly available and are discussed in a previous CEP article (2).</p><p>Initial sources of critical materials</p><p>Almost all CMs are available somewhere in the earth's crust or oceans, commonly as compounds such as chlorides, oxides, phosphates, or sulfides. A few are synthetic. Many sources are located in regions of political instability, or countries where corruption of high-level government officials is common, as well as in areas with poor infrastructure or poor environmental, health, and safety (EHS) practices. For example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the source of approximately two-thirds of the world's cobalt and copper, was publicly criticized for allowing unsafe working conditions and the use of child labor (3, 4). Many large companies have policies that prohibit transactions with entities that allow such practices, and encourage using only ethically sourced cobalt, straining the supply. Conversely, China, the source of most REEs, has now shut down much of the illegal mining and raised the EHS requirements for official mines. These positive steps toward human rights have, however, undoubtedly incurred costs that will be passed on to customers.</p><p>Many source countries tend to view their mineral resources as strategic assets. They sometimes limit exports for political reasons as a tactic in trade and tariff wars, or to benefit their domestic industries. China reduced exports for molybdenum and tungsten by 40% in 2010, citing environmental reasons (5). The U.S., EU, and Japan sued in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to overturn this practice, won, and after an unsuccessful appeal, China removed these caps in 2015 (6). Indonesia banned the export of nickel ores and bauxite in 2014 specifically to help its smelting industry. International nickel prices then increased by 50%, but the country's revenues from the export taxes were lost and its national budget was seriously harmed; the ban was removed in 2017 (7).</p><p>To remain competitive, many countries do not provide detailed information about production rates and inventories of their mineral resources. This introduces large uncertainties into the economic viability of opening a new mine or expanding the capacity of one already in existence.</p><p>Rare earth elements and other desired materials found in the earth's crust or oceans are present in higher volumes than the word \"rare\" implies. The practical problem is that their concentrations vary considerably from mine to mine and even from one location to another within a mine. Many of the REE concentrations are very low, in the range of parts per million (ppm) or even parts per billion (ppb) by weight. The threshold concentration for economically viable REE separation and purification by current technologies is approximately 0.03 wt% (300 ppm). Below this concentration, production of many REEs would likely entail prohibitively high costs.</p><p>To further complicate the supply of CMs, there are virtually no mines built and operated for the main purpose of producing CMs. CMs are almost entirely obtained as byproducts from mines that produce more abundant and widely used metals such as copper, lead, nickel, and zinc and, to a lesser extent, aluminum, and iron. The production rates of CMs are therefore closely tied to the demand for other metals.</p><p>Improving the supply chain</p><p>One approach to increasing the availability of CMs is to convert other elements to the desired ones within highenergy particle accelerators or to collect them from decay products of radioactive elements in nuclear reactors. These conversion methods are currently economically impractical, and are expected to remain so for many decades, so this article will not discuss them further.</p><p>Research and development is currently underway to develop additional sources and processes to make larger quantities of cobalt and other metals available worldwide. Fortune Minerals Ltd. has designed a plant to produce 2,000 tons of cobalt per year, along with gold and bismuth. Scheduled to begin commercial opperation in the Canadian Northwest in 2021, this project's success would significantly increase the availability of cobalt.</p><p>Large quantities of REEs, at relatively high concentrations, were discovered in 2013 and were recently characterized quantitatively (8). The source, located approximately 25 ft beneath the seabed, is about 18,000 ft below sea level, within the Japanese Exclusive Economic Zone around the western North Pacific island of Minami-Tori-shima (also known as Marcus Island). This has the potential to change the supply, availability, and price of REEs throughout the world. Given its depth and location, however, successful development will be very difficult.</p><p>Oil diid g\u00e5s\u00ab companies have extracted crude materials from subsea beds for many years, confirming the viability of ultra-deep-water ventures. For example, the multibillion-dollar Stones Field project in the Gulf of Mexico, which operates at a water depth of 9,576 ft, has been operating since 2016 and is producing approximately 50,000 bbl/day of oil (9).</p><p>As those projects demonstrate, the necessary facilities are complicated and costly and they involve substantial technical, environmental, and economic risks. Additional difficulties such as corrosion and erosion will also need to be addressed to recover REEs from the Minami-Tori-shima site, which will require collecting and raising a salty mud to the ocean surface. Numerous chemical engineering challenges must be overcome in the design of the process and equipment for the separation and purification operations, the selection of the materials of construction, and the development and design of the process instrumentation and control systems. National legal requirements and international treaties, as well as financial challenges, must be addressed for the extraction to become a reality (10).</p><p>An earlier project, Solwara 1, to recover copper, gold, silver, and zinc from a bed located 5,200 ft below sea level in the Bismarck Sea off Papua, New Guinea (PNG), experienced delays. Although the PNG government granted Nautilus Minerals an environmental permit in 2009 and a development license in 2012, the project encountered substantial public opposition due to concerns about marine life and a lack of transparency. While progress remains on hold, the developer, which has already invested over $11 million, is seeking additional project financing of $350 million for further development until production commences (11).</p><p>Although numerous companies in a variety of CM-using applications may ultimately benefit, it will be many years before significant amounts of CMs are available from deep subsea sources at commercially acceptable costs.</p><p>Byproduct sources of CMs</p><p>Several realistic projects are currently underway for CM extraction as a byproduct of more common materials. Alkane Resources Ltd. is now seeking final financing of $603 million to $970 million to increase the production of zirconium from an open-pit mine in New South Wales, Australia. Although focusing on zirconium, the plant will also produce 50 ton/yr of 99.8%-pure hafnium chloride and hafnium dioxide and/or 25 ton/yr of 99.9%-pure hafnium for use in semiconductors; the company's target production rate for these is 250 ton/yr of hafnium products. If the goals are met, the amount of hafnium currently available in the global marketplace will double. Other possible side products include niobium, tantalum, and yttrium.</p><p>CMs are also found in the U.S., but at very low concentrations that make their recovery uneconomical. The DOE, through its National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), is currently funding several projects to recover REEs from domestic U.S. coals and their byproducts. The projects aim to increase the yield, purity, and production rates of CMs, with a goal of 90% purity at a production rate of 10 lb of purified product. Table 3 presents interim results of pilot plant and bench-scale studies using a variety of coal wastes (12).</p><p>Recycling and CMs</p><p>The benefits of recycling are widely known, and the practice is encouraged by the UN and the EU, among others. Various countries have passed legislation governing disposal and recycling practices. Within the U.S., half of the states have enacted regulations focused on the recycling of electronic equipment. They define the items that are covered (and those that are specifically excluded), quantitative targets, the role of manufacturers, and requirements to use qualified disposal and recycling sites (13-15).</p><p>The extent to which common materials such as copper, nickel, and aluminum are recycled further complicates the supply of CMs. The practicality of recycling depends on the concentration of the desired material in the feed stream, its required purity in the product, and the amount and nature of the feed stream. Each recovered metal has unique physical and thermodynamic properties, which limit the types of recovery processes that can be used.</p><p>The required purity depends on the particular CM being considered and its intended use. The purities for semiconductor applications generally range from 90% to 99.9999%. Various unit operations, such as milling followed by flotation, purify the CM content of mining byproducts or recycled devices to the required levels. Thermal means (e.g., smelting), electrolysis (such as is used for aluminum production), or vapor deposition (such as is used to produce carbon nanotubes) are used to further purify the concentrated material. Other preliminary separation routes include leaching with sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide, followed by solvent extraction and then a final purification process. Other processes, including staged membrane-based designs, ion exchange leaching, reverse osmosis, and bio-oxidation, are also being investigated as ways to improve yields and/or reduce the costs of current separation/purification processes (16).</p><p>Relatively little consideration is currently given to specifying the composition of the major non-CM portions. End-use products, overall design, and packaging could all be altered to facilitate recycling possibilities.</p><p>An average cellphone weighs approximately 170 g and may contain approximately 34 mg of gold, 350 mg of silver, and 15 mg of palladium, as well as aluminum, copper, and even smaller amounts of valuable REEs (17). These desirable materials therefore represent only 0.23% (2,300 ppm) of the total weight. Their economic values, however, justify separating them from the device then from each other to obtain purified products.</p><p>Designing a suitable CM recovery facility requires data on melting points, densities, and viscosities, as well as phase equilibrium information such as the distribution of the desired products among the liquid, gas, and solid phases. Radar charts are a useful way to organize and visualize equilibrium phase data (Figure 1). If chemical reactions are involved in the CM extraction and purification, information about reaction rates as a function of feed composition, pressure, and temperature are required. The design of recovery and purification equipment, such as tanks, piping, pumps, instrumentation, sensors, insulation, and other plant components, also requires an understanding of the materials' corrosivity and toxicity.</p><p>Several processes for recovering CMs, whether from ores, mine wastes, or recycled materials, use hydrogen fluoride, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, ammonia, organic solvents, or ion exchange resins. These, or their reaction products, may be hazardous to humans, animals, marine species, and vegetation. The concentrations of plant emissions must therefore be reduced to acceptable levels and properly monitored. Many of the mines containing REEs also contain noticeable amounts of uranium and thorium. Handling and disposing of these radioactive materials adds additional complexities and costs to plant design and operation.</p><p>Regardless of the processes used to recover CMs, overall plant operations are very energy intensive and have high capital and operating costs - all of which contribute to the high prices of CMs.</p><p>Successfully designing, installing, and operating a CM production facility is a formidable chemical engineering challenge likely to yield dramatic benefits. A 2014 study reported that 41.8 million m.t. of used electrical and electronic equipment were discarded that year, and the amount was expected to increase to 50 million m.t. by 2018 (19). Of this, approximately 5% is copper, gold, palladium, and silver, with an overall market value of about $32 billion for just these four metals. The presence of other CMs will substantially increase this value. The current private sector, government, and academic efforts to recover and reuse CMs are certainly justifiable from economic, societal, and defense viewpoints.</p><p>Many companies around the world are capable of recycling and purifying electronic waste. A few, however, account for most of the electric vehicle battery recovery market, which involves the recycling of not just precious metals and copper, but also of REEs and other CMs. One company relies on flotation for separation and concentration. Another, a precious-metals refining operation, employs an ultra-high-temperature technology that combines pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical methods; it is now increasing its capacity from 350,000 ton/yr to 500,000 ton/yr of electrical waste. Another company has announced plans for a plant that will include recycling of streams from sources other than its own mine; the facility, however, is not yet under construction.</p><p>There are sound technical, societal, and economic reasons to recycle materials, including:</p><p>* upgrading a material to its initial composition requires less energy than refining raw ores</p><p>* less pollution is discharged to the environment</p><p>* material that would otherwise be disposed of in a landfill at the end of a product's life is put to another use.</p><p>While the economic and social benefits of recycling in general are clear, there is a subtle disadvantage in the context of CMs. Recycling reduces the amount of various widely used metals, such as nickel, copper, aluminum, and others, that need to be produced from mines, which in turn reduces the amount of CMs obtained as byproducts.</p><p>Price matters</p><p>Price-related risks may be reduced to some extent through a futures market (an auction of contracts to buy/sell a commodity at a fixed price on a specific future date) if one exists for the metal of interest. Futures markets exist for the more common metals, such as copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum, and rhodium. However, there are no futures markets for most of the other metals discussed here, which are typically purchased directly from a producer or from a broker that purchases and stores the metal for resale.</p><p>Given the high prices and the importance of CMs in markets that are growing, much work is underway to monetize the CMs present in streams of ores from mines, in their wastes such as acid mine drainage, and in flyash from coal combustion.</p><p>Demand for CMs is undoubtedly increasing. Since few new mines that secured their financing are under construction, CM production capacity is virtually static and will essentially remain so for the next five to ten years. Capacity relative to increasing demand is therefore falling. This will remain so for the immediate future, since the design, construction, and startup of a new mine and its ore-handling and waste-treatment systems is a multiyear effort requiring a multimillion-dollar investment, numerous government approvals, and a qualified production and support staff.</p><p>The prices of many metals are volatile and strongly depend on the particular metal of interest, its major uses, and its sources. Table 4 and Figure 2 show the recent price history of the eight CMs listed in Table 2 (20, 21). Contributing to their price changes:</p><p>* As automobile production has tilted away from diesel engines and toward engines that rely on gasoline and electricity, palladium prices have fluctuated while platinum prices have continuously fallen.</p><p>* Neodymium and praseodymium prices dropped in 2016 at the peak of illegal mining in China; as the illegal mining has decreased, prices have risen.</p><p>* Gallium prices also dropped in 2016 in tandem with a real estate crisis in China.</p><p>* Rhenium prices have been dropping since 2015. Rhenium is an important metal that is used for hotgas-path components in combustion turbines. Forecasts expect the demand for these units on a worldwide basis to increase because the major turbine users (aircraft and electric power plants) will soon need to add additional equipment to their fleets and plants.</p><p>* Cobalt prices have occasionally dropped, but have recently dramatically increased, and continue to do so, partly due to concerns about market concentration. Several automobile, battery, and fuel cell producers are now entering into long-term contracts with cobalt producers to assure the metal's availability at reasonable and predictable prices. However, recent news reports indicate that an overproduction of cobalt might significantly reduce prices in the near future (22).</p><p>If the transformation from gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles to electric vehicles continues, it is likely to impact the availabilities and prices of many of the CMs. Since the demand for catalytic converters for hydrocarbon-fueled vehicles will correspondingly decrease, the demand for rhodium, platinum, and palladium, the active components in their catalyst beds, will decrease and prices will tend to fall. More instrumentation might be needed in electric vehicles both for normal operation and for battery charging, the net effect of which is not yet clear.</p><p>Major disruptive changes, such as a drastic increase in the widespread use of electric vehicles, do not occur suddenly. Society and industry will need decades to adjust to their impacts. Producers of many types of 21 st-century products that rely on CMs will therefore face an extended period of uncertainty.</p><p>Market concentration risk</p><p>Attempts to profit by manipulating metal markets in the 1980s included efforts to monopolize the amount of silver available for sale by purchasing large quantities of the physical metal. Another company made a similar effort in the 1990s with respect to copper to manipulate the futures market by providing funds (in the form of futures) to a trader (23, 24). These were briefly successful, but ultimately had serious negative consequences to the instigators.</p><p>In both of these examples, the illegal activities were successful for many years before they were shut down. The various exchanges and government regulators have learned from their past mistakes and have improved their internal oversight procedures. Thus, a similar scheme based on manipulating the quantities of various CMs is not as easy today as it was a few decades ago.</p><p>Given these examples and their consequences, the cobalt market concentration could be at risk. Currently, a single company owns 3,000 m.t. of cobalt, making it the world's second-largest owner of the metal, with China's State Reserve Bureau owning 5,000 m.t. (25). This adds to the uncertainty that lies in the future supply of the cobalt.</p><p>Recomendations</p><p>Companies that depend on the availability of adequate quantities of rare earth elements and precious and specialty metals at reasonable and predictable prices are likely to face a challenging economic future that could last decades. To provide some protection against uncertainties, users of these metals would be wise to:</p><p>* secure access to an economically appropriate amount of the metal</p><p>* go beyond contractual production arrangements and create storage for the metal while it is easier to obtain</p><p>* identify substitute materials that can function as substitutes in a device, if necessary</p><p>* focus on alternative technologies that are independent of, or less reliant on, CMs for their performance</p><p>* develop a deep understanding of the production, supply chain, and market mechanics for each CM that they rely on.</p><p>Regardless of the processes used to recover CMs, overall plant operations are very energy-intensive and have high capital and operating costs - all of which contribute to the high prices of CMs.</p><p>HERBERT W.

The company's products include HUMIRA, a biologic therapy administered as a subcutaneous injection to treat autoimmune diseases; VIEKIRA PAK, an all-oral, short-course, interferon-free therapy, with or without ribavirin, for adult patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis, including those with compensated cirrhosis.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jefferies said: </emphasis>[Analyst Jeff Holford] has increased confidence in a delay in Humira biosimilars following his work on the patent estate and recent management commentary.

Further, he estimates that Humira operating margins are currently around 59% but can be improved in the face of biosimilars, owing to the drop-off in royalty stack and lower SG&amp;A costs, forming a long run rate of 77% even after allowing for increased rebates.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TheStreet Rating: Hold, C  </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TheStreet said: </emphasis>\"We rate ABBVIE INC (ABBV) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, notable return on equity and good cash flow from operations. However, as a counter to these strengths, we find that the company has favored debt over equity in the management of its balance sheet.\"</p><p>Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:</p><p><br/><br/>ABBV's revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 1.9%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 10.4%. This growth in revenue appears to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, improving the earnings per share. <br/>The company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Pharmaceuticals industry and the overall market, ABBVIE INC's return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&amp;P 500. <br/>The stock has not only risen over the past year, it has done so at a faster pace than the S&amp;P 500, reflecting the earnings growth and other positive factors similar to those we have cited here. We feel that the combination of its price rise over the last year and its current price-to-earnings ratio relative to its industry tend to reduce its upside potential. <br/>The company, on the basis of net income growth from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed compared to the Pharmaceuticals industry average, but is greater than that of the S&amp;P 500. The net income increased by 4.3% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, going from $980.00 million to $1,022.00 million. <br/>The debt-to-equity ratio is very high at 11.09 and currently higher than the industry average, implying increased risk associated with the management of debt levels within the company. Even though the debt-to-equity ratio is weak, ABBV's quick ratio is somewhat strong at 1.11, demonstrating the ability to handle short-term liquidity needs. <br/><br/><br/>You can view the full analysis from the report here: <url normalizedValue=\"http://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=023499&amp;ticker=ABBV\">ABBV Ratings Report</url><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Must Read:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/13179808/1/7-big-tech-companies-that-are-better-buys-than-apple.html\">7 Big Tech Companies That Are Better Buys Than Apple</url><br/><br/></p><p><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/ATVI\">ATVI</url> data by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ycharts.com\">YCharts</url><br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2.Activision Blizzard Inc.

This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, increase in net income and attractive valuation levels. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results.\"</p><p>Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:</p><p><br/><br/>The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 5.0%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 15.0%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. <br/>Looking at where the stock is today compared to one year ago, we find that it is not only higher, but it has also clearly outperformed the rise in the S&amp;P 500 over the same period. Although other factors naturally played a role, the company's strong earnings growth was key. Turning our attention to the future direction of the stock, it goes without saying that even the best stocks can fall in an overall down market. However, in any other environment, this stock still has good upside potential despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year. <br/>ACTIVISION BLIZZARD INC has improved earnings per share by 32.5% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, ACTIVISION BLIZZARD INC increased its bottom line by earning $1.14 versus $0.95 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.24 versus $1.14). <br/>The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&amp;P 500 and the Software industry.

Sundeep also believes AMAT will benefit from larger, higher-res, and flexible screens, DRAM and NAND end markets are likely to be more stable customers going forward, and foundry competition is intensifying with Samsung disrupting TSMC.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TheStreet Rating: Buy, B+  </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TheStreet said: </emphasis>\"We rate APPLIED MATERIALS INC (AMAT) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income and reasonable valuation levels. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow.\"</p><p>Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:</p><p><br/><br/>AMAT's revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 0.6%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 3.8%. This growth in revenue appears to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, improving the earnings per share. <br/>AMAT's debt-to-equity ratio is very low at 0.23 and is currently below that of the industry average, implying that there has been very successful management of debt levels. To add to this, AMAT has a quick ratio of 1.87, which demonstrates the ability of the company to cover short-term liquidity needs. <br/>APPLIED MATERIALS INC has improved earnings per share by 38.1% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue.

We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat disappointing return on equity.\"</p><p>Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:</p><p><br/><br/>T's revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 2.2%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 0.3%. This growth in revenue does not appear to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, displayed by a decline in earnings per share. <br/>The gross profit margin for AT&amp;T INC is rather high; currently it is at 55.24%. Regardless of T's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 9.82% trails the industry average. <br/>AT&amp;T INC's earnings per share declined by 12.9% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has suffered a declining pattern of earnings per share over the past two years. However, we anticipate this trend to reverse over the coming year. During the past fiscal year, AT&amp;T INC reported lower earnings of $1.19 versus $3.41 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($2.53 versus $1.19). <br/>The change in net income from the same quarter one year ago has exceeded that of the S&amp;P 500, but is less than that of the Diversified Telecommunication Services industry average. The net income has decreased by 12.4% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, dropping from $3,652.00 million to $3,200.00 million. <br/>Even though the current debt-to-equity ratio is 1.12, it is still below the industry average, suggesting that this level of debt is acceptable within the Diversified Telecommunication Services industry. Even though the debt-to-equity ratio shows mixed results, the company's quick ratio of 0.48 is very low and demonstrates very weak liquidity. <br/><br/><br/>You can view the full analysis from the report here: <url normalizedValue=\"http://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=023499&amp;ticker=T\">T Ratings Report</url><br/><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/BA\">BA</url> data by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ycharts.com\">YCharts</url><br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.

Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 8.2%.

Looking ahead, unless broad bear market conditions prevail, we still see more upside potential for this stock, despite the fact that it has already risen over the past year. <br/>BOEING CO has improved earnings per share by 46.1% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue.

During the past fiscal year, CBS CORP reported lower earnings of $2.39 versus $2.79 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($3.56 versus $2.39). <br/>CBS, with its decline in revenue, slightly underperformed the industry average of 3.8%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 2.0%. The declining revenue has not hurt the company's bottom line, with increasing earnings per share. <br/>Even though the current debt-to-equity ratio is 1.21, it is still below the industry average, suggesting that this level of debt is acceptable within the Media industry. Regardless of the somewhat mixed results with the debt-to-equity ratio, the company's quick ratio of 1.17 is sturdy. <br/>The company's current return on equity has slightly decreased from the same quarter one year prior. This implies a minor weakness in the organization.

To some that means thrills - from Black Friday hunting to Cyber Monday browsing. To others, it means dread. So many wish lists are full of high-tech gadgets, and there often seems to be no discernible way to tell good tech gifts from the bad ones. Do you go by brand name? Price? Advertising?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kiplinger prefers to focus on approach of value. And no product is a considered a \"value\" on cost alone - we take into account factors that may be less obvious, including performance, features, quality, upgradability, durability and warranty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To help you with your biggest shopping list of the year, we've put together a comprehensive list of 22 of the best tech gifts for the 2018 holiday season, covering the most popular categories. Included are many options I've had hands-on experience with in my time reviewing consumer electronics for outlets including Forbes, Wired, GeekDad, About.com and others. These products start at just $50 and top out at $2,800, but they all have a common thread: They're high-tech gifts that represent a great value to both the giver and the lucky recipient.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/spending/t050-s001-best-things-to-buy-on-black-friday-2018/index.html\">Best Things to Buy on Black Friday 2018</url></p><p>Best Value in Smart Speakers</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://rivaaudio.com/riva-concert/\">RIVA Concert</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $199.00</p><p>The problem with smart speakers is there's little middle ground for people who want to use them to actually listen to music.</p><p>Most basic smart speakers sound pretty underwhelming. To get high-quality audio, you have to shell out $349 for an Apple HomePod or $399 for a Google Home Max. However, these are meant to be left in place, making them poor choices if you want a smart speaker you can take out on the deck.</p><p>RIVA may not be in all the big-box stores, but I've tested multiple generations of wireless speakers from the company since 2015. They always punch above their weight.</p><p>The $199 <url normalizedValue=\"https://rivaaudio.com/riva-concert/\">RIVA Concert</url> has integrated Alexa with voice control, making it a bona fide smart speaker. It offers impressive audio performance, with three ADX drivers, three passive radiators and a 50W amp. Unlike Sonos speakers (which are also pricier), the RIVA Concert supports virtually any wireless protocol including Wi-Fi, Apple AirPlay and Bluetooth. It's also splash-resistant for outdoors use and has an optional battery pack that lets it go outlet-free for up to 15 hours.</p><p>The clincher is a class-leading three-year warranty.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/spending/t050-s001-how-black-friday-retailers-trick-you/index.html\">10 Ways Black Friday Retailers Trick You</url></p><p>Best Value in Portable Wireless Speakers</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ultimateears.com/en-us/wireless-speakers/megaboom-3.html\">Ultimate Ears Megaboom 3</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $199.99</p><p>Ultimate Ears has become my favorite brand for portable wireless speakers. The company has a wide range of offerings, ranging from $99 to $250, and they all sound impossibly good for speakers of their size and price. Out of the current lineup, my favorite is the $199.99 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ultimateears.com/en-us/wireless-speakers/megaboom-3.html\">Megaboom 3</url>, a portable Bluetooth speaker that represents a great value.</p><p>The Megaboom 3 follows Ultimate Ears' iconic cylindrical design, with 360-degree sound. At just over two pounds, this one is big enough to pack a pair of full-range drivers and two passive radiators that produce audio that's energetic, with surprising bass and plenty of volume. There's also space for a battery big enough to provide 20 hours of music. And with the Boom app, you can connect up to 150 of these things together to really drive the neighbors crazy.</p><p>The Megaboom 3 is covered in tough cloth that's available in multiple colors, it's waterproof (IP67 - can be dropped into a meter of water for half an hour), it floats and it's rugged enough to take just about anything you can throw at it. I test Ultimate Ears speakers by throwing them in our dog's pool and I've yet to have one fail. The hardware is backed by a two year limited warranty.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/spending/t050-s001-best-costco-kirkland-products-for-the-holidays/index.html\">14 Best Costco Kirkland Products for the Holidays</url></p><p>Best Value in Wireless Speakers for the Home</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.libratone.com/us/products/speakers/zipp/\">Libratone ZIPP</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $299</p><p>The $299 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.libratone.com/us/products/speakers/zipp/\">Libratone ZIPP</url> made this list last year as well, but this time around I've moved it to a different category. While it does have an integrated battery for portability, I think it deserves the nod as a home wireless speaker: something that sits on a bookshelf, the kitchen counter or a coffee table.</p><p>ZIPP supports both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, so virtually any audio source can connect wirelessly. There's also a 3.5mm AUX input for older music sources that require a physical connection (I have one hooked up to a turntable). You can pair two speakers for two-channel stereo sound or link up to six in a multi-room audio setup. However, with 360-degree FullRoom audio, even a single ZIPP sounds pretty good. That cylinder is concealing a pair of neodymium tweeters, two radiators and a 4-inch woofer, all powered by a 100W Class D amplifier.</p><p>Adding to its home appeal, the Libratone ZIPP features a minimalist Scandinavian design. Its cloth covers are removable and can be purchased in a variety of colors to suit a home's decor, so it looks as good as it sounds. And yes, with a 10-hour battery, you can also bring the ZIPP out on the deck for an evening of music outdoors. This speaker makes a great gift for someone who enjoys listening to music and appreciates good design.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/retirement/t006-s001-all-50-states-ranked-for-retirement-2018/index.html\">Best States to Retire 2018: All 50 States Ranked for Retirement</url></p><p>Best Value in Wireless Speakers for Audiophiles</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.comoaudio.com/products/musica-1\">Como Audio Musica</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $599</p><p>I recently had several evaluation units arrive from Boston's Como Audio. And that company's Musica immediately became my pick this year for the best value in wireless audio speaker for audiophiles.</p><p>Just looking at the Musica, you know there's something different about this audio system. It's a multi-room streaming speaker with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support. Specs include a pair of soft dome tweeters and dual 3-inch long throw, 4-layer voice coil woofers with tuned bass ports, and a Class D amp delivering 30W per channel. It sounds pretty sweet.</p><p>Unlike most streaming speaker systems - which lean toward plastic and cloth - this one is finished in furniture-grade real wood veneer (my review unit is walnut). That covers 1/2-inch medium-density fiberboard (MDF) that reduces vibration and improves acoustics. There is a high-tech 3.2-inch color LCD screen on the front that displays cover album art and it has a wide range of streaming music services onboard, including Amazon Prime Music, Tidal and Internet radio. Contrasting with this latest technology are retro touches like metal control knobs, FM radio (with an antenna) and even a slot-load CD player.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.comoaudio.com/products/musica-1\">Como Audio Musica</url> looks fantastic, offers high-quality music playback and unbeatable flexibility, and seems like a bargain at $599.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/spending/t062-s003-people-you-should-tip-at-the-holidays/index.html\">16 People You Should Tip for the Holidays</url></p><p>Best Value in 4K TVs (More Than 50 Inches)</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tclusa.com/products/home-theater/6-series/tcl-65-class-6-series-4k-uhd-hdr-roku-smart-tv-65r617\">TCL 6-Series 4K Dolby Vision HDR Roku 65-inch</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $999.99</p><p>TCL has been making waves for a few years by releasing budget-friendly TVs that wow critics. The company is repeating as the maker that gets our nod for TVs 50+ inches in size, this time for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tclusa.com/products/home-theater/6-series/tcl-65-class-6-series-4k-uhd-hdr-roku-smart-tv-65r617\">65-inch 6-Series 4K Dolby Vision HDR Roku Smart TV</url>.</p><p>This TV checks a lot of boxes, especially when you consider its $999.99 price tag. For one, 65 inches is a lot of TV. And this one includes all the latest features, including 4K resolution, Dolby Vision HDR, Wide Color Gamut and 120-zone contrast control. The enhanced remote has voice control. As if that weren't enough, it has Roku's smart TV platform and both 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity to ensure streaming content is lag-free.</p><p>The TCL 6-Series also got CNET's nod as having \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnet.com/reviews/tcl-65r617-2018%e2%80%a6\">the best picture quality for the money in 2018.</url>\"</p><p>Best Value in 4K TVs (50 Inches or Less)</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vizio.com/tvs/eseries/e50f2.html\">Vizio E-Series 50-inch 4K HDR Smart TV</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $469.99</p><p>Vizio is another TV manufacturer that continues to impress without requiring a massive investment. At the high end, its new P-Series with quantum-dot technology is challenging OLED displays. But I want to focus on the E-Series for this list.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vizio.com/tvs/eseries/e50f2.html\">50-inch E-Series 4K HDR Smart TV</url> is a particularly good value. This is a big-screen TV with 4K UHD resolution, Dolby Vision HDR and 10 local dimming zones that comes in at under $500. Just $469.99 to be exact. It also has integrated Google Chromecast functionality, supports Alexa and Google Assistant voice control, and Vizio's SmartCast operating system means the TV is automatically updated with new features and capabilities as they're released.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/business/t057-s010-amazing-ways-life-will-be-different-in-2030/index.html\">20 Amazing Ways Life Will Be Different in 2030</url></p><p>Best Value in 4K TVs If Money Is No Object</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/the-frame/65--class-the-frame-premium-4k-uhd-tv--2018--un65ls03nafxza/\">Samsung Frame TV 65-inch</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $2,799.99</p><p>Which TV to pick if you have an unlimited gift budget? At this point, I'd go with the 65-inch version of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/the-frame/65--class-the-frame-premium-4k-uhd-tv--2018--un65ls03nafxza/\">Samsung's Frame TV</url>.</p><p>As a TV, the Frame has the expected features such as 4K resolution, HDR10+ and ultra-wide viewing angles. But at this price, you're not getting a fancy OLED panel. Sound is more robust than most flat-screen TVs despite the fact that this one mounts flush against the wall. That's because Samsung offloads ports and the 40W Dolby audio to a standalone One Connect Box that's connected to the TV by a single thin, almost invisible cable.</p><p>When it's not being used as a TV, the Frame lives up to its name, becoming a framed work of digital art. The frame itself is customizable (do you prefer white or perhaps walnut?), and you choose the artwork. It even has a motion sensor so when in Art Mode, the TV will wake if someone enters the room, then display images optimally based on the ambient light.</p><p>Best Value in Wireless Security Systems</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nest.com/alarm-system/overview/\">Nest Secure</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $399+</p><p>This year, you can give the gift of home security (without the ongoing monitoring fees).</p><p>The Nest Secure alarm system is an extendable offering from Nest - the company you probably know best for its smart thermostats. <url normalizedValue=\"https://nest.com/alarm-system/overview/\">Nest Secure</url> is a do-it-yourself home security system that starts at $399. The basic system includes the Nest Guard base (the smarts of the system that tracks everything and connects via Wi-Fi to send alerts, with a cellular option), two Nest Tags that automatically disarm the system without having to punch a code in its keypad, and two Nest Detect sensors.</p><p>Those sensors can be positioned on a window door or wall - wherever motion detection is wanted. They also offer smart features like Pathlight that helps light the way in the dark and Dog Pass that prevents pets from tripping the alarm. The Nest Secure system can be expanded as needed, with additional Nest Detect units and accessories like Nest Security cameras and supported third party smart door locks.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/taxes/t054-s001-most-overlooked-tax-deductions-2018/index.html\">20 Most-Overlooked Tax Breaks and Deductions</url></p><p>Best Value in Portable Power Banks</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.goalzero.com/shop/sherpa-power-banks-and-accessories/sherpa-15-power-bank-microlightning/copper/\">Goal Zero Sherpa 15 Power Bank Micro/Lightning</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $49.95</p><p>Portable power banks are popular gifts, for good reason. They're inexpensive, they're compact (making them great stocking stuffers), and virtually everyone could use one. Smartphones, action cameras and other mobile devices run out of battery at the most inconvenient times.</p><p>Goal Zero has a reputation for making high-quality power-related equipment that's rugged and cleverly designed. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.goalzero.com/shop/sherpa-power-banks-and-accessories/sherpa-15-power-bank-microlightning/copper/\">Goal Zero Sherpa 15</url> may cost a little more than some power banks (although it's still under $50), but the extra cash outlay is a good investment. The battery is sufficient to fully charge most smartphones one to two times, power output is regulated to protect devices, and everything is housed in a durable and stylish aluminum case.</p><p>A power bank does no good without cables, and guess what people tend to forget to bring along with them? That's OK: Goal Zero's Sherpa 15 has both Micro USB and Apple Lightning cables built-in, so they're never left behind. This power bank also has a standard USB charge port to cover off anything else.</p><p>Best Value in Smartwatches</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-series-3\">Apple Watch Series 3</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $279+</p><p>Few people will debate that the new Apple Watch Series 4 is the best smartwatch on the market. But it's also one of the most expensive, starting at $399.</p><p>The Series 4 offers some upgrades that previous generations can't match including a larger display, faster processor and ECG capability. But last year's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-series-3\">Apple Watch Series 3</url> is no slouch, either. It still has a beautiful display, runs the latest watchOS version, tracks heart rate and offers most of the same features as the latest model, including optional LTE connectivity. At a glance, it's tough to tell the two apart.</p><p>But the Apple Watch Series 3 now has a much more budget-friendly starting price of $279, making it a great value.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/spending/t050-s001-worst-things-to-buy-during-the-holidays-2017/index.html\">13 Worst Things to Buy During the Holidays</url></p><p>Best Value in Smartphones</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_3?hl=en-us\">Google Pixel 3</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $799</p><p>If you are shopping for someone who needs a new smartphone, my pick for best value this year is the <url normalizedValue=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_3?hl=en-us\">Google Pixel 3</url>. That's despite the fact that I'm an iPhone guy, through and through.</p><p>Why? The Pixel 3 isn't a particularly flashy looking phone. It doesn't even have a notch! But in the era of $1,000 flagship phones, a $799 price is refreshing. As a Pixel device, it will get all of Google's Android updates, and it has all the company's latest AI-powered features right out of the box. That includes the amazing Night Sight mode that revolutionizes nighttime photography. Nothing else out there even comes close to what this smartphone can do with low-light photos.</p><p>If you're dealing with an iPhone fan, then forget all this and go with the iPhone XR (you'll have to guess on the color, though!). For everyone else, the Pixel 3 is an excellent value.</p><p>Best Value in Tablets</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-9-7\">Apple iPad 9.7-inch</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $329</p><p>Tablets still make great gifts, even in the age of super-sized smartphones. Their combination of big display, thin form factor and long battery life make them ideal for web browsing, reading, casual gaming and watching streaming video.</p><p>Plenty of tablets are cheaper than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-9-7\">Apple's iPad</url> (even now that Apple has lowered the price to $329), but few can match the iPad experience.</p><p>The base model iPad has a 9.7-inch Retina display that looks fantastic, it's equipped with a powerful A10 Fusion processor, battery life is rated at 10 hours and it weighs just a smidge over one pound. With an iPad, the owner has access to Apple's App Store, which offers an unbeatable selection of tablet-optimized apps.</p><p>My only suggestion: If you are able to spend a little more, boosting onboard storage from 32GB to 128GB costs an extra $100 but provides a lot more breathing room for installing apps.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/spending/t057-s003-best-phone-plans-for-every-type-of-user-2018/index.html\">Best Phone Plans for Every Type of User, 2018</url></p><p>Best Value in Video Streamers</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/introducing-fire-tv-stick-4k-with-all-new-alexa-voice-remote/dp/b079qhml21\">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $49.99</p><p>One of the easiest and least expensive ways to make an older TV seem like it has the latest cool new technology is by adding a video streamer. That makes streamers a great tech gift for the 2018 holiday season.</p><p>All the big tech companies are in the video streamer game, but Amazon offers one that has a nice combination of affordability and features, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/introducing-fire-tv-stick-4k-with-all-new-alexa-voice-remote/dp/b079qhml21\">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K</url>. For $49.99 you get an HDMI stick that wirelessly streams video from services like Netflix, Hulu and of course Amazon Prime Video. And it does so in 4K with Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos audio. The remote also has Alexa voice control.</p><p>A few disclaimers here. The stick can only stream services the owner has a membership with, and features such as 4K and HDR require both the streaming source to make the content available in that format, and the TV to be capable of supporting it. In other words, it won't magically make an HDTV capable of displaying 4K video. But the streaming video access and Alexa voice control alone will be a huge upgrade for many older TVs.</p><p>Best Value in Wireless Earbuds</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jaybirdsport.com/en-us/tarah-pro-wireless-sport-headphones.html#985-000822\">Jaybird Tarah Pro</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $159.99</p><p>Wireless earbuds are all the rage right now. It's getting tough to find a smartphone with a headphone jack, and streaming music is becoming more popular, so that makes sense.</p><p>The best value I've found in wireless earbuds all year landed on my test bench this fall. Jaybird's new <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jaybirdsport.com/en-us/tarah-pro-wireless-sport-headphones.html#985-000822\">Tarah Pro wireless sports headphones</url> are something special that should appeal to a much wider crowd that the company's fitness-focused core demographic. For 99 cents more than Apple's AirPods, you get ultra-comfortable buds designed to stay in place even during vigorous activity. Audio quality is excellent, you can use Siri or Google Assistant, and they are IPX7 water-resistant (can be dropped into up to a meter of water).</p><p>A thin cable connects the two buds (connectivity to your smartphone is via Bluetooth wireless), but this is a plus in my books. It makes the buds themselves smaller and more comfortable, they're hard to lose, and they offer an incredible 14-hour battery life.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/business/t019-s001-11-things-to-be-thankful-for-in-2018/index.html\">11 Things to Be Thankful for in 2018</url></p><p>Best Value in Studio Headphones</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brainwavzaudio.com/products/hm100-studio-monitor-headphones-with-wood-earcups\">Brainwavz HM100 Studio Monitor Headphones</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $199.50</p><p>You may not be familiar with the Brainwavz brand, but the audio company has been in business for a decade and makes some very high-quality headphones.</p><p>If you're shopping for a true music lover - someone who values hearing music the way it was recorded - you want studio headphones such as the new <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brainwavzaudio.com/products/hm100-studio-monitor-headphones-with-wood-earcups\">Brainwavz HM100 Studio Monitor headphones</url>. I'm just in the process of evaluating a pair of these, and they're pretty impressive.</p><p>The HM100s are equipped with big, 52mm drivers and boast a frequency range of 10Hz-40KHz with a neutral sound signature (no Beats-style bass boost). There's no Bluetooth, because that compresses audio, and these are all about musical perfection. Instead it's old-school cables with a gold-plated plug. The design approach includes construction that largely banishes plastic in favor of materials with a pleasing tactile feel, including wood, leather and metal. The quality construction is backed by a 24-month warranty.</p><p>Best Value in Smart Thermostats</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecobee.com/ecobee4/\">Ecobee 4</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $249</p><p>Smart thermostats make a smart gift. They are cool, smart tech - which everyone likes. They also promise to save energy. That means the recipient saves money!</p><p>Last year the Nest Thermostat E got the nod as the best value. It's still a good choice (in fact I installed one in my home), but my current pick is the $249 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecobee.com/ecobee4/\">Ecobee4</url>. It does all the expected smart thermostat stuff including scheduling and remote access via a smartphone app. It also offers the high-tech LED display that stands out on a wall. But the Ecobee4 has Amazon's Alexa voice assistant onboard, so the thermostat acts like a smart speaker that you can shout questions at.</p><p>The Ecobee4 also includes a remote temperature sensor, so the home's heating and cooling system isn't just reacting to readings on the main thermostat - it also can adjust operations based on the temperature in another room.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t058-s001-9-tech-stocks-must-win-holiday-season-launches/index.html\">9 Tech Stocks With Must-Win 2018 Holiday Season Launches</url></p><p>Best Value in Smart Lighting</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nanoleaf.me/en/consumer-led-lighting/products/smarter-series/nanoleaf-canvas/\">Nanoleaf Canvas</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $248</p><p>Why would I pick a smart lighting kit priced at $248 - one that's not even launching until Dec. 3 - as the best value in its category? I've been playing with Nanoleaf's Canvas light panels for the past few weeks (under embargo) and you'll have to take my word for it: They are amazing.</p><p>Give these as a gift, and you will make someone very happy.</p><p>Nanoleaf Canvas made its first appearance at CES 2018. The system consists of thin LED panels, about 6 inches on a side. They connect together and include adhesive strips to stick them to the wall. They are Wi-Fi connected smart lighting and can display a huge range of colors. They can react to music, pulsing in time to the beat. They respond to touch, too. As a gift, this is a smart light system, a music visualizer, a design project and home decor, all rolled into one.</p><p>The $248 <url normalizedValue=\"https://nanoleaf.me/en/consumer-led-lighting/products/smarter-series/nanoleaf-canvas/\">Nanoleaf Canvas Smarter Kit</url> (not starter kit) contains nine panels and the controller, additional panels are sold in four packs for $80 and up to 500 panels can be connected.</p><p>Best Value in Turntables</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pro-jectusa.com/en-us/products/pro-ject-analog/essential-line/essential-iii\">Pro-Ject Essential III</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $349</p><p>I really enjoy listening to music the old-school way: on a turntable. And the way record sales keep churning along, I'm not the only one. I evaluated a half-dozen or so new turntables this year, and one of those was an easy pick as best value: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pro-jectusa.com/en-us/products/pro-ject-analog/essential-line/essential-iii\">The Pro-Ject Essential III</url>.</p><p>Pro-Ject is an audio company that makes only turntables and related accessories. While it's known for making some of the best audiophile systems out there, the knowhow and design of some its more expensive offerings have trickled down to the $349 Pro-Ject Essential III.</p><p>This turntable would make a great gift for a vinyl lover who's ready to graduate from a beginner record player. It features premium components like sapphire bearings and an aluminum tonearm, and comes with a high-quality Ortofon OM10 cartridge pre-mounted. Pro-Ject also gave this turntable a snazzy piano finish in black, red or white. One of the reasons this model is such a great value is that besides sounding great out of the box, it has upgrade potential (with a new cartridge and acrylic platter for example) should the vinyl fan decide to take their listening to the next level.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t031-s001-millionaires-in-america-all-50-states-ranked/index.html\">Millionaires in America: All 50 States Ranked</url></p><p>Best Value in Laptops</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://us-store.acer.com/laptops/chromebook/chromebook-14-cb3-431-c5fm?utm_source=us.acer.com&amp;utm_campaign=clm&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Acer Chromebook 14</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $299.99</p><p>Laptops are always in high demand as gifts, but their price and value proposition is all over the map. The best choice for someone on your list is going to depend on whether they have specific requirements.</p><p>However, if you're looking for a pick that covers most typical users' and students' needs, and offers value in spades, the Acer Chromebook 14 is tough to beat.</p><p>It's a Chromebook, so that means the owner is tied into Google's suite of apps - although they now also have the ability to run Android apps. Specs are modest, reflecting Chrome's low system requirements, but the $299 Acer Chromebook 14 offers some premium touches including a Full HD display, an upscale aluminum case, 802.11ac MIMO Wi-Fi and 12-hour battery life.</p><p>With Chrome, a Celeron CPU, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, this is not the laptop for playing Fortnite. But for web browsing, streaming video and doing homework, it's fine. I've reviewed dozens of laptops this year, including several that were in the $3,000-plus range.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://us-store.acer.com/laptops/chromebook/chromebook-14-cb3-431-c5fm?utm_source=us.acer.com&amp;utm_campaign=clm&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Acer Chromebook 14</url> is the one I bought for my daughter.</p><p>Best Value in Wi-Fi Routers</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.netgear.com/orbi/rbk50.aspx\">Netgear Orbi (RBK50) AC3000</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $399</p><p>Home Wi-Fi can be a complicated and underperforming mess. Take the growing demands of 4K streaming, multiple connected smart-home devices, smartphones and online gaming, then throw variables like wireless interference, walls and connected devices fighting for bandwidth in the mix. It can get ugly, fast.</p><p>Carefree, high performance Wi-Fi is one of the best gifts you can give. And It doesn't get much better than Netgear's Orbi whole home mesh Wi-Fi system. I've tested a dozen high performance routers over the past year and the one I've used for most of 2018 was a 5.4 Gbps tri-band monster. But it was still far from perfect.</p><p>I've been evaluating a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.netgear.com/orbi/rbk50.aspx\">Netgear Orbi AC300 system</url> for the past month and it delivers what is easily the best Wi-Fi experience I've ever had. Setup was simple. The router and its satellite both have LED rings on top to ensure ideal positioning and they are self-contained with no garish external antennas. Once fired up, the system pretty much runs itself (including updates). With 5,000 square foot coverage there are no Wi-Fi dead zones anywhere in the house. Everything connects with no lag and no buffering, even with multiple simultaneous 4K video streams.</p><p>At $399, it's a little pricier than other mesh routers, but it's worth the premium. The Netgear Orbi AC3000 has a combined 3 Gbps of throughput (compared to 1200 Gbps for Google's Wi-Fi mesh system) for high performance under extreme load and to protect against future Wi-Fi demands.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t064-s001-where-millionaires-live-in-america-2018/index.html\">Where Millionaires Live in America</url></p><p>Best Value in Smart Car Decks</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pioneerelectronics.com/pusa/car/nex/avic-w8400nex\">Pioneer AVIC-W8400NEX</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $1,200</p><p>The easiest way to get the advanced capabilities of Apple CarPlay or Android Auto is to buy a new vehicle. That's a little expensive, so the majority of car and truck owners will wait years before their smartphone becomes a fully integrated part of their driving experience.</p><p>However, third parties offer replacement car decks that replace the factory-installed version. Pioneer has always been a leader in car audio, so it's not a surprise that the company is bringing CarPlay and Android Auto to the forefront with its NEX series. If someone on your list loves their smartphone and would like nothing better than to use it to seamlessly navigate, make phone calls, play music and respond to text messages, then receiving <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pioneerelectronics.com/pusa/car/nex/avic-w8400nex\">Pioneer's AVIC-W8400NEX</url> as a gift would make their day.</p><p>At $1,200 plus installation, it's not an inexpensive gift - although it's a heck of a lot cheaper than a new car. But the price tag is justified by a long list of features. It has both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There's Bluetooth for wireless operation, or smartphones can plug in to keep their battery charged. A big 7-inch LED backlit WVGA touch display is ideal for displaying navigation details and Pioneer includes an integrated mapping system covering the entire U.S. and Canada. It has dual inputs for backup cameras. HD Radio and Pandora are integrated, and it's SiriusXM satellite radio-ready.</p><p>Besides all this high-tech functionality, there's the Pioneer's legendary audio performance, including 4 x 50W output, high-res FLAC support and a 13-band EQ.</p><p>Best Value in Video Game Consoles</p><p>Our pick: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nintendo.com/switch/\">Nintendo Switch</url></p><p>Manufacturer's suggested retail price: $299.99</p><p>During the holiday shopping season, there is no shortage of deals for Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4. So why would the more expensive and less powerful Nintendo Switch be the pick as best value in video game consoles?</p><p>It comes down to flexibility.</p><p>The Xbox and PlayStation are traditional consoles. They connect to a TV and stay there. But the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nintendo.com/switch/\">$299.99 Nintendo Switch</url> is a hybrid. Connected to a TV, it's capable of playing games at 1080p, and its JoyCon controllers pop out and connect to form a full-sized wireless controller.</p><p>Slide it out of the dock and snap the JoyCons back in place and the Switch transforms into a battery-powered mobile gaming system. The player can continue with the same game while riding in the car, sitting on the bus or hanging out at a friends' house. With the recent addition of YouTube support, the Switch can also be used to stream video on the go. It doesn't have the same extensive library as the Xbox One and PS4, but the Nintendo Switch has a growing library of AAA games, offers optional online gameplay, and it's hands-down the most versatile gaming system on the market.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t052-s001-12-retailers-that-may-soon-disappear-forever/index.html\">12 Retailers That May Soon Disappear Forever</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDITOR'S PICKS</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/spending/t050-s001-best-things-to-buy-on-black-friday-2018/index.html\">Best Things to Buy on Black Friday 2018</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/spending/t050-s001-how-black-friday-retailers-trick-you/index.html\">10 Ways Black Friday Retailers Trick You</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/retirement/t006-s001-all-50-states-ranked-for-retirement-2018/index.html\">Best States to Retire 2018: All 50 States Ranked for Retirement</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIPPUB-05700122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIPCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TT0-2FX1-DYTN-N52V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146142</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4548\"/><timeReceived>07:30 PM</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc.

Norway also signed the declaration.</p><p>European politicians are scrambling to amp up their work on AI by earmarking public funds and nudging companies to invest in technologies like robotics and medical applications that process huge amounts of data.</p><p>The EUas investment in AI lags behind the US and China, and the blocas new initiative could still be hampered by competition between member states, or by their differing positions on regulation.</p><p>EU Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel will publish a strategy paper on AI on 25 April that she said will outline legal issues that the technology is likely to create, and also address fears about robots replacing jobs. She will not propose binding legislation focused on AI this month, but has not ruled out regulating the technology at a later point.</p><p>National governments have made a rush of recent announcements relating to AI. French President Emmanuel Macron was the latest leader to focus on the technology when he revealed a plan last month in pump a total of a[logical not]1.5 billion in public funding into AI research over the next four years. Macron has also met recently with big tech executives to lure jobs and private investment to France.

All the big tech companies are trying to figure out how to optimize them. The only thing that has been holding drones back is regulation. With the lockdown scenario as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis and the focus on no touch technologies for the future, this is one thing that could really take off.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's looking at 25 cool things you can do with drones...</p><p>1. Spray disinfectant during Covid-19: All over the world, drones are spraying disinfectants in public places to keep zones sanitized. The same is the case with India. After the crisis is over, will drones take over the spraying of things like DDT too?</p><p>2. Deliver regular stuff: Potentially this is huge. BigBasket, Amazon, Swiggy, all have really mushroomed and the delivery boy network had reached unprecedented levels. Initially probably the larger orders and those at remote places can be handled by drones. Could they do it 100% in the future?</p><p>3. Deliver in hazardous zones: This is quite useful during earthquakes and floods when roads are out and helicopters and boats are limited and can be used sparingly. Drones can deliver medical emergency kits, food and get back valuable information for disaster planners.</p><p>4. Surveillance: This will be popular for governments: national, State and local; also for espionage. Corporates can also keep track of their large properties. This is becoming easier with increasing bandwidth speeds and data centre storage.</p><p>5. Aerial photography: Nothing says bird's eye view like a drone. But it can also be used for underground tunnels, skimming the surface of water and generally getting into areas where it's difficult for the human hand or camera to reach.</p><p>6. Film shooting: While the lockdown will end for the normal people, what about large gatherings? Film shoots may have hundreds of people and so the risk of infection is high. What if films came out with very less actors being shot by drones with cameras controlled from a remote location?</p><p>7. 3D mapping: Surveillance and aerial photography is fine, but what if you wanted to make a 3D map of an area? People like Albert Lin have been doing this for their documentaries for quite some time now and it is also useful for city planning.</p><p>8. Use in war zones: The military is usually ahead in using cutting edge technology and drones are no different. One person even managed to put an AK-47 a drone and make it work perfectly. They can also be used to neutralizing mines.</p><p>9. Racing: Drone racing is awesome thanks to the in-built camera plus the fact that the drone can go high or even appear to be hugging the ground. With large spectator sports under a cloud could we have the World Drone Championships in 2021?</p><p>10. Chatbot drones: What if you put a chatbot in a drone in a hospital or airport that would sort out the queries of visitors? Through facial recognition the drone would know who's in trouble and go to them and ask: May I help you?</p><p>11. Observe wildlife: If drones can be big and menacing, they can be small and inconspicuous and observe on the sly. They can take the shape of something that wouldn't alarm wildlife and act as a sort of candid camera in the forest.</p><p>12. Police the streets: Drones can act as a 24-hour police control and keep a lookout for suspicious activity and pass on the information to the control room. The police could also take charge of the drone and chase criminals.</p><p>13. Create mobile Wi-Fi zones: There have been many attempts to give Internet to the rural areas of India. Drones could move around as Wi-Fi hotspots from area to area. Facebook has been working on Internet drones powered by the sun.</p><p>14. Land surveys: Years back Karnataka did an ambitious Bhoomi project doing geographical mapping using satellite data. Imagine doing the same today with drones and a much detailed map of the land!</p><p>15. Advertising: Drones could be used for outdoor advertising. They could be used to carry banners, ads or even recordings to propagate a product.</p><p>16. Skyscraper maintenance: Drones could help in keeping track of what is going wrong in skyscrapers and maybe even do a bit of repairing and cleaning at the higher levels.</p><p>17. Carry people in emergencies: Drones are getting bigger and bigger and are able to carry more weight. The latest ones can carry people too. It could be used to evacuate people during emergencies or even some sort of passenger service.</p><p>18. Use in farming: In farming, a drone could be used to get detailed information in the case of large fields, spray pesticides and insecticides and even act as a scarecrow and chase away all the birds.</p><p>19. Site planning: Whether it is simplification at the pre-construction or things related to design drones can help in the planning of it all.</p><p>20. Asset management: Both governments and big companies can keep track of all kinds of assets with a fleet of drones.</p><p>21. Extraction pits for mining: This is also another hazardous area where drones can help out and save human lives.</p><p>22. Fish deep in a lake: This one is for fun. You could take the fishing line anywhere in the lake and fish wherever you wanted to. In this case, maybe the son could take his father fishing.</p><p>23. Replace the postal department: If the drones replace the delivery boy network, could they replace the postman too? Then the postal service would see a huge overhaul.</p><p>24. Take drone selfies: If you had a small drone of your own where you could attach your mobile, would you be able to resist the charm of taking selfies with it?</p><p>25. LED light show: We have had static light shows and musical fountains with light. You could put laser lights on drone or maybe even an army of drones to have a really wild light show.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CIOL-0053028549</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRD-PW81-JB5M-W4XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365403</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"953\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 CIOL, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CIOL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000506</classCode><className>DISASTER PLANNING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DMVO</classCode><className>EMERGING TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX002022</classCode><className>PHOTOGRAPHY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000649</classCode><className>ESPIONAGE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOOG</classCode><className>CAMERAS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000161</classCode><className>BANDWIDTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX002022</classCode><className>PHOTOGRAPHY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000A4XT</classCode><className>MOVIE FILMING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000DKNR</classCode><className>HAPTIC TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Tonight, a milestone along the way to reconstruction and redefining the European Union as leaders from 25 countries sign this document. It is the new fiscal compact. It provides both a turning point in the debt crisis and a step towards closer economic union for those who agree to it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you look into -- deep into the 11 pages, the numerous articles, the fiscal compact, the consistency, on it goes. The rules will include a requirement to keep deficits below half a percent of GDP, structural deficits, that is.</p><p>Those countries that don't will be subject to what they call automatic correction mechanisms, and these still have to be defined. The pact will be voted on by national parliaments, where required, and there'll be a referendum in Ireland after the attorney general there determined that that was a constitutional necessity.</p><p>You're aware the UK and the Czech Republic opted out, so because of that, it won't become EU law. It does go into the statute books of those nations which sign up, in some cases, into their constitutions.</p><p>(RINGS BELL)</p><p>QUEST: Charles Hodson is in Brussels tonight. We knew it was coming. It's -- it answers a lot of questions. It raises many more. But this treaty will be regarded as a turning point.</p><p>CHARLES HODSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think you're absolutely right. The important thing about it is, of course, that requirement that structural deficits be held at less than half of one percent of GDP. That is a great deal tighter than the existing Maastricht treaty, which binds members of the eurozone.</p><p>And the most important thing here, Richard, and what sticks in the craw of the Czechs and, of course, the British, is the fact that there will be a transfer of sovereignty.</p><p>Because the governments that sign up to this, the members states that sign up to this, will no longer be entirely free to set their own fiscal policies. Instead, they will have to pass those through Brussels and make sure that they're OK, get those rubber-stamped.</p><p>Now, on the other side of this, it's interesting because initially this was conceived as a treaty for the eurozone for the 17 eurozone members. But actually, despite the fact that Britain and the Czech Republic did not sign, think about it. There are eight members of the European Union who are not eurozone members who also signed.</p><p>And I think what they're seeing this as is an important piece -- if you like, and important gesture, which says we sign up to stability, we sign up to coordination, we sign up to credibility.</p><p>Nevertheless, it hasn't really been what the major thrust of this summit has been about. I think that what the summiteers have felt is, we finally got some of the crisis management of Greece out of the way, although that obviously was discussed. Instead, we've been able to look at the problem of the macro economy, the broader economic problems of Europe.</p><p>And certainly, the Danish prime minister, who currently holds the presidency of the European Union, was very relieved at the change of focus. Let's listen to her.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HELLE THORNING-SCHMIDT, PRIME MINISTER OF DENMARK: I'm very confident that if we want to have solutions for the European economy, we need to meet, we need to take positions, and this is what we have done over the last few months.</p><p>We have had a lot of crisis meetings in the EU, and for the first time, this is not a crisis meeting. This is a meeting where we not only discuss what has happened in the past, but we're also trying to look to the future and start to discuss how do we create new growth in Europe? How do we create more jobs in Europe?</p><p>We have been bogged down in the crisis for a very long time. Now, I wouldn't say we're past the crisis, but we're also -- we also have the energy to focus on other things.</p><p>HODSON: Well, clearly, crisis management has been taken up with Greece, and Greece is not out of the woods yet. There are still certain conditions that have to be met. Are you confident that this is all going to go through, that it will happen, and that Greece will cease to be a problem for the eurozone?</p><p>THORNING-SCHMIDT: I'm confident that the decision that the Greeks have to take will be taken. I'm very confident that the firewall that we build on will be sufficient for now. And these are important decisions. People tend to take these decisions lightly. They are very important decisions that shows the solidarity between the member states of the eurozone. They have been solidarity with the Greek people.</p><p>And I hope, now, that with this new firewall, the Greeks will have the opportunity to pass the law, so they have to pass, and get through to the other side.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HODSON: In terms of the debt crisis, Richard, I think of it as being three time horizons. Longer term, you've got the fiscal compact, which deals with the long-term credibility, deals with what might happen, 7 to 10 years out.</p><p>Meanwhile, short term, Greece, everyone is hoping, will be off the table relatively soon, although there has to be a bit of skepticism.</p><p>But in terms of the medium term, the G20, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Union ultimately hope to put together what would be an amazing $2 trillion firewall, a $2 trillion rescue fund.</p><p>Now, in order to do that, the European stability fund, stability mechanism, which comes in, the ESM, which comes in on the 1st of July as being the kind of prominent rescue fund for the European Union, needs to be boosted from its current level of 500 billion euros, just under $700 billion, to maybe something more like a trillion dollars.</p><p>The problem there is that the Germans are very reluctant to see that happen at the moment. But it looks as if they may be crumbling. If a Greek deal gets done, then they may very well put that together.</p><p>Certainly, I've been asking the European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, if he is confident that this deal, putting this firewall together, can be done.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSE MANUEL BARROSO, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: I'll not comment on precise figures, but I can tell you that I'm confident that during this month of March, there will be a positive reassessment of the need for more funds for the firewall, yes. I believe that it will happen.</p><p>At the same time, the European Union member states have been the biggest contributors to the IMF. I hope the IMF also recognizes this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HODSON: Well, let's hope that these three time horizons, if you like, can be dealt with, although there's a tremendous amount of work still to be done.</p><p>You're back with the big overarching problem which besets Europe, and that is the fact that households are being squeezed by higher unemployment, by higher taxes, by lower state benefits, higher inflation. And if the economy can be sorted out, then a lot of this will follow. But that, I think, is the greatest grounds for skepticism of all, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Charles Hodson, who is in Brussels for us tonight. Many thanks, Charles.</p><p>Europe cannot afford to make the same mistakes that happened with Maastricht, certainly when it comes to the implementation of this treaty. After all, not only did the European government put in things like a 3 percent deficit limit and a GDP-to-debt limit of 60 percent, many countries simply ignored it, and those that didn't ignore it got the rules changed, like France and Germany.</p><p>So, I spoke to Christian Schulz, the senior economist at Berenberg Bank, and I asked him, will this compact do the business?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTIAN SCHULZ, SENIOR ECONOMIST, BERENBERG BANK: Well, if it's good, then it builds confidence that the euro area, in the longer term, will be a safe place to invest. This is what the program is supposed to do.</p><p>But to get there, we still have lots of work to do. Every country needs to comply with the rules, needs to cut the deficit, needs to reform itself and grow. So, there's a long way to go, but in the longer term, this should improve confidence in the euro area.</p><p>QUEST: Which part of this treaty is the important bit? Is it, for instance, the deficit limit of half a percentage point? Is it the coordination of economic policies? Is it the ability to take enforcement action? Which bit is going to really do the trick?</p><p>SCHULZ: I think the one thing this treaty improves is the enforcement of the rules that we've had before. The rules are stricter than before, but they're not really new. We've had these rules before. But what is new is, it's going to be implemented in national law. Either in the law or, even better, in the constitution. So it binds governments into these targets in the longer term.</p><p>QUEST: But the enforcement mechanism within this -- the czar, the fines, whatever -- is it in here?</p><p>SCHULZ: Well, this is where the veto of two countries to make this an EU treaty really hurts. If it had been an EU treaty, you could've had the European Court of Justice or other bodies of the EU really enforce it.</p><p>Now, we have to have -- we have a role for the European Court of Justice, but it's not as clean-cut as it would have been.</p><p>QUEST: So, what's the enforcement mechanism in this?</p><p>SCHULZ: Well, the enforcement mechanism is that within national law, you have automatic penalties, automatic stabilizers that would, if a country breaches the deficit target, for instance, would automatically lead to a correction of that, and therefore, lead to automatic national action. That's really what is new about this.</p><p>QUEST: Are you impressed with this treaty, or is it going to end up like the stability and growth pact? Nice language, will be broken by the big countries, and won't do the trick.</p><p>SCHULZ: Well, it is a bit different from what we've had before. It has the sanctions, but what is key is, it actually has the protection of the rescue fund with it. Only if you sign up for the treaty and if you comply with the rules, you will be rescued in case of a crisis. This really should be an incentive for governments to comply with it this time.</p><p>QUEST: We need to talk about the LTRO briefly. The most extraordinary amount of money was deposited last night at the ECB, more than $700 billion. We know where the money came from. It was landed -- lent out with the left and paid back with the right. When would you expect to see that LTRO money starting to flow?</p><p>SCHULZ: Well, this is really something that has to do with confidence and with growth building across the euro area. Only if banks see demand for credit, they will lend out money, and they will be very tough this time on checking whether the creditors really lent out to the right people.</p><p>So, this will take time. Only once the euro area as a whole returns to growth we will see considerable improvement in the credit conditions, as well.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: And indeed, something that I learned today, if you look at the ECB's website and you manage to mouse and cursor your way to where you see those numbers, the amount of money on overnight deposit does not actually apparently reflect where it is being spent.</p><p>That's more a product of the ECB's own balance sheet. You have to look even further and know something about the underlying spending before you get to that number. We'll get to that next week as part of our further discussion of economics. A bit much for a Friday night.</p><p>Some of the LTRO shine has worn off, as far as European markets are concerned. They were flat, and only the DAX and the CAC current finished up on the week overall. Commodity prices fell, energy stocks in London headed in the same direction.</p><p>There are some signs the big ECB loans are being put to good use, and you see that if you look at Spanish and Italian bonds, which are both below 5 percent, which is the reaction that Mario Draghi at the ECB had hoped, 4.9, 4.9 will be very welcome by those central banks.</p><p>Wall Street is yelping for joy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p><p>(NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE BELL RINGS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: There's a new tech IPO in town, and this one seems to be going rather well. We'll be in New York after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Now, it's used to hosting the reviews. Yelp.com has got rave reviews of its own. It's the latest big website to go public and, on day one, shares are up more than 60 percent. This is Yelp, a site combining social networking with local businesses. That is the European stock market.</p><p>The reviewers have raised more than $100 million. Shares were priced at $15 each. Now, they're closer to $25 a share.</p><p>Shares in -- well, my word. A bit of indigestion there. Zynga are also up in New York. That's the New York market, which is showing down 14 points at the moment.</p><p>The online games company makes games like Farmville, and now it's building its own virtual community, zynga.com, away from its usual home of Facebook. Zynga shares are up more than 40 percent since the IPO showed just how much money it was making.</p><p>As for the Dow -- there. There we are. We have the right one at the right time. The Dow is down 13.5, $12,966. Doesn't look like $13,000 is going to be on our agenda for today.</p><p>Alison Kosik is in New York. I am embarrassed, Ms. Kosik. Well, yes, you may well find --</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You?</p><p>QUEST: I know, you may find this surprising, but I had to look up Yelp.</p><p>KOSIK: I am surprised.</p><p>QUEST: I had to look up Yelp to see what they did, let alone to know why they should have this meteoric rise.</p><p>KOSIK: You know what? You couldn't have put it in any better way. And you're not alone, Richard. I've talked with several traders out there today who were buying shares for their clients today and saying, \"You know what? I had to look up and figure out what Yelp did as well,\" because no one really understands what it does.</p><p>So, what it basically is is it gives reviews for services and businesses and restaurants in your local area here in the US, at least. So, let's say you go -- you want to go to a spa, you want to go to a restaurant, or use a business. Chances are, you may find it on Yelp, and you get sort of people giving their opinions and you can sort of figure out whether or not you want to go to that place.</p><p>OK. So, with that in mind, Yelp goes public today. Traders I talked to said, you know what? It was priced right. You know that, because look how much Yelp is spiking right now, 64 percent, shares are trading for $24.63.</p><p>OK, but here's the problem with Yelp, according to traders that I've talked about. They're calling what you're seeing just a lot of irrational exuberance because Yelp has yet to turn a profit and hasn't really said how it's going to in the future --</p><p>QUEST: Oi!</p><p>KOSIK: In fact, I've got to tell you. This -- to add to this, how do you like this? When Yelp went public back on the trading post behind me, where I'm stand -- where I'm sitting right now, one of the traders I talked to said he was sitting there or standing there, ready to buy in, right when the shares went public.</p><p>And he whispered to his buddy next to him saying, \"Why are we buying this? I'm so confused. How is this company going to make money?\" Richard?</p><p>QUEST: Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi! Ms. Kosik, I feel a bout of indigestion with the memory of the dot --</p><p>KOSIK: Oh, did you buy in this stock?</p><p>QUEST: No! No, no, no. I mean with the dot-com --</p><p>KOSIK: Oh.</p><p>QUEST: -- bubble of the 1990s that we saw these companies that had no revenues, that were on so-called path to profitability that nobody knew what they did, that they were selling dog food at cheaper -- more expensive than they could buy it or whatever.</p><p>I mean, their models were pathetic. Are we seeing a repeat of this with what we're now looking at?</p><p>KOSIK: You know what? It's kind of -- when you compare it to the 90s, I know what you're talking about, the big tech bubble. It's hard to call what's happening now a bubble, because if you look at the way these stocks have performed, most of them are just slightly above or below their IPO prices.</p><p>Angie's List is probably Yelp's closest publicly traded competitor. It's trading slightly below the IPO price. Groupon is down 5 percent year- to-date and 25 percent since the debut. Groupon, of course, reported that fourth quarter loss recently that was a big disappointment.</p><p>Linkedin is on a roll. It's up 35 percent year-to-date. But that has it trading just a few dollars -- about the IPO price. That one maybe had a lot of hype on IPO day.</p><p>But you know what? I think you're not really seeing the same level of excitement from the dot-com bubble of the 90s compared to now. And you know what, Richard? It's probably a good thing, because maybe investors learned a lesson from the 90s.</p><p>QUEST: Probably a good thing for my indigestion as well. All right, Alison Kosik, have a lovely weekend.</p><p>KOSIK: Perhaps.</p><p>QUEST: See you next week.</p><p>Talking of indigestion and things, from luxury to emergency. It's been a tough couple of months for Costa Cruises. In fact, we ask the question, what happens to the total cruise industry? After all, when one ship suffers, is everyone left at sea?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Technicians are investigating the cause of the fire which crippled the Costa Allegra cruise ship. A thousand people were onboard when it cast adrift in the Indian Ocean for four days. It's part of the same fleet of the Costa Concordia. That's the ship, you'll remember, capsized off the coast of Italy, killing at least 21 people.</p><p>When the Allegra finally made it to the Seychelles on Thursday, CNN's Senior International Correspondent Dan Rivers asked passengers to describe their ordeal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAN RIVERS, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Emerging from the sweltering haze of the tropics, the Costa Allegra was towed into the Seychelles by a French fishing trawler, a rather ignominious end to what should have been a luxury cruise.</p><p>But for the last three days, life aboard has been anything but luxurious. Passengers forced to camp on deck after a fire knocked out all power. Helicopters had to drop food.</p><p>But for American couple Gordon and Eleanor Bradwell, the whole experience was summed up in one word.</p><p>GORDON BRADWELL, PASSENGER: Unpleasant, obviously, because we did not have sewage, we did not have showers, no access to water, fresh fruit, food. We ate cold sandwiches for four days. The intense heat was a problem.</p><p>RIVERS (on camera): After three days with no electricity, limited food and water, the passengers are now finally ashore, some of them describing their time onboard as horrific.</p><p>DAVID TINSON, PASSENGER: It's complete incompetence disguised by very, very good luck. That's what's happened. And that's the only reason why there's lots and lots of people still walking around with us now.</p><p>MARI ANNE THON, PASSENGER: When we were up on the deck, and it was extremely black smoke, and so we knew something was going to happen. So -- excuse me. They sound the alarm. So, then we went out to our room to get our life jackets.</p><p>RIVERS: Are you happy to be ashore? How do you feel now?</p><p>ALENA DAME, PASSENGER: Yes, yes. A little bit emotional, because I prefer to go home. I am not in the mood to stay on holiday.</p><p>RIVERS (voice-over): But two thirds of the passengers are taking up Costa's offer of a free holiday on the Seychelles and a refund with a cash payment.</p><p>Costa Cruises is already facing a class action after another of its ships, the Costa Concordia, went aground in Italy in January, leaving at least 21 dead. They must be hoping this latest incident won't also result in litigation.</p><p>RIVERS (on camera): It's been a pretty bad start to 2012 for Costa. Can your brand recover?</p><p>NORBERT STIEKEMA, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, COSTA CRUISES: I am absolutely sure. I think the Costs Concordia was clearly an incident -- a human error. With the Costa Allegra, there's a technical incident, and I think here we had the opportunity to show basically that we're watching out in case of an emergency like that how we handle it.</p><p>RIVERS (voice-over): But it's all prompted more questions. How did the fire start? Why did a backup generator fail? And was poor maintenance rather than human error to blame this time?</p><p>Dan Rivers, CNN, on the Seychelles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: So, first the Concordia and, now, the Allegra. I turned to Simon Calder, who's the travel editor of \"The Independent\" newspaper. One of the best in the business, he is. And I asked whether he thinks the wider cruise industry could now be hit badly by Costa's problems.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SIMON CALDER, TRAVEL EDITOR, \"THE INDEPENDENT\": What the problem is for Costa Cruises in particular and the wider cruise industry in general is the way that these things have come about just six weeks apart.</p><p>The incident most recently for the Costa Allegra is actually nothing unusual. It happens several times every year that there's a power problem, might be caused by a fire. No one hurt. Very uncomfortable three days, of course, for the passengers and crew. But they'll be well compensated for it.</p><p>The big problem is that for Costa Cruises, the image of the company, I'm afraid, is still that stricken ship, the Costa Concordia, and the public face of the company is still Captain Schettino.</p><p>QUEST: Right. So, Costa is to one side in that respect. But what about the industry overall? Are you seeing prices of cruises falling dramatically? Is this the time to get a bargain?</p><p>CALDER: Well, it most certainly is. Now, if you talk to the individual cruise lines, they mostly say, \"Yes, we had a few problems immediately after the Costa Concordia event, but bookings have now returned.\"</p><p>I'm not absolutely sure that they're anything like on the trend they need to be to fill these berths. Remember that the cruise industry isn't like the airline business or the car rental or the hotel trade. It requires a 100 percent load factor. It has to get people on all those berths on all those sailings of all those ships. And the only way to do that is, of course, to discount.</p><p>So, typically, you would find that one person per night on a cruise ship costs around $150. I've seen prices below $100 for top quality ships in places that you will want to be.</p><p>QUEST: OK, so would you expect, then, the cruise industry to go on a PR offensive now? Because discounting will only go so far. But at the same time, we know from our experience, Simon, that memories are short.</p><p>CALDER: We do. But unfortunately, they keep happening for Costa Cruises --</p><p>QUEST: Oh!</p><p>CALDER: -- tomorrow, the pretrial hearing begins in Italy of Captain Schettino. That's going to put Costa Concordia back in the headlines just as Costa Allegra has finished.</p><p>The problem for the cruise industry isn't the majority of very sophisticated regular cruisers who know just how safe the industry is, and they know that this is just a one-off. It's for the new people. People who were considering a cruise who may now say, thanks very much, I'll stay on dry land.</p><p>QUEST: I know you like a bargain. You're the man who pays his own way. So, are you -- where are you looking to get a -- ?</p><p>CALDER: Already booked it. Eastern Mediterranean, I sail a month today.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: I might have known Simon Calder would not miss the opportunity to take advantage of a bargain. And where Simon's going, the rest of us probably should follow.</p><p>Oil prices up 16 percent this year. Analysts are talking about the new Greece.</p><p>(RINGS BELL)</p><p>QUEST: In a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest.</p><p>More QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment.</p><p>This is CNN. And on this network, it is the news which always comes first.</p><p>An amateur video from Syria is said to show a protest in Homs in support of Baba Amr, the neighborhood nearby, where the Syrian Army is still not allowing aid in. Activists report Syrian troops are rounding up men and boys described of fighting age, some as young as 12.</p><p>Iran's supreme leader was one of the first voters to cast a ballot in Friday's parliamentary elections. Some 3,400 conservative candidates are competing for 290 seats. They were all pre-approved by Iran's Guardian Council and the first result is expected on Sunday.</p><p>In Brussels, 25 of the EU's member countries have signed a treaty on financial stability aimed at putting a cap of overspending by member nations. Only the U.K. and the Czech Republic opted out of the pact.</p><p>A new round of tornadoes and damaging storms is now pummeling the south-central United States. The states of Alabama and Tennessee have been hit. Today's outbreak and two -- one two days ago have been unusually powerful and they came around two months earlier than normal.</p><p>As one crisis comes to an end, just another one seems to begin. And this time, it is oil. Brent crude is up 16 percent this year. And some analysts say it won't be long before it hits $150 a barrel.</p><p>Join me at the super screen and you can see Brent over the fierce supply and demand. If we begin with the supply issue, this is when the EU banned Iran's oil imports. And that pretty much is the starting point, if you like, of the process.</p><p>We then get this sharp, sharp run-up in prices over fear -- and that's again Iran, this time when it announces it's stepping up uranium enrichment. But more than that, we get a bit of a wobble. It goes down a bit. And this one is interesting because the downward trend is demand. If prices are going up, as they have been, does that demand destroy, of course, economic growth and cause -- bring that into you know?</p><p>And so we go back up and we tootle around. Some economists, like HSBC's Stephen King, are now suggesting in a report out just today that oil is the new problem that markets should be focusing on. It appears now Greece is under control.</p><p>John Netto is the founder and president of M3 Capital.</p><p>He joins me from the NYMEX in New York.</p><p>I've read at least three analysts' economic report today, all saying that what we are seeing with the price of crude, is the new serious problem for the markets and for economies.</p><p>Do you subscribe to that?</p><p>JOHN NETTO, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, M3 CAPITAL: I do. If you look at history over the last 35 years, we've seen that crude has been a great harbinger, or at least an oil shock has been a great harbinger of a forthcoming or pending recession.</p><p>And I think when you look at the price action in this market, Richard, that, oxymoronically, the -- the market is anticipating an oil price shock.</p><p>QUEST: So, what -- you say that, though, but what's driving that shock?</p><p>Is it the issue with Iran and the Straits of Hormuz or -- or whatever it might be with Iran?</p><p>Where is that shock coming from?</p><p>NETTO: Well, a couple of fronts. The Straits of Hormuz is obviously a key chokepoint when it comes to the shipping of -- of Brent out of that area. Also looking at a number of the potential issues with -- with Israel, issues there. We saw President Obama this morning come out in an interview with \"The Atlantic,\" talk about a surprise attack was, was out of the cards and just off of a geopolitical risk how -- how crude pulled back off of that...</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>NETTO: -- and how WTI pulled off of that.</p><p>But net-net, though, if you look at the WTI-Brent spread, Brent continues to outperform. And that's a reflection of this concern.</p><p>QUEST: OK, at what point -- and I've seen various numbers about an increase in whether it's Brent or WTI and how much that knocks off GDP. There's all sorts of formulae -- formula that we can use.</p><p>But, John, where do you believe, at what price does the price per barrel become a danger to growth?</p><p>NETTO: Oh, the $138 to $140 level. We closed today at $124. It's interesting, because there are a couple of factors that we, as energy traders, want to look at, Richard. These markets have become amazingly coupled in a lot of ways. And that whole risk on dynamic has benefited crude over the last three years. It's benefited Brent over the last three years. And when we look at Brent near all -- near multi-year highs and we look at the S&amp;P near multi-year highs, that may not be intuitive to a lot of people, but it does reflect a longer-term perspective...</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>NETTO: -- for the two can coexist as long as the increase in Brent isn't too far and too fast.</p><p>QUEST: We'll talk more about this in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Good to have you on the program for the first time.</p><p>NETTO: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: And we'll certainly have you back again.</p><p>John, many thanks, indeed.</p><p>John joining me from New York.</p><p>It is a fairly appalling time in the United States when it comes to to the weather, these tornadoes and storms.</p><p>Jenny Harrison is at the World Weather Center.</p><p>Good evening.</p><p>JENNY HARRISON, ATS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, Richard, another very bad day. Not a good end to the week at all. And by no means have we seen the worst of the weather so far this Friday across the United States.</p><p>This is where all the warnings are in place now. These are the watches I'm showing you here. The red boxes are the tornadoes, the yellow indicating severe thunderstorms.</p><p>And I'm just going to actually switch across to a different computer so that I can actually show you. You can see here, this is a zoomed in view of literally one line of thunderstorms within that mass that you saw. These warnings, these red boxes, these are tornado watch -- these are warnings. These are tornado warnings.</p><p>So this is where a tornado has already been spotted on the ground. And this is warning this particular neighborhood that there is very likely a tornado on its way.</p><p>So right now here, we could well be hearing the tornado sirens, if they're actually operating. And then you can also see, look at the hail. You can actually see much more information. I've obviously got the strength of the winds, as well. But also, look at this hail, one point -- I can't read it -- 1.62 inches, I think it says. So that's hail getting on to three-and-a-half centimeters. You can see there, 1.4 inches.</p><p>So we've got the damaging hail, we've got the strong winds, tornado watches that are also in place. And, as I say, all of that is continuing to work its way eastwards.</p><p>Now, so far, these are the reports we've had through. And the numbers do keep fluctuating. In fact, right now, there are 17 reports of tornadoes. They are preliminary reports and very often it's one tornado that's touched down in various places. Alabama, Northern Alabama, there has been reports of damage up there because of a tornado, a suspected tornado.</p><p>But this is, I think, again, probably the most shocking aspect, at the moment, of these storms, is because the area that these storms are working their way through is so very, very vast. This whole area here is the size of Spain, France and Germany combined. Seventy-five million people actually live here. And right in the center, about four million people are actually at high risk. And it's very rare, certainly this early in the season, to have any areas under high risk. But that is the -- the concerns for this particular day. It's going to get worse, Richard. The heat of the day is going to continue to rise the next two to three hours. And that is when we're going to see the more really strong thunderstorms in the exact same area that we saw the thunderstorms and the damage with the tornadoes on Wednesday, literally just not even really two days ago.</p><p>QUEST: Jenny, serious stuff.</p><p>Thank you for that.</p><p>We appreciate it.</p><p>Jenny Harrison is at the World Weather Center.</p><p>In a moment, Barcelona and those mobile phones.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Cisco says there will be more mobile Internet devices on the planet than people by the end of this year. So it's about time they started taking care of us.</p><p>This year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona is all about connected living, as Jim Boulden explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We anticipate there will be about 24 billion connected devices in our lives by 2020. So everything is going to be connected. Every electronic device you can think of is going to be connected by mobile. And you'll be able to control it really effectively to enhance your life.</p><p>JIM BOULDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So give me some examples.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So why don't we open the door?</p><p>BOULDEN: OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So I have a door lock module here. If I pick up the door lock, you can see the door is locked. If I hit the unlock button, that will open the door for us, you see?</p><p>And in we go.</p><p>BOULDEN: So this is the living room, I take it, the connected living room?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're in the connected living room.</p><p>BOULDEN: OK. I can think here, of course, you think of TVs, you think of stereo systems, technologies that are around now.</p><p>But what more?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, how about a fire?</p><p>BOULDEN: A fire, OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right behind you.</p><p>BOULDEN: All right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's turn the fire on.</p><p>BOULDEN: OK. So I can light the fire. I can unlock the door. I can pull up my shades. But I can also do that without that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.</p><p>BOULDEN: Why do I need that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think this is just an example of the sort of things we're seeing today, Jim, as we talk about, you know, 20 billion connected devices...</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's going to change everything in your lives, whether it's your health care, your smart metering, your utilities in your house, your car.</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're going to be connected and we're going to enhance all of those applications going forward.</p><p>BOULDEN: I think the smart metering is very interesting and a way for people to cut their energy costs. And something like that would actually work...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>BOULDEN: -- and help cut...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>BOULDEN: -- the sun coming in or the cold going out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So this is a great example, Jim. This is the Zephyr BioHarness fitted to our appellate (ph). And what essentially is happening, that information is being transmitted over the wireless network. And you can see the results in terms of heart rate and vital signs here.</p><p>It's kind of a -- a simple example to show you. But I think the, you know, the -- the example really holds in health applications where doctors, through a remote from patients, can do this kind of monitoring.</p><p>BOULDEN: And we keep hearing, especially in the developing world, where people are not going to have a doctor in every village, but as they become more wealthy and they use their mobile devices...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>BOULDEN: -- connecting to the doctor -- connecting to a health...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>BOULDEN: -- official is the important...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>BOULDEN: -- future for those apps.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, exactly. Things like mobile stethoscopes for people who just cannot go for a physical.</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They can look, they can check and you can get the quality you need over the mobile network.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, this is a nice end to the tour.</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So what I've got here, Jim, is actually a -- a social web of things. So, actually...</p><p>BOULDEN: Of things?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of things. So these connected things that we have talked about are my friends in the social web.</p><p>BOULDEN: Ah.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So for instance, you can see here, my lights are talking to me. They're actually saying, you're not here and I'm on, should I turn the lights off?</p><p>I'll say yes, turn the lights off for me, please.</p><p>Having done that, it says, OK, cool. It asks me, do I want to see for myself, to see that they have actually turned the lights off.</p><p>BOULDEN: So is that a count -- a camera?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So we have a camera also connected.</p><p>BOULDEN: Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So it's going to show me a stream and I can now see that my lights are, indeed, on.</p><p>BOULDEN: Sure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because there's the light in the corner and it's not on.</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes. So connected homes, connected automobiles, connected health care, that's what they've been talking about here in Barcelona this week. The experts say some 24 billion devices will be connected by 2020, worth trillions of dollars in business. And all from the palm of your hand.</p><p>Jim Boulden, CNN, Barcelona.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST: To paraphrase the old saying, we're turning into a group of people who know the connectivity of everything and the communication of nothing.</p><p>That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for this week.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest.</p><p>Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.</p><p>MARKETPLACE AFRICA is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBYN CURNOW, HOST: You're watching MARKETPLACE AFRICA.</p><p>I'm Robyn Curnow in Johannesburg.</p><p>This week, we look at the trade of a drug from East Africa that some believe has links to terrorism and an industrial dispute in South Africa that has led to a rise in global platinum prices.</p><p>Now, most of the world's platinum is found here, in Southern Africa. The world's second largest platinum producer is Impala Platinum, but a labor dispute has forced the company to dismiss 17,000 workers after an illegal strike. Four people were killed and at least 50 people were hurt in violent protests and attacks on employers who continued to go to work.</p><p>The strike began when 5,000 rock drill operators walked out in January when they did not get a pay increase. When other workers got involved, work at the mine ground to a halt and the dispute has cost the company an estimated $267 million in lost revenue. It also caused global platinum prices to rise.</p><p>This week, Julius Malema, the expelled ANC youth leader, visited the workers and after weeks of protests, the country's main union and the ANC government has urged the miners to return to work.</p><p>JULIUS MALEMA, ANC: You must remember to fight for your rights every time. But you must also remember, at government we don't want to (INAUDIBLE). We want to (INAUDIBLE) in employment supporting your families and yourselves.</p><p>CURNOW: This comes as the company is also being criticized by the Zimbabwean government for not handing over a 51 percent stake of its mining operation in Zimbabwe. So far, Amplats has only handed over 25 percent and offered 30 percent in equity.</p><p>Now, under Zimbabwe's Indigenization Law, multinational companies are forced to give up a majority stake to local black Zimbabweans.</p><p>Well, I recently sat down with Neville Francis Nicolau.</p><p>Now, he's the CEO of the world's largest platinum producer, Anglo American Platinum.</p><p>And I asked him how this indigenization policy was impacting his company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: In terms of making money, in terms of strategic visions, all of that, in Zimbabwe, how do you -- how do you work in that kind of environment?</p><p>NEVILLE FRANCIS NICOLAU, CEO, ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM: Well, Zimbabwe is the only other major geology that -- that has platinum. Operating in Zimbabwe does have its challenges. It -- it's -- it's not like many other countries. But this is a country that's in transition and development.</p><p>So we work with the government and while we are welcome guests, we are happy to -- to produce good quality platinum.</p><p>CURNOW: But you've signed off on this sort of Indigenization Law.</p><p>NICOLAU: Oh, it's a process. So, you know, we've signed off on aspects of it. And we've made very good progress. And so far, so good.</p><p>I have no reason to believe that we will not conclude our -- our discussions positively.</p><p>CURNOW: In terms of being asked to do something like this indigenization process, which is effectively hand over half of your assets on the ground to a local black Zimbabwean, why do that?</p><p>NICOLAU: It's not a matter of giving away half of the company. These are -- even if they are facilitated deals, there is a normal commercial deal that takes place. But the transformation is very important, to get to a point where all Zimbabweans can compete as Zimbabweans.</p><p>CURNOW: How do you ensure that this transformation is -- is stuck to, that this is not some sort of political grab, that that j that those assets go to the right people?</p><p>NICOLAU: Well, the -- we -- we have quite a lot of say in terms of who we sell these assets to. The -- a lot of the -- a lot of those discussions are -- are public and -- and stock exchange company type of discussions. And so far, we have no real reason to believe that we are doing anything that is for a political purpose.</p><p>You know, we're doing it because those are the rules of the country that we operate in and we -- we operate accordingly.</p><p>CURNOW: And you've really had no choice, have you?</p><p>NICOLAU: Well, you can always sell up the whole of the assets and you -- and you can leave.</p><p>CURNOW: And leave?</p><p>NICOLAU: We don't think that that would be a great idea. Of course, we make profit, is that is the primary purpose of business. But for us to leave would leave people without the -- the capacity to be able to develop the mines and to improve the lives of the people around the mines.</p><p>Two thousand employees, very often you can multiply that by five to the number of people that -- that you are benefiting. And then, of course, we have all of the supply companies and people that manufacture stuff.</p><p>So there are a huge number of people directly on the ground that actually are benefiting from us being there. And we're happy to participate like that.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: Neville Francis Nicolau there.</p><p>He is the CEO of Anglo American Platinum.</p><p>Well, from platinum to plants, we take a look at how a ban on a major East African shrub is affecting the livelihoods of Kenyan farmers through (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CURNOW: For hundreds of years, the drug of choice in East Africa has been a plant called khat. When chewed, it gives off a kind of mellow high that many find addictive.</p><p>Well, the trade is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact, many communities in Kenya are entirely dependent on this crop.</p><p>Well, khat has been banned in the U.S. and Canada and some European countries for health reasons.</p><p>But as David McKenzie now reports, many believe the ban was introduced because fear there is a link between the trade and terrorism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Edward Mutuura's Kenyan farm produces a key ingredient in many Somalia social gatherings across the world. He grows khat, a tree whose shoots and leaves, when chewed, produce a feeling of euphoria.</p><p>Every homestead in this part of Kenya seems to have at least one khat tree. And the whole region depends on khat for their economic survival.</p><p>But in January, the Dutch government announced a ban of all khat imports, citing health issues.</p><p>Mutuura says that the majority of their crop goes to the Netherlands, which has a vibrant Somalia community and is a key hub to other European countries.</p><p>EDWARD MUTUURA, FARMER: If the ban is -- is accepted or it is -- it is enforced, the whole Meru County, the whole Meru County, the economy of the whole Meru County will be crippled. The economy of this one of our population here, where khat is grown, will be totally crippled and the people have no source of income.</p><p>MCKENZIE: Many analysts believe that the Dutch ban has nothing to do with health concerns, but everything to do with terrorism.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have businesses which terror organizations may not be running, but which end up benefiting these organizations.</p><p>EMMANUEL KISIANGANI, INSTITUTE OF SECURITY STUDIES: So ultimately, the contributors are doing this in good faith, but the end result is that you have people who have brung what is along in between, who take these resources, this money, and channel it to terror organizations.</p><p>MCKENZIE: The group in question is Somalia-based Al Shabab, an Islamic militant group affiliated with al Qaeda. For years, Al Shabab has been battling the weak transitional government and a recent U.N. report says that Al Shabab, a designated terrorist group in the U.S. and U.K., gets funds by taxing the khat exported to Somalia.</p><p>Analysts believe that the khat trade in Europe may be following a similar pattern. They believe that some of the businessmen in Europe who act as middlemen to exporters and farmers, could be funding Al Shabab.</p><p>(on camera): Khat in Kenya is perfectly legal and it's widely available. This bundle costs around $20 US. But it's impossible to know exactly how much the export industry earns each year. One government official told us it's as much as $100 million per year.</p><p>But this industry is highly unregulated because of the stigma surrounding this crop, so it's impossible to have a fail-safe buffer between the industry and terror groups.</p><p>(voice-over): On the consumer side, khat has very little to do with terror. For centuries, it has been chewed for its stimulating properties. It's a cultural and social activity in many communities in the Horn of Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p><p>In Europe, khat is mainly chewed by the Somalia diaspora, even though it's illegal in several countries.</p><p>That demand has opened up a vibrant industry in fertile parts of Kenya.</p><p>Everything about khat involves speed, because it spoils in one to three days. Khat is sorted, wrapped in banana leaves, haggled over by transporters and rushed to the capital, Nairobi, and out of the country.</p><p>The farmers, who are separated from the end-user and any regulation further down the chain, are bewildered by the Dutch ban.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are legitimate businesses whose end product may end up in the hands of Al Shabab. Yet if governments resort to banning these businesses, then it hurts the ultimate owners of these businesses. I think it is a tricky situation. It's a precarious balancing act that somehow, perhaps, we need to think -- or, rather, governments need to think of mechanisms that ensure that these legitimate businesses don't end up benefiting these terrorist organizations.</p><p>MCKENZIE: But the perceived threat of khat could kill off this region's economic future.</p><p>MUTUURA: Khat farming is -- is -- is the heart of the economy of this place. And the occasion, we cannot educate our children without khat. If we don't have khat to sell, it means that our economy is grounded.</p><p>MCKENZIE: The Kenyan government says it is in talks with the Dutch to reverse the ban on khat. The farmers here hope that those talks bear fruit.</p><p>MUTUURA: This is only what we know in our life. Nothing more.</p><p>MCKENZIE: Or their livelihood will be plucked away.</p><p>David McKenzie, CNN, Kenya.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: This week marks our hundredth show.

Tonight, a milestone along the way to reconstruction  and redefining the European Union as leaders from 25 countries sign this  document.  It is the new fiscal compact.

That is a great deal tighter than the existing Maastricht  treaty, which binds members of the eurozone.</p><p>And the most important thing here, Richard, and what sticks in the  craw of the Czechs and, of course, the British, is the fact that there will  be a transfer of sovereignty.  </p><p>Because the governments that sign up to this, the members states that  sign up to this, will no longer be entirely free to set their own fiscal  policies.  Instead, they will have to pass those through Brussels and make  sure that they're OK, get those rubber-stamped.</p><p>Now, on the other side of this, it's interesting because initially  this was conceived as a treaty for the eurozone for the 17 eurozone  members.  But actually, despite the fact that Britain and the Czech  Republic did not sign, think about it.  There are eight members of the  European Union who are not eurozone members who also signed. </p><p>And I think what they're seeing this as is an important piece -- if  you like, and important gesture, which says we sign up to stability, we  sign up to coordination, we sign up to credibility.</p><p>Nevertheless, it hasn't really been what the major thrust of this  summit has been about.  I think that what the summiteers have felt is, we  finally got some of the crisis management of Greece out of the way,  although that obviously was discussed.  Instead, we've been able to look at  the problem of the macro economy, the broader economic problems of Europe.</p><p>And certainly, the Danish prime minister, who currently holds the  presidency of the European Union, was very relieved at the change of focus.   Let's listen to her.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HELLE THORNING-SCHMIDT, PRIME MINISTER OF DENMARK:  I'm very confident  that if we want to have solutions for the European economy, we need to  meet, we need to take positions, and this is what we have done over the  last few months.</p><p>We have had a lot of crisis meetings in the EU, and for the first  time, this is not a crisis meeting.  This is a meeting where we not only  discuss what has happened in the past, but we're also trying to look to the  future and start to discuss how do we create new growth in Europe?  How do  we create more jobs in Europe?</p><p>We have been bogged down in the crisis for a very long time.  Now, I  wouldn't say we're past the crisis, but we're also -- we also have the  energy to focus on other things.</p><p>HODSON:  Well, clearly, crisis management has been taken up with  Greece, and Greece is not out of the woods yet.  There are still certain  conditions that have to be met.  Are you confident that this is all going  to go through, that it will happen, and that Greece will cease to be a  problem for the eurozone?</p><p>THORNING-SCHMIDT:  I'm confident that the decision that the Greeks  have to take will be taken.  I'm very confident that the firewall that we  build on will be sufficient for now.  And these are important decisions.   People tend to take these decisions lightly.  They are very important  decisions that shows the solidarity between the member states of the  eurozone.  They have been solidarity with the Greek people.</p><p>And I hope, now, that with this new firewall, the Greeks will have the  opportunity to pass the law, so they have to pass, and get through to the  other side.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HODSON:  In terms of the debt crisis, Richard, I think of it as being  three time horizons.  Longer term, you've got the fiscal compact, which  deals with the long-term credibility, deals with what might happen, 7 to 10  years out.  </p><p>Meanwhile, short term, Greece, everyone is hoping, will be off the  table relatively soon, although there has to be a bit of skepticism.  </p><p>But in terms of the medium term, the G20, the International Monetary  Fund, and the European Union ultimately hope to put together what would be  an amazing $2 trillion firewall, a $2 trillion rescue fund.</p><p>Now, in order to do that, the European stability fund, stability  mechanism, which comes in, the ESM, which comes in on the 1st of July as  being the kind of prominent rescue fund for the European Union, needs to be  boosted from its current level of 500 billion euros, just under $700  billion, to maybe something more like a trillion dollars.</p><p>The problem there is that the Germans are very reluctant to see that  happen at the moment.  But it looks as if they may be crumbling.  If a  Greek deal gets done, then they may very well put that together.</p><p>Certainly, I've been asking the European Commission president, Jose  Manuel Barroso, if he is confident that this deal, putting this firewall  together, can be done.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSE MANUEL BARROSO, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  I'll not comment  on precise figures, but I can tell you that I'm confident that during this  month of March, there will be a positive reassessment of the need for more  funds for the firewall, yes.  I believe that it will happen.</p><p>At the same time, the European Union member states have been the  biggest contributors to the IMF.  I hope the IMF also recognizes this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HODSON:  Well, let's hope that these three time horizons, if you like,  can be dealt with, although there's a tremendous amount of work still to be  done.</p><p>You're back with the big overarching problem which besets Europe, and  that is the fact that households are being squeezed by higher unemployment,  by higher taxes, by lower state benefits, higher inflation.  And if the  economy can be sorted out, then a lot of this will follow.  But that, I  think, is the greatest grounds for skepticism of all, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  All right.  Charles Hodson, who is in Brussels for us tonight.   Many thanks, Charles.</p><p>Europe cannot afford to make the same mistakes that happened with  Maastricht, certainly when it comes to the implementation of this treaty.   After all, not only did the European government put in things like a 3  percent deficit limit and a GDP-to-debt limit of 60 percent, many countries  simply ignored it, and those that didn't ignore it got the rules changed,  like France and Germany.</p><p>So, I spoke to Christian Schulz, the senior economist at Berenberg  Bank, and I asked him, will this compact do the business?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTIAN SCHULZ, SENIOR ECONOMIST, BERENBERG BANK:  Well, if it's  good, then it builds confidence that the euro area, in the longer term,  will be a safe place to invest.  This is what the program is supposed to  do.  </p><p>But to get there, we still have lots of work to do.  Every country  needs to comply with the rules, needs to cut the deficit, needs to reform  itself and grow.  So, there's a long way to go, but in the longer term,  this should improve confidence in the euro area.</p><p>QUEST:  Which part of this treaty is the important bit?  Is it, for  instance, the deficit limit of half a percentage point?  Is it the  coordination of economic policies?  Is it the ability to take enforcement  action?  Which bit is going to really do the trick?</p><p>SCHULZ:  I think the one thing this treaty improves is the enforcement  of the rules that we've had before.  The rules are stricter than before,  but they're not really new.  We've had these rules before.  But what is new  is, it's going to be implemented in national law.  Either in the law or,  even better, in the constitution.  So it binds governments into these  targets in the longer term.</p><p>QUEST:  But the enforcement mechanism within this -- the czar, the  fines, whatever -- is it in here?</p><p>SCHULZ:  Well, this is where the veto of two countries to make this an  EU treaty really hurts.  If it had been an EU treaty, you could've had the  European Court of Justice or other bodies of the EU really enforce it. </p><p>Now, we have to have -- we have a role for the European Court of  Justice, but it's not as clean-cut as it would have been.</p><p>QUEST:  So, what's the enforcement mechanism in this?</p><p>SCHULZ:  Well, the enforcement mechanism is that within national law,  you have automatic penalties, automatic stabilizers that would, if a  country breaches the deficit target, for instance, would automatically lead  to a correction of that, and therefore, lead to automatic national action.   That's really what is new about this.</p><p>QUEST:  Are you impressed with this treaty, or is it going to end up  like the stability and growth pact?  Nice language, will be broken by the  big countries, and won't do the trick.</p><p>SCHULZ:  Well, it is a bit different from what we've had before.  It  has the sanctions, but what is key is, it actually has the protection of  the rescue fund with it.  Only if you sign up for the treaty and if you  comply with the rules, you will be rescued in case of a crisis.  This  really should be an incentive for governments to comply with it this time.</p><p>QUEST:  We need to talk about the LTRO briefly.  The most  extraordinary amount of money was deposited last night at the ECB, more  than $700 billion.  We know where the money came from.  It was landed --  lent out with the left and paid back with the right.  When would you expect  to see that LTRO money starting to flow?</p><p>SCHULZ:  Well, this is really something that has to do with confidence  and with growth building across the euro area.  Only if banks see demand  for credit, they will lend out money, and they will be very tough this time  on checking whether the creditors really lent out to the right people.</p><p>So, this will take time.  Only once the euro area as a whole returns  to growth we will see considerable improvement in the credit conditions, as  well.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  And indeed, something that I learned today, if you look at the  ECB's website and you manage to mouse and cursor your way to where you see  those numbers, the amount of money on overnight deposit does not actually  apparently reflect where it is being spent.  </p><p>That's more a product of the ECB's own balance sheet.  You have to  look even further and know something about the underlying spending before  you get to that number.  We'll get to that next week as part of our further  discussion of economics.  A bit much for a Friday night.</p><p>Some of the LTRO shine has worn off, as far as European markets are  concerned.  They were flat, and only the DAX and the CAC current finished  up on the week overall.  Commodity prices fell, energy stocks in London  headed in the same direction.  </p><p>There are some signs the big ECB loans are being put to good use, and  you see that if you look at Spanish and Italian bonds, which are both below  5 percent, which is the reaction that Mario Draghi at the ECB had hoped,  4.9, 4.9 will be very welcome by those central banks.</p><p>Wall Street is yelping for joy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p><p>(NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE BELL RINGS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  There's a new tech IPO in town, and this one seems to be going  rather well.  We'll be in New York after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Now, it's used to hosting the reviews.  Yelp.com has got rave  reviews of its own.  It's the latest big website to go public and, on day  one, shares are up more than 60 percent.  This is Yelp, a site combining  social networking with local businesses.  That is the European stock  market.</p><p>The reviewers have raised more than $100 million.  Shares were priced  at $15 each.  Now, they're closer to $25 a share.</p><p>Shares in -- well, my word.  A bit of indigestion there.  Zynga are  also up in New York.  That's the New York market, which is showing down 14  points at the moment.  </p><p>The online games company makes games like Farmville, and now it's  building its own virtual community, zynga.com, away from its usual home of  Facebook.  Zynga shares are up more than 40 percent since the IPO showed  just how much money it was making.</p><p>As for the Dow -- there.  There we are.  We have the right one at the  right time.  The Dow is down 13.5, $12,966.  Doesn't look like $13,000 is  going to be on our agenda for today.</p><p>Alison Kosik is in New York.  I am embarrassed, Ms. Kosik.  Well, yes,  you may well find --</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  You?</p><p>QUEST:  I know, you may find this surprising, but I had to look up  Yelp.</p><p>KOSIK:  I am surprised.</p><p>QUEST:  I had to look up Yelp to see what they did, let alone to know  why they should have this meteoric rise.</p><p>KOSIK:  You know what?  You couldn't have put it in any better way.   And you're not alone, Richard.  I've talked with several traders out there  today who were buying shares for their clients today and saying, \"You know  what?  I had to look up and figure out what Yelp did as well,\" because no  one really understands what it does.</p><p>So, what it basically is is it gives reviews for services and  businesses and restaurants in your local area here in the US, at least.   So, let's say you go -- you want to go to a spa, you want to go to a  restaurant, or use a business.  Chances are, you may find it on Yelp, and  you get sort of people giving their opinions and you can sort of figure out  whether or not you want to go to that place.</p><p>OK.  So, with that in mind, Yelp goes public today.  Traders I talked  to said, you know what?  It was priced right.  You know that, because look  how much Yelp is spiking right now, 64 percent, shares are trading for  $24.63.</p><p>OK, but here's the problem with Yelp, according to traders that I've  talked about.  They're calling what you're seeing just a lot of irrational  exuberance because Yelp has yet to turn a profit and hasn't really said how  it's going to in the future --</p><p>QUEST:  Oi!</p><p>KOSIK:  In fact, I've got to tell you.  This -- to add to this, how do  you like this?  When Yelp went public back on the trading post behind me,  where I'm stand -- where I'm sitting right now, one of the traders I talked  to said he was sitting there or standing there, ready to buy in, right when  the shares went public.</p><p>And he whispered to his buddy next to him saying, \"Why are we buying  this?  I'm so confused.  How is this company going to make money?\"   Richard?</p><p>QUEST:  Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!  Ms. Kosik, I feel a bout of indigestion  with the memory of the dot --</p><p>KOSIK:  Oh, did you buy in this stock?</p><p>QUEST:  No!  No, no, no.  I mean with the dot-com --</p><p>KOSIK:  Oh.</p><p>QUEST:  -- bubble of the 1990s that we saw these companies that had no  revenues, that were on so-called path to profitability that nobody knew  what they did, that they were selling dog food at cheaper -- more expensive  than they could buy it or whatever.</p><p>I mean, their models were pathetic.  Are we seeing a repeat of this  with what we're now looking at?</p><p>KOSIK:  You know what?  It's kind of -- when you compare it to the  90s, I know what you're talking about, the big tech bubble.  It's hard to  call what's happening now a bubble, because if you look at the way these  stocks have performed, most of them are just slightly above or below their  IPO prices.</p><p>Angie's List is probably Yelp's closest publicly traded competitor.   It's trading slightly below the IPO price.  Groupon is down 5 percent year- to-date and 25 percent since the debut.  Groupon, of course, reported that  fourth quarter loss recently that was a big disappointment.</p><p>Linkedin is on a roll.  It's up 35 percent year-to-date.  But that has  it trading just a few dollars -- about the IPO price.  That one maybe had a  lot of hype on IPO day.</p><p>But you know what?  I think you're not really seeing the same level of  excitement from the dot-com bubble of the 90s compared to now.  And you  know what, Richard?  It's probably a good thing, because maybe investors  learned a lesson from the 90s.</p><p>QUEST:  Probably a good thing for my indigestion as well.  All right,  Alison Kosik, have a lovely weekend.</p><p>KOSIK:  Perhaps.</p><p>QUEST:  See you next week.</p><p>Talking of indigestion and things, from luxury to emergency.  It's  been a tough couple of months for Costa Cruises.  In fact, we ask the  question, what happens to the total cruise industry?  After all, when one  ship suffers, is everyone left at sea?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Technicians are investigating the cause of the fire which  crippled the Costa Allegra cruise ship.  A thousand people were onboard  when it cast adrift in the Indian Ocean for four days.  It's part of the  same fleet of the Costa Concordia.  That's the ship, you'll remember,  capsized off the coast of Italy, killing at least 21 people.</p><p>When the Allegra finally made it to the Seychelles on Thursday, CNN's  Senior International Correspondent Dan Rivers asked passengers to describe  their ordeal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAN RIVERS, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Emerging from the sweltering haze of the tropics, the Costa Allegra was  towed into the Seychelles by a French fishing trawler, a rather ignominious  end to what should have been a luxury cruise.</p><p>But for the last three days, life aboard has been anything but  luxurious.  Passengers forced to camp on deck after a fire knocked out all  power.  Helicopters had to drop food.</p><p>But for American couple Gordon and Eleanor Bradwell, the whole  experience was summed up in one word.</p><p>GORDON BRADWELL, PASSENGER:  Unpleasant, obviously, because we did not  have sewage, we did not have showers, no access to water, fresh fruit,  food.  We ate cold sandwiches for four days.  The intense heat was a  problem.</p><p>RIVERS (on camera):  After three days with no electricity, limited  food and water, the passengers are now finally ashore, some of them  describing their time onboard as horrific.</p><p>DAVID TINSON, PASSENGER:  It's complete incompetence disguised by  very, very good luck.  That's what's happened.  And that's the only reason  why there's lots and lots of people still walking around with us now.</p><p>MARI ANNE THON, PASSENGER:  When we were up on the deck, and it was  extremely black smoke, and so we knew something was going to happen.  So --  excuse me.  They sound the alarm.  So, then we went out to our room to get  our life jackets.</p><p>RIVERS:  Are you happy to be ashore?  How do you feel now?</p><p>ALENA DAME, PASSENGER:  Yes, yes.  A little bit emotional, because I  prefer to go home.  I am not in the mood to stay on holiday.</p><p>RIVERS (voice-over):  But two thirds of the passengers are taking up  Costa's offer of a free holiday on the Seychelles and a refund with a cash  payment.</p><p>Costa Cruises is already facing a class action after another of its  ships, the Costa Concordia, went aground in Italy in January, leaving at  least 21 dead.  They must be hoping this latest incident won't also result  in litigation.</p><p>RIVERS (on camera):  It's been a pretty bad start to 2012 for Costa.   Can your brand recover?</p><p>NORBERT STIEKEMA, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, COSTA CRUISES:  I am  absolutely sure.  I think the Costs Concordia was clearly an incident -- a  human error.  With the Costa Allegra, there's a technical incident, and I  think here we had the opportunity to show basically that we're watching out  in case of an emergency like that how we handle it.</p><p>RIVERS (voice-over):  But it's all prompted more questions.  How did  the fire start?  Why did a backup generator fail?  And was poor maintenance  rather than human error to blame this time?</p><p>Dan Rivers, CNN, on the Seychelles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  So, first the Concordia and, now, the Allegra.  I turned to  Simon Calder, who's the travel editor of \"The Independent\" newspaper.  One  of the best in the business, he is.  And I asked whether he thinks the  wider cruise industry could now be hit badly by Costa's problems.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SIMON CALDER, TRAVEL EDITOR, \"THE INDEPENDENT\":  What the problem is  for Costa Cruises in particular and the wider cruise industry in general is  the way that these things have come about just six weeks apart.</p><p>The incident most recently for the Costa Allegra is actually nothing  unusual.  It happens several times every year that there's a power problem,  might be caused by a fire.  No one hurt.  Very uncomfortable three days, of  course, for the passengers and crew.  But they'll be well compensated for  it.</p><p>The big problem is that for Costa Cruises, the image of the company,  I'm afraid, is still that stricken ship, the Costa Concordia, and the  public face of the company is still Captain Schettino.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  So, Costa is to one side in that respect.  But what  about the industry overall?  Are you seeing prices of cruises falling  dramatically?  Is this the time to get a bargain?</p><p>CALDER:  Well, it most certainly is.  Now, if you talk to the  individual cruise lines, they mostly say, \"Yes, we had a few problems  immediately after the Costa Concordia event, but bookings have now  returned.\"</p><p>I'm not absolutely sure that they're anything like on the trend they  need to be to fill these berths.  Remember that the cruise industry isn't  like the airline business or the car rental or the hotel trade.  It  requires a 100 percent load factor.  It has to get people on all those  berths on all those sailings of all those ships.  And the only way to do  that is, of course, to discount.</p><p>So, typically, you would find that one person per night on a cruise  ship costs around $150.  I've seen prices below $100 for top quality ships  in places that you will want to be.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, so would you expect, then, the cruise industry to go on a  PR offensive now?  Because discounting will only go so far.  But at the  same time, we know from our experience, Simon, that memories are short.</p><p>CALDER:  We do.  But unfortunately, they keep happening for Costa  Cruises --</p><p>QUEST:  Oh!</p><p>CALDER:  -- tomorrow, the pretrial hearing begins in Italy of Captain  Schettino.  That's going to put Costa Concordia back in the headlines just  as Costa Allegra has finished.</p><p>The problem for the cruise industry isn't the majority of very  sophisticated regular cruisers who know just how safe the industry is, and  they know that this is just a one-off.  It's for the new people.  People  who were considering a cruise who may now say, thanks very much, I'll stay  on dry land.</p><p>QUEST:  I know you like a bargain.  You're the man who pays his own  way.  So, are you -- where are you looking to get a -- ?</p><p>CALDER:  Already booked it.  Eastern Mediterranean, I sail a month  today.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  I might have known Simon Calder would not miss the opportunity  to take advantage of a bargain.  And where Simon's going, the rest of us  probably should follow.</p><p>Oil prices up 16 percent this year.  Analysts are talking about the  new Greece.</p><p>(RINGS BELL)</p><p>QUEST:  In a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.</p><p>More QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment.</p><p>This is CNN.  And on this network, it is the news which always comes  first.</p><p>An amateur video from Syria is said to show a protest in Homs in  support of Baba Amr, the neighborhood nearby, where the Syrian Army is  still not allowing aid in.  Activists report Syrian troops are rounding up  men and boys described of fighting age, some as young as 12.</p><p>Iran's supreme leader was one of the first voters to cast a ballot in  Friday's parliamentary elections.  Some 3,400 conservative candidates are  competing for 290 seats.  They were all pre-approved by Iran's Guardian  Council and the first result is expected on Sunday.</p><p>In Brussels, 25 of the EU's member countries have signed a treaty on  financial stability aimed at putting a cap of overspending by member  nations.  Only the U.K. and the Czech Republic opted out of the pact.</p><p>A new round of tornadoes and damaging storms is now pummeling the  south-central United States.  The states of Alabama and Tennessee have been  hit.  Today's outbreak and two -- one two days ago have been unusually  powerful and they came around two months earlier than normal.</p><p>As one crisis comes to an end, just another one seems to begin.  And  this time, it is oil.  Brent crude is up 16 percent this year.  And some  analysts say it won't be long before it hits $150 a barrel.</p><p>Join me at the super screen and you can see Brent over the fierce  supply and demand.  If we begin with the supply issue, this is when the EU  banned Iran's oil imports.  And that pretty much is the starting point, if  you like, of the process.</p><p>We then get this sharp, sharp run-up in prices over fear -- and that's  again Iran, this time when it announces it's stepping up uranium  enrichment.  But more than that, we get a bit of a wobble.  It goes down a  bit.  And this one is interesting because the downward trend is demand.  If  prices are going up, as they have been, does that demand destroy, of  course, economic growth and cause -- bring that into you know?</p><p>And so we go back up and we tootle around.  Some economists, like  HSBC's Stephen King, are now suggesting in a report out just today that oil  is the new problem that markets should be focusing on.  It appears now  Greece is under control.</p><p>John Netto is the founder and president of M3 Capital.</p><p>He joins me from the NYMEX in New York.</p><p>I've read at least three analysts' economic report today, all saying  that what we are seeing with the price of crude, is the new serious problem  for the markets and for economies.</p><p>Do you subscribe to that?</p><p>JOHN NETTO, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, M3 CAPITAL:  I do.  If you look at  history over the last 35 years, we've seen that crude has been a great  harbinger, or at least an oil shock has been a great harbinger of a  forthcoming or pending recession.</p><p>And I think when you look at the price action in this market, Richard,  that, oxymoronically, the -- the market is anticipating an oil price shock.</p><p>QUEST:  So, what -- you say that, though, but what's driving that  shock?</p><p>Is it the issue with Iran and the Straits of Hormuz or -- or whatever  it might be with Iran?</p><p>Where is that shock coming from?</p><p>NETTO:  Well, a couple of fronts.  The Straits of Hormuz is obviously  a key chokepoint when it comes to the shipping of -- of Brent out of that  area.  Also looking at a number of the potential issues with -- with  Israel, issues there.  We saw President Obama this morning come out in an  interview with \"The Atlantic,\" talk about a surprise attack was, was out of  the cards and just off of a geopolitical risk how -- how crude pulled back  off of that...</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>NETTO:  -- and how WTI pulled off of that.</p><p>But net-net, though, if you look at the WTI-Brent spread, Brent  continues to outperform.  And that's a reflection of this concern.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, at what point -- and I've seen various numbers about an  increase in whether it's Brent or WTI and how much that knocks off GDP.   There's all sorts of formulae -- formula that we can use.</p><p>But, John, where do you believe, at what price does the price per  barrel become a danger to growth?</p><p>NETTO:  Oh, the $138 to $140 level.  We closed today at $124.  It's  interesting, because there are a couple of factors that we, as energy  traders, want to look at, Richard.  These markets have become amazingly  coupled in a lot of ways.  And that whole risk on dynamic has benefited  crude over the last three years.  It's benefited Brent over the last three  years.  And when we look at Brent near all -- near multi-year highs and we  look at the S&amp;P near multi-year highs, that may not be intuitive to a lot  of people, but it does reflect a longer-term perspective...</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>NETTO:  -- for the two can coexist as long as the increase in Brent  isn't too far and too fast.</p><p>QUEST:  We'll talk more about this in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Good to have you on the program for the first time.</p><p>NETTO:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  And we'll certainly have you back again.</p><p>John, many thanks, indeed.</p><p>John joining me from New York.</p><p>It is a fairly appalling time in the United States when it comes to to  the weather, these tornadoes and storms.</p><p>Jenny Harrison is at the World Weather Center.</p><p>Good evening.</p><p>JENNY HARRISON, ATS METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, Richard, another very bad  day.  Not a good end to the week at all.  And by no means have we seen the  worst of the weather so far this Friday across the United States.</p><p>This is where all the warnings are in place now.  These are the  watches I'm showing you here.  The red boxes are the tornadoes, the yellow  indicating severe thunderstorms.</p><p>And I'm just going to actually switch across to a different computer  so that I can actually show you.  You can see here, this is a zoomed in  view of literally one line of thunderstorms within that mass that you saw.   These warnings, these red boxes, these are tornado watch -- these are  warnings.  These are tornado warnings.</p><p>So this is where a tornado has already been spotted on the ground.   And this is warning this particular neighborhood that there is very likely  a tornado on its way.</p><p>So right now here, we could well be hearing the tornado sirens, if  they're actually operating.  And then you can also see, look at the hail.   You can actually see much more information.  I've obviously got the  strength of the winds, as well.  But also, look at this hail, one point --  I can't read it -- 1.62 inches, I think it says.  So that's hail getting on  to three-and-a-half centimeters.  You can see there, 1.4 inches.</p><p>So we've got the damaging hail, we've got the strong winds, tornado  watches that are also in place.  And, as I say, all of that is continuing  to work its way eastwards.</p><p>Now, so far, these are the reports we've had through.  And the numbers  do keep fluctuating.  In fact, right now, there are 17 reports of  tornadoes.  They are preliminary reports and very often it's one tornado  that's touched down in various places.  Alabama, Northern Alabama, there  has been reports of damage up there because of a tornado, a suspected  tornado.</p><p>But this is, I think, again, probably the most shocking aspect, at the  moment, of these storms, is because the area that these storms are working  their way through is so very, very vast.  This whole area here is the size  of Spain, France and Germany combined.  Seventy-five million people  actually live here.  And right in the center, about four million people are  actually at high risk.  And it's very rare, certainly this early in the  season, to have any areas under high risk.  But that is the -- the concerns  for this particular day.  It's going to get worse, Richard.  The heat of  the day is going to continue to rise the next two to three hours.  And that  is when we're going to see the more really strong thunderstorms in the  exact same area that we saw the thunderstorms and the damage with the  tornadoes on Wednesday, literally just not even really two days ago.</p><p>QUEST:  Jenny, serious stuff.</p><p>Thank you for that.</p><p>We appreciate it.</p><p>Jenny Harrison is at the World Weather Center.</p><p>In a moment, Barcelona and those mobile phones.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Cisco says there will be more mobile Internet devices on the  planet than people by the end of this year.  So it's about time they  started taking care of us.</p><p>This year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona is all about connected  living, as Jim Boulden explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   We anticipate there will be about 24 billion  connected devices in our lives by 2020.  So everything is going to be  connected.  Every electronic device you can think of is going to be  connected by mobile.  And you'll be able to control it really effectively  to enhance your life.</p><p>JIM BOULDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  So give me some examples.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   So why don't we open the door?</p><p>BOULDEN:  OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   So I have a door lock module here.  If I pick up  the door lock, you can see the door is locked.  If I hit the unlock button,  that will open the door for us, you see?</p><p>And in we go.</p><p>BOULDEN:  So this is the living room, I take it, the connected living  room?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   We're in the connected living room.</p><p>BOULDEN:  OK.  I can think here, of course, you think of TVs, you  think of stereo systems, technologies that are around now.</p><p>But what more?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, how about a fire?</p><p>BOULDEN:  A fire, OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right behind you.</p><p>BOULDEN:  All right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let's turn the fire on.</p><p>BOULDEN:  OK.  So I can light the fire.  I can unlock the door.  I can  pull up my shades.  But I can also do that without that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sure.</p><p>BOULDEN:  Why do I need that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think this is just an example of the sort of  things we're seeing today, Jim, as we talk about, you know, 20 billion  connected devices...</p><p>BOULDEN:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's going to change everything in your lives,  whether it's your health care, your smart metering, your utilities in your  house, your car.</p><p>BOULDEN:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're going to be connected and we're going to  enhance all of those applications going forward.</p><p>BOULDEN:  I think the smart metering is very interesting and a way for  people to cut their energy costs.  And something like that would actually  work...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.</p><p>BOULDEN:  -- and help cut...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.</p><p>BOULDEN:  -- the sun coming in or the cold going out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   So this is a great example, Jim.  This is the  Zephyr BioHarness fitted to our appellate (ph).  And what essentially is  happening, that information is being transmitted over the wireless network.   And you can see the results in terms of heart rate and vital signs here.</p><p>It's kind of a -- a simple example to show you.  But I think the, you  know, the -- the example really holds in health applications where doctors,  through a remote from patients, can do this kind of monitoring.</p><p>BOULDEN:  And we keep hearing, especially in the developing world,  where people are not going to have a doctor in every village, but as they  become more wealthy and they use their mobile devices...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.</p><p>BOULDEN:  -- connecting to the doctor -- connecting to a health...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>BOULDEN:  -- official is the important...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>BOULDEN:  -- future for those apps.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, exactly.  Things like mobile stethoscopes for  people who just cannot go for a physical.</p><p>BOULDEN:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They can look, they can check and you can get the  quality you need over the mobile network.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   Yes, this is a nice end to the tour.</p><p>BOULDEN:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So what I've got here, Jim, is actually a -- a  social web of things.  So, actually...</p><p>BOULDEN:  Of things?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Of things.  So these connected things that we have  talked about are my friends in the social web.</p><p>BOULDEN:  Ah.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So for instance, you can see here, my lights are  talking to me.  They're actually saying, you're not here and I'm on, should  I turn the lights off?</p><p>I'll say yes, turn the lights off for me, please.</p><p>Having done that, it says, OK, cool.  It asks me, do I want to see for  myself, to see that they have actually turned the lights off.</p><p>BOULDEN:  So is that a count -- a camera?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So we have a camera also connected.</p><p>BOULDEN:  Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So it's going to show me a stream and I can now  see that my lights are, indeed, on.</p><p>BOULDEN:  Sure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because there's the light in the corner and it's  not on.</p><p>BOULDEN:  Yes.  So connected homes, connected automobiles, connected  health care, that's what they've been talking about here in Barcelona this  week.  The experts say some 24 billion devices will be connected by 2020,  worth trillions of dollars in business.  And all from the palm of your  hand.</p><p>Jim Boulden, CNN, Barcelona.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  To paraphrase the old saying, we're turning into a group of  people who know the connectivity of everything and the communication of  nothing.</p><p>That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for this week.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest.</p><p>Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.</p><p>MARKETPLACE AFRICA is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBYN CURNOW, HOST:  You're watching MARKETPLACE AFRICA.</p><p>I'm Robyn Curnow in Johannesburg.</p><p>This week, we look at the trade of a drug from East Africa that some  believe has links to terrorism and an industrial dispute in South Africa  that has led to a rise in global platinum prices.</p><p>Now, most of the world's platinum is found here, in Southern Africa.   The world's second largest platinum producer is Impala Platinum, but a  labor dispute has forced the company to dismiss 17,000 workers after an  illegal strike.  Four people were killed and at least 50 people were hurt  in violent protests and attacks on employers who continued to go to work.</p><p>The strike began when 5,000 rock drill operators walked out in January  when they did not get a pay increase.  When other workers got involved,  work at the mine ground to a halt and the dispute has cost the company an  estimated $267 million in lost revenue.  It also caused global platinum  prices to rise.</p><p>This week, Julius Malema, the expelled ANC youth leader, visited the  workers and after weeks of protests, the country's main union and the ANC  government has urged the miners to return to work.</p><p>JULIUS MALEMA, ANC:  You must remember to fight for your rights every  time.  But you must also remember, at government we don't want to  (INAUDIBLE).  We want to (INAUDIBLE) in employment supporting your families  and yourselves.</p><p>CURNOW:  This comes as the company is also being criticized by the  Zimbabwean government for not handing over a 51 percent stake of its mining  operation in Zimbabwe.  So far, Amplats has only handed over 25 percent and  offered 30 percent in equity.</p><p>Now, under Zimbabwe's Indigenization Law, multinational companies are  forced to give up a majority stake to local black Zimbabweans.</p><p>Well, I recently sat down with Neville Francis Nicolau.</p><p>Now, he's the CEO of the world's largest platinum producer, Anglo  American Platinum.</p><p>And I asked him how this indigenization policy was impacting his  company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW:  In terms of making money, in terms of strategic visions, all  of that, in Zimbabwe, how do you -- how do you work in that kind of  environment?</p><p>NEVILLE FRANCIS NICOLAU, CEO, ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM:  Well, Zimbabwe  is the only other major geology that -- that has platinum.  Operating in  Zimbabwe does have its challenges.  It -- it's -- it's not like many other  countries.  But this is a country that's in transition and development.</p><p>So we work with the government and while we are welcome guests, we are  happy to -- to produce good quality platinum.</p><p>CURNOW:  But you've signed off on this sort of Indigenization Law.</p><p>NICOLAU:  Oh, it's a process.  So, you know, we've signed off on  aspects of it.  And we've made very good progress.  And so far, so good.</p><p>I have no reason to believe that we will not conclude our -- our  discussions positively.</p><p>CURNOW:  In terms of being asked to do something like this  indigenization process, which is effectively hand over half of your assets  on the ground to a local black Zimbabwean, why do that?</p><p>NICOLAU:  It's not a matter of giving away half of the company.  These  are -- even if they are facilitated deals, there is a normal commercial  deal that takes place.  But the transformation is very important, to get to  a point where all Zimbabweans can compete as Zimbabweans.</p><p>CURNOW:  How do you ensure that this transformation is -- is stuck to,  that this is not some sort of political grab, that that j that those assets  go to the right people?</p><p>NICOLAU:  Well, the -- we -- we have quite a lot of say in terms of  who we sell these assets to.  The -- a lot of the -- a lot of those  discussions are -- are public and -- and stock exchange company type of  discussions.  And so far, we have no real reason to believe that we are  doing anything that is for a political purpose.</p><p>You know, we're doing it because those are the rules of the country  that we operate in and we -- we operate accordingly.</p><p>CURNOW:  And you've really had no choice, have you?</p><p>NICOLAU:  Well, you can always sell up the whole of the assets and you  -- and you can leave.</p><p>CURNOW:  And leave?</p><p>NICOLAU:  We don't think that that would be a great idea.  Of course,  we make profit, is that is the primary purpose of business.  But for us to  leave would leave people without the -- the capacity to be able to develop  the mines and to improve the lives of the people around the mines.</p><p>Two thousand employees, very often you can multiply that by five to  the number of people that -- that you are benefiting.  And then, of course,  we have all of the supply companies and people that manufacture stuff.</p><p>So there are a huge number of people directly on the ground that  actually are benefiting from us being there.  And we're happy to  participate like that.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CURNOW:  Neville Francis Nicolau there.</p><p>He is the CEO of Anglo American Platinum.</p><p>Well, from platinum to plants, we take a look at how a ban on a major  East African shrub is affecting the livelihoods of Kenyan farmers through  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CURNOW:  For hundreds of years, the drug of choice in East Africa has  been a plant called khat.  When chewed, it gives off a kind of mellow high  that many find addictive.</p><p>Well, the trade is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  In fact,  many communities in Kenya are entirely dependent on this crop.</p><p>Well, khat has been banned in the U.S. and Canada and some European  countries for health reasons.</p><p>But as David McKenzie now reports, many believe the ban was introduced  because fear there is a link between the trade and terrorism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Edward Mutuura's  Kenyan farm produces a key ingredient in many Somalia social gatherings  across the world.  He grows khat, a tree whose shoots and leaves, when  chewed, produce a feeling of euphoria.</p><p>Every homestead in this part of Kenya seems to have at least one khat  tree.  And the whole region depends on khat for their economic survival.</p><p>But in January, the Dutch government announced a ban of all khat  imports, citing health issues.</p><p>Mutuura says that the majority of their crop goes to the Netherlands,  which has a vibrant Somalia community and is a key hub to other European  countries.</p><p>EDWARD MUTUURA, FARMER:  If the ban is -- is accepted or it is -- it  is enforced, the whole Meru County, the whole Meru County, the economy of  the whole Meru County will be crippled.  The economy of this one of our  population here, where khat is grown, will be totally crippled and the  people have no source of income.</p><p>MCKENZIE:  Many analysts believe that the Dutch ban has nothing to do  with health concerns, but everything to do with terrorism.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   You have businesses which terror organizations  may not be running, but which end up benefiting these organizations.</p><p>EMMANUEL KISIANGANI, INSTITUTE OF SECURITY STUDIES:  So ultimately,  the contributors are doing this in good faith, but the end result is that  you have people who have brung what is along in between, who take these  resources, this money, and channel it to terror organizations.</p><p>MCKENZIE:  The group in question is Somalia-based Al Shabab, an  Islamic militant group affiliated with al Qaeda.  For years, Al Shabab has  been battling the weak transitional government and a recent U.N. report  says that Al Shabab, a designated terrorist group in the U.S. and U.K.,  gets funds by taxing the khat exported to Somalia.</p><p>Analysts believe that the khat trade in Europe may be following a  similar pattern.  They believe that some of the businessmen in Europe who  act as middlemen to exporters and farmers, could be funding Al Shabab.</p><p>(on camera):  Khat in Kenya is perfectly legal and it's widely  available.  This bundle costs around $20 US.  But it's impossible to know  exactly how much the export industry earns each year.  One government  official told us it's as much as $100 million per year.</p><p>But this industry is highly unregulated because of the stigma  surrounding this crop, so it's impossible to have a fail-safe buffer  between the industry and terror groups.</p><p>(voice-over):  On the consumer side, khat has very little to do with  terror.  For centuries, it has been chewed for its stimulating properties.   It's a cultural and social activity in many communities in the Horn of  Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p><p>In Europe, khat is mainly chewed by the Somalia diaspora, even though  it's illegal in several countries.</p><p>That demand has opened up a vibrant industry in fertile parts of  Kenya.</p><p>Everything about khat involves speed, because it spoils in one to  three days.  Khat is sorted, wrapped in banana leaves, haggled over by  transporters and rushed to the capital, Nairobi, and out of the country.</p><p>The farmers, who are separated from the end-user and any regulation  further down the chain, are bewildered by the Dutch ban.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   There are legitimate businesses whose end product  may end up in the hands of Al Shabab.  Yet if governments resort to banning  these businesses, then it hurts the ultimate owners of these businesses.  I  think it is a tricky situation.  It's a precarious balancing act that  somehow, perhaps, we need to think -- or, rather, governments need to think  of mechanisms that ensure that these legitimate businesses don't end up  benefiting these terrorist organizations.</p><p>MCKENZIE:  But the perceived threat of khat could kill off this  region's economic future.</p><p>MUTUURA:  Khat farming is -- is -- is the heart of the economy of this  place.  And the occasion, we cannot educate our children without khat.  If  we don't have khat to sell, it means that our economy is grounded.</p><p>MCKENZIE:  The Kenyan government says it is in talks with the Dutch to  reverse the ban on khat.  The farmers here hope that those talks bear  fruit.</p><p>MUTUURA:  This is only what we know in our life.  Nothing more.</p><p>MCKENZIE:  Or their livelihood will be plucked away.</p><p>David McKenzie, CNN, Kenya.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CURNOW:  This week marks our hundredth show.

All but two EU leaders sign the fiscal compact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yelp if you want to go faster. Shares leap 60 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And tonight, introducing a different kind of mobile home, the Barcelona Mobile World Congress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Richard Quest. It might be Friday, but I still mean business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening. Tonight, a milestone along the way to reconstruction and redefining the European Union as leaders from 25 countries sign this document. It is the new fiscal compact. It provides both a turning point in the debt crisis and a step towards closer economic union for those who agree to it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you look into -- deep into the 11 pages, the numerous articles, the fiscal compact, the consistency, on it goes. The rules will include a requirement to keep deficits below half a percent of GDP, structural deficits, that is.</p><p>Those countries that don't will be subject to what they call automatic correction mechanisms, and these still have to be defined. The pact will be voted on by national parliaments, where required, and there'll be a referendum in Ireland after the attorney general there determined that that was a constitutional necessity.</p><p>You're aware the UK and the Czech Republic opted out, so because of that, it won't become EU law. It does go into the statute books of those nations which sign up, in some cases, into their constitutions.</p><p>(RINGS BELL)</p><p>QUEST: Charles Hodson is in Brussels tonight. We knew it was coming. It's -- it answers a lot of questions. It raises many more. But this treaty will be regarded as a turning point.</p><p>CHARLES HODSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think you're absolutely right. The important thing about it is, of course, that requirement that structural deficits be held at less than half of one percent of GDP. That is a great deal tighter than the existing Maastricht treaty, which binds members of the eurozone.</p><p>And the most important thing here, Richard, and what sticks in the craw of the Czechs and, of course, the British, is the fact that there will be a transfer of sovereignty.</p><p>Because the governments that sign up to this, the members states that sign up to this, will no longer be entirely free to set their own fiscal policies. Instead, they will have to pass those through Brussels and make sure that they're OK, get those rubber-stamped.</p><p>Now, on the other side of this, it's interesting because initially this was conceived as a treaty for the eurozone for the 17 eurozone members. But actually, despite the fact that Britain and the Czech Republic did not sign, think about it. There are eight members of the European Union who are not eurozone members who also signed.</p><p>And I think what they're seeing this as is an important piece -- if you like, and important gesture, which says we sign up to stability, we sign up to coordination, we sign up to credibility.</p><p>Nevertheless, it hasn't really been what the major thrust of this summit has been about. I think that what the summiteers have felt is, we finally got some of the crisis management of Greece out of the way, although that obviously was discussed. Instead, we've been able to look at the problem of the macro economy, the broader economic problems of Europe.</p><p>And certainly, the Danish prime minister, who currently holds the presidency of the European Union, was very relieved at the change of focus. Let's listen to her.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HELLE THORNING-SCHMIDT, PRIME MINISTER OF DENMARK: I'm very confident that if we want to have solutions for the European economy, we need to meet, we need to take positions, and this is what we have done over the last few months.</p><p>We have had a lot of crisis meetings in the EU, and for the first time, this is not a crisis meeting. This is a meeting where we not only discuss what has happened in the past, but we're also trying to look to the future and start to discuss how do we create new growth in Europe? How do we create more jobs in Europe?</p><p>We have been bogged down in the crisis for a very long time. Now, I wouldn't say we're past the crisis, but we're also -- we also have the energy to focus on other things.</p><p>HODSON: Well, clearly, crisis management has been taken up with Greece, and Greece is not out of the woods yet. There are still certain conditions that have to be met. Are you confident that this is all going to go through, that it will happen, and that Greece will cease to be a problem for the eurozone?</p><p>THORNING-SCHMIDT: I'm confident that the decision that the Greeks have to take will be taken. I'm very confident that the firewall that we build on will be sufficient for now. And these are important decisions. People tend to take these decisions lightly. They are very important decisions that shows the solidarity between the member states of the eurozone. They have been solidarity with the Greek people.</p><p>And I hope, now, that with this new firewall, the Greeks will have the opportunity to pass the law, so they have to pass, and get through to the other side.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HODSON: In terms of the debt crisis, Richard, I think of it as being three time horizons. Longer term, you've got the fiscal compact, which deals with the long-term credibility, deals with what might happen, 7 to 10 years out.</p><p>Meanwhile, short term, Greece, everyone is hoping, will be off the table relatively soon, although there has to be a bit of skepticism.</p><p>But in terms of the medium term, the G20, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Union ultimately hope to put together what would be an amazing $2 trillion firewall, a $2 trillion rescue fund.</p><p>Now, in order to do that, the European stability fund, stability mechanism, which comes in, the ESM, which comes in on the 1st of July as being the kind of prominent rescue fund for the European Union, needs to be boosted from its current level of 500 billion euros, just under $700 billion, to maybe something more like a trillion dollars.</p><p>The problem there is that the Germans are very reluctant to see that happen at the moment. But it looks as if they may be crumbling. If a Greek deal gets done, then they may very well put that together.</p><p>Certainly, I've been asking the European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, if he is confident that this deal, putting this firewall together, can be done.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSE MANUEL BARROSO, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: I'll not comment on precise figures, but I can tell you that I'm confident that during this month of March, there will be a positive reassessment of the need for more funds for the firewall, yes. I believe that it will happen.</p><p>At the same time, the European Union member states have been the biggest contributors to the IMF. I hope the IMF also recognizes this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HODSON: Well, let's hope that these three time horizons, if you like, can be dealt with, although there's a tremendous amount of work still to be done.</p><p>You're back with the big overarching problem which besets Europe, and that is the fact that households are being squeezed by higher unemployment, by higher taxes, by lower state benefits, higher inflation. And if the economy can be sorted out, then a lot of this will follow. But that, I think, is the greatest grounds for skepticism of all, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Charles Hodson, who is in Brussels for us tonight. Many thanks, Charles.</p><p>Europe cannot afford to make the same mistakes that happened with Maastricht, certainly when it comes to the implementation of this treaty. After all, not only did the European government put in things like a 3 percent deficit limit and a GDP-to-debt limit of 60 percent, many countries simply ignored it, and those that didn't ignore it got the rules changed, like France and Germany.</p><p>So, I spoke to Christian Schulz, the senior economist at Berenberg Bank, and I asked him, will this compact do the business?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTIAN SCHULZ, SENIOR ECONOMIST, BERENBERG BANK: Well, if it's good, then it builds confidence that the euro area, in the longer term, will be a safe place to invest. This is what the program is supposed to do.</p><p>But to get there, we still have lots of work to do. Every country needs to comply with the rules, needs to cut the deficit, needs to reform itself and grow. So, there's a long way to go, but in the longer term, this should improve confidence in the euro area.</p><p>QUEST: Which part of this treaty is the important bit? Is it, for instance, the deficit limit of half a percentage point? Is it the coordination of economic policies? Is it the ability to take enforcement action? Which bit is going to really do the trick?</p><p>SCHULZ: I think the one thing this treaty improves is the enforcement of the rules that we've had before. The rules are stricter than before, but they're not really new. We've had these rules before. But what is new is, it's going to be implemented in national law. Either in the law or, even better, in the constitution. So it binds governments into these targets in the longer term.</p><p>QUEST: But the enforcement mechanism within this -- the czar, the fines, whatever -- is it in here?</p><p>SCHULZ: Well, this is where the veto of two countries to make this an EU treaty really hurts. If it had been an EU treaty, you could've had the European Court of Justice or other bodies of the EU really enforce it.</p><p>Now, we have to have -- we have a role for the European Court of Justice, but it's not as clean-cut as it would have been.</p><p>QUEST: So, what's the enforcement mechanism in this?</p><p>SCHULZ: Well, the enforcement mechanism is that within national law, you have automatic penalties, automatic stabilizers that would, if a country breaches the deficit target, for instance, would automatically lead to a correction of that, and therefore, lead to automatic national action. That's really what is new about this.</p><p>QUEST: Are you impressed with this treaty, or is it going to end up like the stability and growth pact? Nice language, will be broken by the big countries, and won't do the trick.</p><p>SCHULZ: Well, it is a bit different from what we've had before. It has the sanctions, but what is key is, it actually has the protection of the rescue fund with it. Only if you sign up for the treaty and if you comply with the rules, you will be rescued in case of a crisis. This really should be an incentive for governments to comply with it this time.</p><p>QUEST: We need to talk about the LTRO briefly. The most extraordinary amount of money was deposited last night at the ECB, more than $700 billion. We know where the money came from. It was landed -- lent out with the left and paid back with the right. When would you expect to see that LTRO money starting to flow?</p><p>SCHULZ: Well, this is really something that has to do with confidence and with growth building across the euro area. Only if banks see demand for credit, they will lend out money, and they will be very tough this time on checking whether the creditors really lent out to the right people.</p><p>So, this will take time. Only once the euro area as a whole returns to growth we will see considerable improvement in the credit conditions, as well.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: And indeed, something that I learned today, if you look at the ECB's website and you manage to mouse and cursor your way to where you see those numbers, the amount of money on overnight deposit does not actually apparently reflect where it is being spent.</p><p>That's more a product of the ECB's own balance sheet. You have to look even further and know something about the underlying spending before you get to that number. We'll get to that next week as part of our further discussion of economics. A bit much for a Friday night.</p><p>Some of the LTRO shine has worn off, as far as European markets are concerned. They were flat, and only the DAX and the CAC current finished up on the week overall. Commodity prices fell, energy stocks in London headed in the same direction.</p><p>There are some signs the big ECB loans are being put to good use, and you see that if you look at Spanish and Italian bonds, which are both below 5 percent, which is the reaction that Mario Draghi at the ECB had hoped, 4.9, 4.9 will be very welcome by those central banks.</p><p>Wall Street is yelping for joy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p><p>(NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE BELL RINGS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: There's a new tech IPO in town, and this one seems to be going rather well. We'll be in New York after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Now, it's used to hosting the reviews. Yelp.com has got rave reviews of its own. It's the latest big website to go public and, on day one, shares are up more than 60 percent. This is Yelp, a site combining social networking with local businesses. That is the European stock market.</p><p>The reviewers have raised more than $100 million. Shares were priced at $15 each. Now, they're closer to $25 a share.</p><p>Shares in -- well, my word. A bit of indigestion there. Zynga are also up in New York. That's the New York market, which is showing down 14 points at the moment.</p><p>The online games company makes games like Farmville, and now it's building its own virtual community, zynga.com, away from its usual home of Facebook. Zynga shares are up more than 40 percent since the IPO showed just how much money it was making.</p><p>As for the Dow -- there. There we are. We have the right one at the right time. The Dow is down 13.5, $12,966. Doesn't look like $13,000 is going to be on our agenda for today.</p><p>Alison Kosik is in New York. I am embarrassed, Ms. Kosik. Well, yes, you may well find --</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You?</p><p>QUEST: I know, you may find this surprising, but I had to look up Yelp.</p><p>KOSIK: I am surprised.</p><p>QUEST: I had to look up Yelp to see what they did, let alone to know why they should have this meteoric rise.</p><p>KOSIK: You know what? You couldn't have put it in any better way. And you're not alone, Richard. I've talked with several traders out there today who were buying shares for their clients today and saying, \"You know what? I had to look up and figure out what Yelp did as well,\" because no one really understands what it does.</p><p>So, what it basically is is it gives reviews for services and businesses and restaurants in your local area here in the US, at least. So, let's say you go -- you want to go to a spa, you want to go to a restaurant, or use a business. Chances are, you may find it on Yelp, and you get sort of people giving their opinions and you can sort of figure out whether or not you want to go to that place.</p><p>OK. So, with that in mind, Yelp goes public today. Traders I talked to said, you know what? It was priced right. You know that, because look how much Yelp is spiking right now, 64 percent, shares are trading for $24.63.</p><p>OK, but here's the problem with Yelp, according to traders that I've talked about. They're calling what you're seeing just a lot of irrational exuberance because Yelp has yet to turn a profit and hasn't really said how it's going to in the future --</p><p>QUEST: Oi!</p><p>KOSIK: In fact, I've got to tell you. This -- to add to this, how do you like this? When Yelp went public back on the trading post behind me, where I'm stand -- where I'm sitting right now, one of the traders I talked to said he was sitting there or standing there, ready to buy in, right when the shares went public.</p><p>And he whispered to his buddy next to him saying, \"Why are we buying this? I'm so confused. How is this company going to make money?\" Richard?</p><p>QUEST: Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi! Ms. Kosik, I feel a bout of indigestion with the memory of the dot --</p><p>KOSIK: Oh, did you buy in this stock?</p><p>QUEST: No! No, no, no. I mean with the dot-com --</p><p>KOSIK: Oh.</p><p>QUEST: -- bubble of the 1990s that we saw these companies that had no revenues, that were on so-called path to profitability that nobody knew what they did, that they were selling dog food at cheaper -- more expensive than they could buy it or whatever.</p><p>I mean, their models were pathetic. Are we seeing a repeat of this with what we're now looking at?</p><p>KOSIK: You know what? It's kind of -- when you compare it to the 90s, I know what you're talking about, the big tech bubble. It's hard to call what's happening now a bubble, because if you look at the way these stocks have performed, most of them are just slightly above or below their IPO prices.</p><p>Angie's List is probably Yelp's closest publicly traded competitor. It's trading slightly below the IPO price. Groupon is down 5 percent year- to-date and 25 percent since the debut. Groupon, of course, reported that fourth quarter loss recently that was a big disappointment.</p><p>Linkedin is on a roll. It's up 35 percent year-to-date. But that has it trading just a few dollars -- about the IPO price. That one maybe had a lot of hype on IPO day.</p><p>But you know what? I think you're not really seeing the same level of excitement from the dot-com bubble of the 90s compared to now. And you know what, Richard? It's probably a good thing, because maybe investors learned a lesson from the 90s.</p><p>QUEST: Probably a good thing for my indigestion as well. All right, Alison Kosik, have a lovely weekend.</p><p>KOSIK: Perhaps.</p><p>QUEST: See you next week.</p><p>Talking of indigestion and things, from luxury to emergency. It's been a tough couple of months for Costa Cruises. In fact, we ask the question, what happens to the total cruise industry? After all, when one ship suffers, is everyone left at sea?</p><p>QUEST: Technicians are investigating the cause of the fire which crippled the Costa Allegra cruise ship. A thousand people were onboard when it cast adrift in the Indian Ocean for four days. It's part of the same fleet of the Costa Concordia. That's the ship, you'll remember, capsized off the coast of Italy, killing at least 21 people.</p><p>When the Allegra finally made it to the Seychelles on Thursday, CNN's Senior International Correspondent Dan Rivers asked passengers to describe their ordeal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAN RIVERS, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Emerging from the sweltering haze of the tropics, the Costa Allegra was towed into the Seychelles by a French fishing trawler, a rather ignominious end to what should have been a luxury cruise.</p><p>But for the last three days, life aboard has been anything but luxurious. Passengers forced to camp on deck after a fire knocked out all power. Helicopters had to drop food.</p><p>But for American couple Gordon and Eleanor Bradwell, the whole experience was summed up in one word.</p><p>GORDON BRADWELL, PASSENGER: Unpleasant, obviously, because we did not have sewage, we did not have showers, no access to water, fresh fruit, food. We ate cold sandwiches for four days. The intense heat was a problem.</p><p>RIVERS (on camera): After three days with no electricity, limited food and water, the passengers are now finally ashore, some of them describing their time onboard as horrific.</p><p>DAVID TINSON, PASSENGER: It's complete incompetence disguised by very, very good luck. That's what's happened. And that's the only reason why there's lots and lots of people still walking around with us now.</p><p>MARI ANNE THON, PASSENGER: When we were up on the deck, and it was extremely black smoke, and so we knew something was going to happen. So -- excuse me. They sound the alarm. So, then we went out to our room to get our life jackets.</p><p>RIVERS: Are you happy to be ashore? How do you feel now?</p><p>ALENA DAME, PASSENGER: Yes, yes. A little bit emotional, because I prefer to go home. I am not in the mood to stay on holiday.</p><p>RIVERS (voice-over): But two thirds of the passengers are taking up Costa's offer of a free holiday on the Seychelles and a refund with a cash payment.</p><p>Costa Cruises is already facing a class action after another of its ships, the Costa Concordia, went aground in Italy in January, leaving at least 21 dead. They must be hoping this latest incident won't also result in litigation.</p><p>RIVERS (on camera): It's been a pretty bad start to 2012 for Costa. Can your brand recover?</p><p>NORBERT STIEKEMA, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, COSTA CRUISES: I am absolutely sure. I think the Costs Concordia was clearly an incident -- a human error. With the Costa Allegra, there's a technical incident, and I think here we had the opportunity to show basically that we're watching out in case of an emergency like that how we handle it.</p><p>RIVERS (voice-over): But it's all prompted more questions. How did the fire start? Why did a backup generator fail? And was poor maintenance rather than human error to blame this time?</p><p>Dan Rivers, CNN, on the Seychelles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: So, first the Concordia and, now, the Allegra. I turned to Simon Calder, who's the travel editor of \"The Independent\" newspaper. One of the best in the business, he is. And I asked whether he thinks the wider cruise industry could now be hit badly by Costa's problems.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SIMON CALDER, TRAVEL EDITOR, \"THE INDEPENDENT\": What the problem is for Costa Cruises in particular and the wider cruise industry in general is the way that these things have come about just six weeks apart.</p><p>The incident most recently for the Costa Allegra is actually nothing unusual. It happens several times every year that there's a power problem, might be caused by a fire. No one hurt. Very uncomfortable three days, of course, for the passengers and crew. But they'll be well compensated for it.</p><p>The big problem is that for Costa Cruises, the image of the company, I'm afraid, is still that stricken ship, the Costa Concordia, and the public face of the company is still Captain Schettino.</p><p>QUEST: Right. So, Costa is to one side in that respect. But what about the industry overall? Are you seeing prices of cruises falling dramatically? Is this the time to get a bargain?</p><p>CALDER: Well, it most certainly is. Now, if you talk to the individual cruise lines, they mostly say, \"Yes, we had a few problems immediately after the Costa Concordia event, but bookings have now returned.\"</p><p>I'm not absolutely sure that they're anything like on the trend they need to be to fill these berths. Remember that the cruise industry isn't like the airline business or the car rental or the hotel trade. It requires a 100 percent load factor. It has to get people on all those berths on all those sailings of all those ships. And the only way to do that is, of course, to discount.</p><p>So, typically, you would find that one person per night on a cruise ship costs around $150. I've seen prices below $100 for top quality ships in places that you will want to be.</p><p>QUEST: OK, so would you expect, then, the cruise industry to go on a PR offensive now? Because discounting will only go so far. But at the same time, we know from our experience, Simon, that memories are short.</p><p>CALDER: We do. But unfortunately, they keep happening for Costa Cruises --</p><p>QUEST: Oh!</p><p>CALDER: -- tomorrow, the pretrial hearing begins in Italy of Captain Schettino. That's going to put Costa Concordia back in the headlines just as Costa Allegra has finished.</p><p>The problem for the cruise industry isn't the majority of very sophisticated regular cruisers who know just how safe the industry is, and they know that this is just a one-off. It's for the new people. People who were considering a cruise who may now say, thanks very much, I'll stay on dry land.</p><p>QUEST: I know you like a bargain. You're the man who pays his own way. So, are you -- where are you looking to get a -- ?</p><p>CALDER: Already booked it. Eastern Mediterranean, I sail a month today.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: I might have known Simon Calder would not miss the opportunity to take advantage of a bargain. And where Simon's going, the rest of us probably should follow.</p><p>Oil prices up 16 percent this year. Analysts are talking about the new Greece.</p><p>(RINGS BELL)</p><p>QUEST: In a moment.</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest.</p><p>More QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment.</p><p>This is CNN. And on this network, it is the news which always comes first.</p><p>An amateur video from Syria is said to show a protest in Homs in support of Baba Amr, the neighborhood nearby, where the Syrian Army is still not allowing aid in. Activists report Syrian troops are rounding up men and boys described of fighting age, some as young as 12.</p><p>Iran's supreme leader was one of the first voters to cast a ballot in Friday's parliamentary elections. Some 3,400 conservative candidates are competing for 290 seats. They were all pre-approved by Iran's Guardian Council and the first result is expected on Sunday.</p><p>In Brussels, 25 of the EU's member countries have signed a treaty on financial stability aimed at putting a cap of overspending by member nations. Only the U.K. and the Czech Republic opted out of the pact.</p><p>A new round of tornadoes and damaging storms is now pummeling the south-central United States. The states of Alabama and Tennessee have been hit. Today's outbreak and two -- one two days ago have been unusually powerful and they came around two months earlier than normal.</p><p>As one crisis comes to an end, just another one seems to begin. And this time, it is oil. Brent crude is up 16 percent this year. And some analysts say it won't be long before it hits $150 a barrel.</p><p>Join me at the super screen and you can see Brent over the fierce supply and demand. If we begin with the supply issue, this is when the EU banned Iran's oil imports. And that pretty much is the starting point, if you like, of the process.</p><p>We then get this sharp, sharp run-up in prices over fear -- and that's again Iran, this time when it announces it's stepping up uranium enrichment. But more than that, we get a bit of a wobble. It goes down a bit. And this one is interesting because the downward trend is demand. If prices are going up, as they have been, does that demand destroy, of course, economic growth and cause -- bring that into you know?</p><p>And so we go back up and we tootle around. Some economists, like HSBC's Stephen King, are now suggesting in a report out just today that oil is the new problem that markets should be focusing on. It appears now Greece is under control.</p><p>John Netto is the founder and president of M3 Capital.</p><p>He joins me from the NYMEX in New York.</p><p>I've read at least three analysts' economic report today, all saying that what we are seeing with the price of crude, is the new serious problem for the markets and for economies.</p><p>Do you subscribe to that?</p><p>JOHN NETTO, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, M3 CAPITAL: I do. If you look at history over the last 35 years, we've seen that crude has been a great harbinger, or at least an oil shock has been a great harbinger of a forthcoming or pending recession.</p><p>And I think when you look at the price action in this market, Richard, that, oxymoronically, the -- the market is anticipating an oil price shock.</p><p>QUEST: So, what -- you say that, though, but what's driving that shock?</p><p>Is it the issue with Iran and the Straits of Hormuz or -- or whatever it might be with Iran?</p><p>Where is that shock coming from?</p><p>NETTO: Well, a couple of fronts. The Straits of Hormuz is obviously a key chokepoint when it comes to the shipping of -- of Brent out of that area. Also looking at a number of the potential issues with -- with Israel, issues there. We saw President Obama this morning come out in an interview with \"The Atlantic,\" talk about a surprise attack was, was out of the cards and just off of a geopolitical risk how -- how crude pulled back off of that...</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>NETTO: -- and how WTI pulled off of that.</p><p>But net-net, though, if you look at the WTI-Brent spread, Brent continues to outperform. And that's a reflection of this concern.</p><p>QUEST: OK, at what point -- and I've seen various numbers about an increase in whether it's Brent or WTI and how much that knocks off GDP. There's all sorts of formulae -- formula that we can use.</p><p>But, John, where do you believe, at what price does the price per barrel become a danger to growth?</p><p>NETTO: Oh, the $138 to $140 level. We closed today at $124. It's interesting, because there are a couple of factors that we, as energy traders, want to look at, Richard. These markets have become amazingly coupled in a lot of ways. And that whole risk on dynamic has benefited crude over the last three years. It's benefited Brent over the last three years. And when we look at Brent near all -- near multi-year highs and we look at the S&amp;P near multi-year highs, that may not be intuitive to a lot of people, but it does reflect a longer-term perspective...</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>NETTO: -- for the two can coexist as long as the increase in Brent isn't too far and too fast.</p><p>QUEST: We'll talk more about this in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Good to have you on the program for the first time.</p><p>NETTO: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: And we'll certainly have you back again.</p><p>John, many thanks, indeed.</p><p>John joining me from New York.</p><p>It is a fairly appalling time in the United States when it comes to to the weather, these tornadoes and storms.</p><p>Jenny Harrison is at the World Weather Center.</p><p>Good evening.</p><p>JENNY HARRISON, ATS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, Richard, another very bad day. Not a good end to the week at all. And by no means have we seen the worst of the weather so far this Friday across the United States.</p><p>This is where all the warnings are in place now. These are the watches I'm showing you here. The red boxes are the tornadoes, the yellow indicating severe thunderstorms.</p><p>And I'm just going to actually switch across to a different computer so that I can actually show you. You can see here, this is a zoomed in view of literally one line of thunderstorms within that mass that you saw. These warnings, these red boxes, these are tornado watch -- these are warnings. These are tornado warnings.</p><p>So this is where a tornado has already been spotted on the ground. And this is warning this particular neighborhood that there is very likely a tornado on its way.</p><p>So right now here, we could well be hearing the tornado sirens, if they're actually operating. And then you can also see, look at the hail. You can actually see much more information. I've obviously got the strength of the winds, as well. But also, look at this hail, one point -- I can't read it -- 1.62 inches, I think it says. So that's hail getting on to three-and-a-half centimeters. You can see there, 1.4 inches.</p><p>So we've got the damaging hail, we've got the strong winds, tornado watches that are also in place. And, as I say, all of that is continuing to work its way eastwards.</p><p>Now, so far, these are the reports we've had through. And the numbers do keep fluctuating. In fact, right now, there are 17 reports of tornadoes. They are preliminary reports and very often it's one tornado that's touched down in various places. Alabama, Northern Alabama, there has been reports of damage up there because of a tornado, a suspected tornado.</p><p>But this is, I think, again, probably the most shocking aspect, at the moment, of these storms, is because the area that these storms are working their way through is so very, very vast. This whole area here is the size of Spain, France and Germany combined. Seventy-five million people actually live here. And right in the center, about four million people are actually at high risk. And it's very rare, certainly this early in the season, to have any areas under high risk. But that is the -- the concerns for this particular day. It's going to get worse, Richard. The heat of the day is going to continue to rise the next two to three hours. And that is when we're going to see the more really strong thunderstorms in the exact same area that we saw the thunderstorms and the damage with the tornadoes on Wednesday, literally just not even really two days ago.</p><p>QUEST: Jenny, serious stuff.</p><p>Thank you for that.</p><p>We appreciate it.</p><p>Jenny Harrison is at the World Weather Center.</p><p>In a moment, Barcelona and those mobile phones.</p><p>QUEST: Cisco says there will be more mobile Internet devices on the planet than people by the end of this year. So it's about time they started taking care of us.</p><p>This year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona is all about connected living, as Jim Boulden explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We anticipate there will be about 24 billion connected devices in our lives by 2020. So everything is going to be connected. Every electronic device you can think of is going to be connected by mobile. And you'll be able to control it really effectively to enhance your life.</p><p>JIM BOULDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So give me some examples.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So why don't we open the door?</p><p>BOULDEN: OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So I have a door lock module here. If I pick up the door lock, you can see the door is locked. If I hit the unlock button, that will open the door for us, you see?</p><p>And in we go.</p><p>BOULDEN: So this is the living room, I take it, the connected living room?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're in the connected living room.</p><p>BOULDEN: OK. I can think here, of course, you think of TVs, you think of stereo systems, technologies that are around now.</p><p>But what more?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, how about a fire?</p><p>BOULDEN: A fire, OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right behind you.</p><p>BOULDEN: All right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's turn the fire on.</p><p>BOULDEN: OK. So I can light the fire. I can unlock the door. I can pull up my shades. But I can also do that without that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.</p><p>BOULDEN: Why do I need that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think this is just an example of the sort of things we're seeing today, Jim, as we talk about, you know, 20 billion connected devices...</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's going to change everything in your lives, whether it's your health care, your smart metering, your utilities in your house, your car.</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're going to be connected and we're going to enhance all of those applications going forward.</p><p>BOULDEN: I think the smart metering is very interesting and a way for people to cut their energy costs. And something like that would actually work...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>BOULDEN: -- and help cut...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>BOULDEN: -- the sun coming in or the cold going out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So this is a great example, Jim. This is the Zephyr BioHarness fitted to our appellate (ph). And what essentially is happening, that information is being transmitted over the wireless network. And you can see the results in terms of heart rate and vital signs here.</p><p>It's kind of a -- a simple example to show you. But I think the, you know, the -- the example really holds in health applications where doctors, through a remote from patients, can do this kind of monitoring.</p><p>BOULDEN: And we keep hearing, especially in the developing world, where people are not going to have a doctor in every village, but as they become more wealthy and they use their mobile devices...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>BOULDEN: -- connecting to the doctor -- connecting to a health...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>BOULDEN: -- official is the important...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>BOULDEN: -- future for those apps.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, exactly. Things like mobile stethoscopes for people who just cannot go for a physical.</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They can look, they can check and you can get the quality you need over the mobile network.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, this is a nice end to the tour.</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So what I've got here, Jim, is actually a -- a social web of things. So, actually...</p><p>BOULDEN: Of things?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of things. So these connected things that we have talked about are my friends in the social web.</p><p>BOULDEN: Ah.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So for instance, you can see here, my lights are talking to me. They're actually saying, you're not here and I'm on, should I turn the lights off?</p><p>I'll say yes, turn the lights off for me, please.</p><p>Having done that, it says, OK, cool. It asks me, do I want to see for myself, to see that they have actually turned the lights off.</p><p>BOULDEN: So is that a count -- a camera?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So we have a camera also connected.</p><p>BOULDEN: Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So it's going to show me a stream and I can now see that my lights are, indeed, on.</p><p>BOULDEN: Sure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because there's the light in the corner and it's not on.</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes. So connected homes, connected automobiles, connected health care, that's what they've been talking about here in Barcelona this week. The experts say some 24 billion devices will be connected by 2020, worth trillions of dollars in business. And all from the palm of your hand.</p><p>Jim Boulden, CNN, Barcelona.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST: To paraphrase the old saying, we're turning into a group of people who know the connectivity of everything and the communication of nothing.</p><p>That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for this week.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest.</p><p>Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.</p><p>MARKETPLACE AFRICA is next.</p><p>ROBYN CURNOW, HOST: You're watching MARKETPLACE AFRICA.</p><p>I'm Robyn Curnow in Johannesburg.</p><p>This week, we look at the trade of a drug from East Africa that some believe has links to terrorism and an industrial dispute in South Africa that has led to a rise in global platinum prices.</p><p>Now, most of the world's platinum is found here, in Southern Africa. The world's second largest platinum producer is Impala Platinum, but a labor dispute has forced the company to dismiss 17,000 workers after an illegal strike. Four people were killed and at least 50 people were hurt in violent protests and attacks on employers who continued to go to work.</p><p>The strike began when 5,000 rock drill operators walked out in January when they did not get a pay increase. When other workers got involved, work at the mine ground to a halt and the dispute has cost the company an estimated $267 million in lost revenue. It also caused global platinum prices to rise.</p><p>This week, Julius Malema, the expelled ANC youth leader, visited the workers and after weeks of protests, the country's main union and the ANC government has urged the miners to return to work.</p><p>JULIUS MALEMA, ANC: You must remember to fight for your rights every time. But you must also remember, at government we don't want to (INAUDIBLE). We want to (INAUDIBLE) in employment supporting your families and yourselves.</p><p>CURNOW: This comes as the company is also being criticized by the Zimbabwean government for not handing over a 51 percent stake of its mining operation in Zimbabwe. So far, Amplats has only handed over 25 percent and offered 30 percent in equity.</p><p>Now, under Zimbabwe's Indigenization Law, multinational companies are forced to give up a majority stake to local black Zimbabweans.</p><p>Well, I recently sat down with Neville Francis Nicolau.</p><p>Now, he's the CEO of the world's largest platinum producer, Anglo American Platinum.</p><p>And I asked him how this indigenization policy was impacting his company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: In terms of making money, in terms of strategic visions, all of that, in Zimbabwe, how do you -- how do you work in that kind of environment?</p><p>NEVILLE FRANCIS NICOLAU, CEO, ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM: Well, Zimbabwe is the only other major geology that -- that has platinum. Operating in Zimbabwe does have its challenges. It -- it's -- it's not like many other countries. But this is a country that's in transition and development.</p><p>So we work with the government and while we are welcome guests, we are happy to -- to produce good quality platinum.</p><p>CURNOW: But you've signed off on this sort of Indigenization Law.</p><p>NICOLAU: Oh, it's a process. So, you know, we've signed off on aspects of it. And we've made very good progress. And so far, so good.</p><p>I have no reason to believe that we will not conclude our -- our discussions positively.</p><p>CURNOW: In terms of being asked to do something like this indigenization process, which is effectively hand over half of your assets on the ground to a local black Zimbabwean, why do that?</p><p>NICOLAU: It's not a matter of giving away half of the company. These are -- even if they are facilitated deals, there is a normal commercial deal that takes place. But the transformation is very important, to get to a point where all Zimbabweans can compete as Zimbabweans.</p><p>CURNOW: How do you ensure that this transformation is -- is stuck to, that this is not some sort of political grab, that that j that those assets go to the right people?</p><p>NICOLAU: Well, the -- we -- we have quite a lot of say in terms of who we sell these assets to. The -- a lot of the -- a lot of those discussions are -- are public and -- and stock exchange company type of discussions. And so far, we have no real reason to believe that we are doing anything that is for a political purpose.</p><p>You know, we're doing it because those are the rules of the country that we operate in and we -- we operate accordingly.</p><p>CURNOW: And you've really had no choice, have you?</p><p>NICOLAU: Well, you can always sell up the whole of the assets and you -- and you can leave.</p><p>CURNOW: And leave?</p><p>NICOLAU: We don't think that that would be a great idea. Of course, we make profit, is that is the primary purpose of business. But for us to leave would leave people without the -- the capacity to be able to develop the mines and to improve the lives of the people around the mines.</p><p>Two thousand employees, very often you can multiply that by five to the number of people that -- that you are benefiting. And then, of course, we have all of the supply companies and people that manufacture stuff.</p><p>So there are a huge number of people directly on the ground that actually are benefiting from us being there. And we're happy to participate like that.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: Neville Francis Nicolau there.</p><p>He is the CEO of Anglo American Platinum.</p><p>Well, from platinum to plants, we take a look at how a ban on a major East African shrub is affecting the livelihoods of Kenyan farmers through (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CURNOW: For hundreds of years, the drug of choice in East Africa has been a plant called khat. When chewed, it gives off a kind of mellow high that many find addictive.</p><p>Well, the trade is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact, many communities in Kenya are entirely dependent on this crop.</p><p>Well, khat has been banned in the U.S. and Canada and some European countries for health reasons.</p><p>But as David McKenzie now reports, many believe the ban was introduced because fear there is a link between the trade and terrorism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Edward Mutuura's Kenyan farm produces a key ingredient in many Somalia social gatherings across the world. He grows khat, a tree whose shoots and leaves, when chewed, produce a feeling of euphoria.</p><p>Every homestead in this part of Kenya seems to have at least one khat tree. And the whole region depends on khat for their economic survival.</p><p>But in January, the Dutch government announced a ban of all khat imports, citing health issues.</p><p>Mutuura says that the majority of their crop goes to the Netherlands, which has a vibrant Somalia community and is a key hub to other European countries.</p><p>EDWARD MUTUURA, FARMER: If the ban is -- is accepted or it is -- it is enforced, the whole Meru County, the whole Meru County, the economy of the whole Meru County will be crippled. The economy of this one of our population here, where khat is grown, will be totally crippled and the people have no source of income.</p><p>MCKENZIE: Many analysts believe that the Dutch ban has nothing to do with health concerns, but everything to do with terrorism.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have businesses which terror organizations may not be running, but which end up benefiting these organizations.</p><p>EMMANUEL KISIANGANI, INSTITUTE OF SECURITY STUDIES: So ultimately, the contributors are doing this in good faith, but the end result is that you have people who have brung what is along in between, who take these resources, this money, and channel it to terror organizations.</p><p>MCKENZIE: The group in question is Somalia-based Al Shabab, an Islamic militant group affiliated with al Qaeda. For years, Al Shabab has been battling the weak transitional government and a recent U.N. report says that Al Shabab, a designated terrorist group in the U.S. and U.K., gets funds by taxing the khat exported to Somalia.</p><p>Analysts believe that the khat trade in Europe may be following a similar pattern. They believe that some of the businessmen in Europe who act as middlemen to exporters and farmers, could be funding Al Shabab.</p><p>(on camera): Khat in Kenya is perfectly legal and it's widely available. This bundle costs around $20 US. But it's impossible to know exactly how much the export industry earns each year. One government official told us it's as much as $100 million per year.</p><p>But this industry is highly unregulated because of the stigma surrounding this crop, so it's impossible to have a fail-safe buffer between the industry and terror groups.</p><p>(voice-over): On the consumer side, khat has very little to do with terror. For centuries, it has been chewed for its stimulating properties. It's a cultural and social activity in many communities in the Horn of Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p><p>In Europe, khat is mainly chewed by the Somalia diaspora, even though it's illegal in several countries.</p><p>That demand has opened up a vibrant industry in fertile parts of Kenya.</p><p>Everything about khat involves speed, because it spoils in one to three days. Khat is sorted, wrapped in banana leaves, haggled over by transporters and rushed to the capital, Nairobi, and out of the country.</p><p>The farmers, who are separated from the end-user and any regulation further down the chain, are bewildered by the Dutch ban.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are legitimate businesses whose end product may end up in the hands of Al Shabab. Yet if governments resort to banning these businesses, then it hurts the ultimate owners of these businesses. I think it is a tricky situation. It's a precarious balancing act that somehow, perhaps, we need to think -- or, rather, governments need to think of mechanisms that ensure that these legitimate businesses don't end up benefiting these terrorist organizations.</p><p>MCKENZIE: But the perceived threat of khat could kill off this region's economic future.</p><p>MUTUURA: Khat farming is -- is -- is the heart of the economy of this place. And the occasion, we cannot educate our children without khat. If we don't have khat to sell, it means that our economy is grounded.</p><p>MCKENZIE: The Kenyan government says it is in talks with the Dutch to reverse the ban on khat. The farmers here hope that those talks bear fruit.</p><p>MUTUURA: This is only what we know in our life. Nothing more.</p><p>MCKENZIE: Or their livelihood will be plucked away.</p><p>David McKenzie, CNN, Kenya.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: This week marks our hundredth show.

From Jan. 1, 2004, to Jan. 1, 2010, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/2018-10-02/why-investors-love-the-s-p-500\">S&amp;P 500</url> generated an overall return of just 0.29%. From that point forward, the next decade of investing was defined by a booming U.S. economy, a bull market and few interruptions along the way. Through thick and thin, the stock market marched steadily higher to new all-time highs, and the S&amp;P 500 is up 180% in the past 10 years. Here are 25 of the biggest developments that changed investing in the 2010s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Flash crash of 2010</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unlike the market crash in 2007 and 2008, the flash crash of 2010 was over in a matter of minutes. On May 6, 2010, at about 2:32 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 998.5 points (about 9%) in roughly 36 minutes. The market quickly recovered most of its roughly $1 trillion in losses. Subsequent investigations found that illegal \"spoof\" trading was partially to blame for the crash. The crash prompted the creation of new market \"circuit breakers\" to temporarily halt trading in stocks that gain or lose 10% within five minutes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Longest bull market in history</emphasis></p><p>The defining story of the 2010s on Wall Street is the fact that the 2010s started and ended in <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2019-11-29/decade-in-review-2010s-was-the-decade-of-the-bull\">one long bull market</url>. The S&amp;P 500 bottomed on March 9, 2009, and the bull market celebrated its 10-year anniversary in early 2019. The bull market finished the 2010s at 129 months in duration and counting, outlasting the bull market of the 1990s by 16 months. The current bull market is now the longest one in history, and the S&amp;P 500 has gained 361% since it began. The S&amp;P gained 417% during the 1990s bull market.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Debt ceiling crisis of 2011</emphasis></p><p>Up to 2011, the U.S. government had always raised the debt ceiling in a bipartisan manner so the country could continue to meet its financial obligations without interruption. However, this time the Republican-controlled House of Representatives demanded spending concessions from President Barack Obama before they would agree to raise the debt ceiling. Negotiations came down to the wire before a last-minute deal was reached. The stock market experienced extreme selling pressure prior to the deal, and credit-rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's even downgraded its U.S. credit rating for the first time in history, dropping it from AAA to AA+.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The banking industry bounces back</emphasis></p><p>Several U.S. banks were deemed \"too big to fail\" to justify taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis. Yet despite a difficult environment of historically low interest rates and heightened regulations, the banking industry came roaring back. Over the past 10 years, the biggest U.S. banks got even bigger. Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (ticker: <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/wfc-wells-fargo-co\">WFC</url>) grew its total assets 56% to more than $1.9 trillion. Citigroup (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/c-citigroup-inc\">C</url>), Bank of America Corp. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/bac-bank-of-america-corp\">BAC</url>) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/jpm-jpmorgan-chase-co\">JPM</url>) each now have more than $2 trillion in total assets. The U.S. banking industry also reported a record $237 billion in 2018 profits.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook's IPO</emphasis></p><p>There were plenty of high-profile initial public offerings in the 2010s, but no IPO captured the attention of Wall Street quite like Facebook (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/fb-facebook-inc\">FB</url>). On May 18, 2012, Facebook priced its IPO shares at $38, raising more than $16 billion is what was the largest tech IPO in history at the time. Facebook got off to a rocky start in the market, initially dropping as low as $17.55 before finding its stride later in the year. Despite a string of controversies for the company, FB stock is now up nearly 420% from its IPO price.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The rise of passive investing</emphasis></p><p>Strong performance of major <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/funds/slideshows/index-funds-that-can-make-you-rich\">index funds</url> coupled with underperformance of money managers triggered a major shift toward passive investing. This long-term trend reached a major milestone in August 2019 when total U.S. index fund assets topped active equity fund assets for the first time. U.S. index-tracking equity funds now have more than $4.72 trillion in assets compared to $4.26 trillion managed by active stock-pickers. Through the first eight months of 2019, investors pulled another $124.1 billion from active funds and added $88.9 billion to passive funds, according to Morningstar.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Falling fees</emphasis></p><p>In 2010, Charles Schwab (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/schw-charles-schwab-corp\">SCHW</url>) cut its trading commissions for online stock and ETF trades from $12.95 to $8.95. Brokers then commenced a decade-long pricing war that finally reached its pinnacle in 2019 when many brokers, including E-Trade (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/etfc-etrade-financial-corp\">ETFC</url>), TD Ameritrade, Schwab, Fidelity and others ultimately eliminated standard trading commissions completely. But while zero-dollar commissions may seem like good news for investors, some critics argue that brokers cutting fees and relying more heavily on payment for order flow is a net negative for traders when it comes to getting the best execution prices on trades.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quantitative easing</emphasis></p><p>Things got so bad during the 2008 financial crisis that the Federal Reserve was forced to take unprecedented monetary policy measures to stimulate the economy. In addition to cutting its benchmark interest rate to essentially zero, the Fed also began a program of quantitative easing. From late 2008 through 2015, the Fed purchased trillions of dollars of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, expanding its balance sheet from $800 billion to $4.5 trillion. The combination of low interest rates and quantitative easing made it extremely cheap for U.S. companies to borrow money to invest in growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Social media</emphasis></p><p>In 2010, social media market share leaders included Facebook (517 million users), YouTube (480 million users) and MySpace (68 million users). By 2018, Facebook's user base had grown to 2.2 billion, YouTube's had reached 1.9 million, and Instagram and WeChat had a billion users each, according to Statista. Social media IPOs like Facebook, Twitter (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/twtr-twitter-inc\">TWTR</url>), Snap (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/snap-snap-inc\">SNAP</url>) and LinkedIn were popular investments in the past decade. Unfortunately, the dialogue surrounding social media stocks at the close of the decade has shifted to controlling platform abuse, regulating content policies and protecting user privacy and data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Big tech monopolies</emphasis></p><p>The last time the U.S. Justice Department brought an antitrust lawsuit against a tech company was in 1999 when it sued Microsoft Corp. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/msft-microsoft-corp\">MSFT</url>). However, 20 years later, several of the largest U.S. tech companies are facing increasingly intense scrutiny due to their dominance in their respective industries. In July 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported U.S. Attorney General William Barr is spearheading a broad antitrust review of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">tech stocks</url>, including Facebook, Alphabet (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/goog-alphabet-inc\">GOOG</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/googl-alphabet-inc\">GOOGL</url>), Amazon.com (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/amzn-amazoncom-inc\">AMZN</url>) and Apple (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/aapl-apple-inc\">AAPL</url>). The four tech stocks have a combined market capitalization of more than $3.5 trillion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oil prices collapse</emphasis></p><p>West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices traded between $75 per barrel and $115 per barrel for most of the first half of the 2010s. The prolonged period of high prices triggered a boom in U.S. fracking technology and shale oil production. By 2014, the U.S. was producing nearly twice as much oil as it was in 2008, leading to a severe supply glut. WTI prices subsequently plummeted as low as $26.05 per barrel in 2016. Many oil stocks struggled in the second half of the decade, and WTI prices have yet to make it back to $80.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESG investing</emphasis></p><p>ESG is an acronym that stands for environmental, social and governance and represents a style of socially responsible investing that is as much about sustainability as it is about market returns. ESG investing has been around for decades, but inflows into ESG funds exploded in the 2010s. There are now more than 350 different U.S. ESG funds, according to Vanguard. From 2009 to 2019, total assets in those ESG funds more than doubled from under $40 billion to nearly $90 billion. The rise of ESG investing has begun forcing companies to focus on sustainability in addition to profits.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Major legislative changes</emphasis></p><p>Washington played a prominent role on Wall Street in the past decade. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act placed strict rules on banks and other financial institutions in an attempt to better protect consumers in the wake of the financial crisis. The Obama administration's proposed fiduciary rule compelling retirement-focused financial advisors to act in their clients' best interests was struck down by courts in 2018. But perhaps the biggest piece of legislation impacting investors was the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cuts of 2017. The cuts helped boost U.S. corporate profits by 16.2% in 2018.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global interest rate pressures</emphasis></p><p>In addition to quantitative easing in the U.S., central banks around the world ventured into uncharted territory in the past decade by cutting interest rates to all-time lows. In fact, the European Central Bank and central banks of Japan, Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland cut their interest rates into negative territory, while Germany issued 30-year bonds with a zero yield for the first time. Extremely low global interest rates led to tensions between President Donald Trump and the Fed, with Trump repeatedly criticizing the Fed and calling for interest rates of \"zero or less.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cryptocurrency</emphasis></p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2008. But most American investors became aware of cryptocurrencies sometime in 2017 when bitcoin and hundreds of other digital currency prices soared. Investors praised the decentralized nature of <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/cryptocurrency/slideshows/8-things-to-know-before-investing-in-cryptocurrency\">cryptocurrencies</url> and the security of its underlying blockchain technology. Despite harsh criticism from regulators and prominent investors like Warren Buffett, the price of bitcoin skyrocketed from under $800 in late 2016 to an all-time high of $19,783 in December 2017. The crypto bubble burst in early 2018, but bitcoin still finished the decade with a global market capitalization of more than $140 billion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fintech</emphasis></p><p>Cryptocurrencies are just one example of financial technology that has emerged in the past decade to completely change the way Americans bank, invest and manage their finances. The emergence of trading apps like Robinhood, mobile payment apps like Venmo and money management apps like You Need A Budget now provide unprecedented banking services from the convenience of a smartphone. On Wall Street, artificial intelligence and advanced high-frequency trading algorithms have become a central part of investment banking. Crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending apps like Kickstarter and LendingClub (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/lc-lendingclub-corp\">LC</url>) also became popular alternatives to traditional bank loans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robo advisors</emphasis></p><p>One of the most successful fintech innovations of the past decade has been robo advisors. Robo advisors and hybrid robo advisors are fully or partially automated financial advisors that utilize software to manage investments via algorithms and mathematics. Leading robo advisors Wealthfront and Betterment were both founded in 2008 and finished the 2010s with roughly $20 billion and $18 billion in assets under management, respectively. Robo advisors currently have more than $350 billion in AUM globally, according to Aite Group. The firm estimates the number of Americans using robo advising services will grow from 2 million in 2018 to 17 million by 2025.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dual-class shares</emphasis></p><p>One potentially troubling trend of the past decade on Wall Street has been a shift in voting power away from retail investors and toward company founders and insiders. An increasing number of newly-public companies are establishing dual-class stock structures with uneven distribution of voting rights. For example, Facebook's public Class A shares come with one vote per share, whereas its Class B shares owned by CEO Mark Zuckerberg come with 10 votes each. The percentage of newly-listed public companies with dual-class shares climbed from just 4% in 2009 to 17% by 2017, according to ISS Analytics.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Venture capital funding</emphasis></p><p>Venture capital investing involves private investors financing early-stage, potentially high-growth companies by taking equity stakes in them well prior to their IPOs. Due to the high failure rate of early-stage companies, venture capital investment is typically considered to be high risk. The combination of low interest rates and a stock market trading at all-time highs has led to a surge in venture capital funding in recent years. Venture capital fundraising grew from $17.9 billion in 2010 to $56.1 billion in 2018, its highest level since the dot-com bubble in 2000, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bond market rally</emphasis></p><p>The Fed funds interest rate was as high as 5.3% as recently as 2007, but rates never even touched 2.5% in the 2010s. Demand for low-risk debt is so high that investors are now buying bonds with sub-zero interest rates in hopes the bond rally continues. Yields on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds hit their lowest levels ever in 2019. From 1926 to 1980, long-term government bonds generated an average annual return of 3%, according to DFA. Since 1981, those bonds have generated a 9.6% annual return with no signs of slowing down.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yield curve inversion</emphasis></p><p>In mid-2019, investors got a warning sign that the beginning of the 2020s may look a lot different for investors than the 2010s. In August, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes dropped below the yield on two-year Treasury notes for the first time since 2007. This specific yield curve inversion occurred prior to each of the past nine U.S. recessions, according to the San Francisco Fed. The historically bearish indicator initially rattled markets, but the good news is that the yield curve reverted back to normal in early October and has remained so ever since.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trade war</emphasis></p><p>Since mid-2018, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2019-09-17/how-investors-can-win-in-the-china-trade-war\">trade war</url> between the U.S. and China has resulted in billions of dollars in mutual tariffs, countless Twitter threats and a global environment of economic uncertainty. Trump has repeatedly accused China of unfair trade practices and theft of intellectual property. In the past two years, the U.S. has imposed tariffs on $550 billion in Chinese products, while China has imposed retaliatory tariffs on $185 billion in U.S. goods. The trade war is projected to cost the average American household between $500 and $1,700 in 2020, according to PBS.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">China's devalued currency</emphasis></p><p>In August 2019, China allowed the value of the yuan to drop below 7 per U.S. dollar, its lowest level since 2008. China's decision to devalue its currency came in response to a new 10% U.S. trade war tariff imposed on $300 billion in Chinese goods. American companies typically buy Chinese goods in U.S. dollars, so devaluing the yuan relative to the dollar lowers the costs of importing Chinese goods to the U.S. and offsets the impact of tariffs by giving Chinese companies a pricing advantage. In response, Trump designated China a currency manipulator. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brexit</emphasis></p><p>In addition to the trade war, the other major source of economic geopolitical uncertainty in the 2010s has been Brexit. In June 2016, the U.K. shocked the world by voting to exit the European Union. Brexit created an extreme amount of economic uncertainty given all the potential customs changes, tariff adjustments, complicated trade deals and travel restrictions that could be involved in the transition. To make matters worse, the uncertainty has been compounded by Britain's inability to agree on a specific Brexit plan. The U.K. recently extended its Brexit deadline by three months to Jan. 31, 2020. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cannabis legalization</emphasis></p><p>One of the hottest investing trends on Wall Street in the closing years of the 2010s has been cannabis. U.S. investors got their first taste of cannabis in February 2018 when Cronos Group (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/cron-cronos-group-inc\">CRON</url>) became the first Canadian marijuana producer to list on a major U.S. exchange.

Back in 1996, when he and his wife lived in Beijing, they spent two months behind bars because of their work in the underground Protestant \"house church\" movement. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Friends warned they'd be jailed again soon. The couple hid out in the countryside, then escaped to the then-British colony of Hong Kong via Bangkok. Friends--and strangers--pulled strings so Fu's wife could give birth in a local hospital and the couple could gain asylum in the West. When they finally boarded a flight for America in June 1997, \"we knew what it meant to be rescued,\" recalls Fu, now based in Midland, Texas. \"What it meant to feel desperate.\" </p><p>Inspired by that experience, Fu now runs a nonprofit called ChinaAid. It works with thousands of volunteers in China to help victims of injustice. When blind dissident Chen Guangcheng escaped from house arrest and sought urgent refuge in the American Embassy in Beijing, Fu furiously worked his contacts in Washington, D.C., and the media to help Chen obtain a student visa for the U.S. And in \"extraordinary\" cases, says Fu, ChinaAid launches rescue missions to help persecuted Chinese escape through its own underground railroad, extractions whose methods have been informed by those who have come before--and which started in the wake of the June 4, 1989, massacre at Tiananmen Square. They are the progeny of \"Operation Yellowbird.\"</p><p>It was only last year--nearly 18 years after their escape--that Fu and his wife learned they had received crucial support in Hong Kong from a top man in the now legendary organization that called itself Yellowbird: an underground network of sympathizers shocked into action after Tiananmen Square. </p><p>Yellowbird used whatever tools it could muster to spirit dissidents out of the country. Gangsters lent smuggling boats. Cantopop stars donated concert proceeds. Hong Kong police handled disguises. An academic study by Shiu-Hing Lo said the CIA provided scrambler phones, night-vision gunsights and more.</p><p>By 1997, Yellowbird had helped rescue up to 500 Chinese activists, including 15 of the 21 Tiananmen protest leaders on Beijing's \"most wanted\" list. \"Though I never wanted to leave China, Yellowbird was very important,\" recalls New Jersey-based exile Wang Juntao, whom Beijing called a \"black hand,\" or mastermind, behind the 1989 protests. \"Without Hong Kong people's support, without global attention, without an escape plan, China's democracy movement would have suffered much, much greater losses.\"</p><p>Twenty-five years after the Tiananmen bloodletting, Yellowbird's legacy is a bright ray of light in China's still bleak political landscape. When I <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newsweek.com/still-wing-175592\">http://www.newsweek.com/still-wing-175592</url> first reported on Yellowbird in 1996 for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis>, organizers warned that many details had to remain secret to safeguard ongoing missions. (\"Nobody told me at the time that I owed thanks to something called Yellowbird,\" says Fu.) Now increasing numbers of organizers are going public with extraordinary tales of escapes from China that seem to have sprung from the pages of spy novels.</p><p>But the tales of Yellowbird's derring-do are not just a matter of history. The organization worked for years after 1989, and its most potent legacy extends very much to the present day. At minimum, it inspired successor networks--like Fu's--that operate safe havens and orchestrate safe exits for a variety of Chinese activists on the run. </p><p>The pressures that make people take flight keep mounting. Communist officials plan to demolish or forcibly remove crosses from 64 Protestant churches in Zhejiang province, says Fu. In May, Beijing kicked off an \"ultra-tough\" anti-terrorist campaign to suppress violence in largely Muslim Xinjiang province, wracked by the bloodiest attacks in years. Recently, 55 suspects were sentenced in a sports stadium packed with 7,000 spectators, a chilling scene evoking the excesses of Chairman Mao.</p><p>Tiananmen Anniversary Clampdown</p><p>The events of June 4, 1989, united an odd-bedfellows alliance of human rights activists and church workers, foreign diplomats and members of Hong Kong's notorious underworld gangs, the triads. \"That everyone, even the Mafia, helped Yellowbird shows just how unpopular, how morally off, the crackdown was,\" says Bao Pu, a Hong Kong publisher. (His father, Bao Tong, then a senior party Chinese Communist Party cadre sympathetic to the 1989 protesters, was the first person arrested in the crackdown.) \"No matter what you do for a living, nearly everyone knows between right and wrong.\"</p><p>But not quite everyone. To prepare for the 25th anniversary of Beijing's day of carnage, authorities tried harder than ever to suppress all public mention of June 4, a trauma that gripped the nation, nearly split the ruling Communist Party, and killed more than 1,000 protesters. Today, officialdom deems Tiananmen Square such a sensitive venue that in May a young factory worker visiting Beijing who posed in the square for a selfie--and flashed a \"V\" for victory sign with his fingers--was detained.</p><p>The Tiananmen anniversary triggers a security clampdown every year, usually beginning in mid-April. But this year, the campaign kicked off especially early. AIDS activist Hu Jia was placed under house arrest in February. Bao Tong, the former senior policy adviser and now a political prisoner who remains under a form of \"soft\" house arrest in Beijing, was told back in January not to talk to the media about June 4. Police have nabbed activists and scholars, an independent journalist and a Japanese paper's Chinese news assistant, an artist and a prominent lawyer, gay rights advocates and even Buddhists while they were meditating. \"Stability maintenance\" is the government's Orwellian catchphrase of the day.</p><p>The \"Mantis Stalks the Cicada\"</p><p>Many former protest leaders who mourned fallen comrades on June 4 may well owe their lives to Yellowbird. The network derives its name from an old Chinese proverb: \"The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the yellow bird behind.\" Its first rescue was a group of three students, including Li Lu, who later went to Columbia University and became a fund manager advising on China investments for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway company. </p><p>A Yellowbird organizer told me in 1996, \"I sent people to meet Li Lu, and he got into a car beside a uniformed policeman. He thought he was being arrested! I felt that was the safest way to transport him. If stopped [by the authorities], the cop would say Li was in his custody. Actually, he really was a genuine cop.''</p><p>Of all the great escapes, few match that of former student leader Wuer Kaixi. After June 4, seven friends smuggled him out of Beijing to the southern coast of Guangdong province. At one point, he was shut inside the stifling trunk of a car. </p><p>In May 1989, during an unusual televised meeting between student representatives and hardline Premier Li Peng, Wuer, who was on a hunger strike, appeared wearing a hospital gown and clutching an oxygen bag. He chided the premier for being late. Unsurprisingly, the talks fizzled. Li ended the dialogue with a brusque \"goodbye.\" </p><p>Wuer's insouciance in the Great Hall of the People and his impassioned speeches in the square were memorable. But they ended up making him No. 2 on Beijing's \"most wanted\" list after the army opened fire in Tiananmen on June 4.</p><p>Because many Guangdong residents regularly watched Hong Kong television, they easily recognized Wuer, so he couldn't move safely in public. A sympathizer rushed to Hong Kong with a Polaroid of him clutching the same day's newspaper with a handwritten plea: PLEASE SEND HELP. Hong Kong politician Szeto Wah, by then deeply involved in organizing a lifeline for Tiananmen fugitives, saw the photo. Yellowbird flew into action. </p><p>One mob boss bankrolled the mission. The first two rescue attempts were aborted. A third got under way when Wuer glimpsed infrared lights flashing in the darkness off a deserted beach. He and his then-girlfriend scrambled over sharp oyster beds to reach a sleek powerboat that zoomed the exhausted, bloodied fugitives to Hong Kong. French diplomat Jean-Pierre Montagne awaited their arrival, ready to whisk them to Paris with passports, tickets and visas.</p><p>Recently, Wuer--more mature now, with a son nearly 21, the same age he was a quarter-century ago--told me his escape had cost nearly $100,000 \"just for the speedboat ride alone. An underworld guy called Brother Six paid for it, I was told. So when I went to Hong Kong in 2004, I thanked him for saving my life.\"</p><p>Brother Six is another larger-than-life Hong Kong character: underworld figure, speedboat king, car smuggler extraordinaire. He nearly fainted when he saw images of the June 4 carnage on TV. Soon afterward, he met two wealthy Hong Kong executives in a Kowloon hotel to come up with a plan. </p><p>Brother Six and his team specialized in the transport and logistics for the rescues; they helped more than 100 protest-movement figures escape. The more famous those figures were, the more easily and quickly they were granted asylum--but the more it cost to get them out. \"Everything in Hong Kong,\" says one insider with a smile, \"is supply and demand.\"</p><p>Authorities began to suspect that Yellowbird was helping dissidents and organized sting operations to seize some of its members. When a friend told scholar and activist Wang Juntao that Yellowbird would help him escape, Wang said he didn't want to leave China. \"But my friend said, 'A meeting's been set up in Changsha. You should go and then decide to flee or not to flee,'\" Wang recalls. \"But when I arrived at the Changsha train station on November 20, I was immediately arrested.\" </p><p>It had been a Chinese police sting from the start. Wang and his colleague Chen Ziming were detained, and each was sentenced to 13 years. Two of Brother Six's men were also jailed. (Brother Six later negotiated with mainland authorities for the release of his men; in return, he agreed to stop smuggling out dissidents. Both Wang and Chen were released on parole in 1994.)</p><p>Mystery still cloaks just how deeply Yellowbird reached inside the mainland bureaucracy. Stories are now emerging about relatives of high-ranking cadres (who must remain anonymous for now) helping activists escape. \"People inside the system, senior party officials or their family members, helped smuggle people out. I know that about a dozen were imprisoned, some for more than a decade,\" says Bao Pu, the Hong Kong publisher. \"Recently, I met the wealthy son of a general, from the so-called red second generation [the sons of Red Army members who fought alongside Mao during the revolution], who spent three years behind bars. Nobody knows how much people like these suffered.\"</p><p>Publicly, the regime hasn't wavered from its hard line regarding Tiananmen, deeming it a \"counter-revolutionary rebellion.\" And as the years have passed, Yellowbird's room to maneuver became increasingly cramped. Fugitives from June 4 kept trickling into Hong Kong into the '90s. But a problem loomed. The British-administered enclave was due to revert to Chinese control on July 1, 1997. That meant escapees would have a hard time obtaining asylum (or even landing in Hong Kong) after the handover. (France had been especially welcoming; its consulate issued papers to activists without waiting for approval from Paris.)</p><p>Meanwhile, by 1996 the most high-profile heroes of Tiananmen Square either had been jailed or had escaped. That left about 80 escapees who were less famous, less sophisticated and less articulate when they tried to persuade foreign governments they were fleeing repression.</p><p>Bob Fu, who had landed in Hong Kong in the autumn of 1996 with his pregnant wife, was among them. He was not famous--\"a small potato,\" in his words. The couple faced an uphill asylum battle. In 1989, he had led students from his university in Shandong, a coastal province south of Beijing, to join the protests in Tiananmen. Afterward, he had to write confessions but avoided jail time. </p><p>After converting to Christianity, he and his wife opened an independent Bible study class in Beijing and became active in a so-called house church congregation. (In these communities, Chinese Christians hold underground services in private homes to escape the control of state-sanctioned church authorities.) After the couple were briefly detained in 1996, Fu's wife became pregnant in violation of Beijing's strict one-child-only family planning regulations.</p><p>Fearing another detention, they ran and hid. \"Then,\" Fu recalls, \"a sort of miracle happened.\" An Australian missionary friend put them in touch with a Beijing travel agency. They said they wanted to join a Southeast Asian tour. An agent got them passports based on fake employment letters from a big tech company. Inserted into a 20-person Chinese tour group headed for Bangkok and Hong Kong, the couple ditched the others after arriving in the British colony.</p><p>In Hong Kong they encountered a mountain of red tape--and a climate that had already begun to change as the historic handover from Britain to China approached. \"Week after week, we phoned one consulate after another in Hong Kong asking for help,\" Fu recalled. \"'No, no, no' came the answer. Few foreign diplomats even knew what a house church was, so we had to explain everything from the beginning. It was tense.\"</p><p>If the green light didn't come before the handover, Fu would be trapped, a man without a country. But behind the scenes--and in Washington, D.C.--friends pulled strings furiously. At the last minute, the couple was granted asylum in the U.S. and caught a flight for America on June 27, the last working day of the British colonial administration.</p><p>Before the deadline, Yellowbird organizers had scrambled to help clear the backlog of dissidents in Hong Kong still searching for safe havens. And they succeeded. Today, at least on the record, they claim the great escapes are no more. </p><p>\"Yellowbird is an illustration of Hong Kong's unique role, dating back to the Qing Dynasty [the last imperial dynasty, which ended in 1911]. Back then, people also came here to escape persecution,\" says Lee Cheuk-yan, head of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, which lent backing and funds to the protest movement. \"It is a lighthouse for people in China, a safe exit, a place where the struggle for democracy can take root. But after 1997, the possibility of asylum closed down.\"</p><p>Yellowbird 2.0</p><p>Though few wind up in Hong Kong now, victims of injustice continue to flee China. The more recent rescue missions are lower-key compared with the headline-grabbing Yellowbird triumphs of old. The people-smuggling routes, the methods and even the profiles of escapees have changed with the times. </p><p>Today they are less likely to declare they're risking all for democracy and more likely to rail against religious persecution and ethnic discrimination or express localized grievances. And as technology has improved--everyone now has a smartphone--so too have the logistics of escape. Today, some fugitives just walk across China's porous southwestern border into Indochina or board planes using passports obtained under false pretenses.</p><p>But the knowledge--the ability to run an escape undetected--has been passed down over the years since 1989. In 2009, Geng He, the wife of human rights lawyer and political prisoner Gao Zhisheng, was under relentless, in-your-face surveillance at home. (Gao often represented victims of repression, including practitioners of the banned quasi-Buddhist sect Falun Gong. He himself had been in and out of detention several times.) Geng told a kind roadside vendor near her home about her family's travails. The next day, as she was buying fruit, he wordlessly passed her some change, and a scrap of paper.</p><p>On it were instructions that launched Geng and her two children on a two-week-long pilgrimage to freedom. They used train tickets, fake IDs, a cellphone and several SIM cards provided by an anonymous man. After they arrived in southwest China, Gao's two preteens crossed into a neighboring country disguised as ethnic-minority children from a local hill tribe. When all three of Gao's family members reached Bangkok, Fu phoned him with the news. \"He was very relieved,\" Fu says.</p><p>Soon afterward, Gao disappeared again. He is now reportedly serving a three-year prison term in distant Xinjiang.</p><p>As Fu learned, kids are tricky passengers on the underground railroad. Five years ago, his nonprofit ChinaAid mobilized a rescue of the family of Guo Feixiong, another legal activist and a colleague of Gao's. When Fu couldn't obtain travel documents for two of Guo's children to leave China, the persistent pastor gave them his own kids' passports. The trio hopped a plane for Dallas, with Guo's children posing as Fu's. (Potential people-smuggling charges against Fu were dropped after an investigation.)</p><p>Fu's network is relatively modest in scale. It has helped spirit about a dozen Chinese out of the country since 2002. They're a diverse crew: Protestant house church leaders and Falun Gong followers fleeing religious persecution, an activist judge, families of political prisoners, a woman who defied family-planning rules and was forced to have a risky late-term abortion. Some cases cannot be publicized yet, to protect escapees still waiting for safe harbor. One case involves relatives of a wealthy Chinese man who'd been persecuted by ex-Politburo politician Bo Xilai, who in 2012 was purged, tried and sentenced to life for corruption and abuse of power.</p><p>Fu says he's moved to help dissidents' families when the father or husband is detained. \"It broke my heart to read reports of security people hanging out in the living rooms of political prisoners' families, playing poker 24 hours a day,\" he says. \"The underground railroad gives encouragement to people such as Gao and Guo. It lets them know their families are OK.\"</p><p>Since 1997, much of the overland smuggling action has shifted to the rugged hills and rivers of southwestern China. For years, North Korean escapees have crossed China on their way to other countries. And most recently, the surge of unrest and violence in Xinjiang, in China's far Northwest, has sent many Muslim Uighurs fleeing an ever more intense government crackdown. Cambodian and Laotian authorities have caught groups of Uighur border-crossers and sent them back to China. Last October, up to 100 Uighurs were arrested on the Chinese side of the frontier with Laos, where they were hoping to flee after intense police activity in Xinjiang, Radio Free Asia reported.</p><p>Beijing's continuing crackdown may portend yet more traffic along the nation's myriad escape routes, as the regime struggles to contain the escalating violence, which it has blamed on Uighur separatists. Last October, three Uighurs rammed their vehicle into crowds in Tiananmen Square, killing themselves as well as two others. And 29 people were slashed to death in a Yunnan province train station, an attack also blamed on Uighur jihadists. </p><p>Then, just last month, several massive bomb blasts at a market in Xinjiang's capital of Urumqi left 43 dead and 94 wounded. \"It's all part of the same story, the story of living under authoritarian rule,\" says Bao Pu, the Hong Kong publisher. \"Unfortunately, it sometimes manifests itself as a racial or religious issue. But the root cause is the system itself. People feel hopeless.\"</p><p>[[nid:253187]]</p><p>The Comeback Kid</p><p>Chinese attitudes toward exile have evolved as well since the heyday of Yellowbird. Today's Chinese dissidents have a less idealistic view about life in the West and are more aware that exile can be \"a long, painful, lonely journey,\" says Hou Xiaotian, who was jailed four times after 1989 because of her campaigning to free political prisoners. They included her then-husband Wang Juntao, at the time serving a 13-year sentence. </p><p>She left China legally in 1993, worked on Wall Street for a decade and negotiated with officials to permit her to return home if she focused on her business. She agreed. \"For five years, I was in politics as an activist. For 10 years, I was on Wall Street. Now it's time to turn a new page.\"</p><p>As paradoxical as it may sound, former student leader Wuer Kaixi has been trying his best to come back to China, too--and to be arrested. Last November he made his fourth unsuccessful attempt to return to China by boarding a flight to Hong Kong, the city that once showered him with a hero's welcome. Hong Kong authorities trundled him straight onto a Taiwan-bound plane.</p><p>\"I want to go straight to jail in China,\" he declares with an impish grin. \"[I want] to put the Chinese government in the difficult position of holding an open trial--my trial--on the whole topic of Tiananmen, to have them officially charge me for something I did back then.\"</p><p>For a moment, Wuer reveals a flash of youthful bravado, a hint of the idealistic 21-year-old I first met during the chaos of Tiananmen. What if things go sour? I ask him. Does Yellowbird still exist as an option?</p><p>He measures his words carefully. \"Yellowbird is still happening,\" he says. \"Not as much as before, of course. Only when needed. As for exile, actually, I lost my freedom when I went into exile.''</p><p>Brave words. Just like 25 years ago. Perhaps rendered a bit braver with the knowledge that, with luck and the right friends, you can run and you can hide.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWEEK-NW253248_2014-06-13.SIG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWEEK2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CG2-HYJ1-DYR7-G0KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">5774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3557\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newsweek Inc.

But for the sake of our collective prosperity and our personal privacy, it's a fight we can't afford to lose.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress earlier this year to discuss how the now-defunct political-data company Cambridge Analytica acquired data of up to 87 million Facebook users without their knowledge or consent, one of the few pointed questions came from Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina. \"Who's your biggest competitor?\" Graham demanded. After Zuckerberg replied that Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft all had some overlap with various Facebook products, Graham chafed at the answer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If I buy a Ford and it doesn't work well and I don't like it,\" pressed the senator, \"I can buy a Chevy. If I'm upset with Facebook, what's the equivalent product I can go sign up for?\" A bit later, the senator came back to the theme when he asked if the social network's CEO thought Facebook was a monopoly. \"It certainly doesn't feel like that to me,\" said Zuckerberg.</p><p>But to many people, it does. With over two billion users, the company is the colossus of social networking, dwarfing rivals like Twitter and Snapchat. Along with Amazon and Google, which is owned by holding company Alphabet, it dominates the internet landscape. Apple and Microsoft are often mentioned in the same breath as these tech giants, but their business lines are more varied and less internet-centric-enterprise software in Microsoft's case, phones and other devices in Apple's.</p><p>There's another key difference too. Facebook, Google, and Amazon all have business models that require them to scoop up large amounts of data about people to power their algorithms, and they derive their power from this information (see \"Let's make private data into a public good,\" page 74). It's the sheer scale and sophistication of the data-collection empires they've built that make them so distinctive.</p><p>For the past decade or so, these three firms have had a relatively smooth ride to the top. Their cornucopia of services, often provided for free, made them immensely popular and turned them into some of the most valuable businesses in the world. Their combined market capitalization of some $2 trillion at the end of May was roughly equal to the GDP of Italy. Now, however, debates are in full swing on both sides of the Atlantic about how to deal with their dominance.</p><p>D\u00e9ja vu, but different too</p><p>The history of technology has seen singularly powerful corporations before-think of IBM and its reign in mainframes, and Microsoft, the undisputed heavyweight in the PC era. What's different this time is the enormous influence the big firms have over so many parts of daily life, and the troubling issues this raises.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica affair is just the latest in a long line of data scandals that have dogged Facebook. In 2009 it made information about users public without their permission; a few years later, Facebook researchers deliberately manipulated News Feed posts seen by almost 700,000 people to test whether they could influence users' moods without their knowing. (Yes, was the disturbing answer.) Google, too, has had privacy runins, and in 2012 it was fined by regulators in America for circumventing default settings in Apple's Safari web browser to place ad tracking software on people's computers without their knowledge.</p><p>These incidents may appear isolated, but they fit into a bigger picture. Like the oil barons at the turn of the 20th century, the data barons are determined to extract as much as possible of a resource that's central to the economy of their time. The more information they can get to feed the algorithms that power their ad-targeting machines and product-recommendation engines, the better. In the absence of serious competition or (until Europe's recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation) serious legal constraints on the handling of personal data, they are going to keep undermining privacy in their push to know as much about their users as they possibly can.</p><p>Their dominance is allowing them to play a dangerous and outsize role in our politics and culture. The web giants have helped undermine confidence in democracy by underestimating the threat posed by Russian trolls, Macedonian fake-news farms, and other purveyors of propaganda. Zuckerberg at first dismissed claims that disinformation on Facebook had influenced the 2016 election as \"pretty crazy.\" But Facebook itself now says that between June 2015 and August 2017, as many as 126 million people may have seen content on the network that was created by a Russian troll farm.</p><p>Facebook and Google have built new tools for identifying disinformation and vetting advertisers, but it's not yet clear how effective these will be. Even with news that is not clearly fake, researchers have shown that Facebook's content-recommendation algorithms tend to serve up stuff that reinforces people's prejudices. This might be happening even if the social-media industry were more fragmented. But the immense reach of platforms like Facebook has undoubtedly magnified the impact: according to a Pew Research Center study published last year, 45 percent of American adults now get at least some of their news from Facebook.</p><p>Then there's the considerable market power they've built up, which has created turmoil in some industries and stifled innovation in the areas they dominate. Facebook and Google now amount to a digital advertising duopoly: they pocket three out of every four dollars spent on digital advertising in America, and they control 84 percent of global spending on such ads, excluding China. Google controls almost 80 percent of search advertising revenue in America and has a huge share in many other countries.</p><p>Amazon, meanwhile, accounts for over 83 percent of e-book sales in the US and nearly 90 percent of online print sales. The companies' dominance has plunged the media and book publishing industries into turmoil: between 2006 and 2016, ad spending in US newspapers fell by almost two-thirds, and much of that money ended up in Facebook's and Google's hands. Amazon has also become a powerful online gatekeeper for many other kinds of online sales, and it handled around 44 percent of all e-commerce transactions in the US last year.</p><p>Their platforms give the data barons an unprecedented amount of control over what we see, read, and buy. Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California, argues in Move Fast and Break Things, his book about the power of the internet giants, that rebel artists have long had to deal with \"suits\" who control distribution of their work. But the rise of companies like Facebook and Amazon has increased the stakes immeasurably. \"The concentration of profits in the making of arts and news,\" he writes, \"has made more than just artists and journalists vulnerable: it has made all those who seek to profit from the free exchange of ideas and culture vulnerable to the power of a small group of ... patrons.\"</p><p>The data barons like to say that claims about their dominance are overblown. During his congressional testimony, Facebook's Zuckerberg noted that the average American uses eight different communication and social apps. What he neglected to mention was that the social network owns several of the most popular ones, like its Messenger service and Instagram. Google argues that companies like Amazon and Facebook effectively compete with it in search by helping people find information, but its real competitors are dedicated search engines like DuckDuckGo and Microsoft's Bing, which have relatively small market shares. Amazon can point to the fact that there are lots of companies offering e-commerce services, and that it competes with brick-and-mortar retailers, but its dominance in areas like book publishing is impossible to ignore.</p><p>The data barons' power makes startups extremely reluctant to challenge them, and makes venture capitalists wary of backing the few mavericks that do. Speaking at an antitrust conference earlier this year, Albert Wenger, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, said that one of founders' top priorities these days is to avoid the internet giants' \"kill zones,\" the areas in which they are capable of crushing any competition. And those zones are only going to grow as the web companies plunge into more businesses. Breakthrough ideas often come from startups rather than from large firms, so this could be depriving us of important innovations.</p><p>Special effects</p><p>It wasn't supposed to be this way. By lowering barriers to entry and making it easy for consumers to switch services with a few clicks of a mouse, the internet in its early days seemed designed to ensure that digital empires would promptly be besieged by fleets of rebel startups. So why didn't that happen?</p><p>Part of the answer involves one of Silicon Valley's favorite buzz phrases: \"network effects.\" Many online products and services become more valuable as more people use them. Buyers flock to Amazon because they know they'll find lots of sellers-and hence lots of choices; people join Facebook because their friends are there. The US internet giants have been particularly skilled at harnessing these effects, as have Chinese firms like Alibaba and Tencent, which have become similarly dominant in their home market.</p><p>Thanks to network effects, Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been able to harvest oceans of data, which they use to continually refine their products and services. That, in turn, wins them even more users, which yields even more data, and so on. When other businesses show signs of succeeding in their markets, the data barons have often swooped in to buy them using their high-priced shares or vast cash reserves. Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp; Amazon picked up Zappos and Quidsi, two fast-growing online retailers; and Google acquired Waze, which was on the road to becoming a serious competitor to Google Maps. Sometimes consumers don't even notice these deals: after the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, some Facebook users posted that they intended to move to Instagram in protest, clearly unaware it belonged to Facebook.</p><p>The reason the data barons have been so aggressive is that they are all too aware of how network effects can be turned against them by rivals and used to threaten their data-driven monopoly power.</p><p>Why haven't antitrust regulators blocked deals to promote competition? It's mainly because of a change in US antitrust philosophy in the 1980s, inspired by neoclassical economists and legal scholars at the University of Chicago. Before the shift, antitrust enforcers were wary of any deals that reinforced a company's dominant position. After it, they became more tolerant of such combinations, as long as prices for consumers didn't rise. This was just fine with internet companies, since most of their services were free anyway. Critics say trustbusters exercised too little scrutiny. \"Just because the web companies offer products for free doesn't mean they should get a free pass,\" says Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust lawyer at Paul Weiss.</p><p>Move fast and challenge things</p><p>Another reason antitrust officials have struggled with the internet giants' power is that they haven't really appreciated how network effects can breed dominant market positions. At least Europe's watchdogs have been tougher on anticompetitive behavior. Last year the European Union's antitrust authority fined Google 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion) for unfairly favoring its own pricecomparison shopping service in search results, depriving rivals of traffic. (The firm says it did nothing wrong and is appealing the ruling in court.) The EU is also investigating claims from rivals that Google uses its Android mobile operating system and AdSense advertising service to unfairly suppress competition.</p><p>In the US, the big web companies had lobbying clout and close links to the Obama administration, which may have given them an easier ride. But their standing with the government could be about to change: Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, has urged the Department of Justice to take a hard look at the market power of big tech firms, and Joseph Simons, the new chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, which also has antitrust powers, said in his Senate confirmation hearing that he'd watch \"big and influential\" companies in Silicon Valley carefully. \"I'm very optimistic that by the end of the year we'll have a major investigation or two out there,\" predicts Luther Lowe, the head of public policy at Yelp, a service that collects local reviews about things like restaurants and repair shops. Yelp has been locked in a long-running war of words with Google, which it says unfairly favors its own reviews in search results. Google rejects the charge.</p><p>If Lowe is right, the big internet firms could end up spending more time in American courts. But thanks to their vast wealth, fining them for any transgressions won't diminish their power.</p><p>One radical solution would be to break them up, just as the US government splintered the dominant Standard Oil monopoly in the early 1900s. Some progressive advocacy groups in the US have been running online campaigns with slogans like \"Facebook has too much power over our lives and democracy. It's time for us to take that power back,\" and calling on the FTC to force the social network to sell Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger to create competition.</p><p>Facebook isn't the only company in their sights. Earlier this year, Lina Khan, a researcher at the Open Markets Institute, one of the organizations behind the Facebook campaign, argued in a paper that because Amazon has become so dominant in e-commerce, it should be regulated and made to choose between being a seller of goods itself and running the digital platform it and other merchants use to reach customers. If it chose to be a platform, it would, among other things, have to spin off Whole Foods, the US supermarket chain it bought last year.</p><p>Making the legal case for breakups will be hard, though, because the internet giants don't fit the stereotype of rapacious monopolists that raise prices and squeeze investment. They manipulate markets in a different and seemingly more benevolent way. They've become so dominant by developing products and services that many of us want to use. And they gain their immense power through collecting data about our online activity.</p><p>Still, just the threat of corporate dismemberment can have a salutary effect. In the 1990s the Department of Justice tried to force Microsoft to stop bundling its Internet Explorer web browser with its dominant Windows operating system, saying it was giving the browser an unfair advantage over Netscape. The government ultimately failed to get Microsoft broken up, but the bruising battle made the company more cautious about wielding its power to block small firms in emerging markets like online search-a fact that helped Google to flourish. (See a Q&amp;A with Gary Reback, the lawyer who got the government to take on Microsoft, on page 72.)</p><p>Bridging the data chasm</p><p>So how to curb the power of the data barons? Rather than waiting for legal battles that may or may not foster more competition, we urgently need to find ways to bolster rivals. That means reducing the vast chasm between the amounts of information held by the web giants and the rest. Regulation can help here: Europe's new data privacy regime requires companies to hold people's data in machine-readable form and let them move it easily to other businesses if they want to. This \"data portability\" rule will allow startups to get hold of more data quickly.</p><p>If one or another of the data barons is found guilty of anti-competitive behavior, a settlement should include a requirement that they have to share some of their data with rivals. Google, for instance, could be forced to hand over some search data that other firms working on search engines could use to train them, and Facebook could be made to share some of its \"social graph\" data on people's online relationships. The best way to do this (while protecting people's privacy) would need to be carefully thought out, but it would have a bigger impact than large fines, which the internet companies can easily pay.</p><p>Some argue that we need to think much more boldly-and not just with the big internet companies in mind. Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the University of Oxford, has proposed what he calls a \"progressive data-sharing mandate\" that would apply to all businesses. This would require a company that has passed a certain level of market share (say, 10 percent) to share some data with other firms in its industry that ask for it. The data would be chosen at random and stripped of all personal identifiers. Intuitively, the idea makes sense: the closer a company gets to dominating its market, the more data it would have to share, making it easier for rivals to compete by building a better product.</p><p>Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger's suggestion may be hard to make work, but tackling the power of the internet giants will require novel approaches. It will also require a more muscular merger policy, one that looks beyond the narrow test of whether a proposed acquisition would raise prices to consider what it would do to future competition. We're going to need to block not just large deals that would cement the web giants' dominance but also smaller ones capable of eliminating competitors that might go on to challenge them. Carl Shapiro, an antitrust expert at the University of California, Berkeley, has said this could lead to some \"false positives,\" blocking acquisitions of young companies that never do turn into real threats to a Google or a Facebook. But he says this might be a price worth paying in order to stimulate more competition.</p><p>The need for such moves is even more pressing now that we're heading deeper into the artificial-intelligence era. AI feeds on massive amounts of data to gain its power. So the data barons' vast data reserves give them a head start in training AIs that will run all kinds of devices and systems, from driverless cars to software that decides whether or not you should get a loan. That's going to make it harder than ever for other firms to catch up.</p><p>The prominent AI investor Kai-Fu Lee noted this in an article in the New York Times last year: \"The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the more data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you can attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product.\" It's no coincidence that Facebook, Google, and Amazon are intent on gaining as much data as possible and securing some of the brightest AI minds on the planet to work for them.</p><p>Increasingly, the AI-powered, voice-activated assistants these firms are building will be in our cars, homes, and offices, as well as on our phones. We'll expect them to deliver \"the\" answer to questions, rather than the smorgasbord of suggestions that often gets served up today. The companies whose algorithms decide what those answers will be will have an even more powerful influence over us and over the global economy. And to ensure that they hold on to their dominance, Facebook, Google, and Amazon will soon be vacuuming up even more data about us.</p><p>During his congressional testimony, Zuckerberg accepted that new rules are going to be needed to govern his company and others. \"So I think the internet is becoming increasingly important in people's lives,\" he said, \"and I think we need to have a full conversation about what is the right regulation, not whether it should or shouldn't be.\" To create those rules, we urgently need to focus on the source of the internet giants' power and the dangers that it entails. The sooner we find smart ways to diminish the firms' dominance of our data, the better.</p><p>Martin Giles is MIT Technology Review's San Francisco bureau chief.</p><p>45% of American adults now get at least some of their news from Facebook.</p><p>Their platforms give the data arons an unprecedented amount of control over what we see, read, and buy.</p><p>They've become so dominant by developing products and services that many of us want to use.</p><p>84% of global spending on digital ads (outside China) goes to Google and Facebook.</p><p>Making the legal case for breakups will be hard because the internet giants don't fit the stereotype of rapacious monopolists.</p><p>2.4 billion Amount, in euros, the EU fined Google last year for alleged anticompetitive behavior.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECRVW-2189567052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECRVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMD-VTC1-DY0W-40C7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381140</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Technology Review, Inc.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is a busy morning. It is Tuesday, November 13th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on button on the East Coast. Markets are set to rebound this morning. Take a look at futures indicating a modest gain at the start of trading.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow Jones Industrial average up 130 points right now, one-half of one percent. The S&amp;P is up two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ with a 53- point rally this morning up three quarters of a percent. A much different day than yesterday, where we saw serious broad-based sell-off on Wall Street. Apple and Goldman dragged the markets lower. The Dow was down 600 plus points. That was 2-1/3 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The S&amp;P 500 sliding nearly two percent on the session. And at the close, the NASDAQ was the worst performer. It was down nearly three percent on the session as Apple and other technology stocks really took the NASDAQ down sharply at the close. Take a look at global markets this morning on the heels of the strength you're seeing on Wall Street this morning. European markets following suit.</p><p>The FT-100 is up a fraction, the CAC Quarante in Paris us a half of a percent, 21 points higher and the DAX Index up almost one percent. 90 points higher in Germany. In Asia overnight, mixed performances there, take a look. Worst performer was Japan, the Nikkei average down better than two percent.</p><p>Well, the picks are in. Amazon will soon call Long Island City York and Crystal City, Virginia home. The details on the decision to split its headquarters, the second headquarters. The announcement is expected as early as today. That would be the official announcement but we know this is coming up one percent on Amazon this morning in terms of the stock.</p><p>Meanwhile, let's go to California where raging wildfires are continuing this morning. The infernos burning a path of devastation. The death toll up to nearly 50 people right now between these massive fires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand that makes this the deadliest fire in the history of United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are going to take you live to Southern California to get the very latest there. Massive devastation. New questions this morning for Boeing. A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its important 737 jet. That's the same model that was involved in the deadly crash in Indonesia last month. I'm going to be speaking with the Chairman and CEPO Dennis Muilenburg this morning and he is here in studio in a Fox Business Exclusive.</p><p>He will join me at 8:30 a.m. Eastern to answer these questions as well as to tell us about the backdrop for his business today. Also joining the conversation this morning, House Majority Whip and Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise as Congress gets back to work this morning. Also this morning joining me is CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell. Lindsey, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Lindsey, we were talking earlier about the markets and about that sell-off yesterday. We just came off of the quarter where we saw profit growth up 29 percent year-over-year. So why are markets so nervous?</p><p>BELL: We haven't seen growth that great since before 2000. So that is a very impressive number. It's the third quarter of over 20 percent earnings growth. And that is largely due to the tax reform package that we got earlier this year and fiscal stimulus. But the problem now is that fiscal stimulus is peaking, monetary policy is tightening. The Fed is running off its balance sheet here.</p><p>And the question is where do we go with growth from here? There is a lot of uncertainty still out there on trade and to me, between trade and the Fed, those are the two biggest things as I look to 2019 to determine where growth -- the growth trajectory will be going.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, we saw some of the big tech names come down a lot yesterday, Apple down five percent which is a serious number for Apple. Is the worry about growth largely in some of these high flyers like in Apple, or are we just talking about economic growth going from 4.2 percent in the second quarter, 3-1/2 percent in the third quarter to something very different in 2019.</p><p>BELL: Yes. I think it's more about economic growth. The tech sector is being weighed on by the trade disputes obviously and then also I think that with interest rates rising the evaluations that we've seen in some of that really had investors turn a little more skittish. It's been dragging the market down but as we look to 2019, look, if we get 2-1/2 to -- to 2.9 percent GDP, that's really solid.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And really much better than what we saw the prior 10 years.</p><p>BELL: Exactly. In a slowdown in growth from the four percent that we saw in the last quarter could help you elongate this bull market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sounds like you think things went overdone yesterday on the downside.</p><p>BELL: Yes. And I just think volatility is here to stay for a while but we are optimistic, we have 3100 price targets for the next 12 months in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 3100 and it is now at 2726 on the standard &amp; poor's. Lindsey, thank you. Great insights always from you. I'm going to turn now back to the Capitol Hill. Congress is back in session today for its final two month stretch, spending immigration and the fate of the Mueller probe expected to dominate the debate. Joining me right now is the House Majority Whip, author of the new book, Back in the Game, Steve Scalise.</p><p>And we are really happy you are back in the game, Congressman. It's good to see you.</p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: Maria, great to be back with you. Great to be back in the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Congratulations on the book. You know, I was so happy when I saw the book because I thought I'm really happy he is writing about this incident. The whole country was just so worried about you after that shooting at the baseball -- at the baseball course. So we'll get to that in a moment. But you just heard Lindsey Graham talking about the economy.</p><p>Are you expecting growth to slow? You just had this landmark tax cut reform that you put in place earlier this year and now people are worried that the economy is going to slow down.</p><p>SCALISE: Well, you know, we were seeing so much economic growth and it was working the way that we intended. When you -- when you see tax cuts for every single income group and of course lower to middle income people are the ones who benefited the most. And now with Nancy Pelosi being expected to be sworn in as Speaker in January, it does concern people that they want to go backward.</p><p>They want to raise taxes again, go to like kind of big government, government-controlled healthcare. All the things that Pelosi did when she was speaker before. So, you know, it is definitely concerned people and slowed down the growth. Let's see what happens but we're going to be battling that too. We're not going to -- we're not going to let this country go back to those days, the 10 years of slow economic growth less than two percent growth for eight straight years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know we're waiting on couple of situations in Florida this morning but it looks like Republicans will keep the majority in the Senate based on what we're seeing.</p><p>SCALISE: And actually grew their number in the Senate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And grew their numbers but I'm talking about these, you know, questions in Florida and -- but yes, growing the numbers in the Senate. So should that make us feel that the Democrats being in the House majority now will not be subject to stopping the President's economic agenda? I mean, what does this mean in terms of the House leadership taking the majority?</p><p>SCALISE: Well, I think the most important thing that you don't see us go backwards. And, you know, even if Nancy PelosI's agenda which will be to try to grow government, to try to raise taxes, higher, they're not going to be successful ultimately because the bill would have to be signed by the President. But what it does mean is the things that we were going to do tax cuts 2.0, the work that Chairman Brady and his committee were already engaged in to try to make those tax cuts permanent.</p><p>To build on the growth we're seeing in our economy. It's going to be very difficult to get those things accomplished once Nancy Pelosi is speaker for at least two-year period.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, do you think -- I was with David Cicilline, Democratic Congressman who0 wants to get into leadership, the leadership race is obviously happening this week, and he said he doesn't like the corporate rate where it is. Do you think there's any chance that he would be successful in raising the corporate rate?</p><p>SCALISE: Well, I saw that interview and you pressed him I think appropriately because ultimately he didn't want to say it but you can tell what he was trying to imply was he wants to raise the corporate rate and it's OK if he tries to do that which he will not be successful by the way. But if he tried to, what does he going to do with those millions of jobs that we're bringing back to America because we lowered the corporate rate to be competitive.</p><p>America lost its competitive edge and everybody acknowledged that. It wasn't a partisan issue. And so when we made our country competitive again, we're seeing the benefits of it by millions of new jobs being created for families who want to get in the work force. Why would he want to take that away, we're not going to let it happen but it shows you they do want to raise those rates even higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They want to raise rates and they want to have investigations around President Trump. You've got six weeks or seven weeks before the end of the year. What can you get done in this next seven weeks? I know you have spending bills, appropriation bills that need to be tended to. Tell us what you're expecting in terms of success this year.</p><p>SCALISE: Maria, there are a few important bills that are right up front and center that we have to deal with the funding of the Department of Homeland Security which is critically important to keeping America safe. And of course the big fight, there is going to be overfunding the wall. In the House we've been moving forward to try to give the President the $5 billion that he's requested to start fully building out the wall.</p><p>There is some money he has to start building about 100 miles of wall. We want to go a lot further, you know, that's going to be a battle we have. The other big battle is going to be over the farm bill. And Maria, Farm Bill Policy expired a few weeks ago and the big fight has been over work requirements. You know, here you've got this great robust economy where there are more job openings and people looking for work.</p><p>And yet we put a provision in the House that says, if there is a job out there in your able body, you ought to be able to go and look for work instead of getting taxpayer funded welfare benefits and the Democrats oppose that, so we have a big impasse over that. And imagine, at a time when people are looking for work, the Federal government is paying people not to work and we said, look, if there is a job out there for you, you have to go take it or else stop getting taxpayer money.</p><p>And we'll even pay you to train you to work if there's not -- if you don't have the proper training and that's what they're opposing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible. All right. Are there any plans to cut spending? The idea of debt and deficits in our face and getting more expensive just to hold the debt. This conversation is getting louder. What are the plans in terms of spending cuts and is it possible that the Congress and the President make a mistake of looking for something to come together with the Democrats choosing infrastructure and then creating even more debt by spending $2 trillion on an infrastructure package.</p><p>SCALISE: All right. That is continuing to be a concern. One of the reason we didn't get an infrastructure package is because we couldn't get an agreement over how to pay for it. We weren't in this Republican-led House, we weren't going to pass a bill that was just going to add to the deficit. One of the things we had in our healthcare bill that passed the House had protections for people with preexisting conditions.</p><p>But a reforming Medicaid, one of the most broken forms of healthcare by block granting it to the states, letting the states actually be innovative and coming up with better ways to run healthcare for lower income people. It's saved over $800 billion just through the innovation. You didn't have a reduction in money, it just actually allowed states to be more flexible with the money.</p><p>That saved $800 billion. It failed by one voted in the Senate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>SCALISE: Huge disappointments there in a lot of fronts but it would have made healthcare more affordable, protected people of preexisting conditions and transformed Medicaid into a much better program at those kind of savings. That was what's at stake in this election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. We all remember the infamous thumbs down on the Senate. Let me -- let me ask you about the preexisting conditions because that's another talking point on the left that the Republicans do not want to protect preexisting conditions.</p><p>SCALISE: Yes. It was a false claim. In fact they spent millions of dollars promoting that false claim. And I talked to members and so many of these swing districts and they said, look, they're lying about this, they're spending two, $3 million in T.V. ads lying about it. And so they had to go on T.V. and spend -- they didn't have two million, they might had a million and half to say that it wasn't true.</p><p>And so people got confused, they weren't sure what was the case.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCALISE: But our bill -- our bill actually protected people with preexisting conditions. It's in the bill, they knew it, they didn't care, they just said it anyway. Look, you know, they're going to get the majority. I think it's going to be a short-lived majority but at the same time a lot of those candidates who won said they're going to be pro-life and pro-gun and they're going to vote against Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Well, their very first vote as a member of Congress in January is going to be for Nancy Pelosi as speaker. You know, which side are they going to choose, the -- you know, the people back home that they promised one thing to or what's going to happen up in D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you've got your leadership races this week, tomorrow night, the vote tell us what you're feeling in terms of how things stack up. Are you expecting that Kevin McCarthy will be the Minority Leader and you will tell us about the role that you're expecting.</p><p>SCALISE: Yes. I think Kevin will get the votes and he will be the minority leader. I'm running for the minority whip position and feel real confident and the votes that we have and, you know, we'll go forward but at the same time it's going to be interesting to see which route they go, the Democrats do when they're in power. They're going to just be about harassing the President, subpoenas and even impeachment.</p><p>That's not what the American people wanted. You know, ultimately they're going to have to -- they're going to have to decide which route they go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Just to change the conversation, so that's the conversation for the next two years as opposed to what you've been able to do in terms of legislation.</p><p>SCALISE: And we've got to be I think a lot better at articulating the things we stand for as conservatives. That's one thing that I think we didn't do well. We've got to do a lot better at and we're going to get there but I think there's going to be a sharp contrast now because you're going to see the approach that Nancy Pelosi would take as speaker.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I'm glad you mentioned -- a lot of people mentioned the messaging on the Republican side. Let's talk about your book Back in the Game, what role did your recovery have in writing this book? Tell us why you wrote the book.</p><p>SCALISE: Well, you know, as you talked about earlier, there were so many people that came together to help me, you know, not only to save my life in those first few hours after the shooting, but to help me get back in the game and essence to be able to learn how to walk again. Just to learn how to do basic things that I couldn't do in those first few weeks after the shooting.</p><p>And, you know, I had a lot of -- a lot of support and prayers by the people like you were praying, people all over the country were praying and there were so many miracles that we chronicle in this book and the book we talked about. What my wife Jennifer and I talk about these little miracles that happened along the way. And we also talked about the people who did so many heroic things every step of the way to save not only myself but all the other people that were out there that day.</p><p>And then ultimately to help me through the recovery process. And it really is an inspirational book because it could have been a lot different in how it ended. You know, so many cases like this don't end the way it did. This actually has a happy ending and thanks to god, to miracles, and to the support and prayers of so many people. We chronicled it all in the book. Back in the Game and I'm really happy with how it came out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We were so worried. Everybody was worried about you, we -- I mean, it was so serious. Did it change the way you look at things? Did it change the way you approach your job?</p><p>SCALISE: Maria, if anything, it sharpened my focus on the things that matter in life and I think I removed a lot of clutter in life. You know, all of us do things every day that some that we want to do, some that you just kind of do because it's a routine and you focus on what's really important, my family, my faith, you know, the work that I do, I love my job. You know, and it illuminated the things that aren't as important and much happier today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, thank you so much. Thank you for your leadership. So happy you're here.</p><p>SCALISE: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Steve Scalise. Check out the book back in the game. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump just tweeting this on trade. France makes excellent wine but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France and charges big tariffs while doing so. Whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines and charges very small tariffs. It's not fair. Must change. The President obviously touting European leaders on trade this morning.</p><p>Switching gears. We want to bring you to California and show you this devastation which is just unreal. We have two wildfires whipping across the state. The campfire is the northern part, now it is the deadliest fire in the state's history. And the Woolsey fire taking a major toll on Southern California. Fox News' Jonathan Hunt is in Malibu this morning. Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Thousands of families remain evacuated from this area of Southern California where the Woolsey fire has hit so hard. That likely to be out of Malibu and other areas for I would say at least another 24 hours. And take a look at what hundreds of families are going to come back to find when they are eventually let in.</p><p>Everything they have built over their lives, everything they've worked for completely and utterly destroyed. It is a similar story up north -- the camp fire near Chico, California. Now as you mentioned becoming officially the deadliest in state history. 42 people have been killed in that fire. More than 100 still remain unaccounted for and the entire town of Paradise is basically wiped out. Listen here to the fire chief.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID HAWKS, DIVISION CHIEF, CAL FIRE-BUTTE COUNTY: It's just absolutely heartbreaking to drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction. My family lost their home in the fire, my parents did, my grandmother did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: President Trump tweeted last night that he has now approved and expedited major disaster declaration for California. That tweet coming in the wake of tweets over the weekend, in which he was critical of California's forest management. That sparked a firestorm of criticism. He's now changing his tune paying tribute to the heroic firefighters who are still on the frontlines, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Jonathan. Thanks very much. We will be watching. Jonathan Hunt in Malibu this morning. Coming up. Concerns in the sky. A new report says Boeing withheld information on its 737 plane. The same model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash last month. I'll be speaking exclusively with the chairman and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg about that in less than 10 minutes.</p><p>As we take a break, we are watching the price of oil this morning. And as you can see, it is down 1-1/4 percent below 60 right now. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: President Trump continuing to tweet this morning. Here's what he just posted. The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low approval rating in France, that's 26 percent. And an unemployment rate of almost 10 percent. He was just trying to get on to another subject, by the way, there is no country more nationalist than France. Very proud people and rightfully so. Make France Great Again. The President writes this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Vive la, France. Sorry. I just want to quickly say we have our pickup trucks, everyone. We have our tariffs on pickup truck imports. They have their protections for one. Let's move along and get along.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes. All right. Well, stocks getting yesterday on weakness from technology meanwhile especially Apple. The NASDAQ was down almost three percent. This morning we are looking at a rebound a bit, the Dow industrials are up 77, the S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up 39 points after that sharp sell-off yesterday. Joining us right now Wells Fargo Investment Institute Head, global market strategists, Paul Christopher.</p><p>Paul, good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD OF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So when you come in today after since a rough day at the office yesterday where the markets were down 600 points on the Dow. What do you do? Are you a buyer or a seller here?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: Yes. We're a buyer. Look, it's -- the markets, it's still worried about growth, it's trying to put in a bottom. You don't have to put in all the chips at once here but people have a lot of cash. Our clients held a lot of cash and we would like for them to put in a little bit here at a time. We think this is the best buying opportunity in U.S. large caps since the November 2016 election.</p><p>So don't have to put it all in at once. We're still looking for a bottom but do start to take some positions especially in those growth-oriented sectors.</p><p>BELL: So Paul, does that mean you take some positions in the tech, maybe some of the FAANG names that have been beaten up or maybe are in bear market territory right now off of their highs?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: Yes. It's a good question. We've been market weight on information technology. We still think you should be market weight but listen if you haven't had a chance to get into some of these stocks and now you find yourself below market weight. Again this is an opportunity to take yourself back up to that waiting.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Paul, it's Dagen McDowell. It seems like the market gets really shaken every time that 10-year yield gets to about only 3-1/4 percent. Realistically how high a yield, a longer term interest rate can stocks handle given a lot of names that are still -- that still look really overvalued?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: Yes. We think that bond yields, the 10-year for instance will go a little bit higher over the next 12 months and that we think that stocks will still be OK with that. The problem is we're just getting this transition period where we've gone from clearly low growth and low interest rates to a little bit faster growth and somewhat higher interest rates and that sort of a move always wrong foots markets until investors can determine that yes earnings can continue to hit higher levels.</p><p>And it's -- those earnings ultimately over the long run that will be -- that will match the S&amp;P on the way up we think, you know, percentage for percentage.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Paul, great to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Paul Christopher joining us. Well Fargo. New questions for Boeing. A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its 737 model. This is the same model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash last week. We will speak with Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg next, exclusive coming up right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the east coast. Futures are indicating a gain at the start of trading this morning. Dow Industrials expected to be up 69 points, that is about a quarter of a percent. S&amp;P 500 is up almost half a percent, and the NASDAQ with a 39-point gain, up two-thirds of one percent. This, after a sharp sell-off yesterday where the Dow lost two percent and the NASDAQ lost almost three percent.</p><p>European markets were mixed, the FT-100 is down a fraction, as you can see, but the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are both positive. Although off of the highest levels of the morning, for sure. Overnight in Asia, mixed performances, take a look, the worst performer was Japan overnight in Asia. The Nikkei Average was down on the session about two percent, as you can see there.</p><p>Oil is extending its losing streak this morning. Crude oil under pressure again now 11 days in a row lower, down 1-1/3 percent, below $60.00 a barrel. What is the price of oil selling off tell us about the global economy? We want to look at that, coming up.</p><p>All of those stories coming up this morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, new questions this morning for Boeing, The Wall Street journal is reporting that Boeing withheld information on its 737 model, according to safety experts and others. That is the same model involved in the deadly Lion aircrash in Indonesia last month. And joining me right now to discuss that and a lot more in this Fox Business exclusive is the Chairman, President, and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg. Dennis, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, BOEING: Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MUILENBURG: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the story in The Journal obviously is very concerning. What can you tell us in terms of what was told to the pilots and the airlines about any new equipment in that 737?</p><p>MUILENBURG: Well, Maria, first of all, I think it's important that we all express our sympathies for the loss of Lion Air Flight 610 and certainly, our thoughts go with the families that have been affected. We've been very engaged with the investigative authorities throughout and providing all of the information necessary to make sure we do a full assessment of the situation. And the bottom line here is the 737 max is safe, and safety is a core value for us at Boeing, it always has been, and we ensure that our airplanes are safe. In fact, this airplane went through thousands of hours of tests and evaluation, certification, working with the pilots, and we've been very transparent on providing information and being fully cooperative on the investigative activity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what happened? Apparently, there were 10 computer -- the computers about the angle of the nose were not accurate and then the plane went down, all 189 people dead. Do you have a sense of what went wrong?</p><p>MUILENBURG: Yes, as the Indonesian authorities have pointed out initially, there were some indications of inaccurate angle attack signal that was being sent to the airplane, and of course, our airplane has the ability to handle that, and we have procedures in place. And we've already issued a couple of additional bulletins to our operators and pilots around the world that point them back to existing flight procedures to handle that kind of condition. So again, we're going to continue to support the investigation as it proceeds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And was there -- I mean, one of the Boeing officials quoted in The Journal today, one high-ranking Boeing official said that the company had decided against disclosing more details to cockpit cruise due to concerns about inundating average pilots with too much information. Was that a decision now that you regret?</p><p>MUILENBURG: Now, again, we ensure that we provide all of information that's needed to safely fly our airplanes. Again, this comes as out of thousands of hours of testing and evaluating and simulating, and providing the information that our pilots need to operate our airplanes safely, and we'll continue to do that. As I said, as part of the process here, we've already issued a couple of bulletins to pilots and operators that point them back to existing flight procedures to handle this kind of situation. So, we're going to continue to fully cooperate in the investigation. I think it's really important -- again, the bottomline here, the 737 Max is a very safe airplane and we're very confident in it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But was there a new -- well, there are new system that wasn't disclosed to the pilots.</p><p>MUILENBURG: No, there are new systems on the airplanes that are designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the airplane and to provide control capability in high-angle of attack conditions, and those systems operate properly. And again, in certain failure modes, if there's an inaccurate angle attack sensors feeding information to the -- to the airplane, there's a procedure to handle that. And so, again, as part of the investigation process, we're going to make sure we fully understand that. We're going to make sure that we're providing all of the information necessary and appropriate training, and go back to the core value here, is that the airplane safe, we know how to fly it safely, and we're very confident in that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Was that information in terms of what to do should something change -- was that information available to the pilots? Did they know how to operate it should the nose be in a different position?</p><p>MUILENBURG: Yes. In fact, that's part of the training manual, it's an existing procedure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>MUILENBURG: So, the bulletin that we put out again last week and over the weekend, pointed to that existing flight procedure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, obviously, I know that you're answering lots of questions this morning and this week after this horrific crash, and you're going to get more information. What would be the timing on that? When do you expect to hear from the FAA on this?</p><p>MUILENBURG: Well, this is an ongoing investigation, so it will take whatever time is necessary to make sure it's done thoroughly. Again, we participate fully in these investigations, we've provided technical assistance, we'll continue to do that until the work is complete. It's very important that we do this in a diligent and thorough manner. Bottomline is we want to ensure safety in the system, and continue to have confidence in the 737 Max.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the 737 has been a cash cow for your business, this is a very important business. There were some headwinds in the supply chain in terms of the 737, which I want to ask you about. And I know over the recent past, you've expanded the business, you've got commercial aerospace, you've got defense, and then you've got services. Tell us how business is right now, because commercial aerospace has been driving the stock obviously for several years right now?</p><p>MUILENBURG: Well, aerospace is a tremendous growth business. We look out over the next 10 years as an $8.1 trillion marketplace. Passenger traffic is growing at about six to seven percent per year sustained. The world needs about 43,000 new commercial airplanes over the next 20 years. A part of that is the 737 as we've ramped up to 52 a month, this year, we're producing at 57 a month next year. And we have had some supply chain challenges as you -- as you pointed out, as we've been growing. But we are briskly moving to a recovery. We just announced delivery numbers for October earlier this morning, so we delivered 43 737s in October which is an all-time record for October, and we're continuing to March smartly to our recovery plan, and expect to meet our year-end targets for deliveries. This year, for the first time, we'll deliver more than 800 commercial airplanes. By the end of the decade here, we'll be delivering more than 900 airplanes a year. So, you can see the tremendous growth here in commercial airplanes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible and I know you got an incredible backlog as well --</p><p>MUILENBURG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- which will continue that delivery calendar. One out of four or five planes go to China in terms of your deliveries. Tell us about the importance of the business in China.</p><p>MUILENBURG: Yes, China is very important to us. Today, about a third of our 737s go to China, about one-quarter of our overall deliveries. So, if you look at that marketplace around the world, 43,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, about 7,000 of those are in China. It's the fastest growing market segment right now. China needs that lift capability to serve their economic growth needs, so China is very interested in the healthy aerospace economy.</p><p>As you know here in the U.S. as well, there's a big advantage to a healthy aerospace ecosystem. We have about 90 percent of our manufacturing jobs here in the U.S. even though we export about 80 percent of what we build. So when you look at trade deficit versus trade surplus, aerospace is the biggest trade surplus for the U.S., about $80 billion a year. And our business is the biggest piece of that. So, that a mutually-beneficial relationship between the U.S. and China as it applies to trade and the aerospace is very important.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what happens now with this trade spat that we're having with China then? I mean, have you seen any backlash from the Chinese in terms of your business, given the fact that the President is sitting there waiting to put another 250 billion on exports from China on tariffs and this fight between China and the U.S. intensifies?</p><p>MUILENBURG: We've been very engaged in that dialogue, as you know, this is a very important topic to us. We've been talking with the President and the U.S. administration, extensively. They're very aware of the situation and the importance of aerospace. We've also had a very good dialogue with Chinese leadership and our customers in China. And we're encouraged by the dialogue that's going on.</p><p>I think you've seen some recent reports that President Trump and President Xi plan to meet around the G20 summit that's coming up. Some productive dialogue going on on the trade front, we think both countries are interested in a mutually successful aerospace ecosystem. It's good for the economies of both countries. And here in the U.S., it's really important to U.S. manufacturing jobs. We have about 13,000 companies in our supply chain here in the U.S. that are supporting that kind of manufacturing growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Has the air supply chain changed in any way because of your services business? I mean, you're pursuing this more aggressive strategy, does that mean that in time -- in terms of selling a plane to somebody or a business, then you want to maintain that plane as well by using the services there, but are you taking away business from the suppliers?</p><p>MUILENBURG: We're actually see this as a grow the pie business. So, something we can do jointly with our suppliers. Services is our biggest single-growth opportunity. When you look at that $8-trillion marketplace, it's the place where we have the biggest opportunity to further grow. And we're bringing capabilities like parts distribution, maintenance, and modifications. New software, digital solutions, training solutions for our customers, doing that jointly with our suppliers.</p><p>To date -- year-to-date, our services business has grown 12 percent in a market that's growing about three percent a year. So, it is growing, growing strongly, and by doing this jointly with our supply chain, we can provide better light cycle value for our customers. And that's really the lens we're looking through here, not only how we design and build airplanes, but how do we provide value for our customers for post- production support.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This sounds like a natural fit. I mean, the commercial aerospace business has been so strong, and walk us through that for a moment because most people don't understand the number of people who've never been on an airplane.</p><p>MUILENBURG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The number of people who are perhaps in Asia who are wanting to travel, this is a big opportunity for you. So, this is also an economic growth story.</p><p>MUILENBURG: It is. And, Maria, you bring up a really great point. As I said earlier, traffic is growing -- passenger traffic at about six to seven percent a year completely outstripping GDP. And some of the things that are driving that is the upcoming middle class that for the first time ever, is able to travel. So, we have this unique combination of backlogs, seven years of backlog. And every year in Asia alone, 150 million people fly for the first time. Less than -- less than 20 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's amazing.</p><p>MUILENBURG: Less than 20 percent of the world's population has ever taken a single flight. So, think about the growth opportunity that's still ahead of us, and we're feeding right into that with our design and productions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But here we have worries in the market, down 600 points yesterday, worries from economic worries that things are going to slow down.</p><p>MUILENBURG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, where are we on that in your view? You've got interest rates rising obviously when a company or country buys a plane, or several planes, they are in many parts doing it by borrowing, their borrowing costs are going up with interest rates. How much of a headwind will that be for you?</p><p>MUILENBURG: We're not seeing it affect our business. Again, we have a much longer term view. Today, we have a backlog of almost 5800 commercial airplanes if you think of that in terms of production volume, it's about seven years of backlog.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MUILENBURG: So, this gives us the opportunity to think long term in terms of capital investment, innovation investment. And while we pay attention to things like interest rates and the financial markets, it's not something that's really affecting near-term buying behavior. You know, today, we're selling 737 Maxes, filling our production skyline out in 2023 and beyond. So, we have a much longer term perspective. Aerospace is a strong long- term growing business. It's not -- it's no longer a cyclical business. This is a long term sustained growth business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the competition is fierce. I mean, airbus -- can airbus sell to European countries and companies with no tariffs? So, are you disadvantaged by the tariff situation given the fact that a European jetmaker Airbus can do it a lot cheaper?</p><p>MUILENBURG: Well, something we're paying close attention to. To date, we haven't been affected materially by the tariffs. Things that have affected steel and aluminum pricing. We source 90 percent of our aluminum here in the U.S. so it hasn't been a dramatic effect on us, but it's something we're paying a close attention to. The bottom line is it's a very competitive marketplace because it's a very attractive marketplace. Now, we have to continue to invest, to compete. We have to continue to invest to innovate. Tax reform, for example, in the U.S. has been something that has really helped us gain a level-playing field globally so that we can compete and win.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How can you grow the defense business at this point? A lot of worries that defense spending needs to either be capped or cut, given the trillion-dollar deficits we're talking about every day and the debt of 21 trillion.</p><p>MUILENBURG: Yes, we see the defense budget here in the U.S. sustained, and if you look back a couple of years when we were in the middle of sequestration. We feel like we're in a stronger budget position now on both sides of the aisle. So, we look to the U.S. defense budget to remain strong. But we also see growth around the world. Today, about a third of our defense backlog is outside the U.S. So, again, this is a very global business, and there's a lot of defense growth opportunities outside of the U.S., and I think the thing that's unique about Boeing is when we think about growth, we look across commercial defense and services. We're really the only aerospace company that can bring great big critical mass to all three of those sectors.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching that. Dennis, it's great to have you on the program.</p><p>MUILENBURG: Likewise. Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Dennis Muilenburg, ceo at Boeing. We will be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: President Trump just tweeting again. He says this, \"By the way, when the helicopter couldn't fly to the first cemetery in France because of almost zero visibility. I suggested driving, Secret Service said no, too far from airport and big Paris shutdown. Speech next day at the American cemetery in pouring rain! Little reported -- Fake News.\" The President referring to some criticism that he received from the media on failing to go the cemetery that dual.</p><p>We want to turn to Amazon, congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slamming Amazon's plans to partially bring (INAUDIBLE) headquarters to New York City. Joining me right now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney. And Stuart, there was a reason that so many cities across this country were vying for Amazon to come to their city and set up their new headlines. Does she not understand business and economics?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: No, she does not. I don't think she wants to. There's no pleasing some people, and that's the truth. There's no pleasing a socialist. I'll quote you exactly what she said. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, Amazon is a-billion-dollar company. The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks is extremely concerning to residents here. Has the company promised to hire in the existing community? What's the quality of jobs? How many are promised? Are these jobs low wage or high wage? Are there benefits? Can people collectively bargain? There's just no satisfying a socialist. They see no benefit to investment, capital infusion and growth. They don't see it. They simply see a big corporation. Give me the money. I just want the money. That's what it's all about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: I'm astonished, actually. I would have thought that when you bring 25,000 new jobs, a couple of billion dollars to your city, it would be universally approved, but apparently not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but the first thing she does, Dagen, is she complains that Amazon is getting tax breaks (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: And she says Queens City councilman, Jimmy Van Bramer and state Senator Gianaris have also come out against the Amazon deal while Mayor Bill de Blasio says that this could be the single biggest economic development deal in the history of New York City. So, here's a word, Amazon, find another city, I dare you.</p><p>VARNEY: For once, I'm on Bill de Blasio's side.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stuart, I know you'll have more in 10 minutes. We'll see you at the top of the hour, thank you so much. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Stay with us.</p><p>But first, driving innovation, we got a behind-the-scenes look at the journal's technology conference, featuring the CEO of Uber.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The future of technology, the Wall Street Journal's Tech D.Live conference is underway this morning where big names and descending on Laguna Beach, California. Susan Li is there. Susan, good morning.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Maria. Yes, we'll be talking all things tech here in Laguna beach. That includes government regulation, innovation, and future partnerships. Now, later on, to the program, will feature a lot of heavyweights, that includes Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, one of the headliners. And then, we have celebrity attendance as well. Gwyneth Paltrow will be holding the evening session along with Kevin Hart, the comedian. Last night, we heard from AT&amp;T's Randall Stephenson who has some interesting things to say about President Trump, about Jim Acosta, Time Warner and CNN, and we also heard from (INAUDIBLE) of Google.</p><p>Now, we also caught up with Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's former CEO, billionaire, owner of the L.A. Clips. And I think that the overarching theme her are like going to be so far has been this -- talk about the relationship between the White House and big tech. And whether or not they'll be more regulation in the future of big Silicon Valley names. I asked Steve Ballmer this. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT: I don't think Microsoft has much risk at all right now. We certainly had ours in the past. Amazon will have their own set of issues. The most important thing for anybody running a successful tech company where there's not a clear issue. It's just to continue to do their job well, be responsible. I think Amazon has done a very good job so far.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LI: Yes. It was an -- a great job, Jeff Bezos has done a great job as Steve Ballmer says. We'll talk more later on today and we have more interviews coming to you and coming on Fox Business from Laguna Beach. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really good stuff. Susan, thank you. Susan Lee joining us there in Laguna. Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel. Back In a Minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, final thoughts from this all-star panel. Lindsey Bell.</p><p>BELL: Look, the markets might be going well, but the bedrock of the country, the consumer is strong and we saw that in Home Depot's numbers and we'll here about that from retailers later this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bullish (INAUDIBLE) Mitch?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And I think the markets just need to calm down. You know, sometimes good news is bad news, and bad news is good news. Right now, the market just needs to calm down, calm down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. So, it's the stability. Look long term, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And New York City, I'm going to tweet this. I think the Governor of the New York -- of New York state and the major of New York City, maybe need to do a conference call with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to explain what 25,000 jobs mean in terms of the tax revenue, and how that actually helps fix the New York City subways.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And there's a reason that every city in the country wanted the Amazon headquarters.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: They all wanted it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018111303cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TR5-3G61-JB20-G139-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 13, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

Meissner: </emphasis>I majored in entrepreneurship because I always wanted to start my own company. Once you actually start to dive into starting a business, the real world risks involved become a bit daunting. The notion of becoming a financial planner really clicked for me because it was an opportunity to start a potentially lucrative independent business venture, but with a set of instructions and low financial outlay.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Describe what you do.</emphasis></p><p>I work to imbue others with passion. I split about a third of my time between running my personal practice, recruiting advisors into our office (and often into the industry), and developing the practices of new advisors.</p><p>With clients, it's about getting them to feel excited about planning for their future. Having a plan dramatically increases your chances for success in life.</p><p>When I'm recruiting or working with new advisors, I talk a lot about \"The 4 I's\" of why people do what we do: Impact, Income, Independence, and Intellectual stimulation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Share an achievement you are especially proud of.</emphasis></p><p>I'm most proud of earning my designations: Chartered Life Underwriter, Chartered Financial Consultant and Chartered Financial Planner.</p><p>This is a competitive industry and being the best means balancing the triad of success, which in my opinion comes down to: client interaction and service, practice management, and professional knowledge and/or continuing education. I am currently working on my Masters of Science in Financial Services (MSFS).</p><p>Another achievement that I am very proud of is building our clientele.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest challenge that you see in the industry or what is the one thing you would change?</emphasis></p><p>The first challenge is the lack of millennials entering the business combined with the fact that the average age of a financial advisor is around 57 years old. The second challenge is the threat of technology or robo-advisors combined with a misunderstanding of what financial planning actually is. With the advent of robo-advisors, consumers are increasingly looking toward online resources for advice.</p><p>Also, we no longer mirror the markets we serve: millennials continue to show increasing dedication to planning for their future and women are taking a more pivotal role in the planning process. Constantly changing laws and regulations require new fresh minds to reinvent the industry and client service.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest opportunity that you see in the industry?</emphasis></p><p>The biggest opportunity is getting young people, women and minorities excited about a career in financial services. This will allow us to stay viable as an industry.</p><p>We also need to be better about leveraging technology to serve our needs, not just within planning and advising but within marketing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you think millennials are looking for in an advisor? How can advisors best serve this market?</emphasis></p><p>Our generation spends a lot of time online. When we want advice on things, our knee-jerk response is to search for the answer on the Internet.</p><p>What millennials want from an advisor is both the types of advice that they can't get from a robot, and an ear to listen and counsel. It comes down to emotional management.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the No. 1 piece of advice you would give to a young person looking to enter this industry?</emphasis></p><p>The main concern I hear from young people is: \"I don't know if I am comfortable approaching my family or friends for business or referrals\".</p><p>Rather than seeing yourself as a sales person, see yourself as an advocate. The vast majority of people do not have a financial plan, and not one that is comprehensive and addresses the entire gamut of financial planning needs.</p><p>You won't always be prospecting through your friends and family; eventually your market will expand and referrals will flow from many different sources. View the interaction with friends and family as an opportunity to help the people you care for most.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(Related:</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2016/11/10/what-is-the-best-way-to-maintain-a-focus-on-growth\"> What Is the Best Way to Maintain a Focus on Growth?</url></emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">)</emphasis></emphasis></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alexa Meyer</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">26 </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bellevue, Washington</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial advisor</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pacific Capital Resource Group (The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company)</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ThinkAdvisor Life Health: </emphasis>Why did you choose a career in insurance or financial services?</p><p>I've always been a people person. I've always been a numbers person. There aren't many careers where these two components go hand in hand.</p><p>I loved that financial services gave me the ability to develop a practice in my own way and with my own personality showing through. I also sought an industry where I can have it all - the family life I always envisioned and a career that made an impact on the world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Describe what you do.</emphasis></p><p>I help empower families and business owners to make educated financial decisions for themselves and their future. My approach with my clients is to ensure that we are collaborating in the decision making process; I am the informant, educator, and advisor; they are not being told what to do. We form long-lasting, trusted relationships through this collaboration process as we continue to build their plan through the years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Share an achievement you are especially proud of.</emphasis></p><p>I was extremely honored to have earned the Bronze award for Penn Mutual's Career Builder of the Year. I really pushed myself that year beyond what I thought was possible and I'm so grateful I had the opportunity to make an impact on so many families that year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest challenge that you see in the industry or what is the one thing you would change?</emphasis></p><p>I see a lack of understanding in what kind of value we can impart. With so much media around robo-advisors and DIY solutions, it may look like we are heading toward obsolescence in the marketplace. However, as our clients know, a financial advisor's value doesn't necessarily always come in the form of high returns, but in the intangibles: hand-holding clients through complex strategies, having the tough conversations regarding risk management that they might otherwise not address or even think about, educating the client on options they may have never realized they had. This component of the relationship is often more valuable to our clients than the reduced fees they could get elsewhere by doing things on their own. This is what we need to focus on marketing in the future: the relationship.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest opportunity that you see in the industry?</emphasis></p><p>Women - that doesn't necessarily mean only working with single women or women as the primary breadwinner, but making sure you are connecting with the woman in the family in an important way. Women tend to enjoy working with professionals more than men. They are often more receptive to advice and therefore end up implementing planning faster.</p><p>Long-term, women also refer more clients than men typically do. Many women have been left of the financial planning process in the past, as it is traditionally an aspect of the household that men handle. By making them an equal partner at the table and getting everyone on the same page, the whole planning process moves a lot smoother.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you think millennials are looking for in an advisor? How can advisors best serve this market?</emphasis></p><p>Millennials are looking for information and education catered specifically to their situation. Young professionals are taught to research, to use their networks, and to use the internet as a sounding board for major decisions in life.</p><p>Despite this, most people realize that all the ready-made financial advice available to them on the web might not be as fine-tuned as they need it to be for practical and highly personal decision-making. This is where we can be of value. By demystifying the world of finance and taking an educational, unbiased approach to our client meetings, millennials see the value in working with professionals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the No. 1 piece of advice you would give to a young person looking to enter this industry?</emphasis></p><p>Begin with the end in mind! Create systems that you know you can sustain or reformat as your practice grows.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(Related:</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/06/11/penn-mutuals-president-was-talking-about-you\">Penn Mutual's President Was Talking About You</url></emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">)</emphasis></emphasis></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vladimir Nikitenko</emphasis></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">25</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Atlanta</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial planner</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lincoln Financial Advisors</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ThinkAdvisor Life Health: </emphasis>Why did you choose a career in insurance or financial services?</p><p>Vladimir Nikitenko: I always believed that people should pursue a career in something they were genuinely interested in. When talking to buddies in college, I would always ask if whatever they are studying for, if they research it and learn about it outside of what is taught in class and what was assigned. Following that logic, I was interested in finance well outside just the scope of school work... This lead me to purse my passion and become a financial advisor.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Describe what you do.</emphasis></p><p>I am an independent financial planner that focuses on comprehensive financial planning. I make an effort to know every detail about my client and use all that information to put together an all-encompassing financial planning, this includes retirement planning, investments, life insurance, long term care, college planning, and income planning. Once I have an objective plan, we then find the right products or services from a variety of sponsors to meet the needs of the plan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Share an achievement you are especially proud of.</emphasis></p><p>To me, sentimental achievements are much more important than purely worldly ones. Having said that, I honestly feel the greatest sense of accomplishment when I was able to take a client from start to finish, from chaotic to orderly, from uncertain to protected and knowing that after working with me, they are financially in a much better place than before they met me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest challenge you see in the industry, or what is the one thing you would change?</emphasis></p><p>Self-reliance. With easy access to information, many people believe that they can do everything themselves and ignore advice from professionals. This is not only in the finance industry, I see this in my wife when she tries to diagnose herself and our kids on WebMD. We cannot all be experts in everything, and people need to understand that they cannot do enough research to know what professionals that spend their whole day, and life doing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest opportunity you see in the industry?</emphasis></p><p>The average age of the current advisor. There are not enough young people in the industry and I believe that within the next decade there will be a ton of business and clients that will have to be passed down to the next generation of financial professionals. The need for good advice, planning, and quality financial products will remain, and being there to capture that opportunity is huge.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you think millennials are looking for in an advisor? How can advisors best serve this market?</emphasis></p><p>I think millennials need an advisor to tell them what they do not know. Professionals working with millennials need to be sharper and more educated and informed than ever before. With so much information out there, we need to truly be experts in our field. If millennials see this, I believe they will not hesitate to give us their business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the No. 1 piece of advice you would give to a young person looking to enter this industry?</emphasis></p><p>Do plenty of research to make sure you understand what will be expected of you, and how hard you will have to work to succeed, once you are in the business, no matter what happens, stick to your decision and know that you are in it for the long run.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(Related: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/06/20/great-american-parent-explains-annuity-unit-to-wal\">Great American Parent Explains Annuity Unit to Wall Street</url></emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">)</emphasis></emphasis></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Martin Pfannenstiel</emphasis></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">27</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Director of business development and chief compliance officer</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ChangePath</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kansas City, Missouri</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ThinkAdvisor Life Health: </emphasis>Why did you choose a career in insurance or financial services?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Martin Pfannenstiel:</emphasis> I got involved in the insurance industry while playing football at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. I grew up playing sports and was always an involved student, so when I was approached by Mark Heitz of Aviva a carrier located in Topeka, I was intrigued. I studied accounting during my undergrad, and working for a life insurance and annuity carrier allowed me to use both my analytical skills and outgoing personality simultaneously. I've always been somewhat of a go-getter, so after experiencing one aspect of the industry with Aviva, I was motivated to see how I could put my skills and background to use in other areas of the industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Please describe what you do.</emphasis></p><p>Essentially, I help provide advisors with advice on how to properly handle and allocate clients in order to ensure the best interest of the client is being met. ChangePath is a registered investment advisor with a direct affiliation to CreativeOne, an agent development organization, so I utilize both advisory and insurance services in order to meet clients' needs. In order to help advisors prepare for approaching DOL deadlines and fiduciary responsibilities, without incurring additional overhead costs, I utilize insurance products as an asset class to hedge portfolios, teach advisors how to weather economic volatility using insurance and integrate annuities into client portfolios.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Please share an achievement you are especially proud of and describe why.</emphasis></p><p>The achievement I am proudest of is obtaining my juris doctorate degree, along with successfully becoming certified to practice law in Kansas. The ability to have a legal understanding, while obtaining my taxation certification in law school, enables me to better serve others, advocate on behalf of advisors and positively impact those I work alongside.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest challenge you see in the industry, and what is the one thing you would do to change it?</emphasis></p><p>I think nearly everyone can agree one of the biggest challenges everyone faces is time. There's never enough time in the day to complete everything that needs to be done, such as implement technologies that could drastically mitigate or eliminate the majority of non-revenue driving activities or confer with peers and mentors about struggles and successes they've faced. We can't create more time - there are only so many hours in the day - but as an industry, we need to break down barriers so more advisors can implement technologies to scale their business and heighten the client experience. How do you change that? Embrace technology. Not only do the new technologies available provide time efficiencies, effectively scale practices, but they also provide transparency and better client experiences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest opportunity you see in the industry?</emphasis></p><p>Opportunity lies in the middle class. It's truly an underserved market, but one that has significant potential. Although we're in an information-overload culture and many are influenced by Google searching, it' hard to identify the intricacies of retirement planning that could impact them. Often, many don't know what they don't know. Nor, will they know where to look. And therein lies the opportunity for advisors. With the current regulations, opportunities are going to swing in favor of holistic planners because of the very nature of our business - clients seek long-lasting, foundational relationships with their planners. And, studies show the middle class sticks with them. As advisors, can we earn a coveted place with clients by being the primary contact for financial resources and knowledge? This increases your value and client retention. Like I said, clients often don't know what they don't know, and it's our responsibility to continually earn their business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you think millennials are looking for in an advisor? How can advisors best serve this market?</emphasis></p><p>I believe millennials are looking for many of the same things others seek: integrity, transparency, lower fees, better value and better stewards in general. And why shouldn't they get those things? I also believe they're in search of advisors who utilize better technology in their practices, in keeping up with the times. Older advisors with less innovative technology aren't having success capturing millennial clients as a result of the lack of a number of the factors I mentioned above.</p><p>The difference is millennials also want the long-term financial journey to be simplified and straightforward, so that's the approach we should take. And, how do you overcome those millennials seeking instant gratification? We effectively communicate and help them visualize the tremendous impact planning can have on their lifestyle. We're not trading oranges for apples. We're teaching them to trade oranges for a full apple tree later. If you can hone in on your presentation skills in a manner that resonates, it immediately becomes relevant. And that's the key to compensate for instant gratification-minded clients: relevancy. As advisors, everyone benefits when we are powerful and relevant story tellers that can help clients visualize their future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the No. 1 piece of advice you would give to a young person looking to enter this industry?</emphasis></p><p>My advice: finding a quality mentor is the key to success. And, there are qualities to look for in mentors that can help grow your business acumen and round out your soft skill set. Great mentors can be individuals who are still climbing, deeply vested in seeing you succeed, want to shape your future or help you better yourself. I am fortunate enough to have two extraordinary colleagues who have tremendously helped me, Mark Heitz and Lance Sparks.

My parents and I immigrated to the United States when I was around four years old. I attended several elementary schools, and I did not think much about a career in my younger years. Fast forward some years, I ultimately became the first in my family to attend college and I set out to pursue a career in hotel and casino management, which the school that I chose was well-known for. Along the way, I took a finance course and fell in love. When I graduated, I connected with a friend who had gone to work for Barnum Financial Group, and he encouraged me to come in for an interview. I entered the firm's training program and became an advisor in 2011. Since then, I've enjoyed building a business and truly helping my clients at the same time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Describe what you do.</emphasis></p><p>If I had to sum it up, I would say that I help my clients make smart financial decisions to achieve what they want, protect what they already have, and provide support for the people who depend on them. Most of my clients have multiple needs and they are looking for a personal CFO to quarterback their entire situation. I will often work with the other professionals in clients' lives such as their CPA and estate planning attorney.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Share an achievement you are especially proud of.</emphasis></p><p>I've won industry awards and firm recognition, but my biggest accomplishments I would mention are actual cases where my team has had a tremendous impact on a family. I've done a decent amount of work in the field of special needs planning, and one financial plan in particular ended with a result that was not only life-changing for the clients but also for me. Times like that remind me of why I am in this business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest challenge you see in the industry, or what is the one thing you would change?</emphasis></p><p>The upcoming changes to the Department of Labor's fiduciary rules going into effect in 2017 and 2018. I could not agree more that financial professionals should be held to high standards and this overall should be a good thing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest opportunity you see in the industry?</emphasis></p><p>This isn't exclusive to financial services, but for me the biggest opportunity I see is that, as things change, many advisors may not. This leaves such a huge gap to be filled by advisors who can put their clients' needs first and give solid advice.</p><p>Demographically, there are more and more people reaching certain milestone ages such as retirement, and also the older baby boomers aging a bit needing estate planning advice. At the same time, millennials are starting to have an impact on the economy and be in a position where they are able to save.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you think millennials are looking for in an advisor? How can advisors best serve this market?</emphasis></p><p>I think millennials want someone who is really engaged with them and trustworthy. They want to be able to reach you instantly if the need arises. The main way we can serve this market is by always innovating and remaining a few steps ahead of the game. We have to be able to use technology that will appeal to this younger generation. For example, I use a financial planning tool that allows a lot of interaction between the client and advisor, aggregates all of a person's finances on one screen, is viewable on an app, and supplements the financial education that my team personally gives.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the No. 1 piece of advice you would give to a young person looking to enter this industry?</emphasis></p><p>Come into the industry truly wanting to help people. Of course, as with starting any business, hard work is absolutely key, but even more important I would say is organization. Everything my team does is process driven, and because people have had a good experience much of our business currently comes from word of mouth and direct introductions.</p><p>Also, when I first came into the business, I did joint work with other advisors frequently and have always had a mentor. One way that I developed quickly and built the business in a short period of time is by learning from each and every one of these relationships. I always wanted to find that one valuable lesson or one great trait that others had and make it my own.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(Related:</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/06/25/meet-4-leaders-that-are-transforming-the-insurance\">Meet 4 Leaders That Are Transforming the Insurance Industry</url></emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">)</emphasis></emphasis></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maxwell Schmitz</emphasis></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">29</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">San Rafael, California</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vice president, marketing</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DI &amp; LTC Insurance Services</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ThinkAdvisor Life Health: </emphasis>Why did you choose a career in insurance or financial services?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maxwell Schmitz:</emphasis> I came for the work-life balance and stayed for the fulfillment of helping others. Working for a family agency, it was always evident to me that my parents had the unique ability to coach all my teams, join all the field trips, and kind of get away with taking a break at any point during the year. I was attracted to that. It didn't take long for me to realize that the products we sell are used to help people in their darkest hour. A devastating diagnosis can lead to a massive change in a client's lifestyle - for their whole family. There is so much to deal with at that moment in time. We are charged with insulating our clients from financial ruin in the wake of one of these life-changing events, even if we can't be there for them emotionally or physically. It's extremely rewarding to know that we have a role to play for someone going through so much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Describe what you do.</emphasis></p><p>I work with insurance advisors, benefits brokers, and financial planners to protect their clients in the event of a disability. It's my job to educate our network of advisors about the importance of income and asset protection, and how these policies actually work. My other job is to make sure our agency is still relevant in 10 to 30 years. That means innovation and market expansion. And that's been the driving force for our office since I joined seven years ago.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Share an achievement you are especially proud of.</emphasis></p><p>I was proud to serve as president of my [National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors] chapter at the age of 25. It was at that time that I co-authored a book on disability insurance. Since then I have completed my master of science in financial services. I am undertaking the tall task of making disability insurance accessible to the millennial marketplace by developing in-house drop-ticket solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest challenge you see in the industry, or what is the one thing you would change?</emphasis></p><p>The biggest challenge from my perspective as a disability specialist is the dwindling number of carriers. Most people are more likely to experience a disability during their working years than they are likely to die. Yet life insurance sales dwarf disability sales. Insurance, and financial planning in general, is very much a top-down marketing business. Clients buy what the agent sells. Agents sell what the industry supplies. An abundant supply of life insurance products has spawned a culture of life insurance. A sparse supply of disability and long-term care companies means there is simply not a natural consumer appetite for these products. If I had it my way each life insurer would carry a disability product so that advisors would understand the necessity of covering the risk of disability before the risk of death.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest opportunity you see in the industry?</emphasis></p><p>My generation. A workforce that is coming of age. The imminent realization that our parents are no longer a viable backup plan if we can't make it to work tomorrow. Many of us are now married. Having kids. Taking a mortgage. Adulting. We just refinanced our home and when it was finalized and sunk in I felt like I got suckerpunched with how old I felt in that moment. Many of my peers are having similar moments where they ask themselves, \"Who am I and how did I get here?\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you think millennials are looking for in an advisor? How can advisors best serve this market?</emphasis></p><p>I think it's important to consider the psychology of where we were and what we were watching when our financial brains were developing. Many of us were in school seeing headlines of a collapsing market, a housing crisis, and now paying down a mounting student loan debt with figures that are reminiscent of the subprime mortgage loans of yesteryear. We are looking forward to the \"auto\" industry - not cars, but automation and autonomy. Most millennial consumers have an expectation that has been met in some parts of the insurance economy: a self-guided sales process powered by an algorithm instead of a salesperson or advisor. However, this only works for commodities. The complicated nature of DI underwriting is the keystone that keeps disability insurance advice from crumbling into commodity-status like car insurance or term life. Fortunately, there are simplified underwriting programs for DI that are essentially designed for millennials (realistic but still significant benefit amounts). These programs utilize a few shortcuts that make it worthwhile for the casual consumer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the No. 1 piece of advice you would give to a young person looking to enter this industry?</emphasis></p><p>Have an open mind and pave your own way. Constantly evolving media and advancing technology mean that there is boundless opportunity for innovation in our field. I always root for the little guy and would love to see independent advisors relish the evolution as opposed to Big Tech coming in with the next wave of disruption. We are at a crossroads.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(Related:</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/05/11/individual-disability-insurance-sales-were-stable\">Individual Disability Insurance Sales Were Stable in 2016</url></emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">)</emphasis></emphasis></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wesley G.

How can advisors best serve this market?</emphasis></p><p>I believe millennials are looking for someone that's easy to work with and is trustworthy.

I saw the potential to help a lot of people and earn a good living depending on how hard I wanted to work. I also saw the potential with the market we work with at Bankers Life which focuses on baby boomers and seniors who have already retired.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Describe what you do</emphasis></p><p>I meet with individuals in retirement or pre-retirement who are needing help with insurance or financial planning. The company I work for has a specific process that I like to navigate through when it comes to helping these individuals. Prospecting is huge in this industry and that is the first step to getting in front of someone who needs my help. It is something that is always constant in my business.</p><p>When I sit down with a couple or individual the first thing I do is fact find. This is by far the most important step in my company's process. You can never properly nor ethically make a professional recommendation without this step. It is gathering information about what individuals have already planned for and what they still need to plan for. After fact finding is completed I make a recommendation if one is needed and 90 percent of the time it is. I am able to help my clients with a variety of different types of planning. Medicare, long-term care planning, financial planning, estate planning, etc.</p><p>The most important thing I do out of all of those things is building relationships. I strive to get to know each and every client very well along with their families. I have built some of the most valuable relationships a person could ask for. My clients do not just see me when they need something or have a question. If I am in the area I will just stop in sometimes and have a cup of coffee. That's what makes my career so enjoyable.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Share an achievement you are especially proud of</emphasis></p><p>I have many that I am proud of but the one that keeps me going was being named Rookie of the Year in 2014. Everyone always said that your first year is the hardest in this business. I am blessed to have achieved this award because there were many days I wanted to quit and give up but I just kept going. I knew there were people out there that needed my help and I wanted more for myself and my family so those are the things that made that achievement happen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest challenge you see in the industry?</emphasis></p><p>The biggest challenge I see in our industry is perception. Too many insurance professionals do not take the time to LISTEN. I find every day that someone has been sold something they did not need nor did they want and just felt pressured or did not know what it was or how it worked. It makes it harder for the agents that are actively trying to listen and help people. This is why educating my clients on what they already have planned for and haven't planned for is so important. I strive so that my clients can explain to me in detail what we have put in place and how it works and hope that other agents are doing the same.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest opportunity?</emphasis></p><p>The biggest opportunity I see in my business is helping the baby boomers. There are approximately 10,000 people every day that will which age 65. The company I work for, Bankers Life, believes in sitting down with people face to face. This is all a part of the process. I do not do business over the phone or through the mail. The market I work with loves the fact that they can put a face with a name and have their \"insurance person\" still come and sit down at their kitchen table to do business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are most millennials looking for in an advisor?</emphasis></p><p>I think most millennials are looking for someone they can relate to and an honest advisor. They want someone they can have a commonality with and not just feel like they are being sold something and never seeing that person again until there is an issue or question. They are looking for someone who would just stop by and say hello because they are in the neighborhood. Millennials look for someone they can trust or feel like they can rely on to put them in the best position possible.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the No. 1 piece of advice you would give to a young person looking to enter this industry?</emphasis></p><p>The number one piece of advice I would give to a young individual is to JUST LAST! It is going to seem impossible to achieve the smallest things when you first start but you have got to stay positive and motivated. I was constantly reaching out to my managers and veteran agents for advice and help. There were several times I wanted to quit in my first year and just kept going and I am so glad I did. I would not be where I am today had I let myself fail. Do not make failing an option no matter what it takes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(Related:</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2011/11/29/asba-chooses-ltc-advisor\">ASBA Chooses LTC Advisor</url></emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">)</emphasis></emphasis></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Glenn Usher</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">29</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Concord, New Hampshire</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Competitive services consultant</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lincoln Financial Group</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ThinkAdvisor Life Health: </emphasis>Why did you choose a career in insurance or financial services?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Glenn Usher:</emphasis> It was a long road before I ended up in financial services and to be honest, it wasn't my first choice initially but I'm grateful that I landed here. Originally, I went to school for engineering, then finance, and finally I majored in accounting. During my junior year I ended up landing an internship at Lincoln Financial Group in an internal auditing role. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">fascinating</emphasis> as that sounds, it was actually a really great role to have so early in my career as it exposed me to virtually all of the functions (and people) inside of the company. Networking with people at the same time you're auditing them is every bit as hard as it sounds, but I ultimately landed a permanent role with Lincoln as an analyst in the product development area. I worked in that role for 2 years before moving to the retail side to help advisors understand our company's products and where they fit in the marketplace. Helping to educate advisors on the various solutions available to their clients is extremely fulfilling as the work goes beyond the advisor and impacts clients and their families across the country.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Describe what you do.</emphasis></p><p>My role has evolved a great deal over the last several years. Currently I'm in a Field Development role on Lincoln's Competitive Services Team. My primary role is to support the sales team in helping Advisors and Agents understand my company's products as well as what the rest of the market has to offer. I specialize in the Long-Term Care market which has done its own share of evolving over the last decade. There are now several different tools and products an Advisor has at his/her disposal to help protect a client's wealth from expenses arising from a long-term care event. I spend a lot of time educating Agents and Advisors about all of those options, and when/why one product may be more appropriate than another in any particular situation. In my role I also act as a liaison from the field to the product development and marketing areas to ensure the voice from the field is resonating and we're helping to deliver products and content to meet the needs of our advisors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Share an achievement you are especially proud of.</emphasis></p><p>One achievement I'm particularly proud of would be helping several of our distribution partners build out their own curriculum when it comes to the topic of long-term care. Over the last few years a great deal of emphasis has been put on the importance of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">planning</emphasis> for long-term care, but not much in the way of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">how</emphasis> to go about doing it. After years of fielding questions such as: When does a stand-alone long-term care product make sense versus a Linked Benefit policy? Or, when/why should a client attach a Long-Term Care or Chronic Illness rider to a Life Insurance policy or Annuity? It was abundantly clear that there was a gap in education around 'which product when'. Acting in a consulting role to two of the larger banks and wire houses, I helped to shape the training modules they're now using to take the LTC conversation from the 'why' to 'how' we plan for long-term care. I'm proud of this achievement as it not only ensures that Advisors are having the conversation with their clients - which is something I'm extremely passionate about - but, also, that they now have the tools to be able to make the right decisions for their clients as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest challenge you see in the industry, or what is the one thing you would change?</emphasis></p><p>I think the biggest challenge in the industry, specifically the long-term care industry, is a lack of education around exactly what the risks are and how to solve them. The long-term care industry has taken a beaten in recent years due in large part by negative PR regarding the pricing actions many carriers have had to take on their in-force blocks of business. This, along with a lack of understanding of all of the LTC solutions out there and how they work has really hindered a market at a time that it should be blossoming.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the biggest opportunity you see in the industry?</emphasis></p><p>With every big challenge comes great opportunity - spoiler alert - it's long-term care planning. The financial services industry has been focused on the baby boomer generation for the last several decades when it comes to investment and insurance planning, but there's a huge gap in the level of long-term care planning that has been done for this generation. With over 10,000 baby boomers reaching the age of 65 every day, there's a huge opportunity staring us all in the face, but a difficult one to address. The long-term care conversation is an extremely difficult one to have with a client, but an extremely important one. Too often, advisors overlook the impact that even a short 2-year LTC claim would have on their client's portfolio. With a little additional planning this risk can be addressed and with the abundance of products on the market today, it's easier than ever to find a product that meets the client's specific needs - but it's really about having the conversation and just asking the question first.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you think millennials are looking for in an advisor? How can advisors best serve this market?</emphasis></p><p>I think millennials - like any generation - are looking for an advisor that speaks their language. Every generation has their own identity. With Millennials, it's technology. Millennials aren't just tech-<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">savvy</emphasis>, we <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">need</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">rely</emphasis> on technology as a vital part of our lives. Most of us have grown up with computers, cell phones, and the internet and become disoriented without it. The next time the power goes out in your house or office, keep an eye on the millennial and how helpless we become. The point I'm making is that millennials need to be presented thoughts and ideas in a different way than a Gen Xer or Baby Boomer because our values are different. We're impatient and rely heavily on technology - two things that don't necessarily jive with the current state of the insurance industry. As the industry invests resources and energy to make the insurance process faster, advisors need to continue to market themselves in the digital era as that's where millennials will go when they're looking for an advisor.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the No. 1 piece of advice you would give to a young person looking to enter this industry?</emphasis></p><p>Find a mentor or mentors, ask them as many questions as they'll answer, and don't make the same mistake twice. These are all clich\u00e9, but they're clich\u00e9 because they work. Having a reliable mentor that you can feel comfortable reaching out to ask even the most mundane questions is invaluable in this industry. Another benefit of having a more seasoned mentor is that you may be able to avoid that last point entirely. You wouldn't be making the same mistakes your mentor did if you followed through on the second point - never be afraid to make a mistake, but never be afraid to let someone else make it for you first.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(Related: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/04/21/the-secret-to-your-true-potential-is-fried-chicken\">The Secret to Your True Potential Is Fried Chicken</url></emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">)</emphasis></emphasis></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jordan Witt</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">29</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Crossville, Tennessee</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vice president and wealth advisor</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Witt Financial Group</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ThinkAdvisor Life Health: </emphasis>Why did you choose a career in insurance or financial services?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jordan Witt:</emphasis> My dad, and lifetime mentor, has been in the industry on and off since he was a young kid.

How can advisors best serve this market?</emphasis></p><p>I believe millennials are looking for someone they can trust.

The comment was written on Dec. 5, 2019, and posted on March 23, 2020:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The comment was co-signed by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, Center for Digital Democracy, American Academy of Pediatrics, Badass Teachers Association, Berkeley Media Studies Group, Center for Science in the Public Interest, Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development, Color of Change, Common Sense Media, Consumer Action, and</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Federation of California, Consumer Reports, Consumer Watchdog, Corporate Accountability, Defending the Early Years, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Electronic Privacy Information Center, Obligation Inc., Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, and</p><p>Parents Across America, Parents Television Council, Peace Educators Allied For Children Everywhere, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Public Citizen, Public Knowledge, Story of Stuff, Teachers Resisting Unhealthy Childhood Entertainment, UnidosUS, United Church of Christ and USPIRG.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The undersigned 31 groups are pleased to submit this comment regarding the FTC's implementation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (\"COPPA Rule\"). As it considers how best to advance privacy and protect children, the FTC must first begin by using its authority under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act to answer critical questions about online digital advertising, children on general audience platforms, data brokers, and education technology that will inform the agency's approach. The FTC must not adopt any privacy-related rule or policy change unless and until it conducts the necessary studies./1</p><p>The information marketplace that drives online digital advertising is extremely complicated, and 6(b) studies of these issues are long overdue. Websites, apps, platforms, and content providers all have access to a wealth of user information-- including classes of information that constitute \"personal information\" under COPPA. Service providers collect this information to deliver functionality, but also to analyze performance and track, predict, and modify user behavior--including across multiple services and devices. Unnecessary data collection is common, transparency is rare, and misrepresentations about data practices are far too widespread. A comprehensive examination of these practices is severely needed.</p><p>The FTC's current Notice of Inquiry seeking comments on the COPPA Rule further underscores the need for the requisite 6(b) studies. Many details about online operators' COPPA compliance practices are not known to the public due to a general lack of transparency, rendering it impossible for advocates, parents, and concerned citizens to answer many of the questions in the Commission's Notice. For example, a number of the questions the agency raises about the efficacy of certain mechanisms can only be answered with information that industry stakeholders solely have access to-- the kind of information that both the FTC and the public must be able to evaluate without a filter.</p><p>While the agency has previously examined the issue of children's app disclosures on a smaller scale, it does not appear to have ever conducted a formal 6(b) inquiry into the collection and use of children's data./2</p><p>That should change, and the FTC cannot base substantive policy decisions on the current dearth of details about how the information ecosystem functions. Rather, the FTC must conduct and complete a series of long-overdue studies to shed light on these opaque industries before it adopts any privacy-related rulemaking or major policy change.</p><p>The FTC should use its 6(b) authority to examine new methods of advertising to children</p><p>Advertising to children is a lucrative, booming business, and not enough is understood about these new methods of surveilling and monetizing children, or the impact that it has on their privacy and wellbeing./3</p><p>Cross-device identification has become ubiquitous, and makes it easier for advertisers to track children between devices./4</p><p>Ad attribution, the process of identifying user actions in an advertising transaction, has become more granular, and new \"persona\"-based techniques have enabled more detailed tracking./5</p><p>As the digital media industry has increasingly turned to technology that incorporates artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and virtual reality, marketing and data-gathering techniques have evolved accordingly./6</p><p>\"Playable\" ads--ads with a game component--are another new and particularly manipulative advertising format for children when they already struggle to discern organic content from advertisements./7</p><p>The widespread adoption of a new series of metrics that provides details on content online--\"brand safety\"--also creates a wealth of data previously unavailable to marketers, brands, agencies and even the platforms themselves.</p><p>These techniques and others give rise to a slew of questions about new datadriven marketing techniques and their impact on children. These include: What kinds of new advertising practices are emerging, particularly given that browser blocking, third-party ad blocking, GDPR, and CCPA are putting pressures on the ad industry to find alternatives to traditional tracking methods? What is the likely impact of these new methods on a children's psycho-social development, and what is the impact on the family and social interactions? What kinds of data are collected via these new applications, especially with regard to being able to make inferences about behavioral and psychological traits? What data is collected for attribution purposes and is this data collected under the internal operations exception? What data, including personal data, is collected via brand safety measures with regard to children and teen sites, and how is it used?</p><p>There is also a series of related questions on how data collected from children could be used on a discriminatory basis. How pervasive is the use of classifications (or proxies) for race, ethnicity, or indicators of socio-economic status? Which demographics are excluded or targeted for which kinds of marketing efforts? What datasets and applications are used to specifically target children of color?/8</p><p>Given years of research demonstrating that digital advertising can lead to unintentional discrimination, are advertisers considering how their ads could be targeting children on a discriminatory basis, and if so, how to prevent that? Have online services disregarded evidence of their products or ads having discriminatory effects? Are they considering how unhealthy foods and beverages may be marketed on a discriminatory basis?</p><p>The FTC should use its 6(b) authority to examine practices concerning data collection and retention</p><p>Considering the well-documented weaknesses of consent as a foundation for privacy protections, a crucial component of ensuring the protection of children's privacy is how companies are actually using the data they collect, and when (and whether) they're deleting it. In a recent complaint to the FTC, child advocates noted that Amazon did not delete children's information unless and until a parent requested the company do so, which violates COPPA./9</p><p>It's also very difficult for parents to get a comprehensive understanding about the kind of information being collected from or created about their children when technology pervades children's lives at school, at after-school activities, and in friends' homes.</p><p>Questions the FTC should be asking include: What are the common deletion practices for companies that collect children's information, including general audience products and ed tech products in schools? What kinds of data are companies collecting about children? What methods are being used to analyze this data and what kinds of actionable decisions are being made as a result? What kind of data are the companies collecting from students in schools? How are schools choosing the ed tech products they use on students, and do they have any strategies to dispel conflicts of interest in product procurement, such as companies buying administrators and teachers expensive meals, or the use of brand ambassadors? How are schools obtaining consent from parents for products and services subject to COPPA?</p><p>The FTC should use its 6(b) authority to illuminate children's presence on \"general audience\" platforms and those platforms' awareness of children's presence</p><p>General audience platforms purport to lack awareness of children on their platforms to avoid incurring liability under COPPA, but without more details it is impossible to accurately assess the problem. Indeed, there is evidence that so-called general audience platforms have access to information regarding children using their services, raising serious questions about their claims of ignorance. Leading platforms have incorporated a range of techniques to both attract and monetize children, as well as developing various methods to identify potential concerns, such as suicidal ideation.</p><p>For example, one recent Washington Post article on the failure of general audience platforms to comply with COPPA described how companies delete any child users they find, but companies like Instagram declined to provide any numbers (how many users and over what period)./10</p><p>Nor is it widely understood how companies that position their platforms as \"general audience\" detect and identify children on their platforms. In addition, a number of third parties claim the ability to detect child-directed content on general audience platforms for the purpose of offering \"brand safety\" services to brands, ensuring that inappropriate ads are not paired with child-directed content. At the FTC's recent COPPA workshop, many industry voices suggested that many of the viewers of child-directed content are actually adults, and that the FTC should carve out exceptions to COPPA for these viewers on child-directed content.</p><p>These practices and claims give rise to many questions. Leading platforms and brands have a wealth of proprietary measurement and other data that can help the commission better understand how these services recognize child users. How do companies know when adults are engaging with child-directed content on general audience platforms, and how frequently does this occur? How many children are on \"general audience\" platforms? How are children and child-directed content detected both by those platforms themselves and by third parties? What signals do general audience platforms receive when a user arrives at their site that might help determine whether that person is an adult or a child? Given the pervasive use of general audience recording technology, such as smart TVs and smart speakers, how are companies dealing with the collection of children's information? What happens when IoT devices, including smart toys,/11 collects data, including voice and video recordings, from a child who is not a member of the family that owns the device?</p><p>The FTC should use its 6(b) authority to identify how the data of children is being used by contemporary data platforms, including \"marketing clouds,\" \"identity management\" systems, in-house data management platforms, and data brokers.</p><p>Over the last several years, entire new categories of data gathering, analytics and activation platforms have emerged, creating a new regime for the collection and use of information. Consolidation of the data market, as well as the ability to provide informational resources for profiling and targeting in real time, has seen the emergence of various data and marketing clouds, such as by Oracle,/12 Adobe,/13 and others. These vast new databases, which contain data on individuals and from multiple sources, enable \"one-stop shopping\" so consumers--including young people--can be profiled and targeted based on their race/ethnicity, geolocation, cultural and other interests.</p><p>Leading brands like Coca Cola,/14 PepsiCo/15 and McDonald's/16 have built extensive in-house data analytics and targeting systems, constructing their own data management platforms that facilitate the use of their \"first-party\" data assets through programmatic and other forms of targeting. With many companies now their own data brokers, new ways of compiling and analyzing data have emerged. Advances in data analytics also enable data \"cloning\" and targeting of vast numbers of people based on the use of information derived from a single person, known as \"lookalike modeling.\"/17</p><p>Ad-supported \"app\" business models using data for targeting and measurement techniques also pose a privacy concern for children. Methods for user \"acquisition,\" audience segmentation,/18 identifying \"lifetime value,\"/19 \"user level insights,\"/20 and use of \"mediation\" techniques for multiple ad networks,/21 have created a landscape that undermines children's privacy.</p><p>Children are a significant focus of this new data management environment, given their significant spending power and value as a market. Yet there are no independent studies to examine how these new aspects of today's digital data complex impact their privacy, or how it erodes the ability of their parents to identify potential harms and make decisions about their privacy given the multitude of possible uses that these new, first-party management platforms enable.</p><p>Past studies have demonstrated that data brokers collect information on teenagers and students, and attribute child-related information to parents, but there have not been comprehensive studies on data brokers' collection of children's information specifically. At the same time, children's information is known to be commercially valuable because children influence family purchasing, are easily persuaded by ads, and develop key brand loyalties in childhood that may persist for years or even decades. A group of researchers at the Fordham Center on Law and Information Policy conducted an illuminating study on data brokers' collection of student information and found that an alarming number of brokers collect and market information about teenaged students./22</p><p>Yet similar studies do not exist about data brokers' collection and use of information from and about children specifically.</p><p>Questions the FTC should consider include: What kinds of information are data brokers compiling about children and students? What are there sources for this information, and to whom are they selling it? What kinds of first-party data management platforms are companies using to compile and analyze children's information?</p><p>The FTC should use its 6(b) authority to illuminate the efficacy--or lack thereof--of safe harbors</p><p>The FTC has asked the public to comment on whether the safe harbor process has been effective in enhancing COPPA compliance. But only the safe harbors themselves and the FTC are privy to crucial facts like how many violations have been brought to the harbor organizations' attention, how many were acted upon, the real-world impact on the composition of sites' visitors, and similar metrics. Since July 2014, all COPPA safe harbors have been required to file reports summarizing their annual comprehensive review of each subject operator's information policies, practices, and representations, as well as any disciplinary actions taken. But these annual reports have never been made public. CDD filed a request for copies of these reports under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"). Although the FTC eventually made copies of some of these reports available to CDD, the FTC redacted all information that was needed to assess the effectiveness of the safe harbor program./23</p><p>Notably, representatives from two COPPA safe harbor organizations, Privo and CARU, called for increased transparency for safe harbors at the FTC's October 7th workshop.</p><p>To assess the effectiveness of the safe harbor program, the FTC and the public need much more information than is presently available. For example, what percentage of child-directed websites, apps, and other online services participate in safe harbor programs? How (and how often) do safe harbors enforce their requirements and resolve complaints? How do they handle recidivism? These questions cannot be answered without additional information.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The necessary 6(b) studies on the issues outlined above would be consistent with calls by the Commission to base privacy policy-making on empirical data. As Commissioner Christine Wilson has said, \"effective regulation requires a clear 'what,' 'why,' and 'how.'\"/24</p><p>In the words of Chairman Joseph Simons, regulation requires \"rely[ing] as much as possible on evidence and the data, and re-assess[ing] the evidence and data periodically.\"/25</p><p>And Commissioner Phillips stated recently at the FTC's public workshop examining COPPA, \"any rulemaking must be grounded in facts, and supported by data and empirical evidence.\"</p><p>6(b) studies also serve an important public education function, enabling the FTC to shed light on non-transparent industry operations not only to inform its own policymaking, but also to inform interested members of the public. Accordingly, further investigation and reporting of industry data collection and use practices is essential in allowing consumer advocacy groups to contribute in addressing children's privacy harms.</p><p>The FTC should not reformulate any privacy-related policy based on woefully incomplete information. The FTC should operate with haste to undertake the requisite 6(b) studies of online digital advertising, children on general audience platforms, data brokers, and education technology to help inform the agency's approach to children's privacy. Only with more complete information can the agency and the public fully understand what is at stake, and how agency policy can best serve children's privacy. We will follow up with additional questions and suggestions for companies to consider in the agency's 6(b) study.</p><p>Respectfully submitted,</p><p>Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood</p><p>Center for Digital Democracy</p><p>American Academy of Pediatrics</p><p>Badass Teachers Association</p><p>Berkeley Media Studies Group</p><p>Center for Science in the Public Interest</p><p>Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development</p><p>Color of Change</p><p>Common Sense Media</p><p>Consumer Action</p><p>Consumer Federation of America</p><p>Consumer Federation of California</p><p>Consumer Reports</p><p>Consumer Watchdog</p><p>Corporate Accountability</p><p>Defending the Early Years</p><p>Electronic Frontier Foundation</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center</p><p>Obligation, Inc.</p><p>Parent Coalition for Student Privacy</p><p>Parents Across America</p><p>Parents Television Council</p><p>P.E.A.C.E.

Irresponsible data practices lead to a broad range of harms, including discrimination in employment, housing, healthcare, and advertising. They also lead to data breaches and loss of individuals\u2019 control over personal information. Existing enforcement mechanisms fail to hold data processors accountable and provide little-to-no relief for privacy violations.  The privacy principles outline four concepts that any meaningful data protection legislation should incorporate at a minimum:      Privacy protections must be strong, meaningful, and comprehensive. </p><p>    Data practices must protect civil rights, prevent unlawful discrimination, and advance equal opportunity.     Governments at all levels should play a role in protecting and enforcing privacy rights.     Legislation should provide redress for privacy violations.  These public interest privacy principles include a framework providing guidelines for policymakers considering how to protect the privacy of all Americans effectively while also offering meaningful redress. They follow three days of Federal Trade Commission hearings about big data, competition, and privacy as well as the comment deadline on \u201cDeveloping the Administration\u2019s Approach to Privacy,\u201d a request for comment from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration as the agency works to develop privacy policy recommendations for the Trump Administration, and ongoing work at the National Institute for Standards and Technology to develop a privacy risk framework.  The groups urge members of Congress to pass privacy legislation that ensures fairness, prevents discrimination, advances equal opportunity, protects free expression, and facilitates trust between the public and companies that collect their personal data.  New America\u2019s Open Technology Institute, Public Knowledge, Access Humboldt, Access Now, Berkeley Media Studies Group, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, Center for Digital Democracy, Center for Media Justice, Center on Privacy &amp; Technology at Georgetown Law, Color of Change, Common Cause, Common Sense Kids Action, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Customer Commons, Demand Progress, Free Press Action Fund, Human Rights Watch, Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Media Alliance, Media Mobilizing Project, National Association of Consumer Advocates, National Consumer Law Center, National Consumers League, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Oakland Privacy, Open MIC (Open Media and Information Companies Initiative), Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Public Citizen, U.S. PIRG, and United Church of Christ, OC Inc. signed the principles. Additional local and national privacy advocates are encouraged to sign on.  The following can be attributed to Eric Null, Senior Policy Counsel at New America\u2019s Open Technology Institute:  \u201cFor decades, privacy regulation has favored the company over the user -- companies set their own rules and users are left to fend for themselves. Worse, companies have even discriminated based on protected classes through algorithmic decision-making. Comprehensive privacy legislation must disrupt this status quo. Legislation that follows the public interest privacy principles will better protect users and give users more control over their data.\u201d  The following can be attributed to Allie Bohm, Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge:  \u201cIt is imperative that any comprehensive privacy legislation reflect the concerns, interests, and priorities of actual human beings. Today, consumer protection, privacy, and civil rights groups come together to articulate those interests, priorities, and concerns. Importantly, these principles address the many harms people can experience from privacy violations and misuse of personal data, including enabling unfair price discrimination; limiting awareness of opportunities; and contributing to employment, housing, health care, and other forms of discrimination.\u201d  The following can be attributed to Amie Stepanovich, U.S. Policy Manager at Access Now:  \u201cFrom Europe to India to Brazil, data privacy legislation is becoming the norm around the world, and people in the United States are getting left behind. It is long past time that our legislators acted to protect people across the country from opaque data practices that can result in its misuse and abuse, and any acceptable package must start with these principles.\u201d  The following can be attributed to Josh Golin, Executive Director at Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood:  \u201cWhat big tech offers for \u2018free\u2019 actually comes at a high cost -- our privacy. Worst of all is how vulnerable kids are tracked online and then targeted with manipulative marketing. This has to stop. We need laws that will empower parents to protect their children\u2019s privacy.\u201d  The following can be attributed to Joseph Jerome, Policy Counsel at Center for Democracy &amp; Technology:  \u201cDebates about national privacy laws focus on how companies should implement Fair Information Practices. The operative word is \u2018fair.\u2019 When it comes to how companies collect, use, and share our data, too many business practices are simply unfair. Federal law must go beyond giving consumers more notices and choices about their privacy, and we think it is time for legislators in Congress to flip the privacy presumption and declare some data practices unfair.\u201d  The following can be attributed to Katharina Kopp, Director of Policy at Center for Digital Democracy:  \u201cTo this day, U.S. citizens have had to live without effective privacy safeguards. Commercial data practices have grown ever more intrusive, ubiquitous and harmful. It is high time to provide Americans with effective safeguards against commercial surveillance. Any legislation must not only effectively protect individual privacy, it must advance equitable, just and fair data uses, and must protect the most vulnerable among us, including children. In other words, they must bring about real changes in corporate practices. We have waited long enough; the time is now.\u201d  The following can be attributed to Laura Moy, Executive Director at Center on Privacy &amp; Technology at Georgetown Law:  \u201cAmericans want their data to be respected, protected, and used in ways that are consistent with their expectations. Any new legislation governing commercial data practices must advance these goals, and also protect us from data-driven activities that are harmful to society. We need privacy to protect us from uses of data that exclude communities from important opportunities, enable faceless brokers to secretly build ever-more-detailed profiles of us, and amplify political polarization and hate speech.\u201d  The following can be attributed to Yosef Getachew, Director of Media and Democracy Program at Common Cause:  \u201cAn overwhelming majority of Americans believe they have lost control over how their personal information is collected and used across the internet ecosystem. Numerous data breaches and abuses in data sharing practices, which have jeopardized the personal information of millions of Americans, have validated these fears. Our current privacy framework no longer works, and the lack of meaningful privacy protections poses a serious threat to our democracy. Companies can easily manipulate data to politically influence voters or engage in discriminatory practices. These principles should serve as a baseline for any comprehensive privacy legislation that guarantees all Americans control over their data.\u201d  The following can be attributed to James P. Steyer, CEO and Founder, at Common Sense:  \u201cAny federal legislation should provide for strong baseline protections, particularly for the most surveilled and vulnerable generation ever -- our kids. These principles reflect that as privacy, consumer, and civil rights advocates, we only want federal legislation that will move the ball forward in terms of protecting kids, families, and all of us.\u201d  The following can be attributed to Linda Sherry, director of national priorities at Consumer Action:  \u201cOur country has floundered far too long without strong federal regulations governing data collection, retention, use and sharing. These privacy principles, developed by a coalition of leading consumer, civil rights and privacy organizations, are offered as a framework to guide Congress in protecting consumers from the many harms that can befall them when they are given little or no choice in safeguarding their data, and companies have few, if any, restrictions on how they use that information.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN985921520181113</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TR2-1611-DXCW-D23M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 13, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

After a miserable performance during a volatile 2011, that outperformance is still missing as hedge funds pared risk and haven't participated in this year's rally.Hedge funds, which cater to wealthy investors by chasing higher returns for bigger fees, did not live up to high investor expectations this year. Hennessee Group, an adviser to hedge fund investors, said its own hedge fund index fell 4.3% in 2011, compared with a flat finish for the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">S&amp;P 500</emphasis>. Hennessee Group's hedge fund index perked up in January, rising 2.5%. However, that trailed a gain of more than 4% for the S&amp;P 500.</p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"240\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bill Ackman, Pershing Square</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>\"January was a good month for hedge funds. After a 4.6% decline last year, the industry has a more positive outlook for 2012,\" Lee Hennessee, managing principle of Hennessee Group, said in an emailed statement. \"It is encouraging to see a respectable gain even with managers conservatively positioned. Looking forward, managers are still cautious but are optimistic on the potential to generate positive alpha.\"A solid performance in January still doesn't wash away a bad December for hedge funds. TrimTabs Research estimates that the hedge fund industry lost $7 billion in December as industry assets fell about 8% in 2011. Assets are at their lowest since February 2010, TrimTabs said, which is in part because of performance. From May 2011 onward, hedge fund performance was negative in every month except October, TrimTabs added.While it is encouraging that performance is starting to pick up to start 2012, investors in those funds likely aren't happy that hedge funds failed to deliver during tough times. Charles Gradante, co-founder of Hennessee Group, says that after several months of treading water, managers may be primed for a strong turnaround this year.\"The top-performing managers were positioned for a January rally and were long stocks that underperformed in 2011,\" Gradante said in an emailed statement, arguing that stocks have rallied this year on fundamentals rather than economic or political news. For that reason, investors might find guidance in picking stocks by following where the smart money moved during the fourth quarter.The first place for investors to look at hedge fund positioning is the spate of recently released 13-F filings. Hedge fund and investment managers who oversee more than $100 million are required to disclose their equity holdings, options and convertible debt on a Form 13F filed to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Securities and Exchange Commission</emphasis>within 45 days of the end of a quarter. Funds aren't required to report short positions betting on declines, derivatives, bonds or currency bets.TheStreet pored over more than 40 fourth-quarter regulatory filings by some of the biggest hedge fund managers to examine what the smart money bought before we entered 2012. The most important trends for the quarter, broken down by sector, are highlighted on the following pages.</p><h>Energy</h><p>The energy sector saw plenty of hedge fund activity and it's no wonder why. Energy stocks in the S&amp;P 500 jumped 17.6% in the fourth quarter, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ, the best performance of any of the S&amp;P 500's 10 sectors during the three-month period. This performance came as crude oil prices surged from about $76 per barrel in October to more than $100 by late December. In 2012, these bets have paid off with a 5% return for the energy sector, although that trails six other sectors of the S&amp;P 500.This upward move in crude prices and energy stocks has likely benefitted a handful of hedge fund managers, assuming they continue to hold shares of oil stocks. Hedge funds like Brevan Howard, Bridgewater Associates, Centaurus Capital, Moore Capital and Tudor Investment, among many others, all upped their exposure to energy stocks during the fourth quarter.It hasn't all been about the recent jump in the price of oil, though. In the fourth quarter, the energy sector as a whole saw earnings growth of 6.5%, third-best of any other sector during the quarter, according to FactSet Research analyst John Butters. On the downside, earnings for energy companies in the S&amp;P 500 should climb only 1.1% in 2012 based on analysts' estimates.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">El Paso</emphasis>found many buyers after it was announced that<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kinder Morgan</emphasis>would buy the company for $21 billion., Carl Icahn's Icahn Associates, Louis Bacon's Moore Capital, and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors all initiated stakes or increased existing positions in El Paso during the quarter. Meanwhile,sold 12 million shares of El Paso but bought up stock in other energy names like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marathon Petroleum</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anadarko</emphasis>. Elsewhere, Centaurus Capital made a $30 million bet on<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Complete Production Solutions</emphasis>.Among other favored picks, U.K. hedge fund Brevan Howard initiated new stakes in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Valero</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Petrobras</emphasis>. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates opened positions in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peabody Energy</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Imperial Oil</emphasis>, among several others, while increasing stakes in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tesoro</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HollyFrontier</emphasis>., which takes a value approach to investing, trimmed its stake in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BP</emphasis>and completely sold out of a position in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BreitBurn Energy</emphasis>during the fourth quarter., while a buyer of El Paso, sold shares of Anadarko,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transocean</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Talisman Energy</emphasis>. Steven Cohen was another seller of energy names, dumping more than a million shares each of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Baker Hughes</emphasis>, Marathon Petroleum, HollyFrontier,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hess</emphasis>and others.&gt;&gt;To see these energy stocks in action, visit theportfolio on Stockpickr.</p><h>Materials</h><p>Some of the biggest hedge fund managers were down on the materials sector during the fourth quarter, although one specific stock in the sector was a buy for a few fund managers, which increased their exposure to the group.The materials sector was the second worst of all S&amp;P 500 sectors last year, falling 11.6%, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ. Only financials performed worse as a group in 2011. That move lower came as the materials group saw the second largest decrease in earnings growth during the fourth quarter out of all sectors, with profits down 13.8% from the prior year. Looking ahead, though, earnings are expected to grow 4.8% in 2012, down from 29.6% earnings growth in 2011, according to FactSet Research.With slowing growth on the horizon, hedge funds were jumping out of some positions in materials stock, reducing their reported portfolio's overall exposure to the sector.was one such firm, dumping shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">International Paper</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CF Industries</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mosaic</emphasis>. John Thaler's JAT Capital liquidated its 5-million-share stake in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Molycorp</emphasis>and took new positions in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Owens-Illinois</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cemex</emphasis>.On the other hand, hedge funds like Brevan Howard and Highbridge Capital saw their portfolios increase their stakes in the materials sector. Jana Partners bought shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cytec Industries</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rock-Tenn</emphasis>. Highbridge picked up stocks like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LyondellBasell</emphasis>, CF Industries,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sealed Air</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Huntsman</emphasis>, among others.John Paulson, who presided over an epic collapse in his fund last year, bought other materials companies as he increased his positions in gold-related companies like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barrick Gold</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iamgold</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rangold Resources</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Agnico-Eagle Mines</emphasis>.&gt;&gt;To see these stocks in action, visit theportfolio on Stockpickr.</p><h>Industrials</h><p>Like the materials sector, industrials have been a dog for investors this year. Industrial companies in the S&amp;P 500 were down 2.9% in 2011, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ, the third worst sector performer of the year. However, since the end of the third quarter, industrial stocks have been roaring back. In the final quarter of 2011, the sector was up 15.7%, second only to the 17.6% gain in energy. That momentum has carried into 2012, with the sector up 8.4% through Feb. 15.It remains to be seen whether those industrial bets pay off, but for now analysts are looking positively on the sector. According to FactSet Research, industrial companies in the S&amp;P 500 should see earnings grow 10% this year, the fourth highest growth rate for any sector. One reason that many hedge funds saw increases in exposure to industrials was because of purchases of M&amp;A target<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goodrich</emphasis>. The company, which will be acquired by<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">United Technologies</emphasis>, found buyers in Eton Park Capital, and Farallon Capital. Lone Pine Capital, meanwhile, dumped its entire stake in Goodrich and United Tech.Among other notable buys, Carl Icahn picked up a few industrial stocks, buying shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">American Railcar</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Navistar</emphasis>. John Thaler's JAT Capital took new positions in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Union Pacific</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GrafTech</emphasis>.bought up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tyco</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Avery Dennison</emphasis>.Elsewhere, Bruce Kovner's Caxton Associates was a big buyer of industrial stocks, picking up merger mates<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">United Rentals</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RSC Holdings</emphasis>along with shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Illinois Tool Works</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cummins</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CSX</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deere</emphasis>, among others.also increased its exposure to industrials, but that's after Ackman built up a massive position in railway<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Canadian Pacific</emphasis>. Ackman now owns 14.2% of shares outstanding as he has gone activist on Canadian Pacific's management team.On the other hand, David Tepper took an axe to Appaloosa's airline holdings, reducing positions in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">United Continental</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">U.S. Airways</emphasis>while completely liquidating his stake in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delta Air Lines</emphasis>.&gt;&gt;To see these stocks in action, visit theportfolio on Stockpickr.</p><h>Consumer Discretionary</h><p>Consumer discretionary as a whole didn't do too much last year, although the 4.4% rise beat the broader market. With global recession fears easing and the European Central Bank making free cash available to banks to buy sovereign debt, investors have been willing to take on more risk. That explains why discretionary names surged 12% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and are up another 8.6% in 2012 through Feb. 15, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ.The outlook for consumer discretionary stocks seems to be bright. After earnings grew a 3.5% during the fourth quarter from a year ago, the sector is second overall with an expected earnings growth rate of 12.7% in 2012. For the most part, hedge fund managers are placing bigger bets in the sector, with some of the largest funds boosting exposure to discretionary names.was one buyer of discretionary stocks during the fourth quarter, picking up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Priceline.com</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lowe's</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sirius XM</emphasis>, among others. Bill Ackman, on the other hand, dumped more than 21 million shares of Lowe's during the quarter, while Paul Tudor Jones was also a buyer of Sirius XM.John Paulson also made several best on discretionary names during the quarter, most notably taking a 15% stake in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delphi Automotive</emphasis>after the company's IPO in November. Paulson also bought shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AMC Networks</emphasis>, the cable network channel that produces hit shows like Mad Men and The Walking Dead.Meanwhile, Eton Park was one fund that cut its exposure to consumer discretionary in the fourth quarter. The fund trimmed its stake in stocks like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Viacom</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comcast</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dollar Tree</emphasis>.Tom Steyer's Farallon Capital was also a seller of Viacom shares. His fund also completely sold out of stakes in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Home Depot</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Expedia</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CarMax</emphasis>.Similarly, Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital took a hatchet to its discretionary holdings, selling completely out of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Time Warner Cable</emphasis>, Viacom,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Macy's</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kohl's</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DirecTV</emphasis>, among others. Eddie Lampert's RBS Partners cut stakes in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AutoNation</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AutoZone</emphasis>and even<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sears Holdings</emphasis>.was another big seller of discretionary stocks, slashing entire stakes in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon.com</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ralph Lauren</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comcast</emphasis>and Priceline.com, among many others.was also a seller of Amazon.com and Ralph Lauren. &gt;&gt;To see these stocks in action, visit theportfolio on Stockpickr.</p><h>Consumer Staples</h><p>With the global economy at risk due to the European crisis and market volatility scaring investors, it's natural to believe the right place to be invested would be consumer staples. These are companies that are defensive, cyclical names which can help protect against downside risk. Unfortunately, there hasn't been a whole lot of growth opportunity in consumer staples stocks. The overall sector rose 10.5% in 2011 -- second best among all S&amp;P 500 sectors -- but worries over growth have abated and investors have sought out slightly riskier assets for a higher return. In the fourth quarter, earnings for the staples sector grew by only 2.3% from a year ago. Based on estimates, consumer staples will see earnings rise 7.9% in 2012, according to FactSet Research, below the growth rates of industrials, technology and even consumer discretionary names. That may explain why staples are up only 0.4% in 2012, the third worst performing sector. Few hedge funds made big alterations to their holdings of consumer staples stocks.made only one change to its consumer staples holdings, cutting its stake in controversial company<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Green Mountain Coffee Roasters</emphasis>in half. JAT Capital sold completely out of its stake in Green Mountain during the quarter, along with<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Smithfield Foods</emphasis>.shuffled up its discretionary holdings, dropping its stake in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CVS Caremark</emphasis>while picking up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">General Motors</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Best Buy</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CBS</emphasis>, among others.While Maverick Capital made big cuts to discretionary names, the fund picked up shares of several staples companies, including<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sara Lee</emphasis>and CVS. Bill Ackman, meanwhile, trimmed his big position in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kraft Foods</emphasis>.Moore Capital was more active in the staples space, dumping shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Altria</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Procter &amp; Gamble</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PepsiCo</emphasis>. Carl Icahn was also a seller of consumer staples, unloading a massive stake in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Clorox</emphasis>after losing a battle to buy the company. Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management, meanwhile, sold more than 2.3 million shares of Pepsi.&gt;&gt;To see these stocks in action, visit theportfolio on Stockpickr.</p><h>Health Care</h><p>The health care sector was a popular one in the fourth quarter for hedge fund managers looking for merger-arbitrage opportunities. Takeover targets like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kinetic Concepts</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adolor</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pharmasset</emphasis>were snatched up during the quarter, increasing health care weightings for several hedge fund managers. The merger activity is one way to explain the strong performance of the health care sector this year. Health care names in the S&amp;P 500 rose 10.2% overall last year, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ, the third best sector performance this year. The outlook for health care stocks, though, leaves plenty to be desired. After notching only 4.6% earnings growth in the fourth quarter, analysts are calling for 2.4% earnings growth for the sector in all of 2012. Health care stocks are trailing the broader indices this year, climbing only 3.8% in 2012 through Feb. 15. David Tepper of Appaloosa Management was a buyer of health care stocks, picking up nearly 8 million shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boston Scientific</emphasis>. Ray Dalio was another buyer, with his Bridgewater Associates hedge fund buying shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Watson Pharmaceuticals</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">St. Jude Medical</emphasis>, among others.Louis Bacon of Moore Capital was also a big health care buyer, picking up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gilead Sciences</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Express Script</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cigna</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WellPoint</emphasis>, among several others., the world's largest quant fund, also upped its exposure to health care, adding to stakes in Gilead,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thermo Fisher</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Humana</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Intuitive Surgical</emphasis>and Cigna, among others.Not all were buyers, however. Barry Rosenstein's Jana Partners liquidated a position in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Covidien</emphasis>and nearly dumped its entire stake in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HCA Holdings</emphasis>.&gt;&gt;To see these stocks in action, visit theportfolio on Stockpickr.</p><h>Financials</h><p>Given the sharp drop in financial stocks last year, it should come as no surprise that hedge fund managers continued to dump bank shares during the fourth quarter. There was nearly uniform disgust with U.S. bank stocks like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bank of America</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Citigroup</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan Chase</emphasis>, which had all been big winners for hedge fund managers who bet on their recovery after the financial collapse in late 2008.Financials as a group were the worst performing sector on the S&amp;P 500 last year, down 18.4%, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ. That performance may have been too much for the likes of John Paulson. His hedge fund finally gave up on several financial holdings, selling completely out of positions in Citigroup, Bank of America,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BlackRock</emphasis>and others.Others followed in Paulson's footsteps. Among other interesting sales, Bruce Kovner's Caxton Associates, which owned shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MF Global</emphasis>prior to the collapse, sold completely out of positions in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wells Fargo</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Morgan Stanley</emphasis>. Vinik Asset Management cleared its stake of JPMorgan and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">American Express</emphasis>.In crisis there lies opportunity. Many of those funds that sold bank stocks may have missed out on the 10.2% rally in the fourth quarter and the 11.1% rally in the sector this year. Some smart hedge fund managers were buyers of financial stocks last quarter during the carnage, which increased their reported portfolio's sector weighting. Most notably,made new buys of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goldman Sachs</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Genworth Financial</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">E*Trade Financial</emphasis>. While Brevan Howard slashed its position in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Berkshire Hathaway</emphasis>, the hedge fund initiated a stake in Bank of America. Kyle Bass bought up 10 million shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MGIC Investment</emphasis>during the quarters.These financial buyers may not be completely crazy. If there's one reason for optimism, next year's earnings growth may be it. According to FactSet Research, financials should see earnings growth of 22.3% in 2012, the highest based on analysts' estimates of all sectors. It remains to be seen if the European debt crisis and the exposure to those troubled countries derails those rosy forecasts.&gt;&gt;To see these stocks in action, visit theportfolio on Stockpickr.</p><h>Information Technology</h><p>The technology sector gets a lot of attention from hedge funds, mostly because it seems like everyone wants to own shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>. The truth, though, is that the sector has performed admirably this year and should do well into 2012 based on analysts' estimates.The tech area of the S&amp;P 500 climbed only 1.3% last year, falling in the middle of the pack of the 10 sectors of the broad market index. Looking ahead to 2012, analysts expect earnings for the sector to grow 11.5%, which would be the third-best earnings growth rate of all S&amp;P 500 sectors. Thanks to Apple's contribution, the tech sector is the best performing space in 2012, up 12% through Feb. 15.The 13-F reporting system isn't perfect, as investors can't tell whether ownership of a stock means the hedge fund manager loves the company or is simply hedging a bigger short position. That said, it's interesting to look at opposing views based on these filings. Based on buying and selling, tech stocks -- and Apple in particular -- are the perfect example of this push and pull.Apple was among the most held of any stock by hedge funds, as it has been for several quarters now., DE Shaw, Lone Pine Capital, Moore Capital and Maverick Capital all bought shares of the gadget maker during the fourth quarter. However, hedge funds like Blue Ridge and Coatue Management dumped Apple shares during the quarter.The same battleground story holds true among the other big tech stocks. Soros, Blue Ridge,, Lone Pine, DE Shaw, Moore Capital and Coatue bought up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>while Jana Partners dumped shares. Coatue and Viking Global bought<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qualcomm</emphasis>while JAT Capital dumped its entire position in the chipmaker and Maverick sold shares.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Research In Motion</emphasis>was another battleground name, with David Einhorn and Steven Cohen buying the stock as Phil Falcone's Harbinger Capital and JAT Capital sold out of stakes in the BlackBerry maker. DE Shaw sold<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis>shares as SAC Capital bought nearly a million.One tech name that found lots of support was<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yahoo!</emphasis>after Third Point's Daniel Loeb amassed a large stake in the Internet company and has pushed for major changes. Loeb added 8 million shares to bring his stake to 271 million shares, with George Soros, Louis Bacon, and David Einhorn also buying up Yahoo! shares during the quarter.&gt;&gt;To see these stocks in action, visit theportfolio on Stockpickr.</p><h>Telecom</h><p>The telecom sector evokes yawns from the casual investor. Hedge fund managers, too, find little to be excited about in the sector. With telecom shares essentially flat in 2011 and down 2.5% this year through Feb. 15, investors bored with wireless companies look smart to have skipped over the sector.The reasons for the aversion are simply because there's little growth to be had. FactSet Research has the telecom sector growing earnings by only 3% next year based on analysts' estimates, a far cry from the 22.3% expected earnings growth in financials or even 7.9% expected growth in consumer staples. Still, that's better than how telecom companies fared in the fourth quarter, when earnings dropped 23.7%, the lowest growth rate of all 10 sectors of the S&amp;P 500.Though certainly not the sexiest sector, some hedge fund managers increased their reported holdings during the fourth quarter. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates initiated stakes in companies like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BCE</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SBA Communications</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NII Holding</emphasis>. Glenview Capital picked up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Crown Castle</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sprint Nextel</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Clearwire</emphasis>.Among other buyers, Paul Tudor Jones added to stakes in NII Holding, Clearwire,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vodafone</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MetroPCS</emphasis>.On the other hand, Centaurus Capital dumped its stake in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Level 3 Communications</emphasis>while Lone Pine Capital liquidated its position in NII Holding. Louis Bacon's Moore Capital sold its stakes in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Verizon</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BCE</emphasis>.&gt;&gt;To see these stocks in action, visit theportfolio on Stockpickr.</p><h>Utilities</h><p>If there is one sector more boring that telecom, it's utilities. Though many are big dividend payers, there's little excitement in owning an electricity company. Making matters worse, the utility sector saw earnings dip 0.4% in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet Research. Looking ahead, utilities are the only sector expected to see earnings shrink in 2012, with analysts' estimates calling for a 3.2% slide.Despite those negatives, utility stocks have been the best performers this year on the S&amp;P 500, climbing 14.8% in 2011. Boring and unsexy is much more palatable if it means getting a big return. However, that success hasn't carried over into 2012, with the utilities sector down 4.2% through Feb. 15. David Shaw's hedge fund was one buyer of utilities during the quarter. DE Shaw upped its stake in companies like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Northeast Utilities</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Constellation Energy</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FirstEnergy</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CenterPoint Energy</emphasis>, among several others. Leon Cooperman made a bet on<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NRG Energy</emphasis>during the quarter.Meanwhile, Moore Capital was a seller of utility stocks such as<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PPL Corp.</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Westar Energy</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Consolidated Edison</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pinnacle West</emphasis>. Paulson &amp; Co. made a big sale of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Genon Energy</emphasis>during the quarter. York Capital Management dumped a large stake in CenterPoint during the quarter.Quant fund Renaissance Technologies liquidated 21 positions in utilities stocks during the quarter, selling shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Southern Company</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PG&amp;E</emphasis>, Pinnacle West, and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duke Energy</emphasis>, among others.&gt;&gt;To see these stocks in action, visit theportfolio on Stockpickr.-- Written by Robert Holmes in Boston.&gt;To contact the writer of this article, click here:.&gt;To follow Robert Holmes on Twitter, go to.&gt;To submit a news tip, send an email to:.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-11421902</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5505-P8H1-F03D-64S2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3805\"/><timeReceived>15:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 TheStreet.com, Inc.

Rising public support for regulation could move policymakers from talk to action.Details: Edelman's 2020 Trust Barometer found that while tech still enjoys high levels of trust globally, its approval rating fell four points between 2019 and 2020. Trust in tech declined in 19 of 26 markets including the U.S., U.K., Germany and France. It rose five points in South Korea and saw more modest gains in Japan, Spain, Malaysia and India, while holding steady in Kenya and Thailand. </p><p>In 2012, the tech sector was rated trustworthy by 77% of respondents, compared to 47% for business in general, a 30-point gap. This year, that gap is just 18 percentage points, as trust in overall business has risen and that in the tech industry has fallen.40% of respondents in the U.S. and 44% globally believe AI needs more regulation. What they're saying: \"The trend of eroding trust in the technology sector continues,\" said Sanjay Nair, global technology chair of Edelman. \"The trust decline may be small, but it is reflective of consistent concerns that technology companies are not adequately preparing society for the impact of their products.\" Between the lines: Trust is higher for many sectors broadly than it is for the leading-edge technology within a field. Far more people trust the tech industry broadly than AI specifically. Similarly, more trust the food and beverage industry overall than cell-cultured meats and gene editing. The big picture: Two studies from Pew Research also show the impact of declining trust. According to one released on Monday, relatively few Americans trust big tech companies to keep elections safe[1]. Nearly three quarters of those surveyed by Pew in January said they had little or no confidence in technology companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google to prevent their platforms from being misused in this year's U.S. presidential election.Pew also found that a plurality of tech experts believe advances in technology over the next decadewill erode trust and harm democracy[2], comparedto those who believe advances will have a neutral or positive effect on democracy. Yes, but: Technology is still one of the most trusted sectors, despite recent erosion. Such was the case overall for the Edelman study, although a record 13 markets had higher trust in a sector other than technology.Go deeper: The \"ominous\" decline of democracy around the world[3] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/24/few-americans-are-confident-in-tech-companies-to-prevent-misuse-of-their-platforms-in-the-2020-election/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer..._medium=email..._campaign=20-02-24+Tech%2FElection+FT+Heads-up...=982...=100...=5551...=1246759...=0...=1..._source=AdaptiveMailer..._medium=email..._campaign=20-02-24+Tech%2FElection+FT+Heads-up...=982...=100...=5551...=1246759...=0...=1\">https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/24/few-americans-are-confident-in-tech-companies-to-prevent-misuse-of-their-platforms-in-the-2020-election/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer..._medium=email..._campaign=20-02-24+Tech%2FElection+FT+Heads-up...=982...=100...=5551...=1246759...=0...=1..._source=AdaptiveMailer..._medium=email..._campaign=20-02-24+Tech%2FElection+FT+Heads-up...=982...=100...=5551...=1246759...=0...=1</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/digital-technology-threatening-democracy-941b067f-585d-4435-8a43-9934022b9c6e.html\">https://www.axios.com/digital-technology-threatening-democracy-941b067f-585d-4435-8a43-9934022b9c6e.html</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/decline-of-democracy-around-the-world-8e71b769-4beb-4ff5-be17-008d38bf696c.html\">https://www.axios.com/decline-of-democracy-around-the-world-8e71b769-4beb-4ff5-be17-008d38bf696c.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544158265214104625876500126</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y93-15R1-JCMN-Y1CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"606\"/><timeReceived>5:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Around 17% said they strongly supported antitrust action, and another 12% and 11% supported or somewhat supported it respectively.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, 28% of respondents neither supported nor opposed antitrust action, 5% somewhat opposed, 4% opposed, and 5% strongly opposed. 17% of respondents didn't know.

Do you oppose or support anti-trust action against Facebook?\"</p><p>The answers were broadly similar regardless of demographic: Men were somewhat more likely to support antitrust action (23% strongly supported, versus 11% for women), while women were more likely to say they didn't know (25% versus 8% for male respondents); and older respondents were more strongly supportive of antitrust action and less likely to say they didn't know.</p><p>The results also show there is bipartisan support for antitrust action, with both Republican and Democrat-affiliated respondents giving largely similar responses (Democrats were a little more supportive).</p><p>Facebook spokesperson Monique Hall declined to comment on the data, but pointed Business Insider towards previous polls of Americans on the subject, both of which predated the publication of Hughes' op-ed and the subsequent public debate on the possibility of antitrust action.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/19093NBCWSJMarch2019Poll-final.pdf?mod=article_inline\">In one Wall Street Journal/NBC poll from March 2019</url>, attitudes towards breaking up tech companies depended on the framing of leading statements about breaking up big tech firms.

That's according to a new Business Insider/INSIDER poll of US adults conducted by SurveyMonkey. Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes recently called for the Silicon Valley tech giant to be broken up, and the results may bolster these arguments. Facebook has pushed back against demands for anti-monopoly argument, calling for different regulation instead. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes wants to see the tech giant broken up. </p><p>A large segment Americans do too. In a recent SurveyMonkey survey of US adults conducted on behalf of Business Insider and INSIDER, 40% of respondents said they supported antitrust action against Facebook \u2014 and just 15% oppose it. There have been mounting calls for the Silicon Valley social networking firm to face regulatory scrutiny in recent months, and last week Hughes inflamed those calls by writing a 6,000-word op-ed for The New York Times[3] that argued the company he helped build has grown too large and powerful. Facebook has strongly argued against antitrust action \u2014 but Business Insider's data indicates that large swathes of Americans already support the idea, and may bolster the arguments of leftwing politicians like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have championed the push for anti-monopoly action against Facebook and the other tech giants. Following the publication of Hughes' essay, INSIDER surveyed 1,072 people's attitudes towards antitrust action against Facebook through SurveyMonkey Audience. Around 17% said they strongly supported antitrust action, and another 12% and 11% supported or somewhat supported it respectively. Meanwhile, 28% of respondents neither supported nor opposed antitrust action, 5% somewhat opposed, 4% opposed, and 5% strongly opposed. 17% of respondents didn't know. The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 3.12 percentage points. (Download the full data here[4].)Support for clamping down on Facebook extends across party linesRespondents in Business Insider's poll were asked: \"Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has called on the federal government to start anti-trust action against the company and to break it up, such as requiring it to spin off WhatsApp and Instagram as separate companies. Do you oppose or support anti-trust action against Facebook?\" The answers were broadly similar regardless of demographic: Men were somewhat more likely to support antitrust action (23% strongly supported, versus 11% for women), while women were more likely to say they didn't know (25% versus 8% for male respondents); and older respondents were more strongly supportive of antitrust action and less likely to say they didn't know. The results also show there is bipartisan support for antitrust action, with both Republican and Democrat-affiliated respondents giving largely similar responses (Democrats were a little more supportive). Facebook spokesperson Monique Hall declined to comment on the data, but pointed Business Insider towards previous polls of Americans on the subject, both of which predated the publication of Hughes' op-ed and the subsequent public debate on the possibility of antitrust action. In one Wall Street Journal/NBC poll from March 2019[5], attitudes towards breaking up tech companies depended on the framing of leading statements about breaking up big tech firms. In one, 47% supported break-ups and 50% opposed it; in another, 68% said there shouldn't be action, and 28% said there should. These questions grouped together multiple large tech companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 rather than addressing Facebook specifically, as Business Insider's poll did. A CNN poll that Hall highlighted, also conducted in March[6], found that 42% of respondents supported greater government regulation of tech companies \u2014 but within that 42% group, 64% said that \"those companies should not be forced to sell off any parts of their businesses.\" That survey also didn't specify Facebook in its questioning, referring only to \"big technology companies\" broadly, without giving names. After Hughes' op-ed was published last week, Facebook's global head of comms Nick Clegg said in a statement: \"Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company. Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for.\" The $518 billion company is currently also proactively building out its team of antitrust experts, hiring new lawyers and policy gurus with expertise in competition affairs as it tries to improve its lobbying efforts and bolster its legal apparatus against the potential threat, as Business Insider previously reported[7]. SurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender. Respondents are incentivized to complete surveys through charitable contributions. Generally speaking, digital polling tends to skew toward people with access to the internet. SurveyMonkey Audience doesn't try to weight its sample based on race or income. Total 1,127 respondents collected May 10-12, 2019, a margin of error plus or minus 3.12 percentage points with a 95% confidence level.

It focuses on whether Facebook's dominance is stifling competition, limiting choice for consumers and costing advertisers more money.</p><p>Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt announced in a news release Tuesday that his office is taking part in the investigation.</p><p> In an interview, Schmitt said the focus is on how Facebook is using the massive amounts of information it gathers on users of its original social media product, as well as other popular platforms it owns such as WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p> \"It is a very bipartisan coalition to sort of make sure that people's privacy is being protected and that Facebook is honoring the commitment they have made to protect people's privacy,\" Schmitt said. \"It is too early to tell what the ultimate remedy will be, but there's no question these big tech companies control a lot of information. We want to understand better what that is, how they are utilizing it, how vulnerable that data is.\"</p><p> The vast amount of information that will need to be examined makes it hard to estimate how long the investigation will take, Schmitt said.</p><p> The practices allowed by Facebook that have provided the user data on millions of people to be collected through seemingly innocent games and surveys worry many people.</p><p> \"I can tell you as I get around Missouri that is an ongoing concern that people have, just the amount of information companies like Google and Facebook, the big companies have and what they are doing with the information,\" Schmitt said.</p><p> \"Even the biggest of the big tech companies should be held accountable, and that's what we're seeking to do with this investigation,\" Schmitt said in the release. \"This coalition of attorneys general will investigate Facebook's business practices to determine whether they engaged in anticompetitive behavior, put user data at risk, reduced consumer choice, and more.\"</p><p> \"Big Tech must account for its actions,\" Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican, said in a statement.</p><p> The group of attorneys general also worries about Facebook's handling of customer data, James said. That drew scrutiny after firms were able to harvest information in attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Facebook didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.</p><p> The group backing the state-level probe by the seven states and Washington now includes 21 Democratic attorneys general, 18 Republicans and an independent from 39 states and Guam. The list also includes several states that cannot confirm their participation in pending investigations, James said.</p><p>Facebook and other tech giants have also been feeling the heat from federal regulators. The Federal Trade Commission recently fined Facebook $5 billion for privacy violations, but consumer advocates and some public officials criticized that as too lenient.</p><p> A separate investigation, led by Texas and supported by attorneys general from 48 states, including Missouri, as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia is looking at whether Google is engaging in monopolistic behavior with its dominant online search and advertising business.</p><p> \"Google is a major player in almost every phase of a transaction,\" Schmitt said.</p><p>District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine, a Democrat involved in both investigations, said in a statement that he wants to ensure Facebook is \"giving a fair shake\" to the American people.</p><p> \"No company gets a pass if it throttles competitors and exploits consumers,\" Racine said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMO-43cca6593614f45dd465f4582fbd664a99d367e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A1F213F7E09 NWBKMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBR-DPC1-JBCN-43N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401953</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Moberly Monitor-Index and Democrat<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Fifty attorneys general are teaming up to investigate the tech giant for anti-competitive practices and harm to consumers. State Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas launched the investigation from the steps of the Supreme Court this afternoon.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>KEN PAXTON:                 What we've all learned is that while many consumers believe that the Internet is free, certainly, we know from Google's profits that the Internet is not free.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 A closer look on today's All Tech Considered.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ULRICH SCHNAUSS' \"NOTHING HAPPENS IN JUNE\")                </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 All right, here to debrief with us is NPR's Aarti Shahani. Hey, Aarti.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Hi.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 So it seems like every week now the government is opening some new investigation into big tech. It's really been a steady drumbeat. Can you just tell us how this investigation feels different to you?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Yeah, no, it was definitely a show of force. And as you said, 50 attorneys general are launching an investigation. That's 48 states, Ailsa, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The two states sitting it out for now are California and Alabama, and they could still join in, OK?             </p><p>                The group has already subpoenaed Google, though to be clear, this is not a top-to-bottom probe of everything that Google or its parent company, Alphabet, does. It's a look at Google's search and advertising and how those two services may be intertwined in ways that are overall harmful to consumers. To explain what that means, have a listen to one of the AGs who spoke this afternoon, Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>LESLIE RUTLEDGE:                 As a new mom, when my daughter is sick and I search online for advice or doctors, I want the best advice from the best doctors, not the doctor and not the clinic who can spend the most on advertising.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 So she and other AGs are worried that Google's so-called free service comes at a cost to consumers, as well as to companies who fear they're frozen out of business unless they pay Google. The European Union has made this point, too, and move to fine Google billions of dollars. The AGs referred to Europe repeatedly today.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 OK, and we should note that Google is an NPR sponsor. So what has Google been saying in response to this new investigation?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Yeah, so Google declined to comment on the latest announcement. But on Friday, a top Googler on public policy, Kent Walker, put out a blog saying things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone, meaning Google's making your life better, helping you answer any question you have, putting out an incredibly powerful tool to translate just about any language you can think of.             </p><p>                So I would point out that this investigation, and also the one into Facebook that nine AGs announced last week - they're looking at the same issue. It's digital advertising and the decisions people make based on what they're seeing on the Internet. Digital ads are Google and Facebook's cash cow. Those two companies together control nearly 60% of digital ad sales. And according to eMarketer, their control this year is actually dipping a bit because of Amazon's rise. But still, it's a lot of control.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 All right, so as this investigation unfolds, what are you going to be looking for?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Whether it expands to questions, for example, on consumer data and privacy. You know, I would also point out there's a change in the mindset right now. The Texas attorney general's office in 2011 investigated Google for its search engine and decided not to pursue a case. But now, people understand the Internet is where commerce happens. They are the new railroads, and railroads didn't regulate themselves.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 That's NPR's Aarti Shahani. Thanks, Aarti.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Thank you.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-2019090904</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X16-0GD1-JBKP-Y468-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"751\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is an investigation to determine the facts,\" Paxton told reporters Monday. \"Right now we're looking at advertising. But the facts will lead where the facts will lead.\"</p><p>A news release from Paxton's office had described the probe as a \"multistate investigation into whether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access, and harmed consumers.\"</p><p>But Google was the only company singled out Monday.</p><p>\"This is a company that dominates all aspects of advertising on the Internet and searching on the Internet, as they dominate the buyer side, the seller side, the auction side and even the video side with YouTube,\" Paxton said.</p><p>Google has its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Its parent company, Alphabet, reported revenue of $136.8 billion and profits of $30.7 billion in 2018.</p><p>Last year, Alphabet's ad revenue surpassed $116 billion.</p><p>Newspaper advertising revenue, which has plummeted over the past decade, peaked at $49.3 billion in 2006, according to the News Media Alliance, an industry trade organization formerly known as the Newspaper Association of America.</p><p>As it prepares for the state investigation, Google is also dealing with a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.</p><p>A Securities and Exchange Commission report, filed on Friday by Alphabet, said the company had \"received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations in the United States and elsewhere.\"</p><p>Potential investors were given notice that the company \"expect[ed] to receive in the future similar investigative demands from state attorneys general.\"</p><p>In a written statement, also posted Friday, Google promised to cooperate with state and federal officials, saying \"governments should have oversight to ensure that all successful companies, including ours, are complying with the law.</p><p>\"We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so,\" the company said. \"We look forward to showing how we are investing in innovation, providing services that people want, and engaging in robust and fair competition.\"</p><p>At Monday's news conference, officials stressed the bipartisan nature of the undertaking.</p><p>\"We're Republican, Democrat, men, women, black, white and Hispanic, all standing together to protect the free market, to protect competition, but most importantly, to protect the American consumer from this online search engine juggernaut,\" said Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge.</p><p>Support for the investigation crosses the ideological spectrum, supporters said.</p><p>\"I'm next to friends of mine who I vehemently disagree with on issues like immigration, reproductive rights, gun rights and other issues. Certainly health care. But we are acting as one today,\" said District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine.</p><p>He promised \"a fair and full investigation that will follow ... the facts.\"</p><p>In March, Google was fined 1.5 billion euros (about $1.7 billion) after the European Union faulted its business practices. The EU handed Google an even larger fine - 4.34 billion euros (roughly $5 billion) - last year.</p><p>Google isn't the only Internet company facing governmental scrutiny.</p><p>On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced that eight state attorneys general would be examining the business practices of Facebook to see whether the company \"has stifled competition and put users at risk. We will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook's actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices, or increased the price of advertising.\"</p><p>In an interview afterward, Rutledge said she hasn't decided whether to join the Face-book investigation.</p><p>\"Today, we want to focus on Google and [the] big tech company of Google,\" she said.</p><p>Asked why Arkansas would join the Google investigation but not the Facebook investigation, Rutledge said, \"That is something that we're looking into at the attorney general's office in Arkansas and we [will] determine, again, whether or not it violates antitrust laws as well as [the] Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\"</p><p>The newly launched Google probe was welcomed Monday by the Open Markets Institute, a left-leaning think tank that opposes monopolies.</p><p>\"We applaud the ... state attorneys general for taking this unprecedented stand against Big Tech by uniting to investigate Google's destruction of competition in search and advertising,\" said Sally Hubbard, the institute's director of enforcement strategy, in a written statement. \"We haven't seen a major monopolization case against a tech giant since Microsoft was sued in 1998. Today's announcement marks the start of a new era.\"</p><p>But Kent Lassman, president of the right-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute, said the scrutiny is unwarranted.</p><p>\"Both Facebook and Google have delivered value for consumers the world over, offer their respective primary services for free, and compete in a multichannel, highly competitive advertising market,\" he said in a written statement.</p><p>The investigations amount to political grandstanding, he maintained.</p><p>\"Abusive antitrust regulation often appears to be a winner for ambitious politicians. Everyone else - including new market entrants and small players who get overlooked amid all the shouting - loses,\" he said.</p><p>This article was published 09/10/2019</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARKDEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARKDEM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X16-PG51-DY70-02D0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">149305</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"979\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Little Rock Newspapers, Inc.
